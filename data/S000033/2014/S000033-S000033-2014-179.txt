 President, I ask to have printed in the Record winning essays written by Vermont High School students as part of the Fourth Annual State of the Union Essay contest conducted by my office.  The essays follow:       Alexina Federhen, Mount Anthony Union High School, Grade 11      (Winner)                            A House Divided       2013 was a difficult year for America. Nature brought death      and disaster by fire, wind, and water; four prominent banks      used unethical methods to deprive Americans of their homes;      numerous individuals, businesses, and the city of Detroit hit      financial rock bottom; and shootings in our schools     every other week killed 19 and wounded 24 students and staff.      A spy revealed that our government is spying on our private      conversations; universal healthcare became a universal      headache when the application process required major surgery;      and an exciting finish exploded into terror at the Boston      Marathon. But Americans are resilient and resolute. Oklahoma      is rebuilding and Detroit is reorganizing. Many Americans      have healthcare for the first time and dozens of Boston's      runners finished their race in the Shires of Vermont      Marathon. Americans weathered the tragedies of 2013 with the      same determination, innovation, and cooperation that has      enabled us to overcome depressions, recessions, wars, and      disasters in the past; we pull up our boot straps, plant our      feet firmly in the direction of progress, and extend a      helping hand to those in need.       Tragically, there was one disaster that the American people      could not overcome in 2013--a Congress so dysfunctional that      it could not even manage to operate the government for the      entire year. And our expectations were not high to begin      with. A Gallup poll conducted in January 2013 found that      Americans rank Congress lower in popularity than root canals      and cockroaches and rate Congressmen lower in ethics and      honesty than used car salesmen. Instead of employing      collaboration and compromise, our leaders indulged in      backstabbing and finger pointing. Rather than seeking common      ground to find solutions to the problems facing our country,      our elected representatives nitpicked and cherry picked and      attacked each other's intentions and integrity to boost their      personal prospects for fundraising and reelection. The      spectacle of Tea Party Republicans posturing for the press      while the government crashed and burned lacked only a violin      accompaniment to rival Nero's folly.       The 113th Congress was the least productive legislature in      our history, passing only fifty-five bills into law. Public      approval of Congress sank from a ``high'' of 18% on January      1, 2013 to a current low of 8%. In fact, ``69% think no      matter how bad things are, Congress can always find a way to      make them worse.'' (Rasmussen Reports) We deserve better from      our political leaders. We need Congressmen and Senators who      will set aside personal gain and divisive ideology in order      to build compromise and find consensus on the issues that      challenge us: economic opportunity, income parity, gun      control, immigration, stagnant academic achievement, climate      change, and long-term deficit reduction.       Abraham Lincoln once observed that ``a house divided cannot      stand.'' Our House and Senate have splintered into partisan      factions of squabbling inactivity. Americans will continue to      soldier on, overcoming whatever obstacles impede our      advancement. We can only hope that our Congressional leaders      will acquire the maturity and wisdom to help rather than      hinder our progress. But for now, we are a union without      unity.                                  ____       Katharine Mayo, Twinfield Union School, Grade 11 (Second      Place)       In our changing world today we face many challenges, not      just in our country and individual regions, but throughout      the globe. One of the main problems that could alter our      world forever is climate change. Throughout the past century      we have spewed hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon      dioxide into the atmosphere, which top scientists now      unanimously agree is warming our world and causing extreme      weather to become frighteningly common. Our planet has warmed      1.4 deg. in the past one hundred years, and is projected to      keep warming if we do not act soon. This warming is causing      changing weather patterns that are drastically affecting our      world. Flooding, fires, and tornadoes throughout the country      and storms such as Tropical Storm Irene right here in Vermont      show how the effects of climate change are hurting people      everywhere. Even the small changes in my home town in Vermont      are starting to add up, we have less snow, more green      Christmases, and extreme summer storms. Floods are also      becoming increasingly common. However, neither Vermont nor      America are the only places that are being heavily affected      by climate change. It is a global problem, and we have to      think globally and work together in order to mend what we      have done to our planet. Our world is beautiful and fragile,      and we must put our energy to solving the problem of climate      change before it is too late.       America has always been known as a place where individuals      are both innovative and creative in order to solve problems.      I believe that we can each take steps as individuals and as a      country to reduce the carbon we released into the atmosphere.      These steps include driving less, and carpooling more,      replacing light bulbs for more energy efficient ones, being      more conscious of where our food comes from, and recycling      and composting as much as possible. We have seen over the      past one hundred years that each of us have the power with      our small, everyday choices do destroy earth's environment      and natural balance. I believe that if we have been able to      do that, then we each have the power with our small, everyday      choices to change the earth's environment for the better. We      must all make small changes in order to live a more      sustainable lifestyle and lead the world in the right      direction by being a country with a minimal carbon footprint.       We cannot put this issue off any longer. Now is the time to      act, now is the time to put our differences aside and work      together in the government and around the world to change the      world for the better and protect our world for future      generations. We must not be selfish about this problem by      brushing it under the rug because it is easier that way, or      in order to maintain our way of life. We must act now to make      changes in the way we live in order to preserve this      beautiful world for our future children and for generations      to come.                                  ____       Robert ``Will'' Aldrich, Mount Abraham Union Middle/High      School, Grade 9 (Third Place)       In the world there are many issues that we need to address.      There is poverty and debt, the circling case in which      innocent people can't feed themselves or their families      because they can't afford to, which in turn causes famine.      Another problem is pollution, which destroys our environment      by making it dirty and useless for future generations.      Another problem is communication, a thing that most countries      do not know how to do. All of these problems, every single      one, could be solved by promoting sustainable development.      Promoting sustainable development will help to make great      leaps forward in solving world issues.       One way that promoting sustainable development will help to      solve world problems is that it will help developing      countries. Aiding the developing countries will prove      extremely useful later on when we need help. This will give      us the image that we are helpful and are there when other      countries need us. Although this will cost a lot of money, it      will become a large help later on if and when we're in      trouble. Promoting sustainable development in developing      countries will also increase peace throughout the world. If      all the countries are helping each other out, meaning that we      are sharing our information and products, then there will be      little to no conflicts, and we can all be happy and get      along. Not to mention that helping out other countries will      heavily decrease poverty and famine, which will prevent the      need for future U.S. aid and thus save us money, since that      is what some people are more interested in. Clearly,      promoting sustainable development will help to increase peace      and equality and decrease poverty and famine.       Promoting sustainable development will definitely help to      improve our image as a country. We will be looked at as a      great role model and a powerful force with good intentions.      The U.S. could be viewed as a gentle giant of sorts. This      will improve our favor when it comes to disputes and it will      also increase our ally count. Although that should not      matter, we should be doing these things out of the goodness      of our hearts, not expecting reward. We should not need to      receive a reward for us to support the dying, the sick, and      the poor. In conclusion, promoting sustainable development      will improve our image so that we are looked at in a better      light.       Promoting sustainable development will greatly reduce      conflict over rare resources. One example of conflict over      scarce resources is the U.S. and Iran over oil. Another is      against the residents and loggers in South America over the      Amazon Rainforest. This could all be avoided if we all shared      our resources and promoted the use of sustainable      development. Sustainable development would mean that we do      not need to constantly deplete the Earth's resources.      Sustainable development would mean that we come up with ways      to fuel our economies with sources that will never run out!      If the countries do work together to achieve that goal, then      we will no longer have to fight over the sources that we need      because we'll never run out of them.       Promoting sustainable development will help the world make      great leaps forward in solving world issues. It will do this      by helping developing countries develop in economically and      environmentally sound ways, improving the image of the U.S.,      and reducing disputes and fighting over rare resources. The      solving of these problems will help bring about an era of      peace all over the world. Sustainable development will save      Mother Earth from mutilation and destruction. The world will      be a better place if everyone gets along and we all are      working toward the same thing: the protection of our planet.      Promoting sustainable development will make for a better      world for all the generations to come.                                  ____       Brian Townley, Woodstock Union High School, Grade 10 (Third      Place)       Dear Senator Sanders, The American Economy is currently in      recovery from the worst recession to hit this nation since      the great depression. This recession has left the American      economy in disarray, specifically the American middle class.      Stuck on median wages, the American middle class has been hit      the hardest by the collapse of the infrastructure of the      American economy.       In order to repair this monumental failure of our nation to      recognize the middle class as valuable, we must begin to      support Main Street America; local businesses. As a nation we      tend to ignore the services, and products of local businesses      in favor of the cheaper alternatives offered by billion      dollar conglomerates. If we, as a nation, can ever hope to      change, we must be willing to sacrifice. This phenomenon is      responsible for the gradual disappearance of Main Street      America, and the lack of attention given to the American      Middle Class.       With the ominous threats of climate change advancing, we      are offered a second chance to strengthen the middle class.      We     must create sustainable energy sources, to put an end to      global warming. To build our industrial foundation upon a new      type of energy will create a surplus of jobs. These jobs must      offer respectable wages, health care benefits, and      opportunities for growth. If this is done effectively, we may      be able to get the American middle class back on track, and      simultaneously end the impending threat of global warming.       In order to allow our economy to recover from the      recession, we must recognize the youth of America as our      future. In doing so, we must stress upon implementing a      better educational system to better engage the students,      create more affordable collegiate education for the middle      class. The middle class faces many challenges, yet are a      cornerstone of the American economy. However, when attempting      to send their children to college, the middle class faces yet      another challenge. The wealthy are able to pay the college      tuition, and the poor are given generous financial aid      grants. However, the middle class is expected to pay thirty      to fifty thousand dollars a year to send their kids to      college, money which they don't have. This is unacceptable,      and takes away a great deal of incentive for these kids to      even attend college. Those who do attend college leave with a      degree, but are then faced with enormous amounts of student      loans. Lastly, we must involve the youth in the workforce of      America. Not only will this strengthen our workforce, but it      will also provide the American youth with savings for      college, and teach them the value of work.       As I previously stated, in order to change, we must be      willing to sacrifice. We must be willing to sacrifice the      allure of bargain brands to support a local brand. We must      sacrifice our tendency towards gasoline to find more      sustainable sources of energy. If we are truly willing to      sacrifice, we will change.                          ____________________
