President, before my friend from Alabama leaves the floor--just to highlight where we are--I think he knows how strongly I feel about always trying to tackle these issues in a bipartisan fashion. I would just assure the Senator from Alabama, the reason we took as our underlying repeal-and-replace bill the good work that was done by Senator Hatch and Chairman Camp and Chairman Upton is I felt that extended the olive branch in trying to bring the parties together. I intend to do that consistently on the Finance Committee--pretty much justthe way I did when I supported George W. Bush on Part D of Medicare.
