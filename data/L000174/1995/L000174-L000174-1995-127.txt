President, I say to my friend from Alaska, I have always enjoyed, and I think enjoyed more, serving on appropriations than any other committee. One of the reasons for that is my relationship with the Senator from Alaska. I know of nobody who works harder. I have no higher respect for anybody than he. And he and I have served on several subcommittees together. I probably now ruined his electoral chances in Alaska by saying nice things about him here.  The fact of the matter is there was no Nicaragua Contra debate, there was no sequestration debate, there were none of these things that stopped us from getting the appropriations bills through, bills that begin in the other body, at the time we are required to, expected to and paid to. That is the end of September.  But when I hear the Speaker of the House tell about how they are able to do all the things they are supposed to do, and they are running things on time and all, the fact of the matter is these bills begin over there and have not gone through at the speed they should, and were all the appropriations bills done, we would not have a Government shutdown. In those areas where we have passed appropriations bills, there are no shutdowns.  All I am saying is let us stop worrying about who sat where on the way to a funeral or who got off which door. Let us get on with the business.  I think the Senator from Alaska may recall this. I started saying in August, in July, that Democrats and Republicans have got to sit down and start figuring out how to get these budgets through; that there will not be a Clinton budget exactly, there will not be a Gingrich budget exactly, there will not be a Stevens or a Leahy budget exactly. But all of us working together could get a budget that might make sense for the country.  I see my friend from New York is here, and he has been waiting at a time when others were waiting, such as my friend from Washington, so I yield the floor.  Mr. D'AMATO addressed the Chair.
