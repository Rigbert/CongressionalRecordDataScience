 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to a series of stacked votes in relation to the following amendments: Schumer amendment No. 42 and Rockefeller amendment No. 24; further, that no amendments be in order to the amendments prior to the votes; that the second vote be limited to 10 minutes in length; and that there be 1 minute on each side to explain these amendments prior to the vote.
