 President, tomorrow is an important day for all who honor the valor and sacrifice Americans made in World War II. Tomorrow, the history of America's war in the Pacific is brought full circle. The U.S.S. Missouri, the ship on which the United States formally accepted Japan's surrender, will be permanently berthed at Pearl Harbor, the site of America's entry into the war against Japan following a devastating surprise attack.  It is appropriate that in this same week I, along with my colleagues, Senators Roth, Thurmond, Inouye, Stevens, Hollings, Ford, Durbin, Specter, Helms, Cochran, and Faircloth, seek to close the circle for the two commanders at Pearl Harbor fifty-seven years ago, Admiral Husband Kimmel and General Walter Short. Today, we are introducing a resolution that seeks long overdue justice for these two fine officers.  Now some of you will ask ``why now?'' The answer is not just because we are honoring the service and sacrifice of Americans who served in the Pacific campaign by permanently berthing the Missouri at Pearl Harbor. It is more basic than that--there can be no statute of limitations for restoring honor and dignity to men who spent their lives devoted to America's service and yet were unfairly treated. When it comes to serving truth and justice, the time must always be ``now''.  I hope that most of you will read this resolution. The majority of the text details the historic case on behalf of Admiral Kimmel and General Short and expresses Congress's opinion that both officers performed their duty competently. Most importantly, it requests that the President submit the names of Kimmel and Short to the Senate for posthumous advancements on the retirement lists to their highest held wartime rank.  Mr. President, this action would not require any form of compensation. Instead, it would acknowledge, once and for all, that these two officers were not treated fairly by the U.S. government and it would uphold the military tradition that responsible officers take the blame for their failures.  I will address these points in more detail and will review some of the evidence regarding the soundness of Kimmel and Short's military decisions.  First, I want to discuss the treatment of Kimmel and Short and who bore responsibility. Like most Americans, Admiral Kimmel and General Short requested a fair and open hearing of their case, a court martial. They were denied their request. After lifetimes of honorable service to this nation and the defense of its values, they were denied the most basic form of justice--a hearing.  Let me review some of the facts. On December 18, 1941, a mere 11 days after Pearl Harbor, the Roberts Commission was formed to determine whether derelictions of duty or errors of judgment by Kimmel and Short contributed to the success of the Japanese attack. This Commission concluded that bothcommanders had been derelict in their duty and the President ordered the immediate public release of these findings.  Several facts about the Roberts Commission force us to question its conclusions. First, Kimmel and Short were denied the right to counsel and were not allowed to be present when witnesses were questioned. They were then explicitly told that the Commission was a fact-finding body and would not be passing judgment on their performance. When the findings accusing them of a serious offense were released, they immediately requested a court-martial. That request was refused. It is difficult to imagine a fair review of the evidence given the rules of procedure followed by the Commission.  I also think that it is important to note the timing here. It would be difficult to provide a fair hearing in the charged atmosphere immediately following America's entry into the war in the Pacific. In fact, Kimmel and Short were the objects of public vilification. The Commission was not immune to this pressure. One Commission member, for example, Admiral Standley, expressed strong reservations about the Commission's findings, later characterizing them as a ``travesty of justice''. He did sign the Report, however, because of concerns that doing otherwise might adversely affect the war effort. As you will see, the war effort played an important role in how Kimmel and Short were treated.  The Roberts Commission was the only investigative body that found these two officers derelict in their duty.  In 1944 an Army Board investigated General Short's actions at Pearl Harbor. The conclusions of that investigation placed blame on General Marshall, the Chief of Staff of the Army at the time of Pearl Harbor and in 1944. This report was sequestered and kept secret from the public on the grounds that it would be detrimental to the war effort.  That same year, a Naval Court of Inquiry investigated Admiral Kimmel's actions at Pearl Harbor. The Naval Court's conclusions were divided into two sections in order to protect information indicating that America had the ability to decode and intercept Japanese messages. The first and longer section, therefore, was classified ``top secret.'' The second section was written to be unclassified and completely exonerated Admiral Kimmel and recognized that Admiral Stark bore some of the blame for Pearl Harbor because of his failure to provide Kimmel with critical information available in Washington. Then Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal instructed the Court that it had to classify both sections ``secret'' and not release any findings to the public.  I won't go any further with this discussion of history, again I urge my colleagues to read the resolution. I hope that I have made my point that these officers were not treated fairly and that there is good reason to question where the blame for Pearl Harbor should lie.  The whole story was re-evaluated in 1995 at the request of Senator Thurmond by Under Secretary for Defense Edwin Dorn. In his report, Dorn concluded that responsibility for the disaster at Pearl Harbor should be broadly shared. I agree. Where Dorn's conclusions differ from mine and my cosponsors, is that he also found that ``the official treatment of Admiral Kimmel and General Short was substantively temperate and procedurally proper.'' I disagree.  These officers were publicly vilified and never given a chance to clear their names. If we lived in a closed society, fearful of the truth, then there would be no need for the President to take any action today. But we don't. We live in an open society. Eventually, we are able to declassify documents and evaluate our past based on at least a good portion of the whole story. One of our greatest strengths as a nation comes from our ability to honor truth and the lessons of our past.  Like most people, I can accept that there was a good case for the need to protect our intelligence capabilities during the war. I cannot accept that there is a reason for continuing to deny the culpability of others in Washington at the expense of these two officers' reputations 57 years later. Continuing to falsely scapegoat two dedicated and competent officers dishonors the military tradition of taking responsibility for failure. The historic message sent is that the truth will be suppressed to protect some responsible parties and distorted to sacrifice others.  One point I want to make here is that we are not seeking to place blame. This is not a witch-hunt aimed at those superior officers who were advanced in rank and continued to serve, despite being implicated in the losses at Pearl Harbor. I think the historic record has become quite clear that blame should be shared.  The unfortunate reality is that Admiral Kimmel and General Short were blamed entirely and forced into early retirement.  After the war, in 1947, they were singled out as the only eligible officers from World War II not advanced to their highest held wartime ranks on the retirement lists, under the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. By failing to advance them, the government and the Departments of the Navy and Army perpetuate the myth that these two officers bear a unique and disproportionate part of the blame.  The government that denied these officers a fair hearing and suppressed findings favorable to their case while releasing hostile information owes them an official apology. That's what this resolution calls for.  The last point that I want to make deals with the military situation at Pearl Harbor. It is legitimate to ask whether Admiral Kimmel and General Short, as commanding officers, properly deployed their forces. I think reasonable people may disagree on this point. I have been struck by the number of qualified individuals who believe the commanders properly deployed based on the intelligence available to them. I will ask to enter this partial list of flag officers into the Record. Among those listed is Vice Admiral Richardson, a distinguished naval commander, who wrote an entire report refuting the conclusions of the Dorn Report. My colleagues will also see the names of four Chiefs of Naval Operations and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas Moorer. It was Admiral Moorer who observed that, ``If Nelson and Napoleon had been in command at Pearl Harbor, the results would have been the same.''  In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe this case is unique and demands our attention. As we honor those who served in World War II by permanently berthing the U.S.S. Missouri in Pearl Harbor, we must also honor the ideals for which they fought. High among those American ideals is upholding truth and justice. Those ideals give us the strength to admit and, where possible, correct our errors.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution and move one step closer to justice for Admiral Kimmel and General Short.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a partial list of flag officers be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       The following is a partial listing of high-ranking retired      military personnel who advocate in support of the posthumous      advancement on the retired lists of Rear Admiral Husband      Kimmel and Major General Walter Short to Four-Star Admiral      and Three-Star General respectively:                                Admirals       Thomas H. Moorer; Carlisle A.H. Trost; William J. Crowe,      Jr.; Elmo R. Zumwalt; J.L. Hollaway III; Ronald J. Hays; T.B.      Hayward; Horatio Rivero; Worth H. Bargley; Noel A.M. Gayler;      Kinnaird R. McKee; Robert L.J. Long; William N. Small;      Maurice F. Weisner; U.S.G. Sharp, Jr.; H. Hardisty; Wesley      McDonald; Lee Baggett, Jr.; and Donald C. Davis.                             Vice Admirals       David C. Richardson and William P. Lawrence.                             Rear Admirals       D.M. Showers and Kemp Tolley.                          ____________________
