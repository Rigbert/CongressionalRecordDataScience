 President, I wish today to recognize the significant contributions that the East Bay Municipal Utility District in Oakland, CA, is making with respect to renewable energy production. East Bay Municipal Utility District is a regional water and wastewater treatment agency serving the needs of the citizens of Alameda and Contra Costa Counties in the San Francisco Bay area. I am proud to note that with 1.3 million customers in the east bay region, this agency is leading the way in developing sustainable energy and water conservation practices that benefit the region.  On April 3, the East Bay Municipal Utility District's board of directors will formally dedicate a project that will create clean energy for the region and help ensure that waste materials that would otherwise be sent to landfills are reused. This new project is the Power Generation Station Renewable Energy Expansion Project and it builds on the successful Resource Recovery Program that is already serving as a model for other wastewater treatment plants across the Nation.  The Power Generation Station Renewable Energy Expansion Project will utilize biogas, methane, produced from anaerobic digesters to power electrical generators and a new 4.6-megawatt clean-burn turbine. The source materials used by the anaerobic digesters will be waste that is currently being sent to garbage dumps. As a result of this new project, EBMUD's total production capacity at its wastewater treatment plant will be 10.6 megawatts, enough capacity to meet the electrical power demands of 13,000 homes.  The innovative Power Generation Station Renewable Energy Expansion Project will allow the East Bay Municipal Utility District to be the first agency of its kind in the Nation to generate all its own energy entirely from the production of biogas generated from waste materials. Excess energy, above and beyond that needed to meet the electrical power demands of running the wastewater treatment plant, will be sold back to the electrical grid, thereby helping to keep customer rates low by reducing EBMUD's power bill and increasing revenues from the sale of electricity. Increasing the generation of green energy supports California's goal of increasing clean energy while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This project is particularly important because EBMUD is currently generating so much biogas from waste material that it is forced to flare the excess biogas.  At a time when all of us must find ways to reduce energy consumption and help generate renewable energy, I commend the board of directors and the employees of the East Bay Municipal Utility District for the foresight they have shown in developing and growing the Resource Recovery Program and in the construction of this important sustainable energy project. This project serves as a reminder to each of us that we can find ways to develop high-quality public services and reduce operating costs through innovative thinking and the use of technology. I congratulate East Bay Municipal Utility District for leading the way on developing clean energy.                          ____________________
