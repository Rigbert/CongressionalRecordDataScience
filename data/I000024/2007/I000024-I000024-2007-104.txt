President, first of all, let me say to the previous speaker, the junior Senator from Colorado, I reviewed what he and Senator Lamar Alexander have put together, and I think of a lot of the options out there, that is one that is fairly reasonable. But I disagree with the offensive nature that people have taken with some of the terms, such as ``resolution of surrender'' and ``cut and run.'' In reality, I believe that is what we are talking about.  A couple things were said. First of all, it happens in the case of former Senator Max Cleland, he was one of my closest friends. We actually were in a Bible study together. We were together every week, spending quality time and intimate time together. Never once did anyone question his patriotism.  Max Cleland--I heard the story from him, what happened to him in Vietnam. Then I also saw the campaign that came up. Yes, they talked about votes, how perhaps his votes were different than the person who was opposing him who was serving in the House at that time. Never once was his patriotism questioned.
