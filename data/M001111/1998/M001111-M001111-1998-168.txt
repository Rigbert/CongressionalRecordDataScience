 President, I thank the Democratic leader for his continued work on this issue to try to allow us the opportunity to come here to the floor to talk about the most critical issue in this country today, which is the education of our young children.  There is a very serious debate that ought to be had. Are we going to go down the road of vouchers and block grants and cutting out the Department of Education, where fewer and fewer children have the opportunity for an education? Or are we going to talk about the proposals that we would like to debate--whether or not our class sizes should be smaller, how we are going to train our teachers for the skills they need with our children in their schools, how we are going to deal with our classrooms that need school construction so badly across this country. There is a debate to be had. We are ready to join it. We want to have that opportunity, and we will stand behind the Democratic leader to be allowed to have that debate on this floor.
