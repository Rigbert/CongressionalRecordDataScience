President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a joint statement by the chair and ranking member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, Representative Shuster and Representative DeFazio, and the chair and ranking member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, myself and Senator Boxer, to clarify an issue with the Joint Explanatory Statement of the committee on conference for H.R. 22.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Joint Statement of The Honorable Bill Shuster, The Honorable Peter A. DeFazio, and The Honorable James Inhofe, The Honorable Barbara Boxer on the Joint Explanatory Statement of the Committee on Conference H.R. 22,               Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act                            December 3, 2015       Title XLIII of the Joint Explanatory Statement provides a      summary of section 43001 concerning requirements in agency      rulemakings pursuant to this Act. Section 43001 of the House      amendments to H.R. 22 was not agreed to in conference and      does not appear in the conference report to accompany H.R.      22. The summary of section 43001 in the Joint Explanatory      statement therefore appears in error. Accordingly, title      XLIII of the Joint Explanatory Statement has no effect.
