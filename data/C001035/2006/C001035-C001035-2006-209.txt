President, I rise in support of Senator Murray's amendment. I commend her for offering it. Each year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection collects more than $24 billion in Customs duties and fees.  The amendment would extend the merchandise processing fee and passenger conveyance fee for an additional year, and our hope is that that money will then be targeted to pay for this bill. This makes sense. In many ways, it is a user fee. It makes a great deal of sense. It will help ensure that there is a dedicated funding source for the security measures.  I point out again that the amendment has been cleared with the Finance Committee. Senator Murray has worked hard with Senators Grassley and Baucus to find the source of funding. I commend her for her efforts. I fully support the amendment and I urge its adoption.
