Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to James Fleming Davidson, Jr. who passed away peacefully on his 86th birthday. James was a pillar of the community in Riverside, California and he will be deeply missed.  Jim was born on October 26, 1925, the son of James F. Davidson, Sr. and Irene Reid. He attended Magnolia Elementary, Central Middle School, and Poly High School. At 17, he enlisted in the United States Navy and served on a destroyer escort during World War II.  After the war, Jim enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley where he received a Bachelor of Science degree and was a member of the Delta Upsilon Fraternity. Upon graduation he returned to his native Riverside and joined his father in the prominent local Civil Engineering firm of J.F. Davidson Associates. The firm later grew to include five offices and three hundred employees. He also oversaw the expansion of Riverside Blueprint and founded R.B. Graphics and Prefect Impressions, as well as many other successful business ventures including J.F. Davidson Investments. He faithfully went to the office until weeks before his passing.  In addition to his professional accomplishments, James was a citrus grower, avid gardener and sports fan. Jim loved the ocean and spent many happy hours deep sea fishing. He demonstrated his leadership in the community and served as President of the Riverside Rotary Club, Riverside Chamber of Commerce, and the Riverside Community College Foundation. In addition, he was Chair of the Cancer Society Great American Smoke Out and numerous other boards and organizations.  James is survived by his wife of 22 years, Gerri Bredemann Davidson, and her sons; Michael and William Bredemann. Jim's children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren include; Charlotte Davidson (Tony Adler) of Los Angeles, her children; Caroline Dehe (Dr. Saahil Mahta) and Jim's first great-granddaughter; Uma Elvetia Mehta, of London, England, and James Dehe (Karen DeSouza) of Bombay, India; Ian James Davidson, Liam Davidson of Riverside; Hannah Davidson of Portland, Oregon, and Sarah Davidson-Amici (Robert Amici), Dario and Caterina Amici of Riverside; his first wife, Gretchen Holstein Davidson, his sister Eileen Shamel, and many nieces and nephews. He is preceded in death by his parents and his sister Charlotte Davidson Nickel.  On Saturday, November 5, 2011, a memorial service celebrating James' extraordinary life will be held at the first Congregational Church in Riverside. James will always be remembered for his incredible work ethic, generosity, and love of family. His dedication to his work, family and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to James' family and friends; although James may be gone, the light and goodness he brought to the world remain and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
