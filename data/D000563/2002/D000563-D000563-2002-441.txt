Often, after these puppies join a family, they turn out to have serious health and psychological problems that cause them pain, cause their owners great distress, and require expensive medical care.  I believe our amendment will address these problems, by filling gaps in the current law and encouraging stronger enforcement by USDA to crack down on chronic violators.  Our amendment has three components: socialization, breeding, and a three strikes policy. First, it will require commercial breeders to provide socialization for dogs at their facilities. Socialization is important for puppies during their first few weeks of life because if they're isolated from people and other dogs during those key weeks, they could face a lifetime of serious problems. Second, our amendment establishes some very modest restrictions to prevent extreme over-breeding of dogs by commercial operators. The dogs must be at least one-year-old before they're bred, and they can't have more than 3 litters during a 24-month period. Third, our amendment contains a ``three strikes and you're out" provision to strengthen enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act by cracking down on commercial dog dealers who keep violating the law. If there are three violations during an 8-year period, the facility will lose its license, unless the Secretary makes a written finding that revocation is unwarranted because of extraordinary extenuating circumstance  I've heard from many of my constituents in Illinois, who are deeply concerned about the puppy mill problem and want this legislation enacted. Our amendment is supported by national animal protection organizations, such as The Humane Society of the United States and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, ASPCA, which collectively represent more than 8 million Americans.  In addition, more than 860 animal shelters, animal control offices, and other state and local organizations across the country have endorsed this legislation. In my home State, they include 23 groups in Illinois, ranging from the Cook County Department ofAnimal and Rabies Control to the Peoria Animal Welfare Shelter to the Illinois Federation of Humane Societies, based in Urbana.  I've been pleased to join with Senator Santorum and a number of our colleagues in obtaining additional funds for USDA to improve its enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act. We've had terrific support in this effort from Appropriations Chairmen Byrd and Kohl, along with Ranking Member Cochran, for which I'm very grateful. This amendment will complement those ongoing efforts by strengthening USDA's authority to crack down on the bad actors.  This amendment will ensure that any commercial dog breeder licensed by the Federal Government is meeting basic humane standards of care. We owe at least this much to the animals that have earned the title ``man's best friend.'' We're talking about establishing a safety net to protect dogs, puppies, and the consumers who care about them against the poor treatment practices of the really bad dealers, the ones who provide no interaction; the ones who go against industry norms when it comes to over-breeding. And the ones who repeatedly violate the law governing the humane care of dogs. The good dealers, however, should be recognized for their work.  In closing, it is just unfortunate that it is the good dealers who suffer at the hands of the bad ones, the ones that give the industry a bad reputation. I thank my colleagues for their attention to this issue, and I urge their support for the Santorum-Durbin amendment.                               Exhibit 1        Top 10 Violations by Commercial Dog Breeding Facilities       Here are the most common violations found by USDA in      reported enforcement actions of 2000 (in order of frequency):       1. Failure to maintain clean and dry enclosures (remove      excrement, food waste or corpses on a daily basis);       2. Failure to provide veterinary care to animals in need of      care;       3. Failure to provide outdoor housing with adequate      protection from the elements;       4. Failure to establish or maintain program to prevent      infestation of pests;       5. Failure to provide dogs with adequate space;       6. Failure to clean and sanitize food receptacles;       7. Failure to ensure that enclosures did not have sharp      edges that could injure animals;       8. Failure to provide water and food;       9. Failure to allow USDA inspectors to conduct a complete      inspection of facility; and       10. Failure to ensure dogs were older than eight weeks of      age before delivering them for transport.                                  ____                                                The Humane Society                                         of the United States,                                                   Washington, DC.     Support the Santorum-Durbin amendment to the farm bill       Dear Senator: On behalf of the more than 7 million members      and constituents of The Humane Society of the United States      (HSUS) and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty      to Animals (ASPCA), we urge you to support the Santorum-     Durbin amendment to S. 1731 (the Farm Bill). This amendment,      which has broad bipartisan support, tracks closely with S.      1478, the ``Puppy Protection Act,'' introduced by the      amendment authors. The amendment is designed to crack down on      so-called ``puppy mills.''       The Santorum-Durbin amendment will improve USDA enforcement      of the Animal Welfare Act at commercial dog breeding      operations in three ways:       (1) Encourage swift and strong enforcement against repeat      offenders by creating a ``three strikes and you're out''      system for chronic violators.       (2) Address the need for breeding females to be given time      to recover between litters, and to be at least one year old      before they are bred.       (3) Require that dogs be adequately socialized with other      dogs and with people, enhancing their well-being and helping      to prevent behavior problems in the future.       Mistreatment of dogs is a chronic problem at puppy mills.      Dogs at puppy mills are often overcrowded, subjected to      intense over-breeding, denied proper veterinary care, and      maintained in substandard and unsanitary housing. Despite      public awareness of these problems, the conditions persist.      Strengthening the federal Animal Welfare Act to resolve these      problems is a warranted and overdue response.       Mill dogs are treated as breeding machines. They are kept      there for one reason: to produce puppies non-stop, beginning      at a very young age, when they are still just puppies      themselves. Over-breeding causes serious health problems for      the mother and puppies.       Consumers are defrauded, believing they are purchasing      healthy animals. Because of overbreeding and poor      socialization, new puppies from pet stores and large-scale      breeding facilities often face an array of behavioral and      health problems--with illnesses often requiring consumers to      absorb costly veterinary treatment.       USDA data reveal that there are at least 3,000 commercial      dog breeding facilities operating throughout the country. The      Santorum-Durbin amendment will provide USDA with better tools      to crack down on chronic law-breakers and to address the      important issues of socialization and over-breeding.       We anticipate scoring this legislation in the 2001 Humane      Scorecard, either by cosponsorship or recorded vote. Please      support the Santorum-Durbin amendment to the Farm Bill.           Sincerely,     Wayne Pacelle,       Senior Vice President, Communications and Government      Affairs, HSUS.     Lisa Weisberg,       Senior Vice President, Government Affairs and Public      Policy, ASPCA.                                  ____                 Q & A on Puppy Protection Act, S. 1478     Won't this legislation affect ``hobby breeders'' and bring          anyone who sells a puppy under federal regulation?       Those who maintain three or fewer breeding female dogs and      sell their offspring for pets or exhibition are exempt from      the Animal Welfare Act (AWA). This means that they do not      need to obtain a license, nor are they subject to the AWA's      humane care requirements or inspections.       Nothing in the Puppy Protection Act changes this ``de      minimus'' exemption. Only those who are subject to the rest      of the Animal Welfare Act will be subject to the new      requirements regarding socialization and overbreeding and to      the ``three strikes'' enforcement provision.       According to the American Kennel Club's (AKA) records for      1997, the overwhelming majority of its registrants--almost      97%--had 3 or fewer breeding female dogs.       If it becomes necessary to adjust the de minimus threshold      because of pending litigation, this can and should be      addressed through the regulatory process, with input from all      affected parties.     Under the ``three strikes'' provision, will breeding          facilities be shut down for non-compliance with minor          technical rules?       The legislation expressly provides that a dealer's license      need not be revoked if the Secretary finds that ``the      violations were minor and inadvertent, that the violations      did not pose a threat to the dogs, or that revocation is      inappropriate for other good cause.'' This waiver language is      broad enough to cover a range of situations for which      revocation might be considered too severe a penalty, such as      the scenario cited by opponents involving ``three minor      violations. . .even if immediate corrections were made and      the dealer was in full compliance with the law.''       The legislation further guarantees the licensee a hearing      before an Administrative Law Judge within 30 days, to      consider whether license revocation is unwarranted.     Why cover commercial breeders who supply dogs for research?       There are no standards currently covering socialization or      overbreeding of any dogs (those destined for research or for      the pet trade). The Puppy Protection Act addresses this gap      in the Animal Welfare Act.       Dogs who will be used for research--and may suffer and give      their lives to serve human health needs--are certainly no      less deserving of humane care in their first few weeks than      those who will become pets.       Congress has recognized this moral obligation by providing      additional--not lesser--protections for dogs destined for      research, in other portions of the Animal Welfare Act.       Poor socialization renders dogs fearful and aggressive when      they come in contact with people. It is not in the interest      of researchers to have dogs who bite and are unmanageable.       Breeding female dogs every single heat, beginning when they      are too young, seriously compromises their health and the      health of their puppies, leavingthem weak and susceptible to      disease. The scientific integrity of medical research is      undermined if animal subjects are not healthy.       If puppies are produced at facilities that chronically      violate basic humane standards (for food, water, veterinary      care, etc.), their health and their value as research      subjects are likely to be compromised. As former Senator Bob      Dole said, ``It is obvious that good animal care is essential      to ensuring good quality research.''       Less than .3% of all animals used in research are dogs, so      the impact of this bill on research will be slight.      Furthermore, it is not researchers, but the breeding      facilities that supply dogs to them, who will be subject to      the Puppy Protection Act's requirements, which will in turn      benefit the researchers by ensuring healthier dogs.     Shouldn't Congress stay out of the business of regulating dog          breeding practices?       Female dogs at some breeding facilities are made to produce      litters every cycle (typically, twice a year) until they are      ``spent,'' beginning when they are as young as 6 months old.      Such relentless overbreeding causes severe nutritional      deficiencies and impairs a dog's immune system, leading to     increased risk of infections, illness and organ failure.      These concerns go to the heart of humane treatment, and are      as appropriate for Congress to address as other areas already      covered by the AWA, such as adequate veterinary care, food,      water, sanitation, ventilation, and shelter from harsh      weather.       Opponents concede that the legislation's restrictions on      breeding are so modest that ``most breeders have much higher      standards than the ones called for'' in the Puppy Protection      Act; the bill will only affect truly ``bad actors.''     If Congress puts restrictions on breeding of dogs, won't this          lead to breeding restrictions for livestock?       The ``slippery slope'' argument ignores the fact that      Congress will only go as far as it considers necessary and      acceptable, and is not bound to extend any law.       Congress has historically afforded dogs extra protections      under the Animal Welfare Act and other federal laws (such as      banning the sale of dog fur and restricting military research      on dogs), in recognition of the special relationship between      dogs and people. Livestock are not even subject to the      protections of the Animal Welfare Act.     Why not us a ``performance-based standard'' rather than an          ``engineering standard'' for socialization?       When performance-based standards have been used elsewhere      in the Animal Welfare Act (to meet the requirement for      promoting psychological well-being of primates), they have      proven vague, ineffective, and very difficult to enforce.      This approach leaves it up to each facility to figure out how      to achieve the desired result, and forces inspectors to make      subjective judgments. Conversely, an engineering standard      clearly specifies what steps a facility needs to take to      comply with the law. The facilities know what is expected of      them, and the inspectors know what to check for in      determining compliance.     Shouldn't industry experts have a say in developing the          socialization standard?       The legislation provides that minimum requirements for the      socialization of dogs will be developed by the Secretary of      Agriculture as part of the regulatory process, ensuring that      commercial breeders will have ample opportunity to influence      the standard-setting. The legislation does not dictate the      specific socialization requirements.     Why not just focus on better enforcement of existing law and          catching those who breed dogs illegally without a          license?       The sponsors of S. 1478, along with animal protection      organizations, are actively involved in obtaining increased      funding for USDA to do a better job enforcing the Animal      Welfare Act. In the past few years, Congress has appropriated      an additional $13 million to enable USDA to track down more      unlicensed facilities, conduct more inspections, and improve      follow-up enforcement efforts. Opponents of S. 1478, who      argue that Congress should direct its attention to better      enforcement of existing law, have done little or nothing to      secure additional funds toward that end.       While Congress is making progress addressing the AWA budget      shortfall, it is also important to address gaps in the law to      better protect dogs and consumers. All the funding in the      world will not resolve the problems that the socialization      and breeding provisions of the Puppy Protection Act address.                      multi-lender risk management  Senator LEAHY. Mr. President, section 541 of S. 1731 makes certain technical adjustments to the current authority of farm credit system institutions to participate with non-system lenders in certain multi-lender risk management transactions. The system's multi-lender risk management authorities have been very successful in achieving the objectives of the 1992 authorizing legislation, as described on page 73 of the committee's report.  Is it the chairman's understanding that the provisions of S. 1731 will facilitate these partnership arrangements between commercial lenders and the system to spread risk among lenders and improve the availability of capital for the agricultural and food system, communication and related technology service companies and utility systems?
