 President, I rise to commemorate the 30th anniversary for two excellent charities in my home State of Kentucky, the Ronald McDonald House Charities. The Ronald McDonald House Charities of Kentuckiana in Louisville and the Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Bluegrass in Lexington both first opened their doors to needy families in 1984.  Since then, each house has served more than 25,000 families. In the lastyear alone, more than 1,100 Kentucky families have spent nearly 15,000 nights in the two homes operated by these charities. The two homes operate thanks to the generosity of Kentucky's McDonalds' owners, a broad swath of Kentucky businesses, countless individual donors, and the hundreds of thousands of hours given by tireless volunteers.  For those of my colleagues who are not familiar with the Ronald McDonald House, it serves as a home away from home, at low or no cost, for the families of children who are hospital patients. At a time when a family is undergoing such a crisis as the illness of a child, infant, or newborn, the last thing these families need to worry about is finding housing near the hospital. The Ronald McDonald House eases that need by providing a home away from home for families of children receiving health care at area medical facilities while also lending support to other organizations that aid children. Today there are 125 local chapters in 55 countries.  The Ronald McDonald House Charities of Kentuckiana first opened in Louisville in September 1984. Since their most recent expansion in 2009, they feature 36 guest rooms, each accommodating up to four people.  In 1992, the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Kentuckiana helped pioneer one of the first Ronald McDonald Family Rooms in the world--a smaller version of a Ronald McDonald House located inside a hospital so a parent is only steps away from their seriously ill child. Today there are Ronald McDonald Family Rooms in three Louisville hospitals.  The Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Bluegrass in Lexington similarly opened their doors in 1984, and have since expanded to 20 rooms. In 2005, through a partnership with the University of Kentucky, the Ronald McDonald House Charities of the Bluegrass began the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile to offer eastern Kentucky's children free professional dental care and education aboard a state-of-the-art mobile clinic. Centered in Hazard, KY, the Ronald McDonald Care Mobile cares for underserved children in their own neighborhoods and schools.  Together, the Ronald McDonald House Charities of both Kentuckiana and the Bluegrass have accomplished a great deal for the Commonwealth and helped thousands of Kentucky families. Kentucky residents and businesses are proud to have supported them for 30 years, and I know will continue to do so for many years more. I want to thank the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Kentuckiana and the Bluegrass for serving as the home away from home for distressed families with a child in the hospital for 30 years. Kentucky is proud of these institutions and the many people behind them who make them work.                          ____________________
