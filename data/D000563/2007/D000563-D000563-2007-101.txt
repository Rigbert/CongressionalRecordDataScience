President, what will it take to end this war? How many lives? How many limbs? How many broken families? How many innocent victims?  The Senate has an opportunity, with this next vote, to start to bring this war to an end and to start to bring our soldiers home in an orderly, responsible way.  We know the President will not do this. But it is within our power, our authority, and our responsibility under the Constitution to do it. A vote now to move forward on this House appropriations bill will bring this war to an end in an orderly, responsible way.  I urge my colleagues, do not shirk your responsibility. Do not be on the wrong side of history.
