President, the Senator, of course, is entitled to his own analysis of what I said, which of course is not what I said. I have spoken on this floor many times and elsewhere for several years, both in the past administration and in this administration, saying there has been opportunity after opportunity lost by NATO in the past.  This is not something calling for NATO to act today. It is something I have been saying for years, something I have said both to the current President and his predecessor. This is not something I am saying up here and raising this point. It is a situation where I wish I had been wrong in calling for stronger action in the past. It may have had a lot more effect. But I see now, as I look back, I was right and the decisions made by two administrations were wrong.
