 I can't believe anyone would object. So we are objecting to protecting Medicaid from fraud? We are objecting to protecting the integrity of the Medicaid Program? We are objecting to stopping inappropriate Medicaid payments?  We are making a mistake. I hope this gets fixed in conference, and I am going to work to do that. I regret the objection, but I understand why.  Madam President, I yield the floor.
