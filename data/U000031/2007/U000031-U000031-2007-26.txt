Chairman, I might say that, as the gentlelady said, we've offered this amendment that has passed on every appropriation bill thus far.  We know the Federal Government is the largest purchaser of light bulbs in the world. By requiring that only Energy Star light bulbs are purchased, beginning October 1, in fact, we know that we will save the taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars this next year in terms of energy savings.  We also know that if every home did what the Federal Government is going to do, based on the testimony that we had in the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, we would save as a Nation $65 billion, billion, B-as-in-big, kilowatt hours of electricity, which is the equivalent of 80 coal-fire electric plants every single year.  This is a good amendment. It has been bipartisan. We've appreciated the relationship that we've had with the chairman and ranking members of not only the full committee but the subcommittee. I would like to think that we would be able to pass this amendment again by a voice vote and make a stand that in fact the entire government is going to be saving billions of dollars at the end of the day based on the amendment that we're offering today.
