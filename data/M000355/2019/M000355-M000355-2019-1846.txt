 President, in order to guarantee a particular amendment would get a vote without consent, we would have to be able to get 60 votes and vote cloture to advance the amendment.  I will just reiterate to my friend from Oregon that his complaint is legitimate, but it does require, no matter what the majority leader says with regard to openness of the bill, some level of bipartisan cooperation in order to process amendments.

I do have a consent agreement pending. I don't know whether the Senator from Oregon wants to continue to object to all of these--
