There is no question about it.  To give my colleagues an idea of how regressive those efforts are, they would actually be retroactive. So this idea that these tax cuts for the well-to-do were in some way going to create jobs is just absurd. They are made retroactive. So they aren't going to be creating jobs going forward.
