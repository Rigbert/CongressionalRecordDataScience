Mr. Speaker, I am today introducing the ``Homeless Veterans Assistance Act of 2001.'' I intend to have hearings on this measure in September and to ask the House to consider it shortly thereafter.  This is a great Nation, Mr. Speaker, and Fortune smiles on us in this country in so many ways. But tragically, a few are left behind, and a large number of America's veterans are counted among them. Currently, we believe that some 225,000 veterans are homeless on a given night. For these veterans, access to VA benefits, specialized services and effective outreach are vital components to any hope of individual stability and improvement in their prospects.  It is important to create and maintain programs that give veterans the opportunity to become self-sufficient, and to concentrate our resources on programs that work. We know this is not an immediate process but instead constitutes a long-term challenge and struggle for many, both for those who are homeless and those who are trying to help. Also, I believe that some of our government's homeless assistance programs ought to stress prevention as an integral part of any strategy to help homeless veterans. This bill I am introducing, the Homeless Veterans Assistance Act, incorporates a number of these goals.  Mr. Speaker, it is difficult to pinpoint any one cause of homelessness among veterans. Many problems and difficulties could be traceable to an individual's experience in military service, exposure to combat, or return to a seemingly uncaring civilian society. In fact, we know that a majority of homeless veterans today suffer from serious mental illness, including post-traumatic stress disorder, and illegal substance use often complicates their situations. Many have served time in jail. These individual conditions have far-reaching effects on veterans and their families.  A veteran with an impaired mental state may lose the ability to maintain stable employment. Absent employment, it eventually becomes difficult to maintain any type of permanent housing. The vicious cycle only accelerates once employment and housing are lost. The absence of these two important anchors to society is a precursor for increased utilization of medical resources in emergency rooms, VA and other public hospitals and, unfortunately, the resources of America's courtrooms, jails and prisons.  A full platter of medical services may be available to veterans through VA medical facilities, but without better coordination within and across Federal programs relief is only temporary, because veterans once released from VA health care frequently are exposed to the same challenges that created these conditions in the first place. This is why prevention and accountability are two important priorities of my bill. We need to find new ways to prevent veterans from spiraling down to homelessness, but to be responsible we should also provide for them and their caregivers a sense of accountability. And we should not expect veterans to complete this arduous journey alone.  This bill will hold accountable the three federal departments most directly involved in homeless assistance for veterans: Veterans' Affairs, Labor, and Housing and Urban Development. These agencies need to help homeless veterans make a transition to self-reliance; my bill urges them, and in some cases requires them, to cooperate more fully to address the problem of homelessness among veterans.  The bill improves and expands VA's homeless grant and per diem program. Recipients of these funds are contributing substantially to the fulfillment of this bill's objective: to reduce homelessness and provide for the specialty needs of homeless veterans. The initiative I am introducing authorizes higher funding for the program. It also provides a new mechanism for setting the per diem payment so that it will be adjusted regularly. Finally, it eliminates some of the intricate accounting procedures associated with the receipt of the payment.  It is important that any investment produced at taxpayers' expense to help homeless veterans must do the job for which it is intended, or those funds should be returned to the government and put to better use. The existing law requires grant recipients to submit plans, specifications, and specific timetables for implementation of their programs. If the grant recipients cannot meet these obligations, the United States should be entitled to recover the total of unused amounts provided in the grant. My bill would thus bring greater accountability to VA's program to help homeless veterans.  Working is the key to helping homeless veterans rejoin American society, but this is a process that begins with quality medical care and other supportive services including counseling and transitional housing. The Department of Labor's Homeless Veterans Reintegration Program was designed to put homeless veterans back into the labor force. The Secretary of Labor has the authority to determine appropriate job training, counseling, and placement services to aid the transition of homeless veterans back into the labor force.  This bill makes support services available to veterans in need. As homeless veterans begin to make a transition back into the labor force the respective departments must make available essential services to help these veterans. For example, the bill urges the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to increase contracts withcommunity agencies for representative payee services to help some of these homeless veterans manage their own personal funds and thereby avoid poor choices some of them have made that lead to personal catastrophe. The entity acting as a representative on the veteran's behalf can work with care providers of the Veterans' Health Administration and other parties to a veteran's reintegration to ensure that government funds are used appropriately to help the veteran be reestablished in society.  As I indicated, prevention of homelessness among veterans is an important objective of this bill. This should certainly include veterans transitioning from institutional settings who are at risk for homelessness. As I indicated and as we well know, many homeless veterans have been in jail or in prison. I believe we need to consider making provision for the particular services incarcerated veterans need, and begin providing them before they are released from these institutions into society. The bill includes a demonstration program to test the prevention hypothesis within the institutionalized veteran population, at 6 demonstration sites, one of which will be a Bureau of Prisons facility. The purpose of this program is to provide incarcerated veterans with information, referral and counseling with respect to job training and placement, housing, health care, and other needs determined necessary to assist the veteran in the transition from institutional living to civil life.  Also, Mr. Speaker, some programs with very high success rates have been growing on their own, basically without government intervention. One such program that comes to mind is the ``Oxford House'' concept. In this model, a group of recovering alcoholics determined to stay sober band together to rent a residential property. Oxford House, Inc., provides earnest money deposits, and the rest is up to the individuals to govern their own lives and run their own homes. This program has been highly effective, and now there are over 800 Oxford Houses nationwide. The bill authorizes a small demonstration project to provide housing assistance to veterans in group houses with similar goals of self-govemance. This bill authorizes the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs to make grants up to $5,000 for the purpose of subsidizing housing for veterans who present this need. Elements of the Department of Veterans' Affairs recently have helped sponsor 20 such houses. My bill will provide for 50 more in fiscal year 2003 and an additional 50 houses in fiscal year 2004. This is a model worth exploring.  Mr. Speaker, these are the highlights of my bill, the ``Homeless Veterans Assistance Act of 2001.'' I believe the bill will accomplish very important goals. It will provide needed assistance to homeless veterans, lift them to a sustainable level that will prevent them from returning to a state of homelessness, and help them to become self-sufficient individuals who are accountable for their own actions. This bill will also hold all grant and contract recipients accountable for performing their promised services in exchange for government investments, and promote a greater opportunity to work across departments to provide the best possible service for our Nation's homeless veterans. It also sponsors innovative approaches at prevention of homelessness in high-risk groups within the veteran population.  These are good purposes on which I believe we can all agree, Mr. Speaker, so I am very pleased to offer this bill to the House. On behalf of homeless veterans who need these services, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                          ____________________
