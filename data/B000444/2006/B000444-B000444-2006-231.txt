 President, I thank the Senator very much.  The bottom line is, I do not, for a moment--and, again, because he is on the floor and he is my friend--I do not question the motivation, the intention, the desire, the intensity with which my friend from Pennsylvania feels about this issue. I believe he believes if this passes we are going to be doing the victims of asbestosis--and all other aspects of the exposure to asbestos--we are going to be doing them more good than harm.  But I disagree. If the money were here, if the money were guaranteed, under no circumstances could it fall short, then, in fact, that would be the case. But the last piece I will mention here is, I heard my good friend from California talk about Goldman Sachs has a list. Isn't this amazing? We are about to vote on a bill that by some measure will cost at least $140 billion to somebody--I think a lot more--and there is a list that Goldman Sachs has. And we don't? I ain't for no deal I ain't in on. I ain't in on this deal. I am not for it. I am not for it.  I thank the Chair and thank my colleague.
