President, I thank my colleague. I wish to renew my invitation to Senator Coburn to please come to the floor but do it soon before my time expires. I called his office to make sure he knew I was trying to reach him. I have spoken on the floor to alert the Republican side that I wished to ask him to explain a statement he made on the floor earlier today. The statement of Senator Coburn of Oklahoma said:       What the American people ought to pray is that somebody      can't make the vote tonight. That's what they ought to pray.  I am troubled by this statement. I want to give the Senator from Oklahoma an opportunity to explain it because the simple reality is, I don't think we should be wishing misfortune on any of our Senate colleagues on either side of the aisle. I don't know if this was an innocent statement or something he now wants to clarify. But as stated, it troubles me.  It troubles me because I am afraid it reflects the situation we find ourselves in too often in the Senate, where people are literally invoking God's name in prayer for political purposes--in this case, to wish misfortune on one of our colleagues who would not be able to make our 1 a.m. scheduled rollcall. I do not wish misfortune on any of our colleagues.
