Mr. Speaker, this week we will have the opportunity to reduce the Social Security earnings test and bring parity to America's work force.  This obsolete tax punishes senior citizens simply because they take the initiative to work in their retirement years to supplement their Social Security income. Furthermore, the earnings test is detrimental to America's workplace. It deprives the work force of the talents of our most experienced laborers.  The earnings test stands as a monument to the decline of the work ethic upon which this Nation was founded. At a time when we are asking Americans to take more responsibility for their personal welfare, we cannot allow this Depression-era tax to continue to exist.  The mechanics of the earnings test are simple, but it is founded upon no sound principle. The Federal Government instructs men and women between 65 and 69 years of age that if they earn more than $11,280 in a year, they will face an additional 33-percent tax. When combined with the 7.65-percent FICA withholding tax and a 15-percent Federal income tax, hard-working, low-income seniors are burdened with an effective marginal tax rate of 55.65 percent. The earnings test is wrong, counterproductive, and should be abolished.  A key element to H.R. 1215 is the incremental increase of the earnings test threshold to $30,000 per year over a 5-year period. While it does not eliminate the earnings test, H.R. 1215 is a positive step toward ending this substantiated bias against working seniors and I encourage my colleagues to support it.  I would also encourage my colleagues to work toward a full repeal of the earnings test, such as that introduced by Representative Howard Coble in H.R. 201. Both the reduction of the earnings test and its full repeal are important elements in our covenant with America's seniors.                          ____________________
