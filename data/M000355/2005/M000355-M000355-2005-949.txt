 President, tomorrow, the Senate will resume consideration of the Homeland Security appropriations bill. Several amendments are currently pending, including the Collins grant formula amendment, as well as a second-degree amendment on the same subject matter offered by Senator Feinstein. It is my hope that we will be able to lock in a time agreement with respect to those amendments tomorrow morning. In addition, there is an amendment relating to veterans health funding that we hope to dispose of tomorrow.  Chairman Gregg and Senator Byrd will be here tomorrow to work through additional amendments, and Senators who have time to file the amendments and wish to offer them should contact the bill managers, obviously, as soon as possible. Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout the day tomorrow as the Senate continues to make progress on this important piece of legislation.                          ____________________
