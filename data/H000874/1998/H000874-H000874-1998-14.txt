Speaker, I want to rise and speak on behalf of this bill and say that I am probably going to vote to recommit it. But I will reiterate one more time, this bill is 99.9 percent pure and good. The gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) has done an outstanding job. This bill does in fact provide for the needs of the agencies that are within it, it provides funds sufficient for them to carry out their duties in an appropriate way, and it has not included provisions which would undermine their effectiveness. For that I think we owe the chairman of this committee a great deal of thanks because of his conscientious handling of this bill.  Unfortunately as the chairman indicates and as we indicated in the debate on the rule, this bill has gotten caught up in four, what could be called extraneous issues. I would suggest, however, that one of them is not really extraneous to the extent that its provision in the bill is an appropriation matter in that it says none of the funds in this bill shall be spent to purchase policies which do not have full coverage for contraception. To that extent, that is an appropriation provision. The other three provisions essentially are legislation on an appropriation bill. The gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Lowey) was able to offer it because it was in order under the rules. And when she offered it, it passed.  I want to go back to that subject, but I want to thank the chairman for his work on this bill. I want to also join him in thanking the chief clerk of the committee Michelle Mrdeza, also Bob Schmidt, Jeff Ashford, Tammy Hughes, and Frank Larkin. I particularly want to join the chairman in his justifiable pride and appreciation at the work that Jason Isaac has done. I always want to make the observation that the public far too often sees us fighting and confronting one another as if we did not try to work constructively together. I want to say that the chairman, joined by Jason Isaac, has been a very positive interlocutor in trying to come to grips with the important issues confronting this bill. Jason, I want to on behalf of not only myself but all the Democrats on the committee, our Democratic staff, thank you for the extraordinarily able contribution you have made to the consideration of this bill over the past few years. It has been a joy to work with you. We respect your ability and your integrity. We wish you the best of luck.  Mr. Speaker, this bill, and I am not going to make all my comments because I will adopt the chairman's comment and include my statement for the Record. But in particular this bill provides appropriate resources for the IRS. Why is that important? When we did IRS reform, I made the point that if you were not for IRS reform at budget time and at tax-writing time, all the reform legislation you passed was going to be meaningless. You need to give the IRS the resources to serve the public in a customer-friendly way. You also need good management. I want to congratulate again Secretary Rubin and Larry Summers, the Deputy Secretary, for bringing in a manager, Charles Rossotti. His predecessors have been outstanding people. For the most part they have been tax lawyers. Obviously that was an important skill to have, but really what IRS needed was management skill. Secretary Rubin brought in a manager with Mr. Rossotti from the private sector, an 8,000 person firm, an expert in the field of information management. He is doing an outstanding job. That is the good news.  The second piece of good news is that the gentleman from Arizona and our committee has provided him the resources to make sure that reform in fact occurs. I want to thank the chairman again for that. The bill does fund as well law enforcement. Forty percent of Federal law enforcement is in this bill, whether on the borders, in our cities, in our schools, training kids how to stay out of gangs. This bill is a critical component of fighting crime in America in every community in America. The gentleman from Arizona is committed to that effort. He and I have the privilege of working together with our law enforcement officials in the Treasury Department to make sure they are as effective as we could possibly make them to keep our schools and communities and States and Nation as free of crime as we possibly can; as well to interdict drugs which are eating at the fabric of our society. This bill funds that effort. I congratulate him for it.  Mr. Speaker, before my time concludes, I will include the rest of my remarks in the Record, talking about the programs that this bill does well by. Mr. Speaker, we will be discussing what this bill, however, deleted.  When this bill went to conference, there were a number of provisions, four in number, that became contentious. One, the provision about the FEC which the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Livingston) has been a very strong supporter and proponent of, was obviously very controversial and a confrontation between the two parties where one party was all against it and for the most part the other party was for it. I suggested that that provision be dropped because we could not get agreement on that provision, and I am pleased that it has been dropped. The other three provisions, however, were different, Mr. Speaker, and they were different because they had and still to this time, I believe, enjoy bipartisan support.                              {time}  1845  Not only do they enjoy bipartisan support in the House, but also in the Senate, and that bipartisan support also reflected itself in the conference. It is unfortunate that they were dropped. I will have more to say about them in a few minutes.  But again, this is a good bill once we resolve these four items. I hope it moves forward.  Almost half of the $13.4 billion in discretionary budget authority in this bill is targeted at law enforcement and anti-drug efforts.  Roughly $450 million in provided to the drug czar for a variety of drug-fighting efforts, including $182 million for the very successful high-intensity drug trafficking areas [HIDTAS], and $185 million for the ONDCP's national media campaign.  We provided IRS commissioner Rossoitti with funding that will enable him to continue with the reform and restructuring efforts. IRS is funded at $7.9 billion, $469 million less than the President's request--most of which is attributable to the IRS' Y2K needs, which should be funded in the supplemental being planned by the leadership.  Secretary Rubin and Deputy Secretary Summers should be given credit for rescuing the failing tax modernization program. They provided the needed oversight to allow IRS to make the dramatic improvement in their computer systems area.  This bill also funds many smaller agencies, including the National Archives, OPM, GSA, the FEC, and the Executive Office of the President, including the White House Office, and executive residence.  I am pleased that the chairman and I were able to reach an agreement to modify the fence on $630,000 for spending on overtime expenses at the executive residence. I wish the fence were not there, however, the language will allow the White House to provide the General Accounting Office with its comments and once the GAO notifies the committees of its receipt of the White House comments, the fence is eliminated. I was informed today that GAD has given its report to the White House, and this well be finished soon.  For GSA, I am very pleased that we are able to include over $500 million for needed courthouse construction projects. Chairman Kolbe and I agreed that the courthouses needing funding were the only ones that would be funded in this bill. The courthouses included in this bill is identical to the list of construction projects recommended by the judicial conference as the top priority needs of the courts.  In addition, I am disappointed that this bill does not include much needed funding for the Y2K problems facing the Federal Government.  When this bill came out of the full committee, and funding for Y2K was stripped, I was assured that the leadership understood the urgency of the problem and understood that funding had to be provided.  However, as of October, days after the beginning of the new fiscal year in the 3 months since the funding was stripped from this bill, we still have not dealt with this issue.  I had very much hoped that the bill would contain the contraceptive equity language that passed the House and Senate.  Since it does not, I am offering a motion to recommit this conference report with an instruction to include the House-passed contraceptive language.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
