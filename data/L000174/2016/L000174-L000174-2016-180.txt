President, each year, the Small Business Administration sets aside the first week of May to acknowledge small businesses that are doing extraordinary work and recognizes them during Small Business Week. In March, the SBA announced the slate of 2016 Vermont small business award winners, which included three tremendous businesses from Lamoille County. The award winners included the Small Business Person of the Year, Tom Stearns of High Mowing Seeds; Woman-Owned Business of the Year, Debbie Burritt of Sweet Crunch Bakeshop & Catering; and Young Entrepreneur of the Year, Caleb Magoon, of Power Play Sports.  In Vermont, we place a high value on small businesses. They make up the backbone of our economy and the heart and soul of our communities. I am incredibly proud of the three Lamoille County businesses being recognized both because of their hard work and entrepreneurial spirit, but also because they represent a true cross section of the Vermont economy.  Vermonters share an inherent bond with our State's natural resources. Our State prides itself on our strong agricultural history and the renaissance we are seeing in diversified agriculture and value added food production. For many farmers, this connection starts with their soil and the seeds they plant in the ground. What started as a hobby for Tom Stearns 20 years ago has grown into a dynamic business that is one of the top organic seed companies in the country, now supplying those farmers and home gardeners across the country with the seeds that become the food we feed our families. Part of what sets Vermont businesses apart is their ability to innovate and help define or create new markets. High Mowing has done just this in the seed market--by ensuring that all of their 700 varieties of seeds are both organic and GMO-free--and are among the gold standard in the market. Now they are branching out to experiment with new varieties that will bring new specialty vegetables, herbs, and flowers to the market.  When imagining a startup business, it is common to think of someone working out of their garage. Debbie Burritt of Sweet Crunch Bakeshop & Catering is precisely one of those entrepreneurs. Debbie founded her business in 2001 in her home garage, and since then, her products have received great acclaim and attention. Sweet Crunch baked goods are made from scratch, with no preservatives. It comes as no surprise to this Vermonter that their maple cookies are one of their best selling products. In fact, Sweet Crunch's maple cookies were featured on the Food Network, and Sweet Crunch products can be found in locations across New England and, in fact, the country. I will take a moment of personal pride to note that Debbie's delicious products will be a featured part of the annual Taste of Vermont celebration happening in Washington in a few weeks.  The mountains and valleys that played such a significant role in determining the settlement of Vermont continue to be a significant force in the lives of Vermonters. These resources attract skiers, riders, bikers, paddlers, and many other adventurers to our State both to live and to visit. Naturally all of these outdoor enthusiasts need some place to be outfitted. Power Play Sports has been a staple of the local sporting goods scene for more than 20 years, but was recently purchased by Caleb Magoon. Caleb first worked at Power Play as a teenager and returned to manage the store after living in Boston for a number of years. He has demonstrated a great entrepreneurial vision, consolidating his other business under one roof and opening a new store in Waterbury, VT. This type of passion and growth are qualities we want to encourage in Vermont and deserve recognition.  I want to congratulate these three businesses and all the Vermont businesses who were recognized by the SBA for a job well done. I look forward to their future successes. At this time, I ask unanimous consent that the following article written by Kayla Friedrich of the Stowe Reporter recognizing Tom, Debbie, and Caleb for their awards be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       [From the Stowe Reporter]              Stearns, Burritt, Magoon Win Business Awards                          (By Kayla Friedrich)       Tom Stearns, founder and owner of High Mowing Organic Seeds      in Wolcott, has been named Vermont Small Business Person of      the Year by the federal Small Business Administration.       In addition, two other Lamoille County businesses won major      awards:       Debbie Burritt of Sweet Crunch Bakeshop & Catering Co. in      Hyde Park, Woman-Owned Business of the Year.       Caleb Magoon of Power Play Sports in Morrisville and      Waterbury Sports, Young Entrepreneur of the Year.       For more than 50 years, the federal agency has honored      small businesses for their contributions in their communities      and to the economy.       Stearns was recognized for expanding his company,      increasing sales, hiring more employees and contributing to      the local community.       High Mowing is a farm-based company that produces and      distributes vegetable, flower and herb seeds throughout the      U.S. and Canada. It began in 1996 with just 28 varieties,      produced in Stearns' backyard and packaged in his shed.       First-year sales were $2,000, but what started as a hobby      soon expanded beyond his backyard. By 2001, his business had      grown to the point where Stearns began contracting with other      local farms to grow his seeds, in addition to continuing to      produce on High Mowing's 5 acres.       High Mowing was the first organic company to guarantee all      its seeds are not genetically modified, and 20 years later,      his company is one of the top organic seed companies in the      U.S., with more than 60 employees.       ``It is an honor to accept this award on behalf of all the      work done by our team for the last 20 years since this hobby      was born,'' Stearns said. ``It has been a joy to see it grow      and to know that we are just getting started. I get to do      what I love every day and the work is diverse, challenging      and creative.       ``There is nothing more rewarding than bringing an idea to      life in a way that serves health in the world, and it means a      lot to me to have the work of our team recognized in this      way.''                           Young entrepreneur       In Morrisville, the next town over, a very different      business also won an award from the Small Business      Administration.       Caleb Magoon, 32, owner of PowerPlay Sports in Morrisville,      was named 2015 young entrepreneur of the year.       The annual award is presented to business owners under 35      who have had success in sales, profits, increasing jobs,      having innovative business methods and demonstrating      entrepreneurial potential necessary for economic growth.       PowerPlay Sports was founded in 1995 by John Connell and      Rob Maynard. After bouncing around several downtown      locations, the store eventually landed at 35 Portland St.       Magoon began working at the store at 17. After graduating      from Boston University, where he studied theater design,      Magoon and a few friends established a theater company in      Boston, produced shows, and won the Elliot Norton Awards for      best production three years in a row.       However, as a native of Hyde Park, who grew up hiking,      biking and skiing in the Green Mountains, his passion for      sports led him back to Vermont in 2010. He managed PowerPlay      for a year, then bought the business from Maynard.       Magoon said working in theater helped him learn how to run      a business. He and his friends each worked on different      aspects within their theater company, including advertising,      producing and financing, and learned from each other.       ``If you can do that, business is easy. We learned to be      business people,'' Magoon said.       Last year, Magoon moved his embroidery and screen-printing      business--which was in an adjacent building--into the same      location as his sports gear. He also opened a new store,      Waterbury Sports, with two business partners in Waterbury.                          Woman-owned business       A Hyde Park business also received an award from the Small      Business Administration.       Chef Debbie Burritt, owner and founder of Sweet Crunch      Bakery and Catering Co., was selected as the Woman-Owned      Business of the Year.       The bakeshop portion of the company provides desserts and      wedding cakes to restaurants, resorts and the public. For      catering, the company's goal is making every event unique and      unforgettable.       Burritt has a staff to assist with all the details of event      planning, and will customize menus to meet the individual      needs of clients.       Burritt completed her culinary degree at Newbury College in      Brookline, Mass., in 1987, and worked in Boston and Virginia      before moving back to her native state, Vermont. After      working at Stoweflake Resort and Trapp Family Lodge, both in      Stowe, Burritt decided to venture out on her own in 2001.                          ____________________
