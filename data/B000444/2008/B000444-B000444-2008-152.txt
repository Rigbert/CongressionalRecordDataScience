 President, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. My amendment will support full funding for the COPS Program. It is fully offset by an across-the-board cut in nondefense discretionary spending. The chairman asked whether I would be willing to have a voice vote. At this hour of the night, I would be willing to do about anything he asked me to do, including a voice vote.  I yield the floor.
