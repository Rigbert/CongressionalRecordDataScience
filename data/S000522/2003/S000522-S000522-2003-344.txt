Mr. Speaker, today Mr. Evans of Illinois and I are introducing H.R. 100, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, a bill to restate, clarify and strengthen the legal protections afforded our men and women who serve on active duty in our armed forces. This measure would modernize and rename the current Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act, which has had only a few changes since it was passed during World War II. While it has always provided extremely important legal protections, this law is badly in need of comprehensive redrafting in modern legislative language so that it has a more inclusive name, is easier to understand and interpret, and, most importantly, provides updated protections to reflect the considerable changes in American society that have occurred over the past fifty years.  During the 107th Congress, I introduced H.R. 5111, a bill of the same name. H.R. 100 is a continuation of that initiative, and it may be possible to make more improvements as the new bill is considered. I think the timing of this legislation is important. Our Nation is engaged in a war against terrorism and once again contemplates the possibility of a war to prevent Saddam Hussein from developing weapons intended to terrorize the world. Our servicemembers need to know their elected representatives are working to reduce the burdens they and their loved ones face as they protect our freedoms and way of life. That is why we are introducing this bill on the first day of the 108th Congress.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 100 is intended to make the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act (SSCRA) easier to understand by restating it in plain language, to incorporate generally accepted procedural practices, and to adjust its provisions to developments in American life since 1940. Major improvements to the SSCRA in H.R. 100 would:  1. Expand the SSCRA provision temporarily suspending legal proceedings that may prejudice the civil legal rights of military personnel to include administrative as well as judicial proceedings;  2. Add a section pertaining to Legal Representatives that clarifies the term ``servicemember,'' as used in the Act, and incorporates by reference the concept of a legal representative (the SSCRA is silent on this issue);  3. Establish a 90-day automatic stay of proceedings when military duty requirements materially affect the servicemember's ability to appear in a judicial or administrative proceeding;  4. Clarify the 6 percent interest rate cap by specifying that interest in excess of 6 percent per year is forgiven;  5. Improve eviction protections by precluding evictions from premises occupied by servicemembers for which the monthly rent does not exceed $1,700, rather than the current ceiling of $1,200;  6. Add leases to the provision protecting servicemembers who, prior to entry into military service, have entered an installment contract for the purchase of real or personal property by prohibiting creditors without court action from terminating contracts and repossessing property for nonpayment or breach occurring prior to or during military service;  7. Expand the termination of the real property leases provision by adding a clause stating that, if a servicemember while in military service executes a lease and thereafter receives military orders for a permanent change of station (PCS) move or a deployment order of 90 days or more, the servicemember can terminate the lease by giving the landlord written notice;  8. Clarify that protections regarding taxes on personal property include all forms of property owned by a servicemember or jointly held by a servicemember and the servicemember's spouse;  9. Add a provision that states ``a tax jurisdiction may not use the military compensation of the non-resident servicemember to increase the tax liability imposed on other income earned by the nonresident servicemember or spouse subject to tax by the jurisdiction''; and  10. Include legal services as a professional service specifically named under the provision that provides for suspension and subsequent reinstatement of existing professional liability insurance coverage for designated professionals serving on active duty.  Mr. Speaker, during the last Congress, with Public Law 107-330 we amended the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act to expand coverage to National Guard members activated under title 32 to respond to national emergencies declared by the President. Just in the past few days, some members of the reserve components have received notices that they will be called up for active duty, and Congress should consider more ways to encourage citizen service in the armed forces both by reducing its burdens and increasing its incentives. I hope to do that during this Congress. What was once called the Militia is now the National Guard and the Reserves, but the purpose remains the same, to give the people themselves the opportunity and responsibility to voluntarily contribute their time and talents to the national defense.  Mr. Speaker, I am hopeful that the House will consider and pass H.R. 100 early in this session. Our servicemembers should be uppermost in our minds and in our prayers during these dangerous times. As we depend on them, we must also do our part.                          ____________________
