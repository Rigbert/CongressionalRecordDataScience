Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the generous, path-breaking life of Mrs. Lovey Anna Leavell of Sandusky, Ohio. Lovey passed from this life on Saturday, January 22, 2018 after a short illness. She will be truly missed by her family and friends. Lovey was indefatigable.  Lovey's involvement and commitment to her hometown of Sandusky was known by everyone in the area. Her life of service to her community started at the historic Second Baptist Church where she served as Church Secretary, Choir Director, teacher, and Sunday school superintendent. It is also here where she would meet her husband of 60 plus years, Daniel Leavell.  Once her children became school age and began to attend Sandusky City Schools she became active in the school system as well. When her children were young she worked for the school district as a teacher's aide, bus driver, and served as the Treasurer for the Sandusky Band Parents Association. Her dedication to the Sandusky City schools continued always. Even after her children graduated, she continued her connection to the school by working as a substitute teacher.  Civil rights was a cause that Lovey was committed to as well. As a lifetime member of the Sandusky NAACP, she worked on a number of committees for her local branch. She would help set up meetings at which local politicians would be able to talk about issues dealing not only with civil rights, but also other important issues that impacted the community. Her commitment to civil rights was one of the main reasons she decided to become a realtor. Throughout her life she saw the damage that was being done to minorities due to the effects of redlining. It was her commitment to civil rights that made her want to become a realtor in order to help people obtain the American dream of home ownership.  Lovey Leavell was on a first name basis with every elected official that represented the city of Sandusky, from local up through the federal level. It was not uncommon for politicians and candidates to call her and her husband Dan for advice. She was a lifelong Democrat, her views on politics were perhaps best described by Sandusky Mayor Dennis Murray when he said this about Lovey, ``She was never about the games of partisanship. She believed totally in people and in the core things that Democrats stand for--equality, opportunity and good government.''  Later in life when most people would decide to relax and enjoy their retirement years, Lovey decided it was time for her to get a college degree. She received two degrees, associates and then bachelors, both from BGSU Firelands. Her time at Firelands was filled not only with classwork but also with trips to the United Nations in New York, involvement with student government, and several other groups. The students there would come to know her as ``Grandma Lovey''. During her time there she made such an impression on the students, staff, and faculty she was awarded the Links to Progress Award, the highest honor any person can receive from BGSU Firelands.  During Lovey's final years she served on the Ohio 9th congressional military academy nomination committee in 2015 and 2016. She continued her service on the James McBride Arboretum at BGSU Firelands. She never stopped being a realtor or working for civil rights with the NAACP. Even with her impressive life accomplishments, there was one thing Lovey felt she was missing: a Sandusky High School diploma. It was something she had wanted for more than half a century. In September of 2017 the Sandusky School Board presented her with an honorary high school diploma for her life time commitment to education and her involvement in the community.  Lovey is survived by her husband Dan, children Dan Jr., Doug and Deanna, a number of grandchildren, family, and friends. We offer them our prayers and hope that they comfort in the wonderful memories of this extraordinary woman, our dear friend Lovey. She willbe remembered with affection and gratitude for a lifetime dedicated so affectionately to making our part of the world a fairer and more loving place in which to live.                          ____________________
