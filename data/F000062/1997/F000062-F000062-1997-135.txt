 President, I would greatly appreciate it if my colleagues, the chairman of the appropriations Committee and the ranking member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee would join with me in a colloquy regarding the committee's support for a firefighting demonstrator kit for the UH-60L Black Hawk helicopter for the Army National Guard. It is my understanding that the Army National Guard needs and wants improved capability on its UH-60L Black Hawk helicopter to enable them to more effectively augment the firefighting capabilities of State and local government other Federal agencies.  To this end, the Army is pursuing a cooperative research and development agreement or CRADA with Sikorsky Aircraft to obtain this demonstrator aircraft. Once received, this modified Black Hawk will be used in a 3-month, National Guard, operational suitability test with the Los Angeles County Fire Department.
