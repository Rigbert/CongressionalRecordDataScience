President, on Monday, November 17, 2003, Rhode Island, the judicial community and the entire Nation lost a great jurist, a great scholar and a great man. U.S. District Court Judge Raymond J. Pettine passed away leaving a legacy of protecting individual liberties and constitutional rights.  Judge Pettine was born July 6, 1912 on America Street in Federal Hill, one of the original Italian neighborhoods in Providence; a fitting place to be born for someone who would champion the Constitution that distinguishes this country, America, from so many others. His father was a wigmaker in Italy who immigrated to these shores to find a better life for his family and to make a better America through his labors and his sacrifice. Judge Pettine was sustained and inspired by the example of these good people, his mother and father. The hard work, the great patriotism, the unwavering decency and integrity, the deep respect for both family and faith, the gracious manners of a true gentleman were learned in that home on America Street.  Early in his life, Judge Pettine became fascinated with the law. As achild of eight, he scrawled a note to the Dean of Harvard Law School and asked him, ``What do you have to do to become a lawyer?'' The Dean wrote in reply ``study hard, be a good boy, always have a dream.'' His dream led him to Providence College and Boston University Law School. Soon after graduation, he enlisted in the U.S. Army and served on active duty from 1941 until 1946 rising to the rank of major. He later would be promoted to colonel in the Judge Advocate General Corps as a reservist.  After his discharge from active duty and a brief stint in private practice, Judge Pettine began a 13-year career as a prosecutor in the Rhode Island Attorney General's office. Like every task he undertook, he brought great passion and determination to this endeavor. He understood that our adversarial system of justice requires that both the prosecution and the defense must bring the full weight of the facts and the law before the jury so that they may have the benefit of principled and forceful advocacy to make their decision. He was a tough and uncompromising prosecutor determined to enforce the law.  His reputation and his record as a prosecutor earned him appointment as the Federal Attorney for the District of Rhode Island is 1961. His service as Federal Attorney won him the praise of Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy as one of the nation's top three federal prosecutors. And, this prosecutorial experience would help make him a superb judge upon his appointment to the bench in 1966 by President Johnson. Judge Pettine recognized that the role of a judge was different than that of a prosecutor or defense counsel. He was charged with something greater than simply enforcing the law or arguing for a client. He was charged with seeking justice, that delicate balance that rests on fairness and a keen understanding of the nature of people as well as the tenets of the law. He was also charged in a special way with defending the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. He recognized that our democracy, in his words, ``prizes itself in having a Bill of Rights designed to protect us against despotic abuse of authority by the government.''  There was no more courageous, forceful or principled defender of the Constitution than Raymond Pettine. In 30 years on the Federal bench, and as chief judge from 1971 to 1982, Judge Pettine staunchly guarded the individual rights enshrined in the Constitution. He said the Constitution should be interpreted in ways that ``give meaning to the heart and soul of what it's all about: a kinder, more understanding Constitution that recognizes the disenfranchised, the poor and underprivileged.''  In his rulings, he repeatedly upheld the Bill of Rights' freedom of speech, of religion and of privacy.  Pettine stood by the Constitution and showed courage in the face of controversy when he, a practicing Catholic, ruled that municipalities could not erect Christmas Nativity scenes on public land. As he said, ``I firmly believe this with great conviction: that there has to be a separation between church and State--that one of the saving graces of this country is the fact that we are tolerant of all religions, and even of those who have no religion. And, if we start breaking that down, we are going to be in an awful lot of trouble.''  His wise defense of the Constitution and its protections for individual conscience brought him vicious criticism and personal scorn. But, no amount of criticism or scorn could deter him from his obligation to extend the protections of the Constitution to the poor as well as the powerful, to the maligned as well as the popular.  Judge Pettine embraced his judicial duties with remarkable dedication. He became a scholar of the law and, in order to insulate himself from even the appearance of partiality, he led a life focused on his family and the lonely rigors of his judicial responsibilities. Nevertheless, he cut a dashing figure in Rhode Island. He was a man of great culture and erudition who exuded style and panache.  Judge Raymond J. Pettine has left a remarkable legacy. His wisdom, his integrity and his selfless devotion to the Constitution made him a judge of extraordinary achievement. His love of family and his compassionate regard for all he met made him a man of singular worth. I admire him greatly. He has given us the example and the confidence to carry on. And, his presence will continue to be felt whenever we stand up in defense of the Constitution and in defense of those who are ``disenfranchised, the poor and underprivileged.''  My deepest condolences go out to his family and friends, especially his daughter, Lee Gillespie, his granddaughter, Lauren Gillespie and his son-in-law, Thomas Gillespie.                          ____________________
