. 4521) to direct the Secretary of the Interior to authorize and provide funding for rehabilitation of the Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park, to authorize funds for maintenance of utilities related to the Park, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 4521       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The historic significance of the 52-mile Going-to-the-     Sun Road is recognized by its listing on the National      Register of Historic Places in 1983, designation as a      National Historic Engineering Landmark by the American      Society of Civil Engineers in 1985, and designation as a      National Historic Landmark in 1997.       (2) A contracted engineering study and Federal Highway      Administration recommendations in 1997 of the Going-to-the-     Sun Road verified significant structural damage to the road      that has occurred since it opened in 1932.       (3) Infrastructure at most of the developed areas is      inadequate for cold-season (fall, winter, and spring)      operation, and maintenance backlog needs exist for normal      summer operation.       (4) The Many Glacier Hotel and Lake McDonald Lodge are on      the National Register of Historic Places and are National      Historic Landmarks. Other accommodations operated by the     concessioner with possessory interest and listed on the      National Register of Historic Places are the Rising Sun Motor      Inn and Swiftcurrent Motel.       (5) The historic hotels in Glacier National Park, operated      under concession agreements with the National Park Service,      are essential for public use and enjoyment of the Park.       (6) Public consumers deserve safe hotels in Glacier      National Park that can meet their basic needs and      expectations.       (7) The historic hotels in Glacier National Park are      significantly deteriorated and need substantial repair.       (8) Repairs of the hotels in Glacier National Park have      been deferred for so long that, absent any changes to Federal      law and the availability of historic tax credits, the      remodeling costs for the hotels may exceed the capacity of an      investor to finance them solely out of hotel revenues.       (9) The current season of operation for hotels is      approximately 4 months because the developed areas lack      water, sewer, and fire protection systems that can operate in      freezing conditions, lack building insulation, and lack      heating systems.       (10) The National Park Service Concessions Management      Improvement Act of 1998 is based upon sound principles and is      achieving its basic purposes, but there appear to be selected      instances where the National Park Service may need additional      authority to conduct demonstration projects.       (11) A demonstration project is needed for the repair of      the historic hotels in Glacier National Park.     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.
