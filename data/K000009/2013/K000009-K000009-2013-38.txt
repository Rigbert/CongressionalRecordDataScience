Speaker, I would thank the chairman for that courtesy and just say that I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this particular piecemeal continuing resolution. Hopefully, others will come to their senses and we will be able to vote for a clean continuing resolution, which I think the majority of members of our subcommittee would appreciate, so we can reopen the government and deal with all of the responsibilities that we have under this particular bill and meet our responsibilities to energy and water across this country.  I thank the gentleman for his courtesy, and I hope to reciprocate sometime.
