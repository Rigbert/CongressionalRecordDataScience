Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to mark March 3, 1995, as the retirement day for four employees of the United Steelworkers of America. This is a well-earned day of retirement and celebration for Leonard Hickey, Gayle Cody, R.L. Pace, and Catherine Hatch, whose distinguished careers in the labor movement have made their communities and Nation a better place to work and live.  Leonard ``Len'' Hickey, United Steelworkers of America, district 31, assistant director, was born in Muddy, IL, and began working, in 1952, at the Taylor Pipe Works in 1952. A heater at Bethlehem Steel's Burns Harbor plant, Len was elected as the first president of Local Union 6787. He later served in negotiations with Bethlehem and National Can. Len's [[Page E499]] career is distinguished by his leadership on issues of fair pay, incentives, and winning union members the respect of their employers.  Gayle A. Cody, United Steelworkers of America, district 31, executive secretary to Director Parton, was born in East Chicago, IN, and began working at the Hammond Times. Gayle started her career with the USWA, district 31 in 1966. She served as a USWA secretary under four previous directors prior to becoming the executive secretary under current director, Jack Parton. During her 29 years of service Gayle has been involved in all major areas of USWA activities.  R.L. Pace, United Steelworkers of America, district 31, subdistrict director, was born in Hub, MS, and was drafted into the Army in 1953. In 1956, he moved to Chicago, joined the National Guard's First Battalion 178th Infantry, and began working at Burton Auto Springs. He was promoted to staff representative in 1969, and has held a number of offices--including president, in Local 6183. In 1984, he was appointed to the position of sub-director of sub 4 and graduated from Northeastern Illinois University in 1985.  Catherine Hatch, United Steelworkers of America, district 31, secretary to Director Parton, was born in Gary, IN. She began working at the Post Tribune and started with the Steelworkers in 1954. She worked for both Local 2697 and Local 6787. She started at the district 31 office in 1986 working as secretary in organizing, PAC, and education departments. Catherine has handled the finances and records for district 31 since 1993.  On this special day I offer my heartfelt congratulations. Their families and communities can be proud of the contributions that each individual has made. Their work in the labor movement has made America work. I wish each of them a long, happy, and productive retirement.                          ____________________
