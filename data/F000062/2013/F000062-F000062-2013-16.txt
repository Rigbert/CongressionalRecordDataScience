 President, I am pleased to re-introduce, along with Senator Grassley, the Saving Kids From Dangerous Drugs Act of 2013.  For years, law enforcement has seen drug dealers flavor and market their illegal drugs to entice minors, using techniques like combining drugs with chocolate and fruit flavors, and even packaging them to look like actual candy and soda. This bill would address this serious and dangerous problem by providing stronger penalties when drug dealers alter controlled substances by combining them with beverages or candy products, marketing or packaging them to resemble legitimate products, or flavoring or coloring them, all with the intent to sell the drugs to minors.  Recent media reports demonstrate the need for this legislation. In January of this year, the Drug Enforcement Administration seized THC-laden soft drinks, cookies, brownies, and candy from two phony medical marijuana dispensaries in my home state of California that grossed an estimated $3.5 million annually. The names of the products seized show how the purveyors of these drugs marketed them under names that resembled popular soda and candy products: bottles were labeled ``7 High,'' ``Dr. Feelgood,'' and ``Laughing Lemonade''; cookies and brownies had such names as ``White Chip Hash Brownie'' and ``Reese's Crumbled Hash Brownie''; and candy was named ``Jolly Stones THC Medicated Hard Candies'' and ``Stone Candy.''  Less than two weeks ago, police seized more than 40 pounds of THC-laced candy from a campus apartment at West Chester University, outside of Philadelphia. This candy was vividly colored, in a virtual rainbow assortment--pink, yellow, orange, blue, and red. When college students are peddling these drugs, it is not hard to see how minors can become targets of the operation.  Many recent incidents involve methamphetamine, a drug whose users face a ``very high'' risk of ``developing psychotic symptoms--hallucinations and delusions,'' according to a recent Harvard Medical School publication. A 2007 article in USA Today entitled ``DEA: Flavored meth use on the rise'' stated that ``[r]eports of candy-flavored methamphetamine are emerging around the nation, stirring concern among police and abuse prevention experts that drug dealers are marketing the drug to younger people.'' In March of last year, police in Chicago warned parents about a drug that ``looks and smells like candy,'' called ``strawberry quick'' or ``strawberry meth.'' Because of the drug's similarity to candy, police urged parents to tell their children not to take candy from anyone, not even a classmate.  Regrettably, this is a problem that has persisted for many years, with drug dealers trying various methods to lure kids to try many dangerous drugs. The dealers' logic is simple: the best way to create a life-long customer is to hook that person when he or she is young. According to an Indiana sheriff quoted in a 2007 article entitled ``Fruity meth aimed at kids,'' flavoring a drug like methamphetamine makes it ``more attractive to teens, because it takes away meth's normally bitter taste, and some dealers will tell potential users this meth is safer, and has less side effects.''  That is why the practice of flavoring or coloring drugs to entice youth is so dangerous--it deceives the young customer into believing that he or she is not actually ingesting drugs, or at least not ingesting drugs that are as potent as non-flavored drugs. One in three teens already believes there is ``only a slight or no risk in trying [methamphetamine],'' according to the 2007 National Meth Use & Attitudes Survey. When you flavor methamphetamine or market it as candy or soda, the number of teens who believe that the drug is not harmful is surely higher.  The size and sophistication of some of these operations is particularly alarming. In March of 2006, DEA discovered large-scale marijuana cultivation and production facilities in Emeryville and Oakland, California. Thousands of marijuana plants, and hundreds of marijuana-related soda, candy, and other products were seized from the drug dealers' facilities. The products were designed and packaged to look like legitimate products, including an item called ``Munchy Way'' candy bars.  Similarly, in March of 2008, Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, agents seized cocaine near Modesto, California, that was valued at $272,400; a significant quantity had been flavored like cinnamon, coconut, lemon, or strawberry. After that raid, one DEA agent stated that ``[a]ttempting to lure new, younger customers to a dangerous drug by adding candy `flavors' is an unconscionable marketing technique.''  I completely agree. That is why we need to act now to stop those who alter drugs to make them more appealing to youth.  Under current federal law, there is no enhanced penalty for a person who alters a controlled substance to make the drug more appealing to youth. Someone who alters a controlled substance in ways prohibited by the legislation we are introducing today would be subject to an additional penalty of up to ten years, in addition to the penalty for the underlying offense. If someone is convicted of a second offense that is prohibited by the act, that person would face an additional penalty of up to 20 years.  This bill sends a strong and clear message to drug dealers--if you flavor or candy up your drugs to try to entice our children, there will be a very heavy price to pay. It will help stop drug dealers from engaging in these activities, and punish them appropriately if they don't.  The Senate passed a similar version of this legislation in the 111th Congress, but it was not considered in the House. This year, I am pleased to have the support of many of the leading national law enforcement organizations as we try to get this bill over the finish line: the Major Cities Chiefs Association, the Fraternal Order of Police, the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the Major County Sheriffs' Association, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National HIDTA Directors Association,and the National District Attorneys Association have endorsed the legislation. They are on the front lines working to keep these drugs out of our communities, and I am proud to have their support.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1686       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Saving Kids From Dangerous      Drugs Act of 2013''.     SEC. 2.
