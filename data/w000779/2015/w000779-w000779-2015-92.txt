President, today I am introducing the Oregon Wildlands Act to designate hundreds of miles of Oregon Rivers as Wild and Scenic, to protect thousands of acres of beautiful Oregon lands as National Recreation Areas, and to expand Wilderness for some of Oregon's most treasured areas.  Oregon is a unique State and Oregonians take pride in the many natural treasures throughout our diverse landscape. From the Oregon Coast to the high desert of Eastern Oregon, our State boasts some of the most beautiful scenery, varied ecosystems, and unmatched outdoor recreation opportunities in the nation. Protecting these lands and rivers ensures that they will be treasured for generations to come. Oregon's rivers and landscapes are also home to threatened and endangered species, old-growth trees, and delicate ecosystems that deserve the highest protections.  Enjoying the outdoors is in Oregonians' DNA--across the State, opportunities to get outside and enjoy Oregon's treasures bring in visitors from all over the world and make residents proud to call Oregon home. Protecting the lands and waters that support recreation is also an investment in our rural economies. In Oregon alone, the tourism industry employed more than 100,000 Oregonians during 2014 and generated $10.3 billion for the State's economy. Nationwide, outdoor recreation supports a $646 billion industry. Ensuring that visitors have pristine rivers to fish and float on, wilderness areas to hike in, and recreation areas to explore is a guaranteed way to make certain that visitors will return year after year.  All told, the bill designates approximately 118,000 acres of Recreation Areas, approximately 250 miles of Wild and Scenic Rivers, and over 86,600 acres of Wilderness. Each area offers significant opportunities for recreation and ecosystem protections.  The protections in this bill highlight some of Oregon's most environmentally significant areas, such as Devil's Staircase near the Oregon Coast. Devil's Staircase is the epitome of Wilderness in Oregon--it is rugged, pristine, and remote, with hikers following elk and deer trails to navigate the rugged terrain. My bill would protect approximately 30,540 acres as wilderness and 14.6 miles of Wasson Creek and Franklin Creek, which run through the Devil's Staircase area as Wild and Scenic Rivers. Devil's Staircase is home to the most remarkable old-growth forest on Oregon's Coast Range, where giant Douglas-fir, cedar, and hemlock support threatened and endangered species habitat, such as marbled murrelets and Northern Spotted Owls.  My proposal would expand the Wild Rogue Wilderness by approximately 56,100 acres and include an additional 125 miles to the incomparable Wild and Scenic Rogue River. The Rogue is world-renowned as a premier recreation destination for rafting and fishing, with its free flowing waters starting at Oregon's Crater Lake National Park and emptying into the Pacific Ocean. Along the way, the Rogue River flows through a diverse landscape and its cold waters are the perfect habitat for salmon--the river is home to runs of Coho, spring and fall Chinook, and winter and summer Steelhead. By protecting the Rogue River and its tributaries we are protecting the fish and wildlife that depend on clean, healthy water. Additionally, the Wilderness expansion would protect the habitat for bald eagles, osprey, spotted owls, bear, elk, and cougars.  In addition, my proposal designates approximately 35.2 miles of the Elk River and 21.3 miles of the Molalla River as a new recreational, scenic, and wild rivers, and withdraws 19 miles of the Chetco River, one of the most endangered rivers in the country, from mineral development. By protecting hundreds of miles of Wild and Scenic Rivers, as well as the lands that surround those rivers, my proposal ensures that important wildlife habitat can thrive, that Oregon's treasured recreation destinations remain scenic and pristine, and that Oregonians continue to have clean sources of drinking water.  I am pleased to be joined on this bill by my colleague from Oregon Senator Jeff Merkley who has worked closely with me over the years to protect Oregon's natural treasures.                          ____________________
