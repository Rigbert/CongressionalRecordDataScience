President, it is easy for both elected officials and commenters to refer to all knowledge as residing outside the beltway.  It has been my experience that some of the greatest wealth of knowledge, experience, and ability represented in this country is inside the beltway. Rarely enough does that talent get recognized.  An exception, is the recognition in the Washington Post of the extraordinary talent of Anne Dibble Jordan. Mrs. Jordan was the cochair of the last Presidential inaugural of the 20th century.  It is my privilege to know this extraordinary woman and her noted husband, Vernon Jordan. Anne Jordan is one of those people who makes it possible for Washington and our Government to present a face worth seeing by the rest of the world. In fact for those who have come to know her, it is hard to think of anything she could not achieve.   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 18, 1997]The Woman Behind the Curtain--Monday Is Ann Jordan's Big Day--You Won't                          Even Know She's There                          (By Roxanne Roberts)       It's the middle of a news conference at the Foreign Press      Center. Ann Dibble Jordan and Terry McAuliffe, the chairmen      of the Presidential Inaugural Committee sit on a stage      briefing dozens of reporters from around the world about the      seemingly endless list of celebratory events.       McAuliffe pops off with enthusiastic sound bites, jumping      in to answer virtually every question. Jordan sits quietly,      carefully offering written remarks. If there were an award      for the inaugural chairman with the lowest possible profile,      Jordan would win--hands down.       Her face is dominated by her red-framed glasses. She wears      simple gold jewelry, a plain black dress and carriers an      inexpensive Le Sportsac purse.       ``I hate interviews. I hate publicity,'' she says later.      ``My husband tells me I'm the most private person he knows.''       Herein lies the intriguing contradiction of Ann Jordan: a      very private person who lives a very public life. Her husband      is the much-respected and much-feared lawyer Vernon Jordan,      power broker extraordinaire. The Jordans are on the A-list of      every Washington social event, serve on numerous corporate      and charitable boards, and count a vast number of powerful      people as friends--including the president and first lady.      Indeed, Vernon Jordan is a favorite golfing buddy of Bill      Clinton; the couples are so close they had Christmas Eve      dinner together.       Shortly after the election, Clinton picked up the telephone      and called Ann Jordan. ``I need your help,'' said the      president, who asked that she accept the unpaid co-     chairmanship. It was an offer she couldn't refuse.       ``I didn't think I'd be doing all of this, I tell you,''      she says. ``I thought I'd just be a worker. But I had worked      in the previous inaugural, and I'd seen a lot of the things      that probably would be helpful in doing this.''       Jordan, 62, came aboard just before Thanksgiving, with an      eye to creating a structure that was ``open and honest.''      This year, there are no fund-raising responsibilities, so the      job of chairman is primarily one of oversight: meetings every      morning to go over all the plans, defining goals, and signing      off on major decisions and expenditures. When a final      decision had to be made, said committee members, it was often      Jordan whose judgment carried the day.       And there are also news conferences--Jordan's least      favorite part of the job.       ``She doesn't crave the limilight,'' says co-chairman      McAuliffe. ``She's just been a joy to work with. She and I      have not had one disagreement in the past two months.''       ``I am absolutely, totally impressed and in awe of her,''      says Harold Ickes, who is coordinating inaugural plans from      the White House. ``It is not unusual for someone of her      social position to take the job and be sort of honorary about      it, sweeping in and out. She does not throw her weight      around, although--God knows--she knows everyone in     Washington and can get anyone on the phone at the drop of a      hat.''       Of course, in Washington one expects the customary      compliments from colleagues. But the genuine exuberance for      Jordan goes beyond the predictable.       Jordan describes herself as ``quite low-key . . . I know      what my limits are.'' She doesn't mention the gala with      Princess Diana or her vacations on Martha's Vineyard with the      Clintons. She doesn't bring up the dinner at her home four      years ago--the president-elect's first Washington party--or      the fact that she sent cyclamens to all her neighbors      apologizing for any inconvenience it may have caused.       Her official biography for the inauguration is three short      paragraphs.       ``She's raised in the old school,'' says events planner      Carolyn Peachey, a close friend. ``Your name is in the      newspaper three times: born, married, died.''       Hillary Rodham Clinton calls her ``a woman of many      talents.'' Jordan's work on the inaugural committee, says the      first lady, highlights her ``wonderful'' organizational and      management skills. ``What I think I like most about her is      her warm friendship, coupled with her marvelous sense of      humor.''       Vernon Jordan is not in the habit of discussing his      personal life with the press. But he is downright effusive      when it comes to his wife of 10 years.       ``She's smart, independent, caring, loyal,'' he says. ``She      is my best friend in the world.'' The suggestion that she is      shy produces Jordan's famed booming laugh. ``She's not shy at      all. She just keeps her own counsel. And she is in many ways      a very private person, which is one of her more admirable      qualities.''       Nonetheless, it is difficult to be an entirely private      person if one happens to be married to one of the most      influential--and socially gregarious--men in the city. It is      ``just nonsense,'' says Jordan, to even suggest that his wife      was asked to chair the inauguration because of his friendship      with the first couple.       ``I think she did this out of a sense of duty and      responsibility,'' he says. ``She loves to make things work      right. And it's an honor, and I think she views it that      way.''       There is, in fact, a long history of public service in her      life. She was born in Tuskegee, Ala., one of five children of      a surgeon who ran the only hospital in the city that treated      black patients.       Jordan attended prep school and then went to Vassar, where      she was one of four black students. She was so fair-skinned      that she had to tell classmates she was black. ``You didn't      want to have a conversation where you had to get up and walk      out,'' she says. ``Once you say it, you don't have to tell      many more. It goes around quickly.''       She took graduate courses in social work at the University      of Chicago and later taught there and served as head of      social services at the university's medical center. She      married, had four children and divorced 11 years later. She      stayed in Chicago, working full time and raising her      children. ``I was used to running my own life,'' she says.       That life was shaken by the 1981 death of a daughter in a      car accident. ``I think it makes you just stop and relive      your life,'' says Jordan. ``I mean, you think about your life      and what's important, and it changes it.''       Her other children--now in their thirties--were grown when      she married Vernon in 1986. They had met years earlier      while both were working with the Urban League. His first      wife, Shirley, died of multiple sclerosis in 1985.       ``What I like best about him is when we sit down to talk--     he's very interested,'' she says. ``And he's fun to be with.      He's totally unpredictable.''       And Vernon Jordan says, ``When I want to get it straight, I      talk to Ann.''       And then he adds the one-liner of every clever husband:      ``The fact is that I married up.''       Her new husband brought to the marriage the lifestyle of a      wealthy, powerful man in this town. ``It was sort of nice to      enjoy the free time of living in Washington,'' she says. ``It      also allowed me to pursue a lot of my own interests. I was      very busy. And Vernon is a very--to say the least--he's      fun.''       Being married to Jordan also brought invitations to every      important social event in Washington, including the state      dinner for South African President Nelson Mandela. ``It was      one of the great thrills of my life,'' she says. Mandela told      her ``a very funny story about his life after he got out of      prison. . . . I'm certainly grateful for those kinds of      opportunities.''       Aside from inaugural duties, Jordan's time these days is      devoted to her five grandchildren (all under 5 years old),      volunteering in the White House social office and serving on      various boards: WETA, Sasha Bruce Youthworks, the Kennedy      Center and the Child Welfare League of America.       She has settled into her life in the nation's capital, but      her affection for Chicago is such that she travels there as      often as once a month. ``It's a wonderful city and people      don't realize it.'' Washington, she says, ``is a wonderful      city of live in. I mean for living purposes, it's very easy      to get around, the weather's wonderful, and very interesting      people here.''       It was Jordan who pushed to include residents of Washington      in more inaugural activities. She is most excited about the      public events on the Mall, and she was instrumental in      bringing ``King,'' the musical tribute to Martin Luther King      Jr., to the celebration.       ``I love the fact that it can be open,'' she says. ``Not      only just free events, but very well done free events.'' She      hopes to find time to drop by the children's tent for the      storytellers: ``My grandchildren want to see it.''       Jordan doesn't mention the glamour of the inaugural balls.      She'll attend five or six, wearing a dress that she's had a      long time. ``I wear it every year to the Kennedy Center,''      she says. ``It's a black velvet dress that has--I don't know      what you'd call 'em, not rhinestones but sort of sparkly''      decor on the shoulders. ``I love the dress.''       On that night, her husband says simply that he'll be doing      ``whatever she says.''       And afterward, instead of all the exclusive after-ball      parties, you might see the inaugural chairman celebrating at      . . . McDonald's.       ``That's my favorite,'' she says. ``A Quarter-Pounder      without cheese. Then they have to cook it fresh. We're there      all the time.''                          ____________________
