President, during Senate consideration of Senate amendments 3615 and 3617, I was attending a memorial service for the father of my Rhode Island colleague, Representative James Langevin. Had I been present for these votes I would have voted against the motion to table amendment No. 3615, and I would have voted to waive the point of order against amendment No. 3617.                          ____________________
