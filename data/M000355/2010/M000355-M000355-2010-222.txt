 President, first, I would like to note a couple important anniversaries today. It was on this day in 1775 that the Continental Army was established and George Washington appointed to lead it. So June 14 has gone down in history not only as the beginning of America's defeat of the British Army but also as the birth of the greatest Army the world has ever known.
