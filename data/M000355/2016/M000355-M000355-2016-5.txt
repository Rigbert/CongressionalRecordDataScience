 Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that there now be 80 minutes of debate on the House message to accompany S. 612; that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the cloture motion with respect to the House message. I further ask that if cloture is invoked, all time postcloture be considered expired, the motion to concur with further amendment then be withdrawn, and the Senate vote on the motion to concur in the House amendment. I further ask that following adoption of the House message, H. Con Res. 183 be considered and agreed to. Further, I ask that 60 minutes be under the control of Senator Boxer or her designee and that the mandatory quorum call be waived.
