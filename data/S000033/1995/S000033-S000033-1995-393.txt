 Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the $40 billion bailout of Mexico and in very strong opposition to President Clinton's effort to circumvent the congressional process. At a time when this country has a $200 billion deficit and when Members of Congress are proposing cutbacks in Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans programs, and nutritional programs for hungry children, it is absurd to put $40 billion of American taxpayers' money at risk in an unstable Mexican economy and an unstable Mexican political system.  If large banks and Wall Street investment houses want to purchase Mexican bonds at high interest rates, they have every right in the world to do so. But these big money interests do not have the right to be bailed out by Government when their investments turn sour.                          ____________________
