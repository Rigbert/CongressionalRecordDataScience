Speaker, I rise to thank John Wright for over thirty-three years of outstanding service to this House in a number of administrative and support roles. He lives in Maryland's Fifth District, and I am proud to represent him here in Congress.  John--or ``Turk,'' as he is known among his friends and colleagues--is retiring after having lent his skills and talents to the House of Representatives for over three decades. He began his career in January 1982 under House Clerk Benjamin Guthrie as an Office Equipment Attendant for Office Equipment Services. After working in the labor room and the House drapery shop, John was promoted to Inventory Control Clerk in 1987, where he was responsible for the delivery, movement, and pickup of equipment for House offices. He also assisted with Congressional transitions, an arduous process entailing the physical movement of inventory and systems for hundreds of Member offices within a one-month timeframe.  Eager to learn and to help with other duties, John was promoted in 2000, to the position of Vendor Management Counselor for Office Systems Management under the Chief Administrative Officer (CAO). His assignments included the payment of purchase orders for equipment, supplies, and furniture for Members, Committees, Officers, and support offices of the House of Representatives. He processed a large volume of payments swiftly and formed long-lasting friendships with his customers and coworkers. He offered his services and expertise during each Congressional transition by volunteering extra time to assist with office moves.  John's enthusiasm, experience, and resources made him an invaluable asset to the CAO organization, providing excellent customer service to Members and staff. His outgoing personality, positive attitude, and sense of humor have endeared him to many colleagues and friends. John greeted everyone with a big smile and referred to his coworkers as family. He shares his pride in serving the House just as his late mother, Tillie Wright, did during her illustrious forty-one year career in the catering division of the House Restaurant system.  I congratulate John and I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking him for his distinguished service to the House and the nation it serves. I wish him and his family all the best as John begins this new chapter in his life.                          ____________________
