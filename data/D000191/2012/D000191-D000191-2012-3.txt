  Mr. DeFAZIO. A group of millionaire and billionaire CEOs that call themselves the Campaign to Fix the Debt is visiting the White House today. According to Lloyd Blankfein, the CEO of Goldman Sachs, Social Security must be reduced.  It didn't contribute anything to the debt or deficit, but that's his solution. What did he say? He said:       You're going to have to do something undoubtedly to lower      people's expectations of what they're going to get.  He went on to say:       Social Security wasn't devised to be a system that      supported you for a 30-year retirement after a 25-year      career.  Well, his arrogance is only exceeded by his ignorance. That's not the way Social Security works, Mr. Blankfein. It's an earned benefit. I know you wouldn't know about that because you've got $11.9 million in your retirement fund, and you're not too worried about the future of Social Security. The average benefit is $14,000 a year, and most people work 45 years to get that. And you say they need to lower their expectations?  Well, I've got a solution for you: pay Social Security tax on all your income, and you too will get a benefit. And you might need it because we're not bailing out Wall Street again.                          ____________________
