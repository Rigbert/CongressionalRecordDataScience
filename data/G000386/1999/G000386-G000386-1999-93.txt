 President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending consent regarding the Wellstone amendment be temporarily suspended and the Senate now resume the Dodd amendment No. 2532, and there be 10 minutes remaining and a vote occur on or in relation to the amendment at the end of that time. I further ask consent that the Senate then turn to the Wellstone amendment and that all debate but 1 hour equally divided be used during the session of the Senate today. I also ask that 1 hour of debate occur on Wednesday, November 17, and a vote occur on or in relation to the amendment at the conclusion or the yielding back of time, provided that a vote in relation to the Wellstone amendment occur prior to a cloture vote, if cloture is filed on the bill.
