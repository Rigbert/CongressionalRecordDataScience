  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, the motion to table involves two amendments. It is important my colleagues understand what is involved. The current PEPFAR Program focuses on 15 countries with epidemics of AIDS and malaria. The current authorization allows them to work in 110 countries in which they are working now, but the focus has been part of making this program successful.  My amendment would limit the focus of the current PEPFAR bill on the Senate floor to the authorized countries in the first bill so the money is not spread all over the world to countries that do not need it as much as Africa and the others.  But the other amendment, and the reason this is being tabled, is it proposes that we do not allow PEPFAR funds to be used through the U.N. Global Fund for forced abortions and forced sterilization in China and other countries. The law of the land in this country is that our taxpayer dollars are not used for forced abortion. All this does is make sure the money in PEPFAR does not end up with programs like they have in China that force abortions.  I encourage my colleagues to vote no against tabling these amendments so we would be sure that PEPFAR funds are being used where and the way that they are intended to be used.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
