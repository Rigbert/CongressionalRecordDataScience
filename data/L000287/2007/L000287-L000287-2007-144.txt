Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Dr. McDermott, the gentleman from Washington, for yielding me this time and bringing this piece of legislation to us.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 6, the CLEAN Energy Act. More than ever, we need to get our priorities straight. We need to stop helping big oil companies and start helping American families. We need to stop dancing while Rome burns and reverse the damage we have done to our environment.  Oil companies are making record profits. They do not need our help. They are not begging for our help. They made more than $96 billion in profit in 2006. It is time to end the massive giveaway to the big oil companies. It is time to end corporate welfare. It is time to take taxpayer dollars back from the oil companies and use them to solve our energy problems.  It is our moral duty to use other forms of energy, and H.R. 6 starts us on this process. Global warming can no longer be ignored. 2006 was one of the hottest years on record. The weather in Washington during the last 2 weeks has felt more like the warm weather I am used to in my home State of Georgia. We need to act now. H.R. 6 will start to address global warming and turn back the damage we are doing to our environment.  We also need to reduce our reliance on Middle Eastern oil. It is our duty to help inspire the next generation of energy technology: hydrogen, ethanol, wind and other sources of energy that will not harm our little planet, our little spaceship we call Earth.  The American people need relief from energy costs. By improving our energy efficiency, we can all spend less to light and heat our homes and fuel our cars with gas.  Do the oil companies really deserve tax breaks while they earn billions of dollars in profits? It is time to end this waste. It is not right. It is time to start improving our quality of life. The people have a right to know what is in the air we breathe and what is in the water we drink. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 6.
