Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Andy Jacobs and in strong support of H.R. 1057 to designate the new postal facility in Indianapolis, IN, in his honor.  I had the pleasure of serving with Andy since I was first elected to join the Indiana's congressional delegation in 1984 and until his retirement last year. In that time, I grew to appreciate him not only as one of the most thoughtful, honorable, and well-spoken legislators to serve in this body, but also as a good friend.  Because Andy's sons, Andy and Steve, and my boys, John and Tim, were born about the same time, we were able to share the mutual joys of fatherhood together. And whether our advice to each other on raising sons would be considered problematic or not, we always took pleasure about talking about Johnko and Bronko.  While I will certainly miss his wisdom and sense of humor in these Halls, I find comfort in the knowledge that Andy is enjoying his retirement with his wife, Kim Hood, and by watching his two boys grow up to be mature young men.  Since Andy was first elected to represent Indiana's 10th Congressional District in 1964, he made his mark as a tremendous legislator. As a new Member of Congress, he helped to write the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and led the House debate to help get the United States out of Vietnam.  A member of the Committee on Ways and Means, Andy quickly developed an expertise in Medicare and Social Security, and he worked tirelessly to help improve the lives of millions of America's senior citizens.  During his tenure in the House, he served as chairman of both the Subcommittee on Health and the Subcommittee on Social Security of the Committee on Ways and Means. In Andy's capacities he was able to strengthen and enhance the Social Security Administration and Medicare programs.  Widely recognized as one of the most fiscally conservative Members of Congress, Andy was an early proponent of a balanced budget constitutional amendment, and took the lead on other efforts to reduce Federal spending. He also was legendary among Members of the House for his own frugality, regularly returning tens of thousands of dollars to the U.S. Treasury from his personal office's funds.  Mr. Speaker, in his own unique way, Andy Jacobs came to epitomize what is good and right about serving his fellow citizens as a Member of Congress. Indeed, with his interests ranging from poetry to Social Security, the people of Indiana and the rest of the Nation are fortunate to have had Andy Jacobs representing their interests in the United States Congress.  Passage of H.R. 1057 is only a small token of our appreciation, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
