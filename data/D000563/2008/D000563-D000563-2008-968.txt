President, today we were able to achieve a milestone in the Senate session and reach an overall agreement to have all remaining amendments to FISA debated tomorrow and Monday. There will be no rollcall votes tomorrow or Monday; however, Senators should be prepared to vote when the Senate convenes at 10 a.m. on Tuesday.                          ____________________
