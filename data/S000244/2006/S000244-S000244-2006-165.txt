Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, there is one issue that really has not come up in this debate, and that is the immunity that is given in this bill to the people who are interrogating the enemy combatants.  We need to pass this bill so that interrogations can start up again because without the immunity, anybody who is hired by the United States Government to try to find out whom they are planning on blowing up next would be subject to a lawsuit that would be filed by some attorney that would claim that he was representing the public interest.  This is a protection bill for the interrogators. It is something that is needed, and that is another reason why it ought to pass.  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I will not take up any more time speaking about why I oppose this bill. I spoke at length during the House debate, and nothing has changed over the past 48 hours to make me believe that undermining our history, values and constitutional commitment to human rights, civil rights, the rule of law, due process and judicial review is the right thing to do.  Instead, I would like to submit for the Record the views of others in the face of this monumental mistake this Congress is making in submitting to the demands of an imperial White House.  I ask unanimous consent to submit into the Record the following materials:  1. Resolution Condemning Torture by the Conference of Major Superiors of Men;  2. A September 22, 2006 letter from human rights organizations to the U.S. Senate regarding the Military Commissions Act of 2006;  3. September 28, 2006 New York Times editorial, ``Rushing Off a Cliff;'' and  4. ``Questions for the Interrogators,'' Commentary by Fareed Zakaria, September 25, 2006, Newsweek                     Resolution Condemning Torture       CMSM condemns torture in all its forms regardless of      putative justification, and encourages support and help for      victims of torture throughout the world, but especially in      areas under the control of the United States Government.       Rationale: Jesus' death and resurrection revealed the      infinite value of each human being in God's eyes. [Cf. Mt      5:44-48; 10:29-31] Torture is a denial of that value.
