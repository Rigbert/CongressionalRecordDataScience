Speaker, I rise today to note the recent retirement from the Blade newspaper of Toledoan William Brower, a well-known veteran journalist of more than 50 years. He became one of the first African-Americans to work for a daily Ohio newspaper. He was officially recognized this year by the National Association of Black Journalists for its Lifetime Achievement Award.  A Wilberforce University graduate, Bill began his journalism career writing for African-American newspapers in Baltimore, Philadelphia, and Richmond, VA. Hired by Toledo's newspaper, the Blade, in 1947, Bill began as a general assignment reporter. Throughout his years with the paper, he held positions covering the police, courthouse, and education beats, and served as an assistant city editor, news editor, and associate editor. His thrice weekly editorial columns covering politics, sports, and topics of interest to African-Americans became a staple of Toledo area news.  In 1951 he was awarded a Pulitzer Prize nomination for a series of stories written after a tour of 20 States on the conditions experienced by black Americans. In 1971, he followed that story with a series, ``Black America--20 Years Later,'' which won him a Robert F. Kennedy Foundation Award.  The National Association of Black Journalists paid tribute to Bill for his ``pioneering spirit'' and ``outstanding leadership in the media industry.'' The same can be said of his role in our community. Bill Brower and his wife Edna have been groundbreakers, trailblazers, and voices of strength and wisdom, in Toledo. Their dedication to one another continues to be a source of inspiration to us all. His writings have often required us to look at a reflection of ourselves, and in doing so, have moved us to become better people.  No commendation could sum up fully half a century of journalistic achievement. But in honoring his life, the Blade has endorsed independent thought and the advancement of our common heritage as a free people.                          ____________________
