It is a sad day when the President must remind the Senate of its constitutional responsibilities to consider and confirm qualified nominees to the Federal bench. I regret that we have reached this point.  The President's address was an important one. I hope that his call for an end to the intimidation, the delay, the shrill voices of partisanship will be headed. I will continue to do all that I can to defend the integrity and independence of our federal judiciary and to urge the Republican leadership of the Senate to move forward promptly on judicial nominations. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the text of the President's address be printed in the Record at the end of my statement.
