Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that the remainder of the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute be printed in the Record and open to amendment at any point.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Wisconsin?  There was no objection.  The text of the remainder of the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute is as follows:     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration      should aggressively pursue actions and reforms directed at      reducing institutional costs, including management      restructuring, facility consolidation, procurement reform,      personnel base downsizing, and convergence with other defense      and commercial sector systems.       (2) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration must      reverse its current trend toward becoming an operational      agency, and return to its proud history as the Nation's      leader in basic scientific, air, and space research.       (3) The United States is on the verge of creating and using      new technologies in microsatellites, information processing,      and space launches that could radically alter the manner in      which the Federal Government approaches its space mission.       (4) The overwhelming preponderance of the Federal      Government's requirements for routine, nonemergency manned      and unmanned space transportation can be met most      effectively, efficiently, and economically by a free and      competitive market in privately developed and operated space      transportation services.       (5) In formulating a national space transportation service      policy, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration      should aggressively promote the pursuit by commercial      providers of development of advanced space transportation      technologies including reusable space vehicles, single-stage-     to-orbit vehicles, and human space systems.       (6) The Federal Government should invest in the types of      research and innovative technology in which United States      commercial providers do not invest, while avoiding      competition with the activities in which United States      commercial providers do invest.       (7) International cooperation in space exploration and      science activities serves the United States national      interest--       (A) when it--       (i) reduces the cost of undertaking missions the United      States Government would pursue unilaterally;       (ii) enables the United States to pursue missions that it      could not otherwise afford to pursue unilaterally; or       (iii) enhances United States capabilities to use and      develop space for the benefit of United States citizens; and       (B) when it does not--       (i) otherwise harm or interfere with the ability of United      States commercial providers to develop or explore space      commercially;       (ii) interfere with the ability of Federal agencies to use      space to complete their missions;       (iii) undermine the ability of United States commercial      providers to compete favorably with foreign entities in the      commercial space arena; or       (iv) transfer sensitive or commercially advantageous      technologies or knowledge from the United States to other      countries or foreign entities except as required by those      countries or entities to make their contribution to a      multilateral space project in partnership with the United      States, or on a quid pro quo basis.       (8) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and      the Department of Defense can cooperate more effectively in      leveraging their mutual capabilities to conduct joint space      missions that improve United States space capabilities and      reduce the cost of conducting space missions.

TITLE II--INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds that--       (1) the development, assembly, and operation of the      International Space Station is in the national interest of      the United States;       (2) the significant involvement by commercial providers in      marketing and using, competitively servicing, and      commercially augmenting the operational capabilities of the      International Space Station during its assembly and      operational phases will lower costs and increase benefits to      the international partners; and       (3) when completed, the International Space Station will be      the largest, most capable microgravity research facility ever      developed. It will provide a lasting framework for conducting      large-scale science programs with international partners and      it is the next step in the human exploration of space. The      United States should commit to completing this program,      thereby reaping the benefits of scientific research and      international cooperation.     SEC. 202. COMMERCIALIZATION OF SPACE STATION.       (a) Policy.--The Congress declares that a priority goal of      constructing the International Space Station is the economic      development of Earth orbital space. The Congress further      declares that free and competitive markets create the most      efficient conditions for promoting economic development, and      should therefore govern the economic development of Earth      orbital space. The Congress further declares that the use of      free market principles in operating, servicing, allocating      the use of, and adding capabilities to the Space Station, and      the resulting fullest possible engagement of commercial      providers and participation of commercial users, will reduce      Space Station operational costs for all partners and the      Federal Government's share of the United States burden to      fund operations.       (b) Reports.--(1) The Administrator shall deliver to the      Committee on Science of the House of Representatives and the      Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the      Senate, within 90 days after the date of the enactment of      this Act, a study that identifies and examines--       (A) the opportunities for commercial providers to play a      role in International Space Station activities, including      operation, use, servicing, and augmentation;       (B) the potential cost savings to be derived from      commercial providers playing a role in each of these      activities;       (C) which of the opportunities described in subparagraph      (A) the Administrator plans to make available to commercial      providers in fiscal year 1998 and 1999;       (D) the specific policies and initiatives the Administrator      is advancing to encourage and facilitate these commercial      opportunities; and       (E) the revenues and cost reimbursements to the Federal      Government from commercial users of the Space Station.       (2) The Administrator shall deliver to the Committee on      Science of the House of Representatives and the Committee on      Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, within      180 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, an      independently-conducted market study that examines and      evaluates potential industry interest in providing commercial      goods and services for the operation, servicing, and      augmentation of the International Space Station, and in the      commercial use of the International Space Station. This study      shall also include updates to the cost savings and revenue      estimates made in the study described in paragraph (1) based      on the external market assessment.       (3) The Administrator shall deliver to the Congress, no      later than the submission of the President's annual budget      request for fiscal year 1999, a report detailing how many      proposals (whether solicited or not) the National Aeronautics      and Space Administration received during calendar year 1997      regarding commercial operation, servicing, utilization, or      augmentation of the International Space Station, broken down      by each of these four categories, and specifying how many      agreements the National Aeronautics and Space Administration      has entered into in response to these proposals, also broken      down by these four categories.     SEC. 203. SPACE STATION ACCOUNTING REPORTS.

Such plan      shall include--       (1) decision points for removing or replacing those      elements if the International Space Station is to be      completed by the end of the calendar year 2002;       (2) the cost of implementing each such decision; and       (3) the cost of removing or replacing a Russian Government      critical path element after its decision point has passed,      if--       (A) the decision at that point was not to remove or replace      the Russian Government element; and       (B) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration later      determines that the Russian     Government will be unable to provide the critical path      element in a manner to allow completion of the International      Space Station by the end of calendar year 2002.       (c) Monthly Certification on Russian Status.--The      Administrator shall certify to the Congress on the first day      of each month whether or not the Russians have performed work      expected of them and necessary to complete the International      Space Station by the end of calendar year 2002. Such      certification shall also include a statement of the      Administrator's judgment concerning Russia's ability to      perform work anticipated and required to complete the      International Space Station by the end of 2002 before the      next certification under this subsection. Each certification      under this subsection shall include a judgment that the first      element launch will or will not take place by October 31,      1998.       (d) Decision on Russian Critical Path Items.--The President      shall provide to Congress a decision, by August 1, 1997, on      whether or not to proceed with permanent replacement of the      Service Module, and each other Russian element in the      critical path for completing the International Space Station      by the end of calendar year 2002. The President shall certify      to Congress the reasons and justification for the decision      and the costs associated with the decision. Such decision      shall include a judgment that the first element launch will      or will not take place by October 31, 1998, and that the      stage of assembly complete will or will not take place by      December 31, 2002. If the President decides, after August 1,      1997, to proceed with a permanent replacement of the Service      Module or any other Russian element in the critical path, the      President shall certify to Congress the reasons and      justification for the decision to proceed with permanent      replacement, and the costs associated with that decision,      including the cost difference between making such decision by      August 1, 1997, and any later date at which it is made. Such      certification shall include a description of the costs of      removing or replacing each critical path item, and the      schedule for completing the International Space Station by      the end of calendar year 2002.       (e) Astronauts on Mir.--The National Aeronautics and Space      Administration shall not place another United States      astronaut on board the Mir Space Station, without the Space      Shuttle attached to Mir, until the Administrator certifies to      Congress that the Mir Space Station meets or exceeds United      States safety standards.
