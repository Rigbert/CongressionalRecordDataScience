Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. I will not take a long time.  Obviously, those of us who strongly supported that resolution are extremely disappointed. We consider this to be a historic moment in the House because of that ruling, and the fact that we were just silenced without even the ability to debate for 1 hour in the full House.  Now, I understand the gentleman and the majority control the committees, and I understand what happened in the committees, and why we do not have a bill on this floor today.  But let me say to the gentleman I encourage you on your efforts in the committees. We do not expect anything of consequence to result from that. But I know that there are Members along with myself on both sides of the aisle who are very concerned about this historic move of the House to silence the Membership on the largest use of unappropriated dollars in the history of this Nation.
