 President, I rise to speak on another subject, but I think it is appropriate for me to respond to the Senator from Delaware only in a general way, not to the specific points he made.  I do take very seriously his efforts at what we call welfare reform, moving people from welfare to work, because not only as Governor did he demonstrate leadership in that area, but in the short time I have served with him in the Senate, he has talked with me frequently about various aspects of welfare, and I know he has been working with others on his side of the aisle, as well as Republicans.  I hope to be able to give fair consideration to the propositions about which he has spoken this morning.  (The remarks of Mr. Grassley pertaining to the introduction of S. 1440 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')                          ____________________
