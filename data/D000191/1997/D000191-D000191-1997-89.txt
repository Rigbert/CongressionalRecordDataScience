  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the Democrats would tax the very air we breathe, or so the Republicans would have us believe. But the Republicans would actually take oxygen from the lungs of senior citizens and disabled around this country to finance tax cuts for the wealthy. And I am not making this up.  The measure before us today cuts the payments for oxygen and oxygen equipment by 20 percent and freezes payments through 2002 to save $1.6 billion. Eighty percent of the cuts in the bill before us today come from Medicare, not to reform Medicare and stabilize its finances, but to finance tomorrow's bill, the bill that will extend tax cuts to the wealthy, tax cuts that will average $27,132 a year for families that earn over $400,000. And for those families who earn $25,000 they will average zero, nothing.  Is this fair? I do not think so.                          ____________________
