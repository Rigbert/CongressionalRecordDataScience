Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my opposition for H.R. 4 and to encourage my colleagues to vote against this bill.  Ronald Reagan once said the nine most terrifying words in the English language are, I am from the government, and I am here to help you. Our seniors should say, thanks, but no thanks.  H.R. 4 is certainly a solution in search of a problem. The Medicare drug benefit is a quantitative success. Millions of seniors now have prescription drug coverage through Medicare part D and over 86,000 beneficiaries in my district alone are saving money while enjoying greater access to the prescription drugs they need.  Competition has reduced monthly premiums and empowered seniors to make their own choices about drug plans. On average, seniors saved $1,200 off the cost of their prescription drugs last year. In fact, 80 percent of recipients nationwide report high satisfaction with the new program.  Actuaries for the Congressional Budget Office, the ultimate scorekeeper in Congressional spending, as well as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, both predict that H.R. 4 will produce no savings. At the same time, strong competition has lowered drug plans, the bids, by 10 percent, for 2007. Overall, analysts estimate that part D will cost $373 billion less over the next 10 years than initially expected.  Mr. Speaker, if passed, this bill would allow the Federal Government to get into the medicine cabinets of millions of Medicare beneficiaries across the country. Part D is working. The changes proposed in this bill would create tremendous uncertainty among seniors who are benefitting from this successful program. This bill is nothing but a veiled attempt at national health care that could end up driving up costs, reducing seniors' access to much-needed prescription drugs and serving as a downfall of community pharmacies.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this bill.
