 President, on January 25, I introduced S. 149, the FISA Sunsets Extension Act of 2011 to extend the three expiring provisions of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act--the authority to conduct, subject to court order, so-called ``roving wiretaps,'' ``lone wolf'' surveillance, and collection of business records. S. 149 was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.  Today, I am reintroducing that legislation with a new, identical bill. This new bill, just as S. 149 would do, will extend these three authorities, otherwise set to expire on February 28, to December 31, 2013. The bill will also change the expiration date of the intelligence collection authorities provided in the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 so they, too, last until the end of 2013.  The sole purpose of reintroducing the measure is to begin the process under Senate rule XIV to place the reintroduced extension bill on the Senate calendar. The three provisions of FISAwill sunset in a little more than 3 weeks. One of those weeks is a congressional recess. By placing the extension bill on the Senate calendar, we will, at least, be one procedural step closer to acting.  On January 28, Attorney General Eric Holder and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper wrote to urge Congress to grant a reauthorization of sufficient duration to provide intelligence and law enforcement agencies with reasonable certainty and predictability concerning the tools available to them.  The FISA sunsets have most recently been the subject of two short-term extensions: a 2-month extension from December 31, 2009 to February 28, 2010, and then a 1-year extension from that date to February 28, 2011.  In their January 28 letter, the DNI and the Attorney General expressed their concern about the devolution of FISA sunsets ``into a series of short-term extensions that increase the uncertainties borne by our intelligence and law enforcement agencies in carrying out their missions.''  The letter states that ``S. 149, the FISA Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, would avoid these difficulties by reauthorizing the three expiring provisions until December 2013, together with the provisions of Title VII of FISA that are currently scheduled to sunset next year. We look forward to working with you to ensure the prompt enactment of this or similar legislation.''  Yesterday, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees also received a classified report from the Attorney General and the DNI on the important intelligence collection made possible by authority that is subject to the approaching sunset. The Department of Justice and the Office of the DNI have asked for our assistance in making this classified report available, in a secure setting, directly and personally to any Member of the Senate. We did so for a similar report a year ago when Congress considered the last sunset extension.  Each Senator is invited to read this classified report in the Intelligence Committee's offices in 211 Hart Senate Office Building. The Attorney General and DNI have offered to make Justice Department and intelligence community personnel available to meet with any Member who has questions. Our Intelligence Committee staff is also prepared to meet with Members. Vice Chairman Chambliss and I are sending a Dear Colleague letter to each Senator conveying this invitation.  In concluding, I call upon my colleagues in the Senate and House to heed the Attorney General's and DNI's concern about the uncertainty created by short-term extensions. The 3-year extension that my legislation proposes will give our law enforcement and intelligence officials the tools and certainty they need in protecting the Nation. It will align the several sunsets so that Congress can review FISA more comprehensively in 2013. In setting that date Congress will wisely be separating that review of FISA from the debates of a presidential election.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Hon. John Boehner,     Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     Democratic Leader, U.S. House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leaders Reid, Pelosi, and      McConnell:       In the current threat environment, it is imperative that      our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have the tools      they need to protect our national security. The Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Act (``FISA'') is a critical tool      that has been used in numerous highly sensitive intelligence      collection operations. Three vital provisions of FISA are      scheduled to expire on February 28, 2011: section 206 of the      USA PATRIOT Act, which provides authority for roving      surveillance of targets who take steps that may thwart FISA      surveillance; section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, which      provides expanded authority to compel production of business      records and other tangible things with the approval of the      FISA court; and section 6001 of the Intelligence Reform and      Terrorism Prevention Act, which provides the authority under      FISA to target non-United States persons who engage in      international terrorism or activities in preparation      therefor, but are not necessarily associated with an      identified terrorist group (the so-called ``lone wolf''      amendment).       It is essential that these intelligence tools be      reauthorized before they expire, and we are committed to      working with Congress to ensure the speedy enactment of      legislation to achieve this result.       We also urge Congress to grant a reauthorization of      sufficient duration to provide those charged with protecting      our nation with reasonable certainty and predictability. When      Congress enacted the PATRIOT Act, it included a three-year      sunset on these authorities. While we welcome Congressional      oversight into the use of these tools, Congress did not      contemplate that this sunset would devolve into a series of      short-term extensions that increase the uncertainties borne      by our intelligence and law enforcement agencies in carrying      out their missions.       S. 149, the FISA Sunsets Extension Act of 2011, would avoid      these difficulties by reauthorizing the three expiring      provisions until December 2013, together with the provisions      of Title VII of FISA that are currently scheduled to sunset      next year. We look forward to working with you to ensure the      prompt enactment of this or similar legislation.       The Administration also remains open to proposals that      enhance protections for civil liberties and privacy while      maintaining the effectiveness of these and other intelligence      collection tools.       Finally, we are prepared to provide additional information      to Members concerning these critical authorities in a      classified setting, as we did in connection with the previous      reauthorization of the expiring provisions.       The Office of Management and Budget has advised us that      there is no objection to this letter from the perspective of      the Administration's program.           Sincerely,                                                 James R. Clapper,                                Director of National Intelligence.                                              Eric H. Holder, Jr.,                                                 Attorney General.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mr. Grassley, and Mr. Chambliss):  S. 291. A bill to repeal the sunset provisions in the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 and other related provisions and permanently reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act; read the first time.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 291       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
