Chairman, I thank the ranking member for yielding me time and for his work on this issue, and I thank the gentleman from Florida (Chairman Mica) too.  I believe the chairman and I share an opinion, and that is that the greatest threat to today's civil aviation is explosive devices. There are several ways in which the explosive devices can get on the plane. One is cargo. We have already talked about the inadequacies there. This bill does nothing to deal with that. Another is baggage. I had hoped this bill would deal with that.  In fact, our committee dealt with it. We doubled the annual investment in in-line automated baggage screening, but, strangely enough, that money disappeared before this bill came before us today. That is unfortunate.  When you link that to the fact that the majority party has arbitrarily limited the number of screeners we can have so they are not even utilizing the inadequate trace equipment and other things they have, and we have reports on how sometimes they cannot even operate the machines they have because they do not have enough people, we are not investing in the people and we are leaving gaps.  The bill does improve and begins to deal with the threat of suicide bombers and carry-on explosives, $30 million a year. We should do more. The Transportation Security Administration's own expert on this says it is a mature technology, we are using it to guard nuclear plants, military bases, we do not need to be testing it, we need to deploy it.  The $30 million a year in this bill is a lot better than what the administration is doing today. It is still not enough. We should have a goal of immediately purchasing and deploying explosives detection for all passenger checkpoints and carry-on bags, doubling at least the budget for in-line explosive screening, and doing a bottom-up survey to find out how many people we really need to do this job. It has never been done.  We had an arbitrary cut in the number of screeners. 11,000 were cut by the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations of jurisdiction. For what reason? Well, he said because we are going to buy new equipment. Then, of course, he did not fund the new equipment.  So we are leaving extraordinary gaps in our Nation's security. This is of tremendous concern and it should be, to the traveling public. This is a foolish place to save money. We can borrow money to give tax cuts to millionaires and billionaires. We can borrow to build infrastructure and provide security in Iraq. But we cannot afford the investment we need in the United States of America to do the things we need to do to make flying safe and prevent a tragedy like happened in Russia, which we have been predicting for more than 2 years is likely to happen here.                              {time}  1815  I wish that we could get the vote on a bill that would do all of those things. They will not let us do it.
