Chair, I have serious concerns with the amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Stivers).  This amendment authorizes the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to create a new grant program, the Asset Military Partnership Pilot Program, to fund air traffic control towers and airport infrastructure at airports that support DOD missions.  Although I recognize that both the FAA and DOD have a shared interest in keeping our national airspace safe and secure, it is unclear how this new program achieves these goals. To my knowledge, neither the FAA nor DOD has requested that Congress authorize this new program. Moreover, the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure is in the midst of developing a bill to reauthorize the FAA and its programs. Neither the gentleman from Ohio nor anyone else has put forward the need for this program. Instead, it is added on the Floor as an amendment with a possible 10 minutes of debate. In fact, the amendment is likely to be adopted without any debate. That is not how we should be legislating in this body.  Why are we doing this? All indications are that this amendment is simply an attempt to fund specific airport projects at Rickenbacker International Airport, a civil-military public airport near Columbus, Ohio.  I do not object to the FAA offering grants to assist an airport in improving infrastructure or repairing or replacing an air traffic control tower. In fact, a process for this already exists. The Airport Improvement Program (AIP) has a grant set-aside of approximately $15 million a year under the Military Airport Program (MAP) for the conversion of military airfields to civil or joint-use airports. Over the past 30 years, Rickenbacker Airport has received more than $62 million of AIP and MAP funds for airport-related projects.  Although Rickenbacker has long participated in the AIP and MAP programs, this amendment creates a new program with the same objectives as existing programs but its own pot of money. It authorizes grants of up to $2.5 million for three airports, which must meet very specific criteria. It requires the FAA and DOD to each contribute one-half of the funds. The purpose appears simply to create an additional source of funding for a particular airport.  As this bill moves to Conference with the other body, I am hopeful that the Committees on Armed Services will take a hard look at whether creating this new program is in the Nation's best interests and how it relates to the existing AIP and MAP programs.  Mr. Chair, without a better explanation, I do not see why Congress would create another airport program.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.                    Announcement by the Acting Chair  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings will now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 114-112 on which further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:  Amendment No. 2 by Mr. Polis of Colorado.  Amendment No. 5 by Mr. Brooks of Alabama.  Amendment No. 15 by Mrs. Walorski of Indiana.  Amendment No. 16 by Mr. Smith of Washington.  Amendment No. 17 by Mr. McCaul of Texas.  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the time for any electronic vote after the first vote in this series.                  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Polis  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a recorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which the noes prevailed by voice vote.  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.                             Recorded Vote  The Acting CHAIR. A recorded vote has been demanded.  A recorded vote was ordered.  The Acting CHAIR. This is a 15-minute vote.
