 President, I rise to introduce the Criminal Gang Abatement Act of 2001, a bill to give law enforcement additional tools to fight the scourge of gang violence.  This legislation builds on and improves the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, the first Federal statute to address directly the problem of criminal gangs.  I am delighted that Senator Hatch joins me in introducing this bill and I thank him for his hard work in helping develop the legislation.  I know that this bill will be familiar to my colleagues. It is similar to legislation that was included in the Juvenile Justice bill in the last Congress.  The Senate passed the Juvenile Justice bill overwhelmingly. Unfortunately, it did not become law. That is why Senator Hatch and I are introducing this gang legislation separately.  Mr. President, I care deeply about solving the problem of gang violence and crime.  I worked extensively on this problem when I was Mayor of San Francisco and have long considered it one of my top priorities.  I am often struck by how vicious gang crimes can be, and how damaging they are to the victims and to the surrounding community.  Let me give you a couple of recent examples from my own home city of San Francisco.  Last year, gang members tried to rob a passerby with an assault weapon from their car. When the victim resisted, the gang shot the victim 17 times. The victim survived but will never walk again.  Only two months before that assault, two rival gangs had a shootout in San Francisco's Mission District. An innocent bystander was caught in the crossfire and shot through both legs.  A brave eyewitness gave law enforcement the name of one shooting suspect, who was then arrested. The gang then tracked down the witness, put a 9 millimeter automatic to his head, and threatened to kill him for cooperating with the police.  I would like to explain how this legislation will help deter and punish such crimes, and why Congress should act quickly to pass it.  First, the bill makes it a separate Federal crime to recruit persons to join a criminal street gang with the intent that the recruit participate in a Federal drug or violent crime.  The penalty is up to 10 years in jail. The offender can also be held responsible for reimbursing the government's costs in housing, maintaining, and treating the minor until the age of 18.  The purpose of this provision is to deter criminal gang recruitment.  Such recruitment has continued to grow and grow every year.  Even while crime has been dropping generally, the number of criminal gangs and gang members has spiraled.  The 1999 Justice Department survey of gangs, the most recent available, found that the number of gang members has increased 8 percent just from 1998.  In fact, the growth of criminal gangs in the country over the last 20 years, has been extraordinary.  Twenty years ago, the gang problem was centered in Los Angeles and Chicago. Today, though, there are gangs in all 50 States and the District of Columbia.  In 1980, there were gangs in 286 jurisdictions. Today, they are in over 1500 jurisdictions.  In 1980, there were about 2000 gangs. Today, there are over 26,000 gangs.  In 1980, there were about 100,000 gang members. Today, there are 840,500 gang members.  Let me read from a Department of Justice publication entitled ``The Growth of Youth Gang Problems in the United States: 1970-1998'' that was just released a few months ago:       Youth gang problems in the United States grew dramatically      between the 1970's and 1990's, with the prevalence of gangs      reaching unprecedented levels. The growth was manifested by      steep increase in the number of cities, counties, and States      reporting gang problems. Increases in the number of gang      localities were paralleled by increases in the proportions      and populations of localities reporting gang problems. There      was a shift in regions contains larger numbers of gang      cities, with the Old South showing the most dramatic      increase. The size of the gang-problem localities also      changed, with gang problems spreading to cities, villages,      and counties smaller in size than at any time in the past.  And as gangs have increased, so have all forms of youth violence.  That is because youngsters who join gangs are much more likely to commit violent crimes than similarly situated youngsters who are not in gangs.  Research shows, for example, that young people who join gangs are four to six times more likely to engage in criminal behavior when they are gang members than when they are not.  And it is also because gang members are responsible for a large proportion of violent crime. They don't just commit one violent crime but many.  One study found, for example, that gang members, who were 14 percent of sample, reported committing 89 percent of all serious violent offenses in the area.  Enacting this bill would give law enforcement an important tool to deter criminal gang recruitment, thus reducing gang crime.  The bill makes it a separate Federal crime to use a minor to commit a Federal violent crime, and sets penalties for doing so.  The penalty is twice the maximum term that would otherwise be authorized for the offense or, for repeat offenders, three times the maximum penalty.  The bill also increases the minimum penalties for persons using minors to distribute drugs.  Currently, both first-time and repeat offenders can receive a minimum of only a year.  Under the bill, a first-time offender will receive at least 3 years and a repeat-offender will receive at least 5 years.  These provisions are intended to deter gangs from recruiting youngsters to commit crimes.  Gangs recruit minors because they know that children are often not fully aware of the consequences of their actions.  Gangs also know that, if the child is caught, he or she will probably receive lighter punishment than an adult.  Gangs commonly start new recruits as drug lookouts or runners.  Once the youngsters get older, gangs encourage them to engage in more violent activity.  And young recruits often commit violent crimes to gain the gang's respect and improve their status within the gang.  I am very troubled by the fact that many youngsters, some barely in their teens, are lured into gangs by older children and start a life of crime even before they start high school.  One study of eighth graders in 11 cities, found that 9 percent were currently gang members and 17 percent said that they had belonged to a gang at some point in their lives.  According to California law enforcement, the average age of a new gang recruit in Los Angeles is 11, in San Diego 12-15, and in San Francisco 15.  In Alabama, it is 12-14. In Virginia, it is 13. In Ohio, it is 16.  In gangs such as the Latin Kings, babies of gang members are considered gang members from birth.  A South Carolina law enforcement officer told us that he recently looked into the case of one six-year-old child, who was found wearing typical gang attire, holding a gun and beeper, and tattooed with the phrase ``Thug Life.''  I believe that we need to punish gang recruitment of children very severely. This bill would do that.  The bill increases the penalties for gang members who commit drug or violent crimes and who use physical force to tamper with witnesses, victims, or informants.  The bill also generally directs the U.S. Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for criminal street gang members who commit crimes.  There is a strong link between gangs and drugs. By fighting gangs, we can help reduce the supply of illegal drugs in this country.  According to the 1999 Justice Department gang survey, almost half of youth gang members sell drugs to generate profits for the gang.  A survey of California law enforcement by my staff found that gang members in the States' largest cities are involved in 50 to 90 percent of all drug offenses.  This is confirmed by gang members themselves.  For example, in one survey of State prison inmates who were gang members, almost 70 percent said that they had manufactured, imported, or sold drugs as a group.  Worse, the DOJ 1999 gang survey found that about 40 percent of youth gangs are ``drug gangs,'' that is, gangs organized specifically to traffic in drugs.  This is an increase from the 34 percent reported for 1998. The increase was particularly pronounced in rural areas.  There is also a close correlation between gangs and violent crimes.  For example, gangs commit about half of all violent crimes in California's major cities. In some areas of Los Angeles, such as South Central and East Los Angeles, gangs account for 70-80 percent of all violent crimes.  The increased penalties in this legislation will help reduce drug and violent crimes, including threats against witnesses and informants.  Currently, under the Federal gang statute, 18 U.S.C. 521, gang members can only get enhanced penalties for gang crimes that involve drugs or violence.  The penalty is up to an additional 10 years in jail.  This bill allows enhanced penalties for crimes that are often committed by gang members but which may not involve drugs or violence.  These crimes include distributing explosives, kidnapping, extortion, illegal gambling, money laundering, obstruction of justice, and illegally transporting aliens.  The crimes act as ``predicate'' crimes permitting an additional charge of participating in a criminal gang.  The Federal gang statute is sort of similar in design to the criminal RICO statute. That statute permits an additional RICO charge where the defendant, as part of his or her criminal conspiracy, commits two or more predicate acts.  The bill ensures that, for gang offenses, offenders can get a sentence up to 10 years greater than the maximum term they receive for their most serious offense. They can also forfeit property derived from the offense.  The offenses added by the bill are those commonly pursued by gangs.  One study of gangs in various counties, for example, found that: 44-67 percent of gang members reported being involved in auto theft; 34-48 percent in intimidating or assaulting witnesses or victims; and 4-10 percent in kidnapping.  Other studies have found that gang extortion is also common.  Drug gangs commonly use booby traps, that sometimes include explosives, to protect their cultivation or manufacturing sites from law enforcement authorities and the public.  Numerous gangs illegally launder their illicit drug profits.  These include Russian and West African criminal gangs as well as street gangs such as the Bloods, Crips, Gangster Disciples, and Latin Kings.  Alien smuggling and harboring is especially prevalent in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Boston, and New York.  Among the worst offenders is the brutal Fuk Ching gang.  After a police crackdown in New York, law enforcement reports that Fuk Ching began to branch out to Chicago, Maryland, and western Pennsylvania.  The changes made by this legislation should help reduce drug and violent crimes.  The Travel Act allows Federal prosecutors to charge certain interstate crimes such as extortion, bribery, and arson, and for business enterprises involving gambling, liquor, drugs, or prostitution.  This statute was passed in 1961 with Mafia-related criminal activity in mind.  This legislation amends the Travel Act to enable law enforcement to respond more effectively to the growing problem of organized, highly sophisticated, and mobile criminal street gangs.  While the Travel Act currently allows law enforcement to target some activities, such as drug trafficking, the list is not complete.  The list needs to be updated to better reflect interstate crimes often committed today by gang members.  Thus, the bill amends the Travel Act to include crimes such as drive-by shootings, serious assaults, and intimidating witnesses.  In California's largest cities, gang members commit 80-100 percent of all drive-by shootings and around 50 percent of violent crimes.  The numbers are similar for other states as well.  A recent survey in Illinois, for example, found that 50 percent of the jurisdictions in that state face a serious problem of gang drive-by shootings.  The bill also increases the maximum penalty for most violations of the Travel Act from 5 years to 10 and authorizes the death penalty for certain homicides that technically do not qualify as murder.  Defendants who commit violent crimes covered by the act or who try to intimidate or retaliate against witnesses can get 20 years. And, if they kill someone, they can get life imprisonment or the death penalty.  The bill should ensure that prosecutors can use the Travel Act to act against crimes caused by the new Mafia: organized street gangs.  The bill would increase the penalties for using or attempting to use physical force to intimidate witnesses.  The bill would increase the maximum punishment for this crime from 10 years to 20 years.  The bill would also create a crime of threatening to use physical force against a witness.  Such a threat could be punished by up to 10 years.  Violent crimes by gang members often go unpunished because witnesses are afraid that, if they testify, gangs will kill or hurt them or their families.  For example, the Philadelphia deputy district attorney testified before Congress in 1997 that a very high number of the unsolved homicides in Philadelphia were unsolved due to gang intimidation.  One study found that intimidation of victims and witnesses was a major problem for 40-50 percent of prosecutors.  A similar study determined that witness intimidation occurs in at least 75 percent of violent crimes in gang-dominated neighborhoods.  Recently, DOJ estimated that witness intimidation has been growing since 1990 and is now a factor in about two-thirds of violent crimes committed in some gang-dominated neighborhoods.  The bill would help deter and punish victim and witness intimidation by gangs.  The bill amends several criminal statutes to address violent crimes frequently or typically committed by gangs.  Crimes include carjacking, assault, manslaughter, racketeering, murder-for-hire, and fraud against the United States.  These amendments make it easier for prosecutors to prove these crimes by eliminating or modifying the intent requirement for the crimes or by increasing the penalties for violations.  The bill permits the Attorney General to designate high intensity interstate gang activity areas, HIIGAs, and authorizes $100,000,000 for each of 7 years for these task forces.  These provisions are modeled after similar provisions creating high intensity drug trafficking areas, HIDTAs.  HIDTAs are joint efforts of local, State, and Federal law enforcement agencies whose leaders work together to assess regional drug threats, design strategies to combat those threats, and to develop initiatives to implement the strategies.  HIDTAs are based on an equal partnership between different law enforcement agencies.  HIDTAs integrate and synchronize efforts to reduce drug trafficking.  They eliminate unnecessary duplication of effort and maximize resources.  And they improve intelligence and information sharing both within and between regions.  HIDTAs are necessary because drug trafficking tends to be ``headquartered'' in certain areas of the country, from which it spreads to other areas.  Moreover, drug traffickers have been highly organized and developed sophisticated interstate and international operations.  However, both of these points are true for criminal gangs generally.  While criminal street gangs flourish in certain urban areas such as Los Angeles and Chicago, they typically also use these cities as bases to invade more rural locales.  In addition, many gangs have gone from relatively disorganized groups of street toughs to highly disciplined, hierarchical ``corporations,'' often encompassing numerous jurisdictions.  The Gangster Disciples Nation, for example, developed a corporate structure.  They had a chairman of the board, two boards of directors, one for prisons and one for streets, governors, regents, area coordinators, enforcers, and ``shorties,'' youth who staff drug-selling sites and help with drug deals.  From 1987 to 1994, this gang was responsible for killing more than 200 people. Moreover, one-half of their arrests were for drug offenses and only one-third for nonlethal violence.  In 1996, the Gangster Disciples Nation and other Chicago-based gangs were in 110 jurisdictions in 35 States.  Southern California-based gangs are equally well-dispersed.  In 1994, gangs claiming affiliation with the Bloods or Crips, both of whom are based in Southern California, were in 180 jurisdictions in 42 states.  As a result of such dispersal, violent criminal gangs can be found in rural areas.  For example, Washington State law enforcement told us about one gang member that they traced from Compton, California to San Francisco, then to Portland, Seattle, and Billings, Montana, and finally Sioux Falls, South Dakota.  The Justice Department has found that, from the 1970s to the 1990s, the number of small cities or towns, those with populations smaller than 10,000, with gangs increased by between 15 to 39 times.  This is a larger relative increase than for cities with populations larger than 10,000.  In the 1999 National Youth Gang Survey, law enforcement estimated that almost 1 of every 5 of gang members in their area were migrants from another area.  In fact, 83 percent of respondents said that the appearance of gang members in more suburban or rural areas was caused by migration of gangsters from central cities.  Gang members even travel to countries such as Mexico and El Salvador.  The Logan Heights Gang in San Diego, for example, is currently employed by the Arellano-Felix Cartel to help guard drug shipments in Mexico.  The Logan Heights Gang has also been linked to the killing of Cardinal Juan Pasados-Ocampo in Guadalajara in 1993.  As gangs have spread into rural areas and become more interstate and international, it has become more important than ever to ensure coordination between local, state, and federal law enforcement to combat gangs.  The HIDTA program has worked well and provides a good model for the high intensity interstate gang activity area program that this bill creates.  I expect that the high intensity interstate gang activity area program will help reduce the gang problem in the same way that the HIDTA program has helped reduce the drug problem.  The bill also allows serious juvenile drug offenses to be Armed Career Criminal Act predicates.  This provision ensures that career criminals do not escape higher sentences just because their most serious drug offenses occurred when they were a juvenile.  Under this legislation, all armed career criminals will get up to the maximum statutory maximum of 15 years in jail, time which may be not reduced through suspension or probation.  The bill makes the gang statute consistent with the Supreme Court's recent opinion in Apprendi v. United States.  In that decision, the Supreme Court held that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum must be treated as an element of the offense.  This decision has caused some problems for law enforcement in prosecuting gang crimes.  This is because the Federal gang statute has been treated as a sentence enhancement statute, not a stand-alone criminal offense statute.  Before Apprendi, prosecutors would charge gang members with drug and other crimes.  If they were convicted, they would then ask the court to enhance the gang member's sentence because of his or her membership in a criminal gang.  On many occasions, this sentence enhancement would go beyond the statutory maximum for the underlying offenses.  In light of Apprendi, this bill rewrites federal law to ensure that prosecutors can charge gang members for a separate offense under the federal gang statute.  In doing so, the bill also makes it easier for prosecutors to charge gang members by reducing the membership requirement for a criminal gang from a minimum of five members to a minimum of three members.  The bill authorizes $50,000,000 for 5 years to make grants to prosecutors' officers to combat gang crime and youth violence.  This money will help implement this legislation by ensuring that law enforcement has the money to prosecute gang members.  This is important legislation.  I urge my colleagues to act quickly to pass it.  I would also ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and an accompanying section-by-section description be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1236       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Pursuant to its authority under section 994(p) of title 28,      United States Code, the United States Sentencing Commission      shall amend the Federal sentencing guidelines to eliminate      the policy statement in section 5K2.18 of the guidelines      regarding section 521 of title 18, United States Code, and      instead provide a base offense level in chapter 2 of the      guidelines for offenses described in sections 521 and 522 of      title 18, United States Code, that reflects the seriousness      of these offenses. Such guidelines shall include an      appropriate enhancement (which shall be in addition to any      other adjustment under chapter 3 of the Federal Sentencing      guidelines) for any offense described in section 521 if the      offense was both committed in connection with, or in      furtherance of, the activities of a criminal street gang and      the defendant was a member of the gang at the time of the      offense.

SEC. 12. AUTHORITY TO MAKE GRANTS TO PROSECUTORS' OFFICES TO                    COMBAT GANG CRIME AND YOUTH VIOLENCE.       (a) In General.--Section 31702 of subtitle Q of title III      of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994      (42 U.S.C. 13862) is amended--       (1) in paragraph (2), by striking ``and'' at the end;       (2) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the end and      inserting a semicolon; and       (3) by adding at the end the following:       ``(5) to allow the hiring of additional prosecutors, so      that more cases can be prosecuted and backlogs reduced;       ``(6) to provide funding to enable prosecutors to address      drug, gang, and youth violence problems more effectively;       ``(7) to provide funding to assist prosecutors with funding      for technology, equipment, and training to assist prosecutors      in reducing the incidence of, and increase the successful      identification and speed of prosecution of young violent      offenders; and       ``(8) to provide funding to assist prosecutors in their      efforts to engage in community prosecution, problem solving,      and conflict resolution techniques through collaborative      efforts with police, school officials, probation officers,      social service agencies, and community organizations.''.       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--Section 31707 of      subtitle Q of title III of the Violent Crime Control and Law      Enforcement Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 13867) is amended to read      as follows:     ``SEC. 31707. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.       ``There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this      subtitle, $50,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2002 through      2006.''.     SEC. 13. NOTIFICATION AFTER ARREST.       Section 5033 of title 18, United States Code, is amended by      striking ``arresting officer'' each place it appears in the      first and second sentences and inserting ``arresting officer      or another representative of the Attorney General''.                                  ____        Criminal Gang Abatement Act of 2001--Section-by-Section                               Section 1       The short title of the bill is the ``Criminal Gang      Abatement Act of 2001.''                               Section 2       Adds section 522 to Chapter 26 of title 18, which prohibits      any person from traveling in, or using any facility in,      interstate commerce to recruit or retain a person as a member      of a criminal street gang with the intent that the recruited      or retained individual participate in an offense described in      section 521(c) of the title. Section 521(c) offenses are      Federal felonies involving controlled substances for which      the maximum penalty is not less than five years, a Federal      felony crime of violence involving the use or attempted use      of physical force, and conspiracies to commit either of these      two offenses.       The penalties for violating the section include      imprisonment for not more than 10 years, fines, or both. In      addition, if the individual who was recruited is a minor, the      defendant may be held liable for any costs incurred by the      Federal, State, or local government for housing, maintaining,      and treating the minor until the age of 18.       The term ``criminal street gang'' is amended in section 5      of this bill.                               Section 3       Prohibits the intentional use of minors to commit a crime      of violence or to assist in avoiding detection or      apprehension for such an offense. Any first-time offender      shall be subject to twice the maximum term of imprisonment      and fine that would otherwise be authorized for the offense.      For any second or subsequent conviction under the section,      the offender is subject to three times the maximum penalty.                               Section 4       Amends 21 U.S.C. 861 to increase the minimum penalty to      three years for any first-time offender who employs or uses a      minor to distribute, receive, or avoid detection of a      controlled substance in violation of the title or title III.      The minimum punishment for a repeat offender is increased to      five years.                               Section 5       Amends 18 U.S.C. 521 to transform it from a penalty      enhancement provision to an offense and, in so doing, also      redefines the term ``criminal street gang'' to reduce the      membership requirement from ``5 or more persons'' to ``3 or      more persons.'' The rewriting of section 521 is in response      to Apprendi v. United States, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), in which      the Supreme Court held that any fact that increases the      penalty for a crime beyond the statutory maximum, other than      for a prior conviction, must be treated as an element of the      offense.       The proposed amendment establishes ten predicate offenses      in subsection c. Those offenses are: a Federal felony      involving a controlled substance for which the maximum      penalty is not less than 5 years; a Federal felony crime of      violence; an offense under newly created section 522; an      offense under section 844, (importation, manufacture,      distribution, and storage of explosive materials; an offense      under sections 875 or 876, kidnapping and extortion; an      offense under section 1084 or 1955, illegal gambling; an      offense under section 1956, money laundering, to the extent      it relates to an offense involving a controlled substance; an      offense under chapter 73 of title 18, obstruction of justice;      an offense under section 274(a)(1)(A), 277, or 278 of the      Immigration and Nationality Act, illegal transportation of an      alien; and a conspiracy, attempt, or solicitation to commit      an offense described above.       Any person who commits one of the predicate offenses while      participating in a criminal street gang with the intent of      promoting the felonious activities of the gang, and who has      been convicted within the past five years of one of the      predicate offenses, faces an additional 10-year consecutive      sentence for the predicate crime. The bill also provides for      the forfeiture of any property derived directly or indirectly      from the offense.       The bill also amends 18 U.S.C. 3582(d) to allow the court      to include as part of the sentence for any person convicted      under section 521 or 522 an order requiring the offender      while in prison to not associate or communicate with a      specified person upon a showing of probable cause that the      association or communication is for the purpose of enabling      the offender to be engaged in illegal activity.                               Section 6       Amends 18 U.S.C. 1952 to increase the maximum penalty for      traveling in interstate or foreign commerce or using any      facility in interstate or foreign commerce to distribute the      proceeds of any unlawful activity or for promoting, managing,      establishing, carrying on of any unlawful activity from five      years to ten. In addition, the bill authorizes the death      penalty for any person convicted of traveling, or using any      facility, in foreign or interstate commerce to commit any      crime of violence to further an unlawful activity, if that      act of violence results in death. Conspiring to violate the      section is treated the same as an actual or attempted      violation.       The bill amends the section to include new subsection b,      which provides that any person who travels in interstate or      foreign commerce or uses any facility in interstate or     foreign commerce with the intent to delay or influence the      testimony of or prevent from testifying a witness in a State      criminal proceeding or who seeks to cause any person to      destroy, alter or conceal evidence and thereafter performs,      or attempts or conspires to perform, an act described above      shall be imprisoned not more than 20 years, fined, or both,      and if death results, may be imprisoned for any term of years      or for life, or be sentenced to death.       The proposed section also amends redesignated subsection c      by amending ``unlawful activity'' to include assault with a      deadly weapon, assault resulting in serious bodily injury,      shooting at an occupied dwelling or motor vehicle, and      intimidation of or retaliation against a witness,      victim, juror, or informant.       Finally, the bill directs the United States Sentencing      Commission to amend the Federal Sentencing Guidelines to      provide an appropriate increase in the offense level for      violations of the newly amended section.                               Section 7       Amends 18 U.S.C. 1512 to increase the penalties for the use      of physical force or the threat of physical force with the      intent to influence, delay, or prevent the testimony of any      person in an official proceeding.       The bill increases the maximum term of imprisonment for the      use of physical force against any person in violation of the      section from 10 years to 20 years. In the case of the use of      the threat of physical force against any person, the      individual may be imprisoned for not more than ten years.      Identical penalties are assessed for those who conspire to      commit any offense under the section.                               Section 8       This section amends various sections of title 18 to address      violent offenses frequently or typically committed by gangs.      Most of the amendments either eliminate a mens rea      requirement or increase the penalty for a violation.       Subsection a amends 18 U.S.C. 2119 by eliminating the      requirement that the offender intend to cause death or      serious bodily harm during a carjacking in order to violate      the section.       Subsection b amends: 1. 18 U.S.C. 113(a)(3), dealing with      assaults within the maritime and territorial jurisdiction of      the United States, by striking the requirement that the      offender intend to do bodily harm when assaulting a person      with a dangerous weapon; 2. 18 U.S.C. 1112(b), dealing with      manslaughter within the maritime and territorial jurisdiction      of the United States, by increasing the maximum penalty for      voluntary manslaughter from ten years to twenty; 3. 18 U.S.C.      1153(a), which deals with offenses committed within Indian      country, by including within the list of offenses subject to      the same law and penalties as all other persons ``an offense      for which the maximum statutory term of imprisonment under      section 1363 of this title is greater than five years''; 4.      18 U.S.C. 1961(1)(A) by including within the definition of      ``racketeering activity'' the illegal activities specified in      the section that ``would have been chargeable'' under State      law ``except that the act or threat, other than gambling was      committed in Indian country, as defined in section 1151 of      this title, or in any other area of exclusive      Federal jurisdiction''.       Subsection c amends: 1. 18 U.S.C. 1958(a), dealing with      murder-for-hire, by bringing within the scope of the section      those who travel, or use any facility, in interstate or      foreign commerce with the intent that a felony crime of      violence against the person be committed in violation of the      laws of any State or the United States. As it currently      stands, the section applies only to those who intend that a      murder be committed; 2. 18 U.S.C. 1959, which deals with      violent crimes in aid of racketeering. The bill increases the      penalty for violating various subsections of section 1959.      The maximum punishment for threatening to commit a crime of      violence is increased from five to ten years; for attempting      or conspiring to commit murder or kidnapping is increased      from ten to twenty years; and for attempting or conspiring to      commit a crime involving maiming, assault with a dangerous      weapon, or assault resulting in serious bodily injury is      increased from three to ten years. The amendment also      incorporates the definition of ``serious bodily injury'' set      forth in section 2119 of the title as the term was previously      undefined within the section.       Subsection d amends 18 U.S.C. 371, dealing with      conspiracies to commit offenses against or to defraud the      United States. The bill strikes the second paragraph of      section 371, dealing with conspiracies involving      misdemeanors. A second subsection is added that provides that      if two or more persons conspire to commit any offense against      the United States, and one or more such persons acts on the      conspiracy, each shall be subject to the same penalties as      those prescribed for the most serious offense that was the      object of the conspiracy, except that the penalty of death      shall not be imposed.                               Section 9       Amends the term ``conviction'' in 18 U.S.C. 924(e)(2)(C),      part of the Armed Career Criminal Act, to include an act of      juvenile delinquency involving serious drug offenses.                               Section 10       Requires the United States Sentencing Commission to amend      the Federal sentencing guidelines to eliminate the policy      statement in section 5K2.18 dealing with sentence enhancement      for gang crimes. As with the amendment to 18 U.S.C. 521 in      section 5 of the bill, the deletion is in response to the      recent decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466      (2000).       Instead of the to-be-deleted and no longer appropriate      policy statement, the proposed amendment directs the      Commission to provide a base offense level for offenses      described in 18 U.S.C. 521 and 522 that reflects the      seriousness of the offenses-including an appropriate      enhancement for any offense described in section 521      committed by a member of a criminal street gang in connection      with the activities of the gang. The guidelines are also to      include an appropriate enhancement for a person who, in      violating section 522, recruits, solicits, induces,      commands, or causes another person residing in another      State to be or remain a member of a criminal street gang,      or who crosses a State line with intent to violate section      522.                               Section 11       Permits the Attorney General to designate an area as a high      intensity interstate gang activity area. The Attorney General      makes such designation upon consultation with the Secretary      of the Treasury and the Governors of the appropriate States.      In making such designation, the Attorney General considers      the extent to which gangs from the area are involved in      interstate or international criminal activity, the extent to      which the area is affected by the criminal activity of gang      members who are located in, or have relocated from, other      States or foreign countries, the extent to which State and      local law enforcement agencies have committed resources to      respond to the problem of criminal gang activity in the area,      the extent to which a significant increase in the allocation      of Federal resources would enhance local response to gang-     related criminal activity in the area, and any other criteria      deemed appropriate.       After such designation, the Attorney General may provide      assistance to the area by facilitating the establishment of a      regional task force, consisting of Federal, State, and local      law enforcement, for the coordinated investigation,      disruption, apprehension, and prosecution of criminal      activities of gangs and gang members in the area. In      addition, the Attorney General may direct the detailing from      any Federal department or agency, subject to the approval of      the head of that department or agency of personnel to the      high intensity interstate gang activity area.       The bill authorizes $100,000,000 for each of fiscal years      2002 through 2008. Sixty percent of the appropriation is to      be used to carry out the activities described above. The      remainder is to be used to make grants for community-based      programs to provide crime prevention and intervention      services that are designed for gang members and at-risk youth      in the designated areas. The bill further requires the      Attorney General to ensure that not less than 10 percent of      the amounts spent each fiscal year are used to assist rural      States.                               Section 12       Amends the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of      1994, 42 U.S.C. 13862, to permit additional uses for grants      made by the Attorney General under the section. The      additional uses are: to hire additional prosecutors; to      provide funding to enable prosecutors to address drug, gang,      and youth violence problems more effectively; to provide      funding to assist prosecutors with funding for technology,      equipment, and training; and to provide funding to assist      prosecutors in their efforts to engage in community      prosecution, problem solving, and conflict resolution      techniques through collaborative efforts with police, school      officials, probation officers, social service agencies, and      community organizations.       The bill authorizes the appropriation of $50,000,000 for      each of fiscal years 2002 through 2006 to carry out the      subtitle.                               Section 13       Amends 18 U.S.C. 5033 so that government officials, other      than the arresting officer, may advise juveniles of their      rights, notify the Attorney General, and notify the      juvenile's parents of the juvenile's detainment and rights.      This provision clarifies a provision that has been      interpreted in an overly literal manner by the Ninth Circuit      and is now causing numerous problems for law enforcement in      that circuit. See United States v. Juvenile (RRA-A), 229 F.3d      737, 748 (9th Cir. 2000) (Trott, J., dissenting).                                 ______                                       By
