 President, today I am pleased to introduce the Child Status Protection Act of 2001. This legislation would protect children who are in danger of losing their eligibility for an immigration visa because of the inability of the Immigration and Naturalization Service INS to process their petitions or applications in a timely fashion.  Children caught in the INS backlogs often face the problem of ``aging out'' of eligibility for family-based visas on their 21st birthday. One case recently brought to my attention was that of a couple who were lawful permanent residents. In 1993, they filed family-based petitions for their three children. Although the INS approved the petitions, as of March 2000, none of the children had become permanent residents. When they turned 21, the two oldest children were switched into another visa category because they no longer qualify as ``minor children.'' Now, they are in another backlog in which they have to wait another eight years to get a green card.  The legislation I have introduced today would provide a child, whose timely filed application for a family-based, employment-based, or diversity visa was submitted before the child reached his or her 21st birthday, the opportunity to remain eligible for that visa until the visa becomes available. The legislation also would protect the child of an asylum seeker whose application was submitted prior to the child's 21st birthday.  In recent years, the INS has faced a dramatic increase in the number of immigration benefit petitions and applications filed. This combined with the agency's slow service, and antiquated filing and computer data systems, has caused millions of our constituents to endure long waits of three to five years before getting their cases adjudicated.  The INS backlogs have carried a heavy price: children who are the beneficiaries of petitions and applications are ``aging out'' of eligibility for their visas, even though they were fully eligible at the time their applications were filed. This has occurred because some immigration benefits are only available to the ``child'' of a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident, and the Immigration and Nationality Act defines a ``child'' as an unmarried person under the age of 21.  As a consequence, a family whose child's application for admission to the United States has been pending for years may be forced to leave that child behind either because the INS was unable to adjudicate the application before the child's 21st birthday, or because growing immigration backlogs in the immigration visa category caused the visa to be unavailable before the child reached his 21st birthday. As a result, the child loses the right to admission to the United States. This what is commonly known as ``aging out.''  Situations like these leave both the family and the child in a difficult dilemma. Under current law, lawful permanent residents who are outside of the United States face a difficult choice when their child ``ages-out'' of eligibility for a first preference visa. Emigrating parents must decide to either come to the United States and leave their child behind, or remain in their country of origin and lose out on their American dream in the United States. In the end, we as a country stand to lose when we are deprived of their cultural gifts, talents and many contributions.  For lawful permanent residents who already live in the United States, their dilemma is different. They must make the difficult choice of either sending their child who has ``aged-out'' of visa eligibility back to their country of origin, or have the child stay in the United States out-of-status, in violation of our immigration laws, and thus, vulnerable to deportation. No law should encourage this course of action.  One compelling example is that of 17-year-old Juan, a youngster born in Guatemala, who applied for adjustmentof status under the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act in 1999. He is a junior in high school with a 4.0 grade point average. His mother came to the United States in 1986, fleeing life-threatening conditions in Guatemala. Juan, who was six years old at the time, joined her four years later. Today, Juan has yet to have an interview with the INS. Given the expected three- to five-year wait for the INS to adjudicate adjustment of status applications, this high achieving student may not only miss out on his dream of becoming an engineer, his home state of California stands to lose out on the contributions he undoubtedly will make.  The aging out problem also extends to those who have fled persecution and are granted asylum in the U.S. Current law permits persons granted asylum to have their child join them in the United States. However, if the child ages out while the parent's application for asylum is being adjudicated, the child is no longer automatically entitled to remain with his parent.  As Members of Congress we, too, have been confronted with this issue. Because the Attorney General does not have the discretion to protect the status of these children, we often are called upon to introduce private bills to grant them the status they deserve. Unfortunately, these bills are limited in number and not all deserving children are able get private bills introduced on their behalf.  The Child Status Protection Act of 2001 would correct these inequities and help protect a number of children who, through no fault of their own, face the consequence of being separated from their immediate family. It is a modest but urgently needed reform of our immigration laws, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Child Status Protection Act of 2001 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 672       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
