President, I thank the majority leader for what he said on these nominations. As he knows, we have an awful lot of them that have come out, and then every time he has tried to move them quickly on the Senate floor there has been opposition from the other side.  It has been frustrating when we actually had nominations that waited months, or will have a cloture vote, and then they will get 90 or 95 votes for confirmation.
