President, I am pleased that the Senate passed legislation, H.R. 3942, earlier this month to redesignate the U.S. Post Office in Middletown the ``Rhode Island Veterans Post Office Building,'' and I thank Congressman Patrick Kennedy for introducing this important legislation in the House of Representatives. I recognize the important contributions and sacrifices that our military veterans have made for our country. The celebration of the 60th anniversary of the D-Day invasion at Normandy this month again highlighted the great sacrifices that our brave soldiers have made, and continue to make today in Afghanistan, Iraq and throughout the world. I am proud to support naming the U.S. Post Office in Middletown in their honor.                          ____________________
