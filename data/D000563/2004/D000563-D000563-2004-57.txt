President, today I would like to talk about a critical subject, the need to support family planning as part of our international development agenda.  Family planning saves lives. It is a basic health service, especially in parts of the world such as Malawi where 1 in 7 mothers die in childbirth or Mozambique where 137 infants die per 1,000 live births and where life expectancy is just 37 years.  This is a health issue and it is a development issue because the two are virtually always related.  Ten years ago, members of the United Nations met in Cairo to draft a 20-year action plan to alleviate poverty through women's empowerment and universal access to reproductive healthcare.  Recently, a new report by UNFPA has come out, ``The Cairo Consensus at Ten: Population, Reproductive Health, and the Global Effort to End Poverty.'' This report assesses how far we have come and how far we have to go and argues that we have to mobilize political will and international assistance if we are going to build on previous gains.  This report revealed that, a decade after the Cairo meeting, more than 350 million couples still lack access to a full range of family planning services. It found that almost 530,000 women die each year from complications of pregnancy and childbirth, mostly from preventable causes. It also found that 2 out of every 5 people on the planet still struggle to survive on less than $2 a day, and many of them earn less than half that tiny amount.  The report concluded:       Policy makers have been slow to address the inequitable      distribution of health information and services that helps      keep people poor . . . Developing countries that have reduced      fertility and mortality by investing in health and education      have higher productivity, more savings and more productive      investment, resulting in faster economic growth. Enabling      people to have fewer children, if they want to, helps to      stimulate development and reduce poverty, both in individual      households and in societies. Smaller families have more to      invest in children's education and health. Rapid population      growth contributes to environmental stress, uncontrolled      urbanization and rural and urban poverty.  However, United States funding for UNFPA, which Congress has repeatedly passed, has not been distributed because the administration has refused to do so. Releasing the funds for UNFPA, which the administration has cancelled for the last 3 years, is a great way to help countries alter this template of maternal and child mortality, poverty, and under development.  This issue isn't about coercive abortion in China. UNFPA has a program to end coercive abortion in China. It is not about abortion at all. The UNFPA does not provide any support for abortion.  This is about providing health services for desperately poor women and their families.  The administration's own investigative team looked into UNFPA andfound no evidence of wrongdoing and urged immediate and unconditional release of these funds.  Study after study has shown that development is fundamentally about women: dollars go further and programs mean more when they reach women. Increasing women's access to education, health care, and human rights brings enhanced child health, improved food production, lower population growth rates, and higher incomes--in short, better quality of life for women and their families.  Reproductive health is an important component of this agenda, especially when we look at maternal and child mortality rates. That is why it is so important that we support the UNFPA and in the process advance our other foreign assistance goals.                          ____________________
