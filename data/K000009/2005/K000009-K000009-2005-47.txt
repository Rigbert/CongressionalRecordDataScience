Speaker, as those listening might recall, the 2004 Presidential election was decided in Ohio, my home State, and the margin in the Presidential race was razor thin. But if you have been paying attention to Ohio newspapers of late, you know that there is a broad and widening major political scandal in Ohio that relates to the last election. People who have paid attention to Ohio or live in Ohio can read about it on the Web site of our local newspaper; the toledoblade.com is the site.  But what this concerns is that the highest elected officials in Ohio, starting with the Governor of Ohio, the Attorney General of Ohio, the auditor of Ohio, the Secretary of State of Ohio, were all in receipt of campaign contributions from an individual who is now charged with diverting millions of dollars from the State of Ohio's Workers' Compensation trust fund for personal use and for political use. There is a grand jury that has been empaneled in Ohio now involving the northern and southern districts of Ohio, looking at the diversion of some of these dollars to the Bush campaign. It is a broad and widening scandal, as I have said.  Then, today, the Secretary of State of Ohio is mentioned in articles that were published by the Cleveland Plain Dealer and by the Columbus Dispatch in our capital city, and I will just read a couple of the lines: The Board of Elections of our capital city, and that, of course, is Columbus, Ohio, the Franklin County Board docked its executive director a month's pay for accepting $10,000 in his office last year from a consultant from the voting machine company Diebold, with which we have had so many fights over the last 2 years, trying to get verified, auditable paper trails in those voting machines.  Now, it appears that that company, through its consultant, actually walked into the office of the director of the Board of Elections and wrote a check for $10,000, which the director of the board was a little reluctant to accept, but said, well, why don't you write it out to the local political party, the Republican Party of Columbus Ohio, Franklin County, which was done.  Well, now, this has been all discovered, and the investigation of what has transpired with the Secretary of State's office and Diebold and this County Board of Elections is being investigated.  One of our State senators from Ohio, Senator Teresa Fedor, has sent a letter to the Office of the United States Attorney in northern Ohio requesting a formal investigation of Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell regarding possible violations of Federal law, including, but not limited to, the Hobbs Act, regarding improper dealings between the Secretary of State's office and Diebold Election Systems, or their agents.  She goes on, and I will place the full letter in the Record, to ask the Inspector General to look at a series of conflict of interest questions here and the gravity of pay-to-play allegations, to determine whether Mr. Blackwell, the Secretary of State, violated Federal law by accepting campaign contributions in exchange for official acts. Because, Mr. Speaker, if you look at what has been happening in Ohio, there has absolutely been a preference for the Diebold machines; there have been delays, there have been all kinds of efforts made to advantage one company over other companies.  I want to place some of these news articles in the Record tonight. Also, there is a huge court case pending between a company called ESS, which is another company that has voting machines, and Diebold Corporation. That is in the courts. Our Secretary of State is saying, oh, you have to pick these machines, you have to pick the Diebold machines; they are the only machines that we have certified without giving other machines an equal chance.  What is interesting about this is that Ohio has received $136,552,794 over the last 2 years to purchase these machines, so there is Federal taxpayer dollars involved, and another $44,616,967 for training of election officials. None of those training dollars have been spent, but $136 million has gone out for hardware in a very narrow process where one company has been so very advantaged.  So I just wanted to draw people's attention to what is going on in the State of Ohio, to the ongoing court case, to the false deadlines set by our Secretary of State, now by the investigation that has been requested by our very high-ranking senators of the U.S. Attorney in Ohio, and I commend listeners to the toledoblade.com Web site to the developing political scandal in the State of Ohio.            [From the Blade Columbus Bureau, July 19, 2005]               Elections Chief Punished For Taking Check               Franklin County official accepted $10,000                on behalf of GOP from diebold consultant                           (By Jim Provance)       Columbus.--The Franklin County Board of Elections yesterday      docked its executive director a month's pay for accepting a      10,000 check in his office last year from a Diebold Inc.      consultant seeking county business.       Matt Damschroder accepted the check on behalf of the county      Republican Party.       He came forward after a Diebold competitor, Nebraska-based      Election Systems & Software, sought to depose him as part of      a lawsuit alleging special treatment for Diebold on the part      of Ohio Secretary of State Kenneth Blackwell.       Mr. Blackwell plans to seek the GOP nomination for governor      in 2006.       His office denied any connection between campaign      contributions and his decisions affecting Diebold.       Diebold's device has the only computerized touch-screen      machine so far to win state certificatlon for its paper-     receipt backup system.       Such a system was mandated last year by the Ohio General      Assembly.       Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien had suggested that      Mr. Damschroder be fired. He would not confirm yesterday that      an investigation was under way.       According to Mr. Damschroder, political consultant Pasquale      ``Pat'' Gallina, who works for consultants Celebrezze &      Associates, walked uninvited into his office in January,      2004, on the day the board was considering a contract for      voter-registration software. He offered to make out a check      to him on the spot.       Mr. Damschroder said he instead accepted a ``voluntary''      contribution to the county GOP. A former executive director      for the party, Mr. Damschroder accepted the check even though      the law prohibits using government property for political      business.       ``I don't believe I committed a crime,'' he said. ``I think      I did something that would best be described as a lapse of      judgment and clearly in the gray area . . . The biggest thing      I wish I had done was throw the guy out on that day he came      in and certainly not have taken physical receipt of the      contribution.''       The county has joined the ES&S lawsuit, which seeks to      break Diebold's monopoly on touch-screen machines available      to counties.       Celebrezze & Associates is on a monthly retainer for      Diebold.       ``Any contribution he made was on behalf of Celebrezze &      Associates and of his own volition,'' said Diebold spokesman      Mike Jacobsen. ``Diebold had no knowledge of any such      contribution.       ``Diebold does not condone any political contributions made      on its behalf, implied or otherwise,'' he said. ``In      particular, our company's ethics policy restricts political      contributions since June, 2004.''       That policy was, in part, a reaction to a letter authored      by Walden O'Dell. chief executive officer of Diebold, Inc.,      of North Canton, Ohio. In the letter, Mr. O'Dell promised to      help deliver Ohio to President George Bush, triggering a      firestorm during the presidential election campaign.       The Lucas County Board of Elections has selected Diebold to      supply its touch-screen machines. A review of filings with      the county elections bureau by the county Republican and      Democratic parties revealed no contributions from Mr.      Gallina.       In a phone conversation that took place a year after the      contribution to the party, Mr. Damschroder said Mr. Gallina      bragged that he had been given $50,000 to Blackwell interests      and worked with Blackwell campaign adviser Norm Cummings to      position Diehold for state business.       ``I have never asked, accepted, received, or was offered      any money [from Mr. Gallina], period,'' Mr. Cummings said.       Mr. Gallina, of Reynoldsburg, could not be reached for      comment, but he told the Associated Press there was no      $50,000 contribution for Mr. Blackwell and that the      $10,000 to the county party was his own money.       Mr. Gallina has given a total of $8,000 to Mr. Blackwell's      campaigns since 1998, according to records filed with the      secretary of state. Also in January, 2004, he gave $10,000 to      Citizens for Tax Reform, a Blackwell-backed group that      unsuccessfully sought to force repeal of a temporary penny-     on-the-dollar sales-tax surcharge enacted in 2003.       Blackwell spokesman Carlo LoParo said Mr. Blackwell made      several decisions adverse to Diebold, negotiating contracts      at first with four manufacturers of touch-screen and optical-     scan voting machines to give counties a menu from which to      choose.       Later, after lawmakers enacted the requirement for the      voter-verified paper audit trail, Mr. Blackwell took all      touch-screen devices, including Diebold's, off the table      because none had been certified as meeting the new mandate.       Mr. Blackwell later reversed position when Diebold's      receipt-equipped machine won federal and state approval.       ``It wasn't the secretary of state who forwarded the VVPAT      requirement,'' Mr. LoParo said. ``It wasn't the secretary of      state who prevented vendors from meeting that requirement.      From the beginning, this process has been transparent and      fair.''       Sen. Teresa Fedor (D., Toledo) yesterday urged U.S.      Attorney Gregory White to investigate Mr. Blackwell's dealing      with Diebold.       ``We need to get to the bottom of this,'' she said. ``I      don't care if it was $50,000 or $5, you're not supposed to be      able to buy influence in America.''       Mr. Damschroder said the loss of 30 days' pay will cost him      $11,220. William Anthony, Jr., chairman of the Franklin      County elections board and that county's Democratic Party,      said the board believes there was no criminal intent on Mr.      Damschroder's part.       As for Mr. Gallina, Mr. Anthony said, ``If somebody gives      you a check for $10,000, I guess they would want something.''                                  ____                                        The Ohio State Senate,                                   Cleveland, Ohio, June 18, 2005.     Gregory White, Esq.,     Assistant U.S. Attorney, Office of the U.S. Attorney,          Cleveland, Ohio.       Dear Attorney White: I am contacting you to ask that you be      in a formal investigation of Ohio Secretary of State J.      Kenneth Blackwell and his cabinet regarding possible      violations of the federal law, including, but not limited to,      The Hobbs Act, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951. Questions have been      raised by both The Columbus Dispatch and The Cleveland Plain      Dealer regarding possible improper dealings between the      Secretary of State's office and Diebold Election Systems and/     or their agents.       The Hobbs Act was meant to prohibit corruption by elected      officials. As you know, the Act prohibits ``obtaining the      property from another, with his consent . . . under color of      official right.'' 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1951(b)(2). The United      States Supreme Court has held that an elected official      violates the Hobbs Act if the ``public official has obtained      a payment to which he was not entitled, knowing that the      payment was made in return for official acts.'' Evans v.      United States, 112 S. Ct. 1881, 1889 (1992). The Court went      on to say that ``the offense is completed at the time when      the public official receives a payment in return for his      agreement to perform specific official acts; fulfillment of      the quid pro quo is not an element of the offense.'' Id.       According to Franklin County Board of Elections Executive      Director Matthew Damschroeder, officials or agents of Diebold      Election Systems, including lobbyist Pasquale Gallina,      allegedly made a deal with Secretary of State Blackwell, and/     or his associates, that Diebold would receive a substantial      or exclusive rights to supply electronic voting machines to      the State of Ohio in exchange for a substantial donation to      ``Blackwell's political interests.'' If this is, in fact,      what happened, it appears to be a clear violation of federal      law. Even if no quid pro quo existed, Mr. Gallina's alleged      $10,000 payment to ``Citizens for Tax Repeal,'' of which      Blackwell is Honorary Chair, raises significant conflict of      interest questions.       Because of the gravity of these ``pay-to-play''      allegations, I urge your office to fully investigate to      determine whether Mr. Blackwell violated federal law by      accepting campaign contributions in exchange for official      acts. This immediate investigation is necessary to fully      protect the taxpayers of Ohio and the sanctity of government      procurement in the State. If these allegations are true, no      business in the country can trust that they will have fair      dealings with Ohio. Thank you for your attention to this      important matter and please do not hesitate to contact me      with any questions or concerns you may have.           Sincerely,                                                     Teresa Fedor,     State Senator, 11th District.                          ____________________[Pages H6312-H6313]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                     POLITICAL SCANDAL PLAGUES OHIO
