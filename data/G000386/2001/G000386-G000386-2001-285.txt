 President, a recently released study from Duke University found that older Americans are enjoying a more vigorous old age. Fewer people over the age of 65 require nursing home care and more are living on their own, with little or no outside help.  The image of a ``senior citizen'' is dramatically different than it was just a generation ago. Since 1963, the month of May has helped the Nation focus on the contributions and achievements of America's older citizens. Older Americans Month honors the leadership of older persons in our families, workplaces and communities. One of these leaders is an 81-year-old woman from Reinbeck. Doris Casey is a champion for Iowa's older citizens. Through her initiative, concern, and commitment, she has touched the lives of seniors in Reinbeck and throughout northern Iowa.  When the Casey's moved to Reinbeck in 1967, the family planned to stay for only six weeks. As a way to get to know neighbors and make friends, Mrs. Casey began volunteering at the local nursing home once a week and played cards with the residents. Thirty-four years later, Mrs. Casey still lives in Reinbeck. She worked at that nursing home for 17 years and has become a treasured resource in the community for her knowledge and action on senior-related issues. Mrs. Casey has been a member of the Grundy County Commission on Aging for 28 years. She played a key role in starting the county's congregate meal program sixteen years ago. Although the program has since changed to home-delivered meals, Mrs. Casey is still involved. She does the books, takes orders and solicits deliverers. In addition, Mrs. Casey helps coordinate a community meal for approximately 40 seniors in Reinbeck each month.  For the last 27 years, Mrs. Casey has been an active volunteer with the Hawkeye Valley Area Agency on Aging and until recently was a member of their board of directors. The staff at Hawkeye Valley call her a godsend. She volunteers in the administrative office, helps with special projects and answers the hotline for those alleging Medicare fraud and abuse under Operation Restore Trust. Mrs. Casey works hard to ensure that seniors in her community have the latest information on issues affecting their lives. She is a monthly presenter at the county nutrition site and writes a weekly column for her local paper. She provides assistance to those applying for Medicaid and low-income heating assistance, and she serves on the State's consumer Medicare committee. People know that if Mrs. Casey doesn't have the answer on a particular senior issue, she will likely know the person who does.  Last but certainly not least, Mrs. Casey is a caregiver. When her late husband, John, was suffering from Alzheimer's Disease, she served as his full-time caregiver. Mrs. Casey is currently a guardian for a senior with a disability. And, she still visits the local nursing home to share devotions with the residents a few times a year. Mrs. Casey carries out each of these activities with joy, determination and humility. Even a recent hip surgery won'tkeep her from carrying on with her duties. Her contributions to the community are many, yet she describes the rewards as all hers.  In one month, Mrs. Casey will turn 82. Happy early birthday, Mrs. Casey. Thank you for your compassion for the people of Reinbeck and the people of Iowa. Your commitment and concern for others is an example to us all that we should contribute to the lives of those around us, no matter what our age.                          ____________________
