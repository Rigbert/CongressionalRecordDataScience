Speaker, I am very, very pleased to welcome to our midst Father Joseph Kleinstuber, a constituent of mine and an extraordinarily loved leader in our area. Father Kleinstuber is pastor of St. Mary's Church located in my district in Bryantown.  Father Kleinstuber was born in Washington, D.C. He attended Gonzaga High School, as well as Georgetown and George Washington Universities before going on active duty as an officer in the Air Force. He spent 3 years in the Air Force as chief of the Aviation Physiology Department at Randolph Air Force Base in Texas.  Following his military service, he studied at St. Vincent Seminary and was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1964.  Prior to coming to St. Mary's, Father Kleinstuber served as an assistant pastor of St. Anthony Church in the District and St. Andrew the Apostle Church in Silver Spring, Maryland. He also worked for 25 years at St. John's College High School here in Washington as chaplain, director of counseling, a member of the science department, and, of interest to our Speaker, wrestling moderator.  Since 2001, Father Kleinstuber has been at St. Mary's serving as the pastor of this more than 200-year-old parish where he is affectionately known by the students at St. Mary's Bryantown Catholic School as Father K.  I want to thank Father Kleinstuber for his dedicated service to the citizens of Bryantown and St. Charles County, and I wish to extend my gratitude and that of my colleagues to him for leading us in this morning's prayer.  Father, we wish you well and thank you for your leadership in so many different areas that have made our country a better place.                          ____________________
