I want to see this done as quickly as possible. I will urge the staff that is now reviewing this new substitute amendment--some are just seeing it for the first time--to move quickly and to urge all colleagues on both sides, Democrats and Republicans, to bring their amendments to the floor and let's get on with it.  I say to the Senator, I understand his feelings, and if it is in the form of a question, does the Senator believe he is deserving of my empathy?
