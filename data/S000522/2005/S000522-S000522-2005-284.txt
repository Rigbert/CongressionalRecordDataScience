Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend for yielding me time, and I congratulate him for his courage in leading the battle on this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, 90 percent of the hospitals in the United States today refuse to abort unborn children, and the trend is for hospitals to divest themselves of this violence against children.  It is outrageous that as hospitals in our country repudiate abortion, the Davis amendment seeks to turn our overseas military hospitals into abortion mills. With all due respect to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis), the amendment she offers will result in babies being brutally killed by abortion. It will harm women, and it will force pro-life Americans to facilitate and subsidize the slaughter of innocent children.  We want no part of the carnage.  Abortion is violence against children and it harms women. Some methods of abortion dismember and rip apart the fragile little bodies of children. Other methods chemically poison kids. Abortion has turned children's bodies into burned corpses, the direct result of the caustic effect of the chemicals.  Now we learn, Mr. Chairman, from science and from medicine that due to the nerve cell development, unborn children from at least 20 weeks onward, and most likely even earlier, feel excruciating pain.
