  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have 20 minutes for the proponents. I have a number of people who would like to speak. It is an important amendment and one we have tried to have considered by the full body. Then if the opposition wants 5 minutes, that is fine. That would still keep it under a half hour.
