President, several years ago, after his 3-year-old daughter Robin passed away from leukemia, George Herbert Walker Bush wrote to his mother about how much he loved and missed his little girl. It is a beautiful, almost heartbreaking letter. Near the end, he wrote about his daughter's continued presence in his life and the life of his family. He said: ``We cannot touch her and yet we feel her.''  President Bush himself has now passed beyond our reach. Yet, knowingly or not, we all feel the difference he made in the Nation and in the world. Many of us feel that deep longing for a ``kinder, gentler'' Nation that President Bush promised in his inaugural address 30 years ago.  George Herbert Walker Bush was an American patriot who devoted his life to his family and to his country. On his 18th birthday--6 months after Pearl Harbor--he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and became one of the youngest aviators in the history of the Navy. He was discharged 1 month after Japan's surrender, but he never stopped serving America.  There is a book entitled ``Flyboys'' that tells the story of the squadron George Herbert Walker Bush was a part of and the deadly mission they were given in the South Pacific. He flew some 58 missions as a Navy pilot. On his last assignment, he was shot down, and two of his crew were killed in that confrontation. Fortunately for us and for him, he was rescued by a submarine. There is a grainy, black-and-white film of his being fished out of the ocean by the American submarine that is still an inspiration to this day.  As the 41st President of the United States and the father of the 43rd President, he was the linchpin of a political dynasty that spanned four generations. He already had a lifetime of public service before he became President--as a Texas Congressman, Ambassador to the United Nations, Envoy to China, Director of the CIA, and Vice President to Ronald Reagan.  Despite his extraordinary achievements, he was a man of remarkable humility. If his syntax sounded a little choppy at times--and Dana Carvey made a fortune imitating him--it was partly due to the fact that George Herbert Walker Bush had difficulty using the words ``I'' and ``me.'' When he was a young boy, his mother taught him that those were the words of braggarts. Riding in the Presidential limousine through streets lined with cheering crowds, he once told a fellow passenger: ``They're not clapping for me; they're clapping for the office of the President.'' That was exactly how he thought it should be.  I was still a rather new Congressman when George Herbert Walker Bush was President. I sure didn't agree with all of his policies, as my voting record demonstrates, but that is a discussion for another time. As President Bush's own life shows us, there is a time for politics, and there is a time to put politics aside and to recall the exceptional lifetime of service he gave to our Nation.  President Reagan helped hurry the end of the Cold War, but it fell to President George Herbert Walker Bush to successfully navigate the aftermath.  When the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, he insisted there would be no gloating or triumphalism from his administration.  His low-key approach helped set the tone for our NATO allies, and it helped make possible the peaceful end of the Soviet Union. Never before had such a heavily armed empire ended with so little turmoil or bloodshed in its final days. In the 2 years before the collapse of the Soviet Union, President Bush and then-Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev successfully negotiated the START nuclear arms treaty. Under President George Herbert Walker Bush, we saw the largest reduction in nuclear weapons in history, and America and the world are safer today because of it.  If you want to see the world's enduring respect for President Bush, look at the statesmen and stateswomen expected to attend his memorial service tomorrow at the National Cathedral. Among them are Mikhail Gorbachev, his partner in historic change, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who grew up in Communist East Germany.  It is said that the Germans today credit George Herbert Walker Bush more than any person for their successful reunification. He knew that America is stronger when we work with partners than when we imagine we can somehow go it alone. When Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait in 1990, George Herbert Walker Bush methodically assembled an international coalition to push them back.  He left his mark on domestic policy as well. He fought for and in 1990 signed the Americans with Disabilities Act--one of the greatest civil rights laws in our Nation's modern history.  President Bush was a committed conservative and a Texan by choice. He had close ties to the oil industry, but he believed in science. What a welcome change it would be in Washington today if his party felt the same. President George Herbert Walker Bush understood that poisoning our planet is not just unfair to future generations, it is bad for business, and it is bad for our economy. He helped build bipartisan support--this Republican President helped build bipartisan support--and signed the Clean Air Act of 1990, strengthening the Federal Government's role and protecting the very air we breathe. He signed the Global Change Research Act of 1990, establishing an interagency Federal council to improve understanding of global change and to devise a plan to reduce the risks of climate catastrophe. What a sharp contrast to the current administration. George Herbert Walker Bush's work was the work of a leader.  Between 1980 and 1990, America's budget deficit tripled to $220 billion, driven largely by the Reagan-era tax cuts. In 1990, with a lot of criticism, President Bush had the courage to sign a tax increase--as President Reagan had before him--to help pay down the deficit for future generations. He put the interests of future generations ahead of his own short-term political advantage, and he paid a heavy price in the next election. He may have even lost because of it. Years later, he received a Profile in Courage Award for that leadership.  In his inaugural address, President Bush said that the real strength and greatness of America came from ``a thousand points of light''--the countless acts of decency and compassion we show to each other and to those in need. In his post-Presidential years, he remained a committed advocate for volunteerism, community, and national service. He was active in domestic and global humanitarian activities, often alongside former President Bill Clinton, an old political opponent turned ally.  In 1995, after a domestic terrorist bombed the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people and injuring 680 more, the National Rifle Association sent out a fundraising letter denouncing the Federal agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms as ``jack-booted thugs.'' Former President George Herbert Walker Bush reacted with anger. He denounced that vitriol by the NRA as ``a vicious slander on good people.'' He publicly resigned his NRA lifetime membership, placing conscience ahead of political calculation.  Like John McCain and others who have personally experienced the terror of war, George Herbert Walker Bush did not confuse politics with war. He did not mistake political opponents for enemies. He understood that people can have differences of opinion and both still love the country.  Our sadness at losing him seems partly a reflection for our own deep, deep yearning as a nation today for the kind of leadership and character and integrity and honesty and courage that he brought to the Office of Presidency.  In his first inaugural address, President Lincoln pleaded with a nation on the knife's edge of war. He said:       We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies.  Lincoln urged us to be guided ``by the better angels of our nature.''  In his own inaugural address, President George Herbert Walker Bush also spoke of all Americans as friends. Let me read two short sections of his remarks.       My friends, we are not the sum of our possessions. They are      not the measure of our lives. In our hearts, we know what      matters. We cannot hope only to leave our children a bigger      car, a bigger bank account. We must hope to give them a sense      of what it means to be a loyal friend, a loving parent, a      citizen who leaves his home, his neighborhood and town better      than he found it. And what do we want the men and women who      work with us to say when we're no longer there? That we were      more driven to succeed than anyone around us? Or that we      stopped to ask if a sick child had gotten better and stayed a      moment there to trade a word of friendship?  President George Bush went on to say:       America is never wholly herself unless she is engaged in      high moral principle. We as a people have such a purpose      today. It is to make kinder the face of the nation and      gentler the face of the world. . . . My friends, we have work      to do.  As a tribute to George Herbert Walker Bush, who lies in state in the Rotunda of the U.S. Capitol--the 32nd person to be so honored in our history--let us try to remember we are not enemies but friends, and may we summon the courage, the wisdom, and the humility to put the interests of our Nation and our world ahead of self-interest.  In closing, my wife Loretta and I send our deepest condolences to President Bush, his family, and all who knew and loved him.                          ____________________
