The elimination of this program means the cutting of funds for grants in over 35 States, midcycle, including programs in Vermont and Pennsylvania.  Senator Jeffords and I have been working to find an acceptable way to ensure that the Community Schools programs which work well will continue to be funded.  I understand the fiscal constraints faced by the committee. I appreciate the willingness of the chairman to add language to this bill that would give priority funding through the high-risk youth grant program to currently running Community Schools grants that are successful.  The program in Vermont is called CITYSCAPE. This grant has allowed Barre City to develop partnerships between the schools, the community and other key service providers to target assistance to youth who are at risk of abuse and neglect, at risk of substance abuse and at risk of teen pregnancy. The program seeks to increasing community and school connection to these youth, decrease youth violence and to decrease youth use or potential use of alcohol, tobacco or other drugs.
