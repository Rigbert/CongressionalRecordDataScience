President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator Hagel in introducing the Small Business Banking Act of 1999, legislation that eliminates a Depression-era federal law prohibiting banks from paying interest on commercial checking accounts. Last year, I cosponsored a similar bill with Senator Hagel that was incorporated into a financial institutions regulatory relief bill which passed the Banking Committee.  The prohibition against the payment of interest on commercial accounts was originally part of a broad prohibition on the payment of interest on any deposit account. At the time of enactment in 1933, it was the popular view that payment of interest on deposits created an incentive for rural banks to shift excess deposits to urban money center banks which made loans that fueled speculation. Moreover, it was believed that such transfers created liquidity crises in rural communities. However, a number of changes in the banking system since enactment of the prohibition have called into question its usefulness.  First, with the passage of the Depository Institutions Deregulatory and Monetary Control Act of 1980, Congress allowed financial institutions to offer interest-bearing accounts to individuals--a change which has not adversely affected safety and soundness. Second, many banks have developed complex mechanisms called sweep accounts to circumvent the interest rate prohibition. Because of the costs associated with developing sweep accounts, large banks have become the primary offerors of these accounts. As a result, many smaller banks are at a competitive disadvantage with larger banks which can offer their commercial depositors interest-bearing accounts. Most importantly, the vast majority of small businesses cannot afford to utilize sweep accounts because the cost of opening these accounts is relatively high and most small businesses do not have a large enough deposit base to justify the administrative costs.  In light of these developments, it has become clear that the prohibition on interest-bearing commercial accounts is nothing more than a relic of the Depression-era that has effectively disadvantaged small businesses and small banks, and led large banks to dedicate significant resources to circumventing the prohibition. I am, therefore, pleased to cosponsor this legislation that will eliminate this prohibition and level the playing field for small banks and small business.  Mr. President, as we move into a new millennium, I think it appropriate that we eliminate this vestige of the early twentieth century that is no longer useful and is indeed burdensome.                                 ______                                       By
