 When we vote on this referral, let us vote as Americans, as I said, not as a partisan issue. You may have the Attorney General in the future. It's not the question of the party of the Attorney General. It is the question of whether or not this Congress is going to provide for equal treatment of all Attorney Generals and all Cabinet officers.  Let us vote for this motion to refer and give the committee the opportunity it should take, and let us vote down this motion that should fail, and let us vote down these motions for contempt, and let us thoughtfully consider the equities of this issue.
