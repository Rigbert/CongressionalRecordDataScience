Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Jacob Gillison, who served as office manager and scheduler in my Washington, DC office for nearly 14 years.  For over a decade, Jacob served as a member of my staff, friend, confidant, and counselor to many in what we call Team Lewis, our office family. Jacob recently joined the staff of Senator Bernie Sanders as the administrative director and scheduler. I would like to congratulate him on his new position, and thank him for his many years of service to my office and constituents.  I first met Jacob many years ago when he was a member of the United States' Air Force (USAF) Air Traffic Control Field. During his nearly two decades of service in the U.S. Air Force, Jacob was recognized repeatedly for his dedication and commitment to excellence. When I learned that he was considering a transition to a different branch of government, I was pleased to invite him to join my Washington, DC staff as scheduler and office manager. If he was able to keep military planes safe and on-time, I believed he might be able to keep me and my staff on schedule.  When he joined my office, I learned even more about his total commitment to service. As a member of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc., Jacob was handpicked by the president of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. to serve as deputy assistant to the international president of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity focusing on governmental and civic affairs. In this capacity, Jacob conceptualized and coordinated ``SigmaDay on the Hill,'' which brought local high school students to Capitol Hill to lobby on the behalf of legislation affecting high school students and their local communities. This experience enlightened and exposed young people in learning how their Congress works and inspiring them to move from the sidelines to the frontlines.  During his spare time in the evening and on weekends, Jacob advises and counsels young men in the local community. His selfless efforts did not go unrecognized as the leadership of Nu Sigma Sigma Chapter of the Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Inc. voted and honored him as ``Mentor of the Year 2010.'' As an additional testament to Jacob's long and exceptional service, the Free Masons bestowed on him their 33rd Degree, an honorary title granted to those Masons who distinguish themselves.  A native of Beaufort, South Carolina, Jacob graduated from Battery Creek High School and continued his education by earning dual Bachelor of Science degrees in Business Administration and Economics from Benedict College and an additional degree in Aeronautical Science from Embry Riddle Aeronautical University.  Over the years, I had the pleasure of visiting Beaufort, South Carolina and even attending the beautiful Gullah Festival. I was particularly proud to meet and become an honorary member of Jacob's welcoming family. He is truly a loving and dedicated family man--a proud brother, father, and grandfather. Jacob's son, Dexter, and daughter-in-law, Nikita, continue the family tradition of service as members of the U.S. Air Force. His lovely daughter, Mekala, is a high school honor roll student, ROTC member, athlete and dancer, and Jacob's handsome first grandchild, Brice, is the apple of his eye.  As you can see, Mr. Speaker, I cannot say enough about how great a member of my staff and family Jacob Gillison was. I will truly miss him, his children, grandson, twin brother Esau, and brothers-in-spirit--Tyson and Glenn--but I wish him continued success in his new position and this exciting, next stage of his outstanding career.                          ____________________
