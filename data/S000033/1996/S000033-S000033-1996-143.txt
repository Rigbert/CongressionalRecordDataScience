 Speaker, if we want to understand why in this country the richest people are becoming richer while most working people are seeing a decline in their standard of living, if we want to understand why the Contract With America provides for huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people and the largest corporations while it cuts back massively on programs for the elderly, working people, and low-income people, we might want to examine Newt Gingrich's travel schedule for the coming week.  Mr. Gingrich will be in Seattle, WA, where he will have dinner with his colleagues and his friends for the Washington State Republican Party for $1,000 each. He will be in Dallas, TX, for a dinner for only $10,000 apiece. He will be in Dearborn, MI, for another private fireside reception at $10,000.  Who goes to these events? Most people that I know do not spend $1,000 for a dinner.                          ____________________
