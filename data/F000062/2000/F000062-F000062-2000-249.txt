 President, no matter what our party affiliation, no matter what our beliefs, no matter whether we are Members or staff, we are all here for one purpose--that is, we believe in the nobility of public service. And while the enormity of the issues before this body bring it, and us, much notoriety, it is to the many thousands of dedicated public servants at the State and local level that we owe a debt of gratitude.  San Francisco has been fortunate for the last 25 years to have had the services of a public servant of great ability and dedication, Andy Moran. Andy's talents first came to my attention when I was Mayor. He has risen through the ranks of municipal government and has, for the last six years, served as the General Manager of the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission. For those who do not know, our PUC includes the Hetch Hetchy Water and Power Division, the Water Department and San Francisco's Clean Water Program.  As one might imagine, the challenges of this job are many, and they are varied. Andy has met those challenges with practice, intelligence, good humor, and a sense of fairness. His accomplishments are too numerous to mention here, but I would be remiss if I don't pay special tribute to his expertise on the all-important issue of California water. Water is our lifeblood in California, and the demands on our water supply and our water supply system have increased dramatically in the last generation.  Andy has been a part of that evolution. He has an institutional memory and an understanding of those issues which are born of first hand experience. He has played pivotal roles in such landmark agreements as the Bay-Deltaaccord and the settlement of Tuolumne River water rights with Turlock and Modesto Irrigation Districts. His accomplishments have been widely recognized by his peers, and he has served on numerous California water committees, including a term as Chair of the Association of California Urban Water Agencies.  Mr. President, we do not know what the future holds for Andy Moran, but we do know that his future will be met with continued success. He has been a mainstay of San Francisco's municipal government and will be greatly missed. We owe Andy a tremendous debt of gratitude, and we wish him the very best in his life ahead. Andy Moran is a true public servant.                          ____________________
