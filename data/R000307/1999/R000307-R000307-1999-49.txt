President, we have had a great deal of discussion in regard to the kind of emergency assistance we would all like to see happen in the Senate. We have heard quite a bit of debate as to what is appropriate.  I have a package that has been endorsed by about six or seven Senators--Senator Burns and Senator Santorum, more especially, who have been especially helpful--Senator Craig, Senator Grassley, Senator Grams, Senator Hagel, all of the cosponsors, to try to reach some accommodation. I am not sure, but perhaps we could conclude this debate and simply have a vote within, I would say, a half hour. I do not know what my friends and colleagues on the other side would say about that, but I make a recommendation and seek unanimous consent that debate on this amendment be for 30 minutes, with 15 minutes divided equally.  Could there be an agreement on that? I see the distinguished Democratic leader nodding his head.
