 I want to join particularly with my friend Frank Wolf, who is my good friend. We work very closely together.  Owen Pickett was the kind of Member that brought real respect to this institution. He worked on both sides of the aisle. He worked very strongly on behalf of our national security. He was a Member who was popular on both sides of the aisle. Owen Pickett and Norm Sisisky served together on this side of the aisle with Frank and me for many years.  Owen Pickett was someone who this institution could have justifiable pride in. We could look to him and say that is the kind of Member, frankly, that we all ought to be, showing respect for one another, working with one another on behalf of the American people and their security.  I rise to extend great sympathy to his family, but much more importantly than that, to give thanks on behalf of this institution and on behalf of our country for his extraordinary service.
