 President, I am today introducing a bill which would exclude the value of real property of a veteran, or a veteran's spouse or dependent, in determining how a veteran's eligibility for health care from the Department of Veterans Affair (VA) is classified. The bill would also simplify eligibility determinations by eliminating the annual self-reporting burden for veterans, and instead enable the Department to obtain income information directly from the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration.  The problem asset-rich, cash-poor veterans experience in gaining eligibility for veterans pension and health care benefits was brought to my attention late last year by one of my constituents, Larry Sundall. Larry is one of Iowa's county veterans service officers. He serves veterans in Emmet County, in northwest Iowa. In the course of his work, he was finding that many of his farmer-veteran constituents where in desperate straits with no, or little, income, but still could not qualify for VA pension programs without selling their land. Because of the value of their land, these veterans would also be classified in Category 7 for purposes of health service eligibility in the event they sought health care from the VA. Category 7 veterans can receive health care services as long as the VA has sufficient funds. However, they are required to pay co-payments for any health care they receive through the VA because of the value of their land, even if they have no income and are in debt to boot. If the administration and Congress don't appropriate enough money, these Category 7 veterans will not be eligible for health care services from the VA.  At Larry's urging, I decided to convene a meeting of interested parties in Des Moines last April to talk over this issue. Because many of his county veterans officials in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and South Dakota were encountering constituents with similar problems, we invited the associations of county veterans service officers from those states to send a representative to participate. We invited the State Veterans Affairs Officers from those states. VA staff from headquarters, regional offices, and VISNs also participated. The meeting was very useful and informative from my perspective, and I am grateful to all who participated. As it happens, the VA's Health Services Administration had already recognized the asset test as a problem for veterans and had formed a task force to look into the feasibility of eliminating the asset test. The Veterans Benefits Administration had also begun to discuss the issue. In any case, VA participants at the meeting agreed to convey the essentials of our discussion to principal officials at VA headquarters.  The problem follows from a provision of Title 38 which holds that the Secretary may deny benefits to a veteran ``. . . when the corpus of the estate of the veteran . . . is such that under all the circumstances . . . it is reasonable that some part of the corpus of such estates be consumed for the veteran's maintenance''. In other words, if the income and estate of a veteran are large enough, they should be used before the veteran receives benefits from the VA. The law also states, however, that liquidations of assets should be required only when it can be done at ``no substantial sacrifice'' to the veteran. Regulations implementing this provision of law contain essentially the same language. The complications begin with a VA manual, 21-1, which lays out criteria to be used by VA staff in adjudicating eligibility for pension and health benefits. Under the criteria set out in M21-1, the net worth of a veteran must be adjudicated when the veteran's income and net worth is greater than $50,000. Ownership of $50,000 of farm land or other real property does not automatically and inevitably mean that adjudicators will declare a farmer veteran ineligible for these VA programs. In principle, the $50,000 is just a threshold which is to trigger adjudication of a veteran's claim for benefits, not to automatically disqualify a veteran for benefits.  But there are two problems with the treatment of assets in the schema. First is the $50,000 level. It's obviously much too low, even as a trigger for adjudication. In Iowa currently, the average value of an acre of farm land is $1,781. So a farm holding valued at $50,000 would average about 28 acres, clearly two small to be viable. A 40 acre farm, at the current average value per acre, would be worth $71,240. A more viable 80 acre farm would be valued at $142,480. It seems to me, therefore, that the threshold triggering review of a farmer veteran's income and assets should be raised to $150,000. But, second, and more fundamentally, the law stipulates, as I noted earlier, that divestiture of an estate should not involve ``substantial sacrifice''. It is difficult for me to see that selling off the family farm, in many, if not most, cases, the sole source of livelihood for a farm family, would not involve substantial sacrifice. It thus seems inherently unrealistic to require a veteran to liquidate land holdings in order to become eligible for VA pension benefits or in order to pay co-payments for VA health care services.  What the bill I am introducing today would do is eliminate completely the asset test as a factor is establishing eligibility for health care services. A veteran's income, however, would still be considered in eligibility determinations. The bill would also permit the Secretary to determine the attributable income of the veteran using income date from the year preceding the prior year in the event that the Secretary is unable to use prior year data. Finally, the bill would permit the Secretary to use information obtained from the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Treasury for the purpose of determining the attributable income of a veteran.  The VA estimates that this proposal should save the VA money, Mr. President. They estimate that more than $11 million would be saved in fiscal year 2001, growing to more than $13 million in fiscal year 2005.  I ask that the full text of the bill be included in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3010       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(c) Use of Income Information From Certain Other Federal      Agencies.--Section 5317 of that title is amended--       (1) by redesignating subsections (f) and (g) as subsections      (g) and (h), respectively; and       (2) by inserting after subsection (e) the following new      subsection (f):       ``(f) In addition to any other activities under this      section, the Secretary may utilize income information      obtained under this section from the Secretary of Health and      Human Services or the Secretary of the Treasury for the      purpose of determining the attributable income of a veteran      under section 1722 of this title, in lieu of obtaining income      information directly from the veteran for that purpose.''.
