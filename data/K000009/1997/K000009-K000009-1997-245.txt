Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a community leader in my district. Johnny McCloud, a minister, an activist, and organizer in Toledo, OH died suddenly on October 23, 1997 at the age of 52 years.  Born and raised in Florida and Georgia, Johnny completed undergraduate studies and graduate studies at Southwestern Christian University, Abilene Christian University, University of South Florida, and Valdosta State College. He also attended International Seminary in Orlando, FL for post graduate work. A lifelong learner, his studies ranged from biology and medicine, to counseling and education, to administration and the Bible. He taught school, worked for the Economic Planning and Opportunity Association, and ran his own business. A noted orator, he was most known as a minister with North Side Church of Christ and Glass City Church of Christ, and as the executive director of the J. Frank Troy Senior Center in Toledo.  Johnny McCloud's civic and community work was legion. He was highly involved in many organizations, for most of which he was an officerholder, including the National Caucus and Center of Black Aged, National Black Alcoholism Council, Northwestern Ohio Regional Council on Alcoholism, Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance, Interracial Religious Coalition, EOPA of Greater Toledo, Selective Service Board, the Republican Party, Neighborhood Business and Economic Development Committee, IBPOE, Holy Hill No. 4 Chapter--AF & AM, Rachel Chapter--OES, Amaranth Chapter, Matrons Council, and Order of Masons. In all of these activities, he offered total commitment and dedication to all of these causes.  Our heartfelt prayers are with his family and friends during this extremely difficult time. May his son Willie, his mother Evelyn Parker, and sister Betty Braham find some measure of comfort and peace in the condolences and gratitude of our community.                          ____________________
