Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memorial to an Alaskan who dedicated his life to his business and making his customers feel as though they were in their own living room having a meal with friends. On January 13, 2018, Alaska lost one of its hardest working, most dedicated and adventurous fathers, Mr. George Brown.  George embodied the ``Greatest Generation'' that came to Alaska in the years following World War II. He valued hard work, personal relationships, and personal responsibility. He and his wife, Peggy founded the Lucky Wishbone diner in Anchorage, Alaska in 1955, the same year McDonalds was founded but in a much different environment, serving the best burgers, shakes and especially fried chicken you could find anywhere. Sorry Kentucky, the Colonel had nothing on Mr. Brown.  George kept the very spirit of the Greatest Generation alive up until his passing by ensuring that generations of Alaskans had simple, handcrafted diner food that was unsurpassed by any other restaurant. He also pioneered the ``smoking ban'' in Anchorage by banning smoking in the restaurant in 1991. George and Peggy's place was home to so many of us. His smile and his infectious spirit could light up a room and his sense of humor warmed the restaurant where he was a fixture for over 60 years.  George was more than a restauranteur, he was my friend. As a frequent patron of the Lucky Wishbone, I can speak to his service to customers and how he always cared for his employees as though they were immediately family. He treated his staff like they were his daughters and sons which meant everyone made you feel at home when you visited the Lucky Wishbone.  George, Peggy and the Lucky Wishbone will live in infamy in our hearts and souls. I hope that George's sister Elaine, daughter Pat, son Corky, and his grandchildren can take comfort in the bond they have with George and the legacy of the Lucky Wishbone. I also hope the precious memories of George will bring them comfort, and that they will come to find, in the lovely words of Hugh Robert Orr:  ``They are not dead who live in lives they leave behind. In those whom they have blessed, they live a life again, and shall live through the years eternal life, and shall grow each day more beautiful, as time declares their good, forgets the rest, and proves their immortality.''  Please join me in expressing heartfelt appreciation for George and sympathies for his Alaskan family.                          ____________________
