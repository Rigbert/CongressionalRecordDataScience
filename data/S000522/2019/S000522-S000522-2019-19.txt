Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of S. 2710, a bill that would prohibit the commercial export of covered munition items to the Hong Kong Police Force.  Mr. Speaker, I especially want to thank my good friend and colleague, Chairman McGovern, for his legislation, which is pretty much a companion bill that passed a little over 1 month ago, again, on the whole idea of U.S.-originated equipment being exploited in Hong Kong against these protesters. I thank him for doing that. We have raised this at hearings, and his bill was a great bill.  As the largest protest movement Hong Kong has ever seen continues, major concerns have arisen about the Hong Kong police's independence and professionalism. The people of Hong Kong are rightfully furious about well-documented cases of excessive force, brutal tactics, and tolerance of violence against protesters. The Hong Kong police themselves are now a cause of the protests.  There has been widespread police misuse of crowd control equipment and less-lethal weaponry, including incidents that have seriously injured journalists.  I am glad this bill is before us. After it passes, it goes to the President, and I fully expect he will sign it into law.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
