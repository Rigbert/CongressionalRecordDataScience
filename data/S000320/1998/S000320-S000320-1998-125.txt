 President, I rise in strong support of S. 2052, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, to authorize appropriations for intelligence-related activities and programs of the United States Government. This important legislation was reported favorably out of the Committee on May 7, 1998, by unanimous vote, consistent with the long-standing, bipartisan nature of the Select Committee on Intelligence.  Following receipt of the President's budget, the Select Committee undertook a thorough review of the budget request for intelligence for fiscal year 1999. That review was informed, in part, by several hearings and briefings as well as the findings and recommendations of a group of outside experts--known as the Technical Advisory Group--that the distinguished Vice Chairman of the Committee, Senator Kerrey, and I tasked last December to address key questions facing the Community.  In addition, the Committee staff recently completed indepth audits and reviews of the use of ``cover'' by the Central Intelligence Agency and the administration of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978. These reviews and audits led to Committee action with respect to the authorities, applicable laws, and budget of the activity or program concerned.  As a product of these reviews, the Committee came to some rather startling and disconcerting conclusions about the overall health and direction of the Intelligence Community. For example:  First, the CIA's foremost mission of providing timely intelligence based on human sources (``HUMINT'') is in grave jeopardy. CIA case officers today do not have the training or the equipment needed to keep their true identities hidden, to communicate covertly with agents, or to plant sophisticated listening devices and other collection tools that will provide timely intelligence on an adversary's intentions.  Second, what many see as the ``crown jewel'' of U.S. Intelligence--the National Security Agent's SIGINT capability--likewise is in dire need of modernization. The digital and fiber-optic revolutions are here-and-now, but NSA is still predominantly oriented toward Cold War-era threats. The Director of NSA, Lieutenant General Kenneth Minihan, has recommended major changes in how NSA performs its vital mission--changes our Committee endorses--but these changes were not reflected in the President's budget request.  Third, promising technologies and systems for detecting missiles and other threats have been short-changed in the budget request. Likewise, robust funding for new tools for conducting information warfare, new sensors to detect and counter proliferation, and moving to smaller and cheaper satellites to support the war-fighter are not included in the budget request.  And fourth, the quality of analysis within the Intelligence Community is poor and getting worse. Responding to the failure to predict the Indian nuclear tests, the Director of Central Intelligence commissioned retired Admiral David Jeremiah to review what went wrong and why. Among other findings, Admiral Jeremiah concluded that intelligence community analysts were complacent; they based their analyses on faulty assumptions; and engaged in wishful thinking. It is my belief that such is the state of analysis as it relates to many issues and problems, including political-military developments in China, the ballistic missile threat, and more. We can and should expect more from the Intelligence Community.  The Intelligence Community has been forced by budgetary pressures to choose between funding current operations (such as Bosnia) and investing in the future. This is the case even after personnel reductions of over 20 percent in the Intelligence Community have been made over the past decade. In many ways, then, the problem confronting U.S. Intelligence is similar to that confronting the Department of Defense: How to pay for the necessary investments in future, ``winning-edge'' capabilities when the policymakers emphasize current operations? And, equally important, how to sustain the quality of life and skills-level of personnel who are already stretched thin by high operations tempo and lengthy overseas deployments?  To address these challenges, Senator Kerrey and I tasked the staff to find and cut any and all poorly justified or redundant programs out of the budget. And, in fact, significant cuts were made to a wide range of lower-priority intelligence programs and activities. If it was poorly justified, redundant, or low-priority, then we cut it. These actions are entirely consistent with our oversight responsibilities, and the American people would expect no less.  The Select Committee then took those funds and applied them against the highest priority intelligence needs and targets. Earlier this year, Senator Kerrey and I prepared intelligence budget guidance to direct the staff's budget work. That guidance emphasized the need for strengthened investment in areas such as advanced research and development, counter-proliferation, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, personnel training, information operations, effective covert action, and enhanced analysis. These are precisely the areas the Committee has historically supported and the keys to future intelligence successes--whether to support military commanders, policymakers in Washington, or American diplomats.  This approach of cutting low-priority projects and redirecting those funds into high-payoff, futuristic technologies and systems, is fiscally responsible and reflects the need for difficult choices in an era of scarce resources.  This budget is full of tough choices. For example, the Committee recommended cutting certain ``legacy'' programs and activities at NSA in order to pay for the collection systems and processes of the future, as recommended in General Minihan's study of the future SIGINT architecture needs (the ``Unified Cryptologic Architecture''). Likewise, the Committee recommended cutting the number of CIA contractors, and reduced spending on costly infrastructure programs.  None of these actions were easy--and in fact I am concerned that the Select Committee may have cut the intelligence budget too deeply in order to reach agreement with the Senate Armed Services Committee. That being said, this legislation is sound, it is balanced, and it is worthy of strong bipartisan support.  My colleagues and the American people must come to understand that to save lives on the battlefield, to preclude terrorist attacks against Americans, to root out spies in our midst, and to give diplomats the information they need to forestall conflict in the first place, we need an effective, revitalized Intelligence Community. And that it is precisely what the Intelligence Authorization Act seeks to do.  In summary, the Select Committee made the tough choices. We cut programs in order to invest in the future. We concluded that the intelligence budget can be cut, but it must be done in a careful, precise way, and based on specific programmatic recommendations. And we did it in a fully bipartisan manner.  I applaud and appreciate the efforts of the Vice Chairman of the Committee, Senator Kerrey from Nebraska, and all the Members of the Committee, who labored long and hard on this bill. It is one of the most important pieces of legislation this body will consider this year, and I urge its passage.  Pursuant to the unanimous consent agreement, the Armed Services Committee has been discharged from consideration of the Intelligence Authorization Bill. Although the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee and I had previously agreed that the Armed Services Committee would not report the Intelligence Authorization Bill until three days following completion of Senate Floor consideration of the Defense Authorization Bill, the Chairman of the Armed Services Committee has informed me that his committee has completed its review of the Intelligence Authorization Bill and does not recommend any amendments. We agree that it is appropriate for the Senate to consider the intelligence Authorization Bill at this time. We also agree, however, that this unanimous consent agreement to discharge the Armed Services Committee from further review of the Intelligence Authorization Bill will not serve as a precedent for requiring the Armed Services Committee to report future Intelligence Authorization Bills until it has had an adequate amount of time to review such legislation.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the cost estimate for the bill.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 1998.     Hon. Richard C. Shelby,     Chairman, Select Committee on Intelligence, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for S. 2052, the      Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Dawn      Sauter, who can be reached at 226-2840.           Sincerely,                                                  June E. O'Neill,                                                         Director.       Enclosure.   S. 2052: Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, as  Reported by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on May 7, 1998                                summary       S. 2052 would authorize appropriations for fiscal year 1999      for intelligence activities of the United States government,      the Community Management Account, and the Central      Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System      (CIARDS).       This estimate addresses only the unclassified portion of      the bill. On that limited basis, CBO estimates that enacting      S. 2052 would result in additional spending of $174 million      over the 1999-2003 period, assuming appropriation of the      authorized amounts. The unclassified portion of the bill      would affect direct spending; thus, pay-as-you-go procedures      would apply. However, CBO cannot give a precise estimate of      the direct spending effects because data to support a cost      estimate are classified.       The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) excludes      from application of the act legislative provisions that are      necessary for the national security. CBO has determined that      all of the provisions of this bill either fit within that      exclusion or do not contain intergovernmental or private-     sector mandates as defined by UMRA.                estimated cost to the federal government       The estimated budgetary impact of the unclassified portions      of S. 2052 is shown in the following table. CBO is unable to      obtain the necessary information to estimate the costs for      the entire bill because parts are classified at a level above      clearances held by CBO employees. The costs of this      legislation fall within budget function 050 (national      defense).----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                      By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------                                        1998         1999         2000         2001         2002         2003----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                        SPENDING SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION Spending Under Current Law for the Community Management Account:    Budget Authority \1\..........           94            0            0            0            0            0    Estimated Outlays.............          104           36            7            2            0            0Proposed Changes:    Authorization Level...........            0          174            0            0            0            0    Estimated Outlays.............            0          108           52           10            3            0Spending Under S. 2052 for the Community Management Account:    Authorization Level \2\.......           94          174            0            0            0            0    Estimated Outlays.............          104          144           59           12            3            0                                            CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING Estimated Budget Authority........            0            0        (\2\)        (\2\)        (\2\)        (\2\)Estimated Outlays.................            0            0        (\2\)        (\2\)        (\2\)        (\2\)----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ The 1998 level is the amount appropriated for that year.\2\ CBO cannot give a precise estimate of direct spending effects because data to support a cost estimate are  classified.       The bill would authorize appropriations of $174 million for      the Community Management Account. In addition, the bill would      authorize $202 million for CIARDS to cover retirement costs      attributable to military service and various unfunded      liabilities. The payment to CIARDS is considered mandatory,      and the authorization under this bill would be the same as      assumed in the CBO baseline.       Section 401 of the bill would extend the CIA's authority to      offer incentive payments to employees who voluntarily retire      or resign. This authority, which is currently scheduled to      expire at the end of fiscal year 1999, would be extended      through fiscal year 2001. Section 401 would also require the      CIA to make a deposit to the Civil Service Trust Fund equal      to 15 percent of final pay for each employee who accepts an      incentive payment. CBO estimates that these payments would      amount to less than $5 million. We believe that these      deposits would be sufficient to cover the cost of any long-     term increase in benefits that would result from induced      retirements, although the timing of the agency payments and      the additional benefit payments would not match on a yearly      basis. CBO cannot provide a precise estimate of the direct      spending effects because the data necessary for an estimate      are classified.       Section 501 of the bill would require the President to      inform certain federal employees and contract employees that      they may disclose classified and unclassified information to      Congressional oversight committees if they believe that      information provides direct and specific evidence of      wrongdoing. CBO estimates that the costs of implementing      section 501 would not be significant because the number of      employees covered by the bill would be small and the cost      associated with each notice would be minimal.       For purposes of this estimate, CBO assumes that S. 2052      will be enacted by October 1, 1998, and that the full amounts      authorized will be appropriated for fiscal year 1999. Outlays      are estimated according to historical spending patterns for      intelligence programs.                      pay-as-you-go considerations       Section 401 of the bill would affect direct spending, and      therefore the bill would be subject to pay-as-you-go      procedures. CBO cannot estimate the precise direct spending      effects because the necessary data are classified.              intergovernmental and private sector impact       The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) excludes      from application of the act legislative provisions that are      necessary for the national security. CBO has determined that      all of the provisions of this bill either fit within that      exclusion or do not contain intergovernmental or private-     sector mandates as defined by UMRA.                         previous cbo estimate       On May 5, 1998, CBO issued an estimate for H.R. 3694, the      Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999, as      ordered reported by the House Permanent Select Committee on      Intelligence. CBO estimated that section 401 of that bill      would increase direct spending by     $1 million or more in at least one year during the 2000-2003      period. Like section 401 in S. 2052, the provisions in H.R.      3694 would extend the CIA's authority to offer incentive      payments to employees who voluntarily retire or resign.      However, H.R. 3694 would not require the CIA to make a      deposit equal to 15 percent of final pay to the Civil Service      Trust Fund for each employee who receives an incentive      payment. The bills also authorize different amounts of      appropriations for the Community Management Account.       CBO prepared a cost estimate on February 25, 1998, for S.      1668, as reported by the Senate Select Committee on      Intelligence on February 23, 1998. Section 501 of S. 2052      duplicates the provisions of S. 1668, a bill to encourage the      disclosure to Congress of certain classified and related      information. CBO's estimates for these provisions are      identical.
