 President, again I think we are going to know in a moment whether we will need to debate the Nunn-Biden posse comitatus amendment, but in the meantime while that is being ironed out, I ask my friend from Utah whether or not Senator Brown is available to introduce his amendment. I think that is the only thing we have left.
