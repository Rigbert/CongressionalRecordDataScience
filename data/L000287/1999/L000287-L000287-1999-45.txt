Mr. Speaker, I am a member of an African American church. I grew up in an African American church, a Baptist church. I attended seminary, and am a licensed and ordained Baptist minister. But I believe in the separation of church and state.  If the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Traficant) wants to consider and call the Bill of Rights mumbo jumbo, that is all right, he has that right, but for me and my house, I am going to stand with the Founding Fathers, not with the gentleman from Ohio.
