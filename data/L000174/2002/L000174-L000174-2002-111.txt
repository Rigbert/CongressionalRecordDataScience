President, I want to make sure that it is clearly stated and make sure it is clear in the Record. The charter changes for the American Legion, the charter changes for AMVETS, the charter changes for Veterans of Foreign Wars are in a separate bill that has the Republican hold on it. However, there is no opposition from members of the Judiciary Committee. Iam told there is no Democrat who opposes those charter changes. I am told that every Democrat in the Senate is perfectly willing to pass the charter changes for the American Legion, for the AMVETS, and for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and as soon as the Republican hold is lifted on the charter changes for the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the American Legion, and AMVETS, we can pass it.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
