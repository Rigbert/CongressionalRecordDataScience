 So I say to my colleagues that if all time is used, we will be on the bill shortly after midnight tomorrow night, and then we would have to begin to offer amendments under the regular order.  Chairman Murkowski is ready to start that process on the floor tomorrow whenever that may occur--whether it is during the day by agreement or whether it is in the middle of the night without agreement.  I encourage Senators on both sides of the aisle to file their amendments and get them in the queue.                          ____________________
