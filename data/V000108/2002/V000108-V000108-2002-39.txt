Speaker, it is with great pride and enthusiasm that I congratulate the national champion Hammond Robotics Team. the team, which comprises students from all racial, cultural, and economic walks of life, finished in first place for the second consecutive year at the US FIRST national competition in Orlando, FL.  The members of the national champion Hammond Robotics Team are: Amanda Aldridge, Jasmine Barnett, Justin Clark, David Clinton, Ryan Gawron, Mike Goril, Ethan Grove, Eugene Hanas, Elyse Holguin, Khamicia Jarrett, Kristyn Kapetanovic, Kevin Kolodziej, Omar Martin, Sarah Michna, Luis Moreno, Amanda Morrison, Julia Novak, Shane Ostapchuk, Michael Phillips, Christina Polka, and Michael Smith.  US FIRST is an organization dedicated to motivating America's youth about science, technology, and engineering through hands-on methods. The program involves a unique blend of problem solving and competition that prepares students for real world situations. During the competition, teams face off against each other and are given a limited amount of time to devise both an offensive and defensive strategy for accomplishing a specific task. Team Hammond conquered the challenge. While nearly 1,000 teams nationwide were involved in the US FIRST competition, Team Hammond came out on top.  Although Team Hammond has enjoyed a high level of success through the years, the team's triumphs have not come without adversity. Though many of the teams at the National Competition enjoyed significant corporate financial underwriting, Team Hammond had to work extremely hard to secure funding for both the regional and national competition. Through numerous fundraising efforts and private sponsorships, Team Hammond took the necessary initiative and was able to secure the necessary funding for its worthy program.  However, perhaps the most applaudable aspect of Team Hammond's success is the various backgrounds from which the team members come. The team is comprised of students from all four of Hammond's high schools and reflects the diversity on which northwest Indiana prides itself. This diversity is, for the Hammond Robotics Program, the rule rather than the exception and it should be commended.  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I congratulate Team Hammond for its second consecutive year as national champions and third national championship overall at the US FIRST national competition. The young men and women of the team worked hard towards a goal and their efforts paid off. I hope that the rest of my colleagues will join with me in applauding Team Hammond's commendable effort.                          ____________________
