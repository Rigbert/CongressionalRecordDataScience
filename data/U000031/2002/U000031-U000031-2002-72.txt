Speaker, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize Catholic Schools Week, a time set aside to acknowledge the accomplishments of the Catholic schools of our nation. Catholic schools have displayed an exemplary ability to educate the youth of our great country. They have shown their dedication to the students whom they serve, providing tuition assistance to the vast majority of their students and an ample number of teachers in order to ensure that each child gets the attention he or she needs to succeed. Moreover, Catholic schools maintain a diverse student body, with children from all income levels, racial and ethnic groups, and religious backgrounds receiving an education within their walls.  In order to find proof of the accomplishments of Catholic schools here in the United States, one need only examine the caliber of the students they produce. An impressive ninety-seven percent of Catholic school graduates continue their education on a postsecondary level. African-American and Latino students advance to college at thrice the rate of their public school counterparts, making clear the commitment of Catholic schools to all children. These successes have led to a dramatic increase in demand on the part of Catholic schools, with current enrollment at over 2\1/2\ million students and almost half of Catholic schools currently maintaining a waiting list for admission.  Among those schools living up to such stellar standards are the fifteen Catholic schools located in Michigan's Sixth Congressional District, which I represent here in Washington. I would like to offer my congratulations to the many individuals who have contributed to these schools, including students, parents, teachers, and administrators. Due to the hard work and ongoing efforts of these individuals, Catholic schools have become an inspiration to those everywhere who care deeply about education.                          ____________________
