President, I rise today to recognize a distinguished group of World War II veterans from Kansas who are now visiting their Nation's Capital this week as part of the Honor Flight Network.  The Honor Flight Network is an organization with the main mission to give veterans the opportunity to visit their memorials on the National Mall, free of cost to the veteran. The veterans who participate are many times unsung heroes of World War II, and in many cases their remembrances and their stories are shared for the first time and become public for the first time for families and hometowns. In many cases, young people traveling with these veterans hear the stories and can put the stories of these famous battles that protected our country in their local newspapers and in their school newspapers. It is history--it is history shared, lessons learned, and certainly renewed thanks to the ``greatest generation.''  Many of these veterans are in their eighties and nineties. There are fewer than 20,000 World War II veterans in Kansas. As time marches on, that number only decreases. Nationwide, the VA estimates that approximately 740 members of the ``greatest generation'' pass each day. So I am especially pleased that this Tuesday a group of 28 veterans will fly in to our Nation's Capital from Kansas to see their World War II memorial, and other memorials, and allow us the privilege to pay homage to their heroism. With five regional hubs in Kansas, there is a steady stream of veteran groups making their way to our Nation's Capital. The leaders of these groups include Brian Spencer and Bill Patterson leading the Honor Flight Kansas Student Edition from Lyndon, KS; Adrianne McDaniel and Peggy Hill, who lead the Jackson Heights Honor Flight; Beverly Mortimer and Denise Cyr head up the North Central Kansas Honor Flight out of Concordia, KS; Mike Kastle and Jeff True guide the Southern Coffey County High School Honor Flight out of Leroy, KS; and finally, the leaders of this group coming in on Tuesday are Mike VanCampen and Lowell Downey.  These hub leaders and the many volunteers deserve our recognition for the hours of work, organization, and fundraising that go into planning these trips. Thank you for what you do and for setting such a fine example in remembering and honoring the sacrifices made by those who stood in defense of our country in World War II.  Kansans and all Americans should know that this program--as a matter of fact, the World War II Memorial itself would not even exist without our former Senate majority leader, the senior Senator from Kansas and a World War II veteran himself, Bob Dole. Bob was instrumental in bringing the World War II Memorial to the National Mall. And even now Bob meets personally with Honor Flight groups who make their way out to see their memorial. When veterans learn that Bob Dole is at the World War II memorial, there is a crush of veterans like a flock of chickens going to the mother hen. I am not sure Bob Dole will appreciate that allegory, but at least I think that indicates everybody comes to hear him and thank him for his efforts.  Finally, I wish to recognize each member of this Honor Flight trip from Kansas visiting their memorial, and I ask unanimous consent that their names be printed in the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Kansas Honor Flight Network Trip--July 31-Aug. 2, 2012--World War II                         and Korean War Veterans                         World War II Veterans       Dwight E.
