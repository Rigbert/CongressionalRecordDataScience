Speaker, I yield myself 1\1/2\ minutes.  Mr. Speaker, across generations, Presidencies are often associated with one famous utterance: ``Ask not what your country can do for you,'' ``The only thing we have to fear,'' ``Tear down this wall.'' And our current President will be no different: ``If you like your health care plan, you can keep it, period.''  For the last 3 years, the President repeated this promise in selling his signature law, and he did so with the knowledge that it would not be met. Millions of Americans, including nearly 250,000 in Michigan, took the President at his word and now, unexpectedly, are receiving cancelation notices. They are confused, worried, and upset. Today we stand with those families with the Keep Your Health Plan Act.  This bill is to help provide peace of mind to folks like the farmer in Bangor, Michigan, who just found out after purchasing his family's insurance for the last 30 years that he will be able to keep that plan no more. And the sticker shock will be unbearable, as the premiums double and their deductible jumps nearly $3,000. Sadly, they are not alone. For millions of Americans, it is cancelations today, sticker shock tomorrow.  For the last 6 weeks, the White House stood idly by, ignoring the pleas of millions. But as the administration's allies in Congress panicked, the White House went from attacking our thoughtful bill to making an end runaround Congress with a universal ``fix.''  Our straightforward one-page bill says if you like your current coverage, you should be able to keep it. The President should heed his own advice and work with us, the Congress, as the Founders intended, not around the legislative process.  Everyone today should embrace the Keep Your Health Plan Act, and our efforts to protect Americans from the damage of this law should not stop there. Let's keep the promise.  I reserve the balance of my time.
