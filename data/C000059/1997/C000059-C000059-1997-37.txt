Speaker, California's 43d Congressional District has been extremely fortunate to have many dedicated citizens who have been willing to contribute their time and talents to help make our community an exceptionally good place in which to live and work. One of the most dedicated and active of these citizens has been Judge Manuel Real.  Manuel Real is a U.S. district judge for the Central District of California, a position he has held since being appointed by then-President Lyndon Johnson in 1966. On Friday, October 10, 1997, I will be honored to participate in the opening of a new elementary school in Mead Valley, CA named in honor of Judge Real for is many years of service to the great State of California.  Judge Real first began his distinguished legal career as an assistant U.S. attorney. He left for a short time to enter into private practice before rejoining U.S. Attorney's office until he was appointed a U.S. district judge. During his tenure with the central district court, Judge Real served as the chief judge of the court from 1982-1993.  The students of the new Manuel Real Elementary School should strive to emulate the accomplishments of their school's namesake as well as his dedication to improving the community and its overall quality of life. On behalf of the citizens of the 43d Congressional District, I want to add to this tribute my congratulations, and to wish Manuel, his wife Stella, and their four children best wishes for a happy and productive future.                          ____________________
