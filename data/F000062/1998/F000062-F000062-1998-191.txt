  I must say that I think what is happening here is unfortunate. I think what we are seeing overwhelmingly all across the United States is a state of medical care and health insurance in this country that is becoming much more oriented toward business and much less oriented toward medicine. And this is prompting, I think, all across this land a terrible situation for physicians and for patients.  What prompted me to introduce this bill was two California women who wrote to me. I want to read them to you and enter their full statements in the Record.  One was from a woman in Newark, CA. And she wrote--and this was almost 2\1/2\ years ago--that she had a modified radical mastectomy as an outpatient at the Fremont Kaiser outpatient clinic. She was operated on at11:30 in the morning and was released at 4:30 that afternoon, with no attempt made to see if she could even walk to the bathroom. She was 60 years old. And the discovery of cancer and the subsequent surgery were extremely draining both emotionally and psychologically.  That is one case. Same day. Let me read you about another case.       My mastectomy and lymph node removal took place at 7:30      a.m., November 13. I was released at 2:30 p.m. that same day.      I received notice, the day before surgery, from my doctor      that mastectomy was an outpatient procedure at Kaiser and I'd      be released the same day. Shocked by this news, I told my      surgeon of my previous complications with anesthesia and the      fact that I have a cervical spine condition, which adds an      additional consideration for any surgery.  Then she goes on and she says:       While in a groggy, postoperative daze, swimming in pain and      nausea, I was given some perfunctory instructions on how to      empty the two bloody drains attached to my body. I was told      to dress myself and go home. My doctor's written chart      instructions for a room assignment, if I developed acute      nausea or pain, were ignored by the nursing staff.  This is the problem we are trying to stop right here and now. I frankly am sorry that the bill isn't broader. But this is something whose cost is small--$100 million. We know it can be accommodated. We know we can get the job done.  This bill is simple. It requires every insurance plan in the United States of America to cover the hospital length of stay determined by the physician to be medically necessary. It does not prescribe a fixed number of days. It does not set a minimum. It leaves the length of the hospital stay for the mastectomy up to the treating physician.  Secondly, it requires health insurance plans to cover breast reconstruction following a mastectomy.  Thirdly, it requires insurance plans to cover breast prostheses and complications of mastectomy, including lymphedema.  And, finally, it prohibits insurance plans from financially penalizing or rewarding a physician for providing medically necessary care or for referring a patient for a second opinion.  This is a simple bill. It is a direct bill. It is going to directly benefit the lives of tens of thousands of women. I regret that it isn't more comprehensive. But we know it is doable, we know what it does, and we know women will immediately be better off because of it.  So I am very proud to stand here with my colleague from New York and with others in the Senate. The great bulk of women Senators are supporting this. This is tangible; it is doable. We believe it can become law quickly. And we say, let us seize the moment and let us accomplish at least this for women of America.  So I thank my colleague from New York for his authorship. I was very proud to be an original sponsor on this bill. We did have a hearing. We have tried to get the job done before, but hopefully it will get done this morning.  As an original cosponsor of S. 249, the Women's Health and Cancer Rights Act, I am pleased to sponsor the amendment on mastectomy hospital length of stay that Senator D'Amato is urging the Senate to consider. It is time to pass it.  Senator D'Amato and I introduced this amendment as a bill on January 30, 1997, 16 months ago. The Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on the bill, S. 249, on November 5, 1997. We have filed this as an amendment, to be considered by the Senate, three times:  On March 16, we filed it as an amendment to H.R. 2646, the Parent and Student Savings Account PLUS Act.  On May 6, we filed it as an amendment to H. R. 2676, the IRS restructuring bill.  On March 31 and on February 10 of this year, Senator D'Amato offered it as an amendment in the Finance Committee.  In sum, we have made numerous efforts to get the Senate to consider this bill.  The D'Amato-Feinstein mastectomy bill has 21 cosponsors, including a bipartisan group of women Senators: Senators Snowe, Moseley-Braun, Kay Bailey Hutchison, Mikulski and Boxer.  This amendment has four important provisions: For treatment of breast cancer:       1. It requires insurance plans to cover the hospital length      of stay determined by the physician to be medically      necessary. Importantly, our bill does not prescribe a fixed      number of days or set a minimum. It leaves the length of      hospital stay up to the treating physician.       2. It requires health insurance plans to cover breast      reconstruction following a mastectomy.       3. It requires insurance plans to cover breast prostheses      and complications of mastectomy, including lymphodemas. For      treatment of all cancers:       4. It prohibits insurance plans from financially penalizing      or rewarding a physician for providing medically necessary      care or for referring a patient for a second opinion  Let me share with you two firsthand experiences, two California women describing their treatment by insurance companies in having a mastectomy.  Nancy Couchot, age 60, of Newark, California, wrote me that she had a modified radical mastectomy on November 4, 1996, at 11:30 a.m. and was released by 4:30 p.m. She could not walk and the hospital staff did not help her ``even walk to the bathroom.'' She says, ``Any woman, under these circumstances, should be able to opt for an overnight stay to receive professional help and strong pain relief.''  Victoria Berck, of Los Angeles, wrote that she had a mastectomy and lymph node removal at 7:30 a.m. on November 13, 1996, and was released from the hospital 7 hours later, at 2:30 p.m. Ms. Berck was given instructions on how to empty two drains attached to her body and sent home. She concludes, ``No civilized country in the world has mastectomy as an outpatient procedure.''  These are but two examples of what, unfortunately, is symptomatic of a growing trend and a national nightmare--insurance plans interfering with professional medical judgment and arbitrarily reducing care without a medical basis.  Premature discharges for mastectomy, with insurance plans strong-arming physicians to send women home, are one glaring example of the growing torrent of abuses faced by patients and physicians who have to ``battle'' with their HMOs to get coverage of the care that physicians believe is medically necessary.  Increasingly, insurance companies are reducing inpatient hospital coverage and pressuring physicians to discharge patients who have had mastectomies. This is beyond the pale. It is unconscionable.  The Wall Street Journal on November 6, 1996, reported that ``some health maintenance organizations are creating an uproar by ordering that mastectomies be performed on an outpatient basis. At a growing number of HMOs, surgeons must document `medical necessity' to justify even a one-night hospital admission.''  A July 7, 1997 study by the Connecticut Office of Health Care Access found the average hospital length of stay for breast cancer patients undergoing mastectomies decreased from three days in 1991 and 1993 to two days in 1994 and 1995. This study said, ``The percentage of mastectomy patients discharged after one-day stays grew about 700 percent from 1991 to 1996.''  In the last ten years, the length of overnight hospital stays for mastectomies has declined from 4 to 6 days to 2 to 3 days to, in some cases, ``no days.'' The average cost of one day in a community hospital in 1995 nationwide was $968.00. In California, in 1997, the average cost for one day was $1,329.77. When insurance plans refuse to cover a hospital stay, most Californians have difficulty coughing up $1,300.00. They are forced to go home.  In 1997, over 180,000 women (or one in every 8 American women) were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and 44,000 women died from breast cancer. Only lung cancer causes more cancer deaths in American women. 2.6 million American women are living with breast cancer today.  In my state, this year, 19,399 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer and 4,585 will die. The San Francisco Bay Area has some of the highest rates of breast cancer in the world. According to the Northern California Cancer Center, San Francisco's 9-county area's rate of breast cancer in 1994 was 50 percent higher than most European countries and 5 times higher than Japan. In September 1997, the Northern California Cancer Center gave us some mixed news: ``The good news is we're seeing the rates go down. The bad news is we don't know why,'' said Angela WittPrehn. But officials there say, the bottom line is that incidence rates are still higher than national rates.  After a mastectomy, patients must cope with pain from the surgery, with drainage tubes and with psychological loss--the trauma of an amputation. These patients need medical care from trained professionals, medical care that they cannot provide themselves at home.  A woman fighting for her life and her dignity should not also be saddled with a battle with her health insurance plan. A physician trying to provide medically necessary care  As the National Breast Cancer Coalition wrote me on March 12, 1998: ``The NBCC applauds this effort and believes this compromise will put an end to the dangerous health insurance practices that allow cost and not medical evidence to determine when a woman leaves a hospital after breast cancer surgery.''  Insurance plans also refuse to cover breast reconstruction and breast prostheses. Our bill requires coverage.  Joseph Aita, Executive Vice President and Medical Director of LifeGuard, was quoted in the San Jose, California, Mercury News, as saying ``Looking normal is not medically necessary.''  Let me contradict Mr. Aita. Looking normal is medically necessary. Breast reconstruction is important to recovery. According to Dr. Ronald Iverson, a Stanford University surgeon, ``Breast reconstruction is a reconstructive and not a cosmetic procedure.''  He cites a study which found that 84 percent of plastic surgeons reported up to 10 patients each who were denied insurance coverage for reconstruction of the removed breast. This could mean 40,000 cases per year.  Commendably, my state has enacted a law requiring coverage of breast reconstruction after a mastectomy. We need a national standard, covering all insurance policies. Let's follow California's need.  Finally, our amendment prohibits insurance plans from including financial or other incentives to influence the care a doctor's provides, similar to a law passed by the California legislature last year. Many physicians have complained that insurance plans include financial bonuses or other incentives for cutting patient visits or for not referring patients to specialists. Our bill bans financial incentives linked to how a doctor provides care. Our intent is to restore medical decision-making to health care.  For example, a California physician wrote me, ``Financial incentives under managed care plans often remove access to pediatric specialty care.'' A June 1995 report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute cited the suit filed by the husband of a 34-year old California woman who died from colon cancer, claiming that HMO incentives encouraged her physicians not to order additional tests that could have saved her life.  Our amendment today tries to restore professional medical decisionmaking to medical doctors, those whom we trust to take care of us. It should not take an act of Congress to guarantee good health care, but unfortunately that is where we are today. As the National Breast Cancer Coalition wrote us on March 12, ''. . . until guaranteed access to quality health care coverage and service is available for all women and their families, there are some very serious patient concerns that must be met. Without meaningful health care reform, market forces propel the changes in the health care system and women are at risk of being forced to pay the price by having inappropriate limits placed on their access to quality health care.''  This amendment is an important protection for millions of Americans who face the fear, the reality and the costs of cancer every day. When any cancer strikes, it is not just the victim who suffers. It becomes a family matter.  Today I say, enough is enough. It is time for this Senate, for this Congress to send a strong message to insurance companies that we must put care back into health care. Medical decisions must be made by medical professionals, not anonymous insurance clerks.  I ask unanimous consent to have items I referred to previously printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Newark, CA, November 16, 1996.     Senator Feinstein.     Senator Boxer.       I recently called your office to express my anger at having      been forced on Nov. 4 to have a modified radical mastectomy      as an outpatient at the Fremont Kaiser Outpatient Clinic. I      was operated on at 11:30 am and was released by 4:30 with no      attempt made to see if I could even walk to the bathroom.       I am 60 years old and the discovery of cancer and the      subsequent surgery was extremely draining both emotionally      and psychologically. I feel that Kaiser completely      disregarded these feelings, along with my fear of coming home      so soon with no professional help. We received a call from      Kaiser the following morning but visit by a home health      nurse.       Any woman, under these circumstances, should be able to opt      for an overnight stay to receive professional help and strong      pain relief.       I am interested in your view of this issue. Contact me if      you want further details.                                                    Nancy Couchot.       Sorry I am still wobbly writing.                                  ____              [From the Los Angeles Times, Nov. 21, 1996]                     Outpatient Mastectomy Surgery       My thanks to Ellen Goodman for ``The Latest HMO Outrage:      Drive-Thru Mastectomy'' (Commentary, Nov. 18). Last week I      became an uninformed victim of this inhumane practice at      Kaiser-Permanente, Los Angeles.       I want to acquaint women with my firsthand experience of      this degradation and urge my fellow HMO patients to contact      their Washington legislators.       My mastectomy and lymph node removal took place at 7:30      a.m., Nov. 13. I was released at 2:30 p.m. that same day. I      received notice, the day before surgery, from my doctor that      mastectomy was an outpatient procedure at Kaiser and I'd be      released the same day. Shocked by this news, I told my      surgeon of my previous complications with anesthesia and the      fact that I have a cervical spine condition, which adds an      additional consideration for any surgery. The pleasant doctor      assured me that I'd be admitted, for the night, if I      experienced excessive pain or nausea. This was noted in my      chart.       In the recovery room and the holding area, I felt like a      wounded soldier in a hospital tent during the Civil War. I      was surrounded by moaning patients and placed directly next      to a screaming infant. When I finally found a voice, I      shouted, ``Get me out of here!'' A nurse flitted by, shot me      a disapproving glance, and commented, ``Some folks just don't      know when to be grateful.'' This was the ultimate      humiliation.       While in a groggy, postoperative daze, swimming in pain and      nausea, I was given some perfunctory instructions on how to      empty the two bloody drains attached to my body. I was told      to dress myself and go home. My doctor's written chart      instructions for a room assignment, if I developed acute      nausea or pain, were ignored by the nursing staff. Obviously,      the reassurance had been given to placate me at the time of      my discussion with the doctor but everyone knew an overnight      stay was against Kaiser hospital rules. Everyone knew, except      me. I had no time to mourn the loss of my breast or regain a      sense of composure.       This experience was especially shocking because four years      previously, I had undergone a hysterectomy and received      excellent treatment and a four-night stay at the very same      Kaiser facility.       We women can allow ourselves to be discounted or we can      demand more from the HMOs. No civilized country in the world      has mastectomy as an outpatient procedure.                                                   Victoria Berck.
