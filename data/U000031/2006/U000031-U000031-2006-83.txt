Speaker, I look forward to working with the gentleman to clarify the rules. It is very important that broadcasters know precisely what the rules are. We can do a better job.  We are taking the Senate legislation as it was passed. I think we had some better language in the House. I look forward to working with you and other Members on both sides of the aisle to make this a bipartisan effort and lay those ground rules out so everyone, whether it is listeners or broadcasters, knows precisely the rules of the road and hopefully will not get into trouble for it. I thank the gentleman for his input all along in the process.
