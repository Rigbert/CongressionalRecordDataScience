Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague, the gentleman from Texas, for his help on the manager's amendment. His amendment is included in it.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment makes a number of technical and conforming changes to the underlying attacks of H.R. 2202, and in addition it includes several amendments that were proposed by several of my colleagues; specifically, the gentleman from California, Mr. Cox, the gentlemen from Florida, Mr. Foley and Mr. McCollum, and the gentlemen from California, Mr. Dornan, Mr. Gallegly, and Mr. Campbell, were each responsible for significant portions of this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
