 President, let me add to the remarks of the majority leader that I, too, believe it is important to have a farm bill. It has been a challenging process, to say the least, for our negotiators, but they continue to make progress. I, too, am optimistic that we can get there. I think it is important to the country that we do getthere. This extension we just passed was regretfully necessary, but it doesn't lessen in any way the need to get a farm bill, a 5- or 6-year extension, depending upon what is negotiated. We are continuing to work along those lines and hope to get there.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
