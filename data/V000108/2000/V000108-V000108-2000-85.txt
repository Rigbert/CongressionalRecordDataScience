Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I also rise in strong support of the English amendment, and want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. English), my good friend, for offering this.  While I am concerned about the general funding levels for the Department of Commerce, and recognize that we are already $19 million below the request, I do think that we need to ensure that the promises that have been made in the past, whether it be on NAFTA, whether it be on the World Trade Organization, or more recently, permanent most-favored-nation status on China, which I happened to oppose at the last issue, as well as NAFTA, be kept, now that a vote has taken place in the House of Representatives.  We need to ensure that we have adequate personnel so that we can enforce those promises, and to ensure that everyone is abiding by international trade statutes, U.S. trade statutes, so those in America who work for a living and who in 1998 made a nickel less for their average hour's worth of work than they did in 1980 are ensured that our departments are on the job and protecting their interests.  I do thank the gentleman for offering this amendment.
