President, over the past few months, we have heard a variety of justifications for why now is not the time to repeal don't ask, don't tell.  Opponents of repeal have said that we should wait for our military leaders to call for change. Well, in the past year, the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--the two highest-ranking military leaders in America--have told us now is the time for Congress to act.  We have been told that we should wait for the results of the Pentagon study on the effects of ending don't ask, don't tell and recommendations for implementing its repeal. We now have the results of that study. It concludes that the risks associated with overturning don't ask, don't tell are low, with thorough preparation.
