President, today I am introducing legislation along with Senator Lautenberg to help communities voluntarily reduce the number of guns in their homes and on their streets. There are over 200 million guns in America today. Alarmingly, that is almost one for every man, woman, and child in this country. Of those 200 million guns, 66 million are hand guns and the number of assault weapons is increasing. Although statistics show a 4.7% decrease in the rate of firearm-related injuries from 1996 to 1997, the rate of a firearm-related injuries is still unacceptably high.  More than 600,000 gun crimes are committed in the United States each year. On average, approximately 200 people are wounded by guns and approximately 88 people are killed by guns everyday. Twelve American children, under the age of 19, are killed by guns everyday. The rate of accidental shooting deaths for children under the age of 15 in the United States is nine times higher than the rate of the other 25 industrialized nations combined. Firearm homicides are the second leading cause of death for youth 15-24. Firearm suicide is the third leading cause of death in this age group. Handguns account for nearly 70% of firearm suicides among all age groups. Guns kept in the home for self-protection are three times more likely to kill a friend or a relative than an intruder.  The human cost of gun violence is great. Saving families from senseless deaths caused by gun violence is long over due. Reducing the number of guns in our homes and in our streets is essential to curbing gun violence in this country.  In economic terms, it is estimated that the lifetime medical costs of the 134,445 gunshot injuries in the United States in 1994 was $2.3 billion. The average medical cost per injury was about $17,000. The medical cost of gunshot injuries due to assaults was about $1.7 billion. Taxpayers paid 49% or $1.1 billion of these medical costs. The estimated indirect costs of gunshot injuries, the value of lost productivity due to fatal and non-fatal injuries, was about $19.7 billion in 1994.  There are also non-economic costs which include pain and suffering of the survivors, the fear which inevitably permeates all strata of society, the societal and emotional stress on both adults and children, and the influence gun related violence can have on a community.  The multiple costs of gun-related injuries--the human cost, the economic cost, and the non-economic cost--amount to an exceedingly costly epidemic and make finding a solution to gun violence a top priority. Unfortunately, there is no single cure for this disease. However, voluntary gun reduction programs that provide a means to reducing the number of weapons on the streets and in children's homes are an important step to creating safe and healthy environments.  That is why I have introduced the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act of 2000. The purpose of this Act is to voluntarily reduce the number of guns in circulation by aiding State and local law enforcement departments that wish to conduct gun reduction programs to create safer homes and safer streets.  Under the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act, law enforcement officials would be permitted to--  (1) accept voluntary surrender of firearms from individuals seeking to dispose of them;  (2) provide gift certificates or other goods in exchange for firearms;  (3) provide cash in exchange for firearms, in a value not to exceed a percentage of the estimated cost of a new firearm of the same type; or  (4) use any other innovative approach to encourage a voluntary reduction in the number of firearms in local communities.  This legislation would authorize $15 million for grants to States or local units of government to conduct these programs.  A program may include a criminal background check regarding the ownership of each firearm or may offer amnesty from such background checks, provided that the policy regarding criminal background checks is uniformly applied. Whenever any firearm is surrendered under this Act, State or local units of government shall inquire whether such firearm is needed as evidence. If the surrendered gun is not needed as evidence, it shall be destroyed --thus preventing the potential recycling of guns and possible illegal use. Any firearm that is a curio or relic or that has historic significance shall be donated to a State or local museum for display.  Safe Homes-Safe Streets programs would provide an excellent way for communities to draw attention to the problem of gun violence, which is fueled by the widespread, easy availability of firearms. Gun reduction programs under the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act would also serve as a catalyst for local communities and neighborhood organizations to work with law enforcement in a collaborative manner. Moreover, gun reduction programs under the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act would encourage citizens to become more involved in the fight against gun violence.  Most importantly, the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act would eliminate tens of thousands of guns from our homes and streets. With fewer guns in American homes, fewer guns can fall into the wrong hands and fewer guns can be used for crime or suicide. It makes no difference if older or newer guns are collected in the programs because all guns are potentially lethal and can be fired accidentally. Guns kept in the home for self-protection are three times more likely to kill a friend or a relative than an intruder. Safe Homes-Safe Streets programs would help stop violence before it occurs.  On their own volition, some communities have launched successful gun reduction programs to help rid themselves of guns and reduce the senseless violence in their daily lives. Many communities have implemented gun buyback programs; however, other communities have taken a more innovative approach to address the circulation of illegal guns on their streets. For example, in California and in my hometown of Springfield, Illinois, law enforcement officials have implemented the ``Stop Gun Violence Reward Program.'' Under the ``Stop Gun Violence Reward Program,'' citizens are encouraged to anonymously and confidentially call the CrimeStoppers hotline when handguns are seen in public places. An officer is then dispatched to investigate the compliant. If an illegal gun is recovered in a public place, the caller receives a $100 cash reward. If the gun is stolen, it is returned to its rightful owner. If the gun is not needed as evidence, it is destroyed. With federal assistance, more communities would be empowered to voluntarily help reduce the number of potentially lethal firearms in their homes and on their streets--helping to create safer homes and safer streets.  Moreover, the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act would help communities increase awareness of gun violence and gun possession; reduce the number of accidents and domestic violence with guns; reduce the availability of highly lethal weapons in the short term; reduce the lethality of crimes committed; enhance community solidarity; enhance community-police relations; and reduce the taxing medical cost of gun-related injuries. The benefits ofthe Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act--legislation facilitating a voluntary reduction of the number of guns in circulation--is clear.  The Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act would help create safer homes and safer streets for our families. Several organizations, including Illinois Council Against Hand Gun Violence, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Illinois Education Association, National Education Association, The Bell Campaign, and the American Public Health Association, have already recognized the need for legislation calling for a voluntary reduction of the number of firearms in circulation.  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Lautenberg in taking steps to cure the deadly epidemic of gun violence by supporting and cosponsoring the Safe Homes-Safe Streets Act.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.
