Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. The answer to better fuel mileage is probably in a different fueled vehicle. It is called hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.  This morning I met GM officials who gave me their new brochures on these cars that they are going to be manufacturing. They have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to develop and finance the new hydrogen fuel cell vehicle.  Now, what this amendment would do you cannot create with just magic. You cannot say just ``Poof, here it is. There you go.'' It would be nice to have a vehicle that delivered 40 or 50 miles per gallon. But to do that would take all of the engineering gusto away from developing what I think is the real answer, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. It would take hundreds of millions of dollars out of that engineering cycle today and invest it into something else.  This is the answer. Let science prevail. Let science and the experts decide that this is the vehicle. Let them develop these types of vehicles, knowing that we are there, that we are going to have these cars in the showroom before too long. Let us not get off that track. Let us defeat this amendment. Let the research and development continue so that all of us will be able to drive one of these vehicles in the near future.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Bonilla). The Committee will rise informally.
