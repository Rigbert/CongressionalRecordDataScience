President, I rise today to speak about Hilton Wick, a great Vermonter who was recently honored at a dedication ceremony in Burlington, VT. As a token of thanks for his tireless fundraising efforts on behalf of Fletcher Allen Health Care, the plaza in front of Fletcher Allen's Ambulatory Care Center will now bear Hilton's name. For decades, Hilton Wick has committed his talents and energy to improving his community, raising awareness, and inspiring involvement on a wide variety of community development projects. Not only Burlington but all of Vermont can be grateful for his outstanding leadership and enormous generosity.  I would like to share with my colleagues an article from the October 29, 2005, edition of the Burlington Free Press which magnificently describes the contributions of Hilton Wick. I ask that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Oct. 29, 2005]                 Hilton Wick Gives His All To Community       It is a fitting tribute to Burlington's Hilton Wick that      the plaza in front of Fletcher Allen Health Care's new      Ambulatory Care Center is being named after him.       The dedication for the Hilton A. Wick Plaza on Sunday      honors a man who has been one of the most generous and      steadfast community builders Burlington has known.       When the hospital's Renaissance Project was in its darkest      hours, Wick persevered with community fund-raising efforts      despite the adversity, convinced that the goal of a     better hospital remained sound and that Vernmonters would      benefit from it.       Through the years and with a broad array of causes, Wick's      message has been ``get involved, get committed, do what you      can to help achieve success and don't forget that little      things do matter,'' according to his friend, Dan Feeney, who      worked with Wick on several capital campaigns.       Burlington, and Vermont, have been the fortunate      benefactors of Wick's remarkable ability to rally people      around good causes, including the United Way, the American      Cancer Society, the Intervale Foundation, the ECHO Center and      the Community Health Center.       The health center, which serves underinsured and uninsured      Vermonters, recognized Wick at its annual meeting this week      as a kind of guru or ``professor'' of community fund-raisers      in Burlington. ``To have Hilton as your friend is to have a      mentor, a philanthropic advisor, social connector, politician      and the best story teller,'' according to an announcement      from the health center.       When people gather Sunday to honor wick, now 85, they will      share stories of a man who leads by example, inspiring others      to give back to the community--a commitment he has held      deeply since escaping death in the South Pacific during World      War II.       The son of a railroad worker and homemaker in rural      Pennsylvania, Wick came to Vermont in 1949 after graduating      from Harvard Law School the previous year. He practiced law      and continues the practice with his son Jim at Wick &      Maddocks in Burlington; he taught business law at the      University of Vermont; and he was president and later      chairman of the board of Chittenden Trust Co. He ran for      governor in 1984 and served a term as a state senator in      1988.       His friends know him especially for his devotion to his      family--his five children and his late wife Barbara, who died      of breast cancer in 2001--and his community.       George Little, a former state senator who served with Wick      on a number of fund-raising drives, said his longtime friend      has raised more money for health care, education and other      projects ``than I can possibly count.       ``Hilton is an extraordinary human being who has made his      life an example of thoughtful, unselfish generosity to his      community,'' Little said.       Lois McClure said Wick encouraged her and her late husband,      Mac, to give to a number of worthy projects including a      building constructed in the 1980s at Fletcher Allen that      bears the McClure name. ``Mac said, `When someone like Hilton      feels I should do it, I guess I had better do it.' '' McClure      recalled.       For Wick's daughter, Julia, her father is a kind-hearted      role model with a unique sense of humor and a love of story-     telling. He is dedicated, she said, to helping those in need,      ``a quiet and determined leader who imparts his knowledge      through inspiration.''       Wick, who now lives at Shelburne Bay Senior Living      Community, said in an interview Friday that he has enjoyed      helping Burlington, ``a great place to live''--and      particularly the hospital, where ``the wonderful medical      personnel have kept me alive, when I'm not sure I was      entitled to it.''       Wick's countless hours of public service have been      recognized with numerous accolades over the years, including      several ``Man of the Year'' awards from organizations and      ``Father of the Year'' from the Lund Family Center. But the      real benefits are experienced every day in the community,      which has been enriched and improved because of him.       Next time you walk across the plaza at Fletcher Allen      Health Care, think of Hilton Wick and the many contributions      he has made.                          ____________________[Pages S13355-S13356]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       TRIBUTE TO HILTON A.
