Chairman, I rise to support the gentleman's amendment. It simply reduces the long-range standoff missile study to the President's request.  Given the National Nuclear Security Administration's dismal record on both life extension projects and construction projects, cost overruns like we have never seen before, I think it is wise to take a considered approach to any new system and any new study.  So I support the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort. Support the Quigley amendment.
