 President, we are now in a period of 2 hours of debate equally divided. I understand Senators on that side will begin.  I would like to notify all Senators we are now working through a process to get the next amendment set in order so that Members will know. We do have 2 hours of debate, but Members should know that we may yield back some of that time. So please be ready. I think everybody has a lot of amendments they want to have brought up, and the sooner we can get to that the sooner we will.  So, again, we will now move to 2 hours of debate equally divided.  I yield the floor.
