President, I am proud to introduce the Career and Technical Education for Adult Learners or the CTE for All Act with my colleague, Senator Baldwin.  Our legislation addresses the critical need to expand educational opportunities for working adults with low academic skills. A Department of Education update of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, 2013 Survey of Adult Skills confirms that a significant number of working adults in the United States have low literacy, numeracy, and digital problem solving skills. Specifically, 14 percent have low literacy skills; 23 percent have low numeracy skills; and 62 percent have low digital problem solving skills. Moreover, the skills gap has no age barrier as half of low skilled working adults are under the age of 45.  Our ability to accelerate the economic momentum we have seen in the latest income data from the U.S. Census Bureau will depend, in large part, on our commitment to providing education and training opportunities to low-skilled adults. These workers are concentrated in fields such as construction, health care, manufacturing, and hospitality. Expanding career and technical education opportunities to these workers could enhance their career opportunities and strengthen their earning potential, fueling economic productivity and growth for the future. Unfortunately, according to the U.S. Department of Education, roughly half of low-skilled workers are not engaged in formal or non-formal learning opportunities. The CTE for All Act aims to change that by ensuring that there are pathways for adult learners in career and technical education programs.  Specifically, our legislation will ensure that programs funded under the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act are aligned with adult education programs and industry sector partnerships authorized under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act. The CTE for All Act will require that the state director for adult education is consulted in the development of the statewide plan for career and technical education. The bill adds low-skilled adults to the special populations to be served in career and technical education programs and will allow states to report separate performance indicators for adult career and technical education students. The legislation would also allow adult education providers that offer integrated education and training programs to receive career and technical education funding. Additionally, the legislation encourages career and technical education programs to include work experiences for their students.  We have worked with the adult education community and other stakeholders in developing this legislation. We are pleased to have the support of the National Council of State Directors of Adult Education, the Commission on Adult Basic Education, the National Skills Coalition, the Center for Law and Social Policy, CLASP, and the National Council of Adult Learning.  We are stronger as a nation when every person--no matter their starting point--has the opportunity to develop their skills and reach their potential. The CTE for All Act will strengthen the ladder of opportunity for low-skilled adults who work hard every day to provide for their families. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and work with us to include these provisions in the reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Act.                          ____________________
