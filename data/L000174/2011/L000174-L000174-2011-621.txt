President, the distinguished Senator from Oklahoma and I worked together to advance both of these amendments in a bipartisan way. We worked together during the last year, and we are working together again this year.  Our amendment closes a gap in our Public Safety Officers Benefits Act for emergency service providers by extending Federal benefits to emergency service providers who die or are disabled in the line of duty and who work for private, nonprofit emergency services organizations.  A tragedy in Vermont 2 years ago highlighted this issue. First responder Dale Long from Bennington, VT, was Bennington Rescue Squad's 2008 EMT of the Year and a 2009 recipient of the American Ambulance Association's Star of Life Award. Shortly after that ceremony, he was killed in the line of duty. Given the private, nonprofit status of his ambulance service, he is ineligible for Federal death benefits.  The Judiciary Committee--all Republicans, all Democrats--unanimously approved this legislation last Congress. The Leahy-Inhofe amendment is fully paid through an included offset.  The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma and I have talked about this. He comes from a part of the country where people have to fly to rescue. We drive to rescue. We are much smaller. They fly. Either way, we ought to be doing something to protect the people who are out there trying to rescue or aid people in distress.  I am proud to join with Senator Inhofe, and I hope at some appropriate time the amendment, as now amended, will be accepted.
