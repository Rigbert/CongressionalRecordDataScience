 It should be a crowded Chamber. It is not. I say it should be because this should be a required debate. As a matter of fact, we should have had the debate.  I am the ranking member of the Senate Rules Committee. The distinguished Senator from Texas just pointed out if we went to regular order, we would be having a meeting of the Rules Committee, having a very interesting debate, a very educational debate. I think especially for the class of 2010 and the class of 2012 on the majority side, who did not have the advantage of listening to Bob Byrd's lecture to every class that came in, his sermon to every class that came in--we all became born again to our responsibilities as Senators, seeing the light with only his advantage of being both in the majority and the minority. I regret that is not the case. I regret we are not in the Rules Committee.  I rise, like the distinguished Senator from Texas and others who have spoken about this, our leader, Senator Alexander in particular, giving us a real history on what is going on here or what is not going on. We are trying to discuss the so-called nuclear option that the majority leader reportedly wishes to employ.  We are apparently brought to this point as a result of the leader's frustration. I was here when, obviously, he was simply frustrated with the pace of the Senate and how the Senate operates. This really comes down to the NLRB and the appointments to the NLRB and the fact that two courts found these appointments were illegal. That is what our side objects to. It is not especially to the appointments.  Apparently, we are going to have a cloture vote on it, and apparently the nuclear gun is cocked and ready to be pulled. There is a country western song, ``Don't take your guns to town, son. Leave your guns at home.'' Harry, don't take that nuclear gun to this body. Take it back to Searchlight, NV. Put it back in its holster if in fact the nuclear gun has a holster. That would be my advice.  I would say this about the majority leader. I have known him for a long time. We worked together on the Ethics Committee--and I mean we worked together. As majority leader I have had a good relationship with him. He has a good sense of humor. Sometimes that doesn't show, but he actually does.  I remember one time he was conducting a mini-filibuster. I don't remember the issue. I was the Acting Presiding Officer. I was listening to him talking about how rabbits were eating the cactus in front of his home in Searchlight, NV; whereupon I took the floor and we engaged in quite a colloquy about rabbits and cactus and not to sit on cactus. There are a lot of cactus in the world.  This is probably the biggest one we are attempting to sit on, and I just don't think it is a good idea.  The majority leader was a boxer. He was a good one. His hero is Smokin' Joe, Smokin' Joe Frazier. So when I talk to him, I call him Smokin' Joe. My appeal to him, if he is listening--he probably isn't, but if he reads about this, or if his staff tells him, tell him your old friend from the Ethics Committee had some advice. Smokin' Joe used to wait until the late rounds. He was in better shape. But he knew when to hold them and when to fold them. He was a great champion.  We do not need to go down this road. We really don't need to go down this road. Apparently, the majority leader has determined that--and this is my view--he will have to destroy the Senate in order to save it.  Those are pretty strong words. Those are harsh words, but I intend them to be. We should not be confused about this. By breaking the rules to change the rules the majority seeks to destroy what has made the Senate great, unique in the history of the world. I am repeating the advice we all got from Senator Byrd, the institutional flame of the Senate. Again, every time a new class came in, he would give his sermon or his lecture or his advice or his counsel, and we all took it, regardless of whether we were Democrat or Republican.  The Senate has always been the one place where all Americans could be assured they would have a voice. Every American, no matter what State they happened to live in or what political party they belonged to, knew they would be represented here. Kansas, Massachusetts, wherever; they knew they would be represented. Minority views were respected. Even if your party was not in power, you still had a voice.  Unfortunately, if you pull that trigger on that nuclear gun, the majority will abolish that. If you take that step, that is surely going to lead to complete control of this institution by the majority. That has been predicted by virtually everybody who has spoken, and I intend to quote a lot of majority leaders and a lot of people in the Senate on the Democratic side who have pointed this out.  I know some on the other side, especially those who have never been in the minority, will seek to minimize the import of what they are doing. Oh, it is just a small change. They will claim what they are trying to do is very limited, applying only to executive nominations.  I wish I had a chart. But if you look at the difference of 68 percent on civilian nominations that were confirmed in past administrations in the 106th Congress, and you are talking, 68, 72, in that neighborhood, and then you move clear up here to the 112th Congress, and President Obama is 82 percent, 86 percent--what is the deal? Other than being upset about the NLRB.  Make no mistake. The change itself will be less important than the manner in which it is imposed. Let me repeat that. The change itself will be less important than the manner in which it is imposed. If the majority decides to write new rules with a simple majority vote, regardless of the issue, ignoring the existing rules that require a supermajority to achieve such a change, it will put us on a path that will surely lead to total control of this body by the majority.  As of today there is only one House of Congress where the majority has total control. The majority wishes, apparently, now, there were two--or there will be two.  We do not have to wonder what the Senate will become if they get their wish. We only need to look to the House of Representatives. We will become the Senior House. I don't know about the Upper House or the Lower House--perhaps we will be the Upper House--but we will become the House.  I know that doesn't mean much to many of my colleagues who have never been in the minority or served in the House. I served as an administrative assistant to a wonderful House Member for 12 years and was in the House for 16 years. I have the privilege of now serving my third term in the Senate. I have been in the majority and I have been in the minority. The Senator from Texas is surely right, the majority is better.  Many of you folks who should be here have never served in the House. Many of you have never served in the minority. I have done both, as I have indicated. Let me explain what it means to serve in the minority in the House to those who have never had this wonderful privilege.  In the House, no bill comes to the floor without a rule. The rule governs the length of debate and the amendments that will be considered. If you want to even speak on the bill, you have to get the bill manager to give you some of the very limited time available under the rule. If there is not enough time, you will not be able to even speak on it.  The majority in the House writes the rule, and they decide how much time they will allow. The rule also determines what amendments will be considered. If the rule does not allow for consideration of your amendment it will not be considered, it will not be debated, and it will not be voted on. The majority in the House decides what amendments will be considered.  If you are a member of the majority, they might allow consideration of your amendment--if you are in good standing with the Rules Committee. If you are a member of the minority, you can forget about getting a vote on your amendment. If the majority does not want to allow it, it will not happen. As a member of the minority there is nothing that you can do about it.  I know about this. I remember when I first went to the House Rules Committee under a very determined, aggressive chairman of the Rules Committee. I had an amendment that I thought was well placed, well taken, pertinent. It was on agriculture. It was on something that dealt with the farm bill or agricultural program policy. But I was a Republican. I went in and I thought this amendment would be considered under parliamentary procedure whether it would be germane or not. Guess what. It was just a rehash of a partisan debate because it was not bipartisan. We had a lot of bipartisan support for it.  So my amendment was not allowed. Then I figured it out. Charlie Stenholm was from Texas--well, he still is from Texas and he is still active in the agriculture community. Very active, very respected. Charlie wanted the same amendment. So I finally figured out, let Stenholm introduce my amendment, but don't tell them it is my amendment.  So Stenholm introduced my amendment and then as soon as it was approved by the House Rules Committee, then it became the Stenholm-Roberts amendment. If it passed, obviously, it became the Roberts-Stenholm amendment in Kansas and the Stenholm-Roberts amendment in Texas, and that is how we got things done. So we had the Stenholm-Roberts for quite a few years. I never went into the Rules Committee because if I did I knew I would lose. Boy, talk about one-party rule.  We don't want to do that. Guess what. We had a revolution back in 1994. I became chairman of the Agriculture Committee. All of a sudden the Stenholm-Roberts amendment became the Roberts-Stenholm amendment, and that is how it worked in the House of Representatives.  I don't think we want to do that. It is precisely for this reason that many Members of the House choose to run for the Senate. That is why I did it. The Senate is supposed to be different. Here, if you want to be heard on a bill, it will happen. We haven't been living up to that recently, but that is how the place is supposed to work. In the Senate the Senator's right to speak is not supposed to depend on the whim of the majority. Now it is on a whim and a prayer. That is why people run for the Senate. That is what has distinguished this body from the House since we first convened in 1789.  The majority, unfortunately, wants to erase that distinction. It wants to assure that Members do not have any rights beyond those which the majority is willing to grant.  You don't have to take my word for it. The distinguished majority leader--whom I affectionately call Smokin' Joe--himself has recognized this. As my colleague, Senator Alexander, from that desk right over there, has previously noted, Senator Reid addressed this topic in his book--how appropriate--``The Good Fight,'' from a boxer and now our majority leader. Senator Reid wrote about the battle over the nuclear option in 2005. Things were a little different. This is what he wrote:       Once you opened that Pandora's box, it was just a matter of      time before a Senate leader who couldn't get his way on      something moved to eliminate the filibuster for regular      business as well. And that, simply put, would be the end of      the United States Senate.  The end of the United States Senate.  The distinguished majority leader said:       It is the genius of the Founders that they conceived the      Senate as a solution to the small state/big state problem.      And central to that solution was the protection of the rights      of the minority. A filibuster is the minority's way of not      allowing the majority to shut off debate, and without robust      debate, the Senate is crippled.  Senator Reid went on to say:       Such a move would transform the body into an institution      that looked just like the House of Representatives where      everything passes with a simple majority.  Senator Reid also wrote:     there will come a time when we will all be gone, and the      institutions that we now serve will be run by men and women      not yet living, and those institutions will either function      well because we've taken care of them, or they will be in      disarray and someone else's problem to solve.  Boy, that is pretty heavy stuff; that is meaningful. That is something everybody here should consider.  He described the nuclear option this way at that time:       In a fit of partisan fury--  I am not quite sure we are there yet. I would say it is more of a partisan frustration.     they were trying to blow up the Senate. Senate rules can only      be changed by a two-thirds vote of the Senate, or sixty-seven      Senators. The Republicans were going to do it illegally with      a simple majority, or fifty-one. Vice President Cheney was      prepared to overrule the Senate parliamentarian. Future      generations be damned.  Do you think the Senator was upset then? He was upset then a heck of a lot more than he was this morning. If only the majority leader would recall his own words.  The Vice President also recognized the damage this would do. This is what Vice President Biden said on the floor when he was still a Member of this body. This is important stuff. We all know Joe Biden. We are all a friend of Joe Biden. He is the Vice President of the United States. When he was a Senator he said something very important:       Put simply, the nuclear option would transform the Senate      from the so-called cooling saucer our Founding Fathers talked      about to cool the passions of the day to a pure majoritarian      body like a Parliament.       Republicans control the Senate, and they have decided they      are going to change the rule. At its core, the filibuster is      not about stopping a nominee or a bill, it is about      compromise and moderation. That is why the Founders put      unlimited debate in. When you have to--and I never conducted      a filibuster--but if I did, the purpose would be that you      have to deal with me as one Senator. It does not mean I get      my way. It means you may have to compromise. You may have to      see my side of the argument. That is what it is it about,      engendering compromise in moderation.  Joe Biden went on to say:       If there is one thing I have learned in my years here, once      you change the rules and surrender the Senate's institutional      power, you never get it back.  Folks, we are about to break the rules to change the rules.  He went on to say:       The nuclear option abandons America's sense of fair play.      It is the one thing this country stands for: Not tilting the      playing field on the side of those who control and own the      field.  Then he said to the Republican side of the aisle, which was then in the majority:       I say to my friends on the Republican side: You may own the      field right now, but you won't own it forever. I pray God      when the Democrats take back control, we don't make the kind      of naked power grab you are doing. But I am afraid you will      teach my new colleagues the wrong lessons.       We are only in the Senate as temporary custodians of the      Senate. The Senate will go on. Mark my words, history will      judge this Republican majority harshly, if it makes this      catastrophic move.  I hope the Vice President will listen to his own prayers. We don't need any divine intervention here, but maybe he can share his concerns with the majority leader. It could help us avert a real catastrophe.  The majority leader and the Vice President are not the only people who recognize the damage that would be done by triggering the so-called nuclear option. Our former Parliamentarian, named Bob Dove--a man whose advice I sought when I had the privilege of being the acting Presiding Officer--and Richard Arenberg, a professor and one-time aide to former majority leader George Mitchell, wrote a book on the subject, ``Defending the Filibuster.''  I know I am quoting a lot, but these are important issues. I hope they stick like a burr under your saddle so they make you stop and think about this. They wrote--       If a 51-vote majority is empowered to rewrite the Senate's      rules, the day will come, as it did in the House of      Representatives, when a majority will construct rules that      give it near absolute control over amendments and debate. And      there is no going back from that. No majority in the House of      Representatives has or ever will voluntarily relinquish that      power in order to give the minority a greater voice in      crafting legislation.       Do not be fooled by those who would try to minimize the      impact of what the majority is actually contemplating.  The rule changes themselves are less important than the manner in which they will be imposed. Once the majority has decided it can set the rules, there is no limit to what the majority might do in the future. I hope you understand that. There are no constraints. The majority claims these changes are necessary to make the Senate function. If it decides further changes are needed, it will make them. The minority will have no voice, no say, no power, and that has never been the case in the Senate.  Tragically, what the majority contemplates is at once both calamitous and totally unnecessary. The filibuster is a product of our dysfunction, not the source.  I know many Members--and I have harped on this--do not even know what it is like to serve in a functioning Senate. They hardly know what it is like to operate under regular order where bills are referred to committee, amended, brought to the floor, debated, amended, and passed.  This matter should be before the Rules Committee. We should have a complete hearing and then bring it to the floor. We averted this at the first of this year. I know people think the filibuster is to blame for this breakdown, but they are wrong. We don't operate under regular order here because the majority leadership doesn't want to. They have an agenda. I understand that.  They have been trying to operate this place like the House of Representatives for years. They want to control debate and to control the amendments.  I know a little bit about this. When we were talking about the farm bill last year, Senator Reid said: We can't do a farm bill in less than 3 weeks. I said: We will do it in 3 days. Senator Stabenow and I worked very hard to get common agreement on the farm bill, but we did it. We needed regular order. We needed to open it up. We needed to give Senators here on our side a chance to at least offer amendments, and we did it. We had 73 amendments. We did it in 2\1/2\ days. We had regular order and people said: Gee, is this what the Senate used to be all about? And that was the case. So it can work.  I know there are folks over there who think the filibuster is to blame for this breakdown, but they are wrong. Rather than give up that control, they have decided during the past 4 years--with the exception of a few bills I have just mentioned--I think they want to make it official. I think they would rather blow up the Senate rather than let it work its will.  It will be a tragedy. They think it will save the Senate, but it will destroy it. That threat of destruction may not be obvious to some today, but it is real. If the nuclear option is deployed, one day it will become clear to all. And when that day comes and people wonder: What happened to the Senate? When did it die? We will know the answer. It died the day the nuclear option was triggered. That is what nuclear devices do--they destroy. This is not justa minor shot across the bow to be used only once. This is a mushroom cloud over the Capitol.  Again, I urge the distinguished majority leader: Don't take your nuclear gun to town.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the remarks by U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd at the orientation of new Senators, December 3, 1996, printed in the Record.  I also ask unanimous consent that Senator Byrd's final speech before the Rules Committee called ``The Filibuster And Its Consequences'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   Remarks by U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd at the Orientation of New                        Senators, December 3, 1996       Good afternoon and welcome to the United States Senate      Chamber. You are presently occupying what I consider to be      ``hallowed ground.'' You will shortly join the ranks of a      very select group of individuals who have been honored with      the title of United States Senator since 1789 when the Senate      first convened. The creator willing, you will be here for at      least six years. Make no mistake about it, the office of      United States Senator is the highest political calling in the      land. The Senate can remove from office Presidents, members      of the Federal judiciary, and other Federal officials but      only the Senate itself can expel a Senator.       Let us listen for a moment to the words of James Madison on      the role of the Senate.       ``These [reasons for establishing the Senate] were first to      protect the people against their rulers: secondly to protect      the people against the transient impression into which they      themselves might be led. [through their representatives in      the lower house] A people deliberating in a temperate moment,      and with the experience of other nations before them, on the      plan of government most likely to secure their happiness,      would first be aware, that those charged with the public      happiness, might betray their trust. An obvious precaution      against this danger would be to divide the trust between      different bodies of men, who might watch and check each      other. . . . It would next occur to such a people, that they      themselves were liable to temporary errors, through want of      information as to their true interest, and that men chosen      for a short term, [House members], . . . might err from the      same cause. This reflection would naturally suggest that the      Government be so constituted, as that one of its branches      might have an opportunity of acquiring a competent knowledge      of the public interests. Another reflection equally becoming      a people on such an occasion, would be that they themselves,      as well as a numerous body of Representatives, were liable to      err also, from fickleness and passion. A necessary fence      against this danger would be to select a portion of      enlightened citizens, whose limited number, and firmness      might seasonably interpose against impetuous councils, . .      .''       Ladies and gentlemen, you are shortly to become part of      that all important, ``necessary fence,'' which is the United      States Senate. Let me give you the words of Vice President      Aaron Burr upon his departure from the Senate in 1805. ``This      house,'' said he, ``is a sanctuary; a citadel of law, of      order, and of liberty; and it is here--it is here, in this      exalted refuge; here, if anywhere, will resistance be made to      the storms of political phrensy and the silent arts of      corruption; and if the Constitution be destined ever to      perish by the sacrilegious hand of the demagogue or the      usurper, which God avert, its expiring agonies will be      witnessed on this floor.'' Gladstone referred to the Senate      as ``that remarkable body--the most remarkable of all the      inventions of modern politics.''       This is a very large class of new Senators. There are      fifteen of you. It has been sixteen years since the Senate      welcomed a larger group of new members. Since 1980, the      average size class of new members has been approximately ten.      Your backgrounds vary. Some of you may have served in the      Executive Branch. Some may have been staffers here on the      Hill. Some of you have never held federal office before. Over      half of you have had some service in the House of      Representatives.       Let us clearly understand one thing. The Constitution's      Framers never intended for the Senate to function like the      House of Representatives. That fact is immediately apparent      when one considers the length of a Senate term and the      staggered nature of Senate terms. The Senate was intended to      be a continuing body. By subjecting only one-third of the      Senate's membership to reelection every two years, the      Constitution's Framers ensured that two-thirds of the      membership would always carry over from one Congress to the      next to give the Senate an enduring stability.       The Senate and, therefore, Senators were intended to take      the long view and to be able to resist, if need be, the      passions of the often intemperate House. Few, if any, upper      chambers in the history of the western world have possessed      the Senate's absolute right to unlimited debate and to amend      or block legislation passed by a lower House.       Looking back over a period of 208 years, it becomes obvious      that the Senate was intended to be significantly different      from the House in other ways as well. The Constitutional      Framers gave the Senate the unique executive powers of      providing advice and consent to presidential nominations and      to treaties, and the sole power to try and to remove      impeached officers of the government. In the case of      treaties, the Senate, with its longer terms, and its ability      to develop expertise through the device of being a continuing      body, has often performed invaluable service.       I have said that as long as the Senate retains the power to      amend and the power of unlimited debate, the liberties of the      people will remain secure. The Senate was intended to be a      forum for open and free debate and for the protection of      political minorities. I have led the majority and I have led      the minority, and I can tell you that there is nothing that      makes one fully appreciate the Senate's special role as the      protector of minority interests like being in the minority.      Since the Republican Party was created in 1854, the Senate      has changed hands 14 times, so each party has had the      opportunity to appreciate first-hand the Senate's role as      guardian of minority rights. But, almost from its earliest      years the Senate has insisted upon its members' right to      virtually unlimited debate.       When the Senate reluctantly adopted a cloture rule in 1917,      it made the closing of debate very difficult to achieve by      requiring a super majority and by permitting extended post-     cloture debate. This deference to minority views sharply      distinguishes the Senate from the majoritarian House of      Representatives. The Framers recognized that a minority can      be right and that a majority can be wrong. They recognized      that the Senate should be a true deliberative body--a forum      in which to slow the passions of the House, hold them up to      the light, examine them, and, thru informed debate, educate      the public. The Senate is the proverbial saucer intended to      cool the cup of coffee from the House. It is the one place in      the whole government where the minority is guaranteed a      public airing of its views. Woodrow Wilson observed that the      Senate's informing function was as important as its      legislating function, and now, with televised Senate debate,      its informing function plays an even larger and more critical      role in the life of our nation.       Many a mind has been changed by an impassioned plea from      the minority side. Important flaws in otherwise good      legislation have been detected by discerning minority members      engaged in thorough debate, and important compromise which      has worked to the great benefit of our nation has been forged      by an intransigent member determined to filibuster until his      views were accommodated or at least seriously considered.       The Senate is often soundly castigated for its      inefficiency, but in fact, it was never intended to be      efficient. Its purpose was and is to examine, consider,      protect, and to be a totally independent source of wisdom and      judgment on the actions of the lower house and on the      executive. As such, the Senate is the central pillar of our      Constitutional system. I hope that you, as new members will      study the Senate in its institutional context because that is      the best way to understand your personal role as a United      States Senator. Your responsibilities are heavy. Understand      them, live up to them, and strive to take the long view as      you exercise your duties. This will not always be easy.       The pressures on you will, at times, be enormous. You will      have to formulate policies, grapple with issues, serve the      constituents in your state, and cope with the media. A      Senator's attention today is fractured beyond belief.      Committee meetings, breaking news, fundraising, all of these      will demand your attention, not to mention personal and      family responsibilities. But, somehow, amidst all the noise      and confusion, you must find the time to reflect, to study,      to read, and, especially, to understand the absolutely      critically important institutional role of the Senate.       May I suggest that you start by carefully reading the      Constitution and the Federalist papers. In a few weeks, you      will stand on the platform behind me and take an oath to      support and defend the Constitution of the United States      against all enemies, foreign and domestic; to bear true faith      and allegiance to the same; and take this obligation freely,      without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and to      well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on      which you are about to enter: So help you God.       Note especially the first 22 words, ``I do solemnly swear      that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United      States against all enemies foreign and domestic . . .'' In      order to live up to that solemn oath, one must clearly      understand the deliberately established inherent tensions      between the 3 branches, commonly called the checks and      balances, and separation of powers which the Framers so      carefully crafted. I carry a copy of the Constitution in my      shirt pocket. I have studied it carefully, read and reread      its articles, marveled at its genius, its beauty, its      symmetry, and its meticulous balance, and learned something      new each time that I partook of its timeless wisdom. Nothing      will help you to fully grasp the Senate's critical role in      the balance of powers like a thorough reading of the      Constitution and the Federalist papers.       Now I would like to turn for a moment to the human side of      the Senate, the relationship among Senators, and the way that      even that faced of service here is, to a degree, governed by      the constitution and the Senate's     rules. The requirement for super majority votes in approving      treaties, involving cloture, removing impeached federal      officers, and overriding vetoes, plus the need for unanimous      consent before the Senate can even proceed in many instances,      makes bipartisanship and comity necessary if members wish to      accomplish much of anything. Realize this. The campaign is      over. You are here to be a Senator. Not much happens in this      body without cooperation between the two parties.       In this now 208-year-old institution, the positions of      majority and minority leaders have existed for less than 80      years. Although the positions have evolved significantly      within the past half century, still, the only really      substantive prerogative the leaders possess is the right of      first recognition before any other member of their respective      parties who might wish to speak on the Senate Floor.       Those of you who have served in the House will now have to      forget about such things as the Committee of the Whole,      closed rules, and germaneness, except when cloture has been      invoked, and become well acquainted with the workings of      unanimous consent agreements. Those of you who took the      trouble to learn Deschler's Procedure will now need to set      that aside and turn in earnest to Riddick's Senate Procedure.       Senators can lose the Floor for transgressing the rules.      Personal attacks on other members or other blatantly      injudicious comments are unacceptable in the Senate. Again to      encourage a cooling of passions, and to promote a calm      examination of substance, Senators address each other through      the Presiding Officer and in the third person. Civility is      essential here for pragmatic reasons as well as for public      consumption. It is difficult to project the image of a      statesmanlike, intelligent, public servant, attempting to      inform the public and examine issues, if one is behaving and      speaking in a manner more appropriate to a pool room brawl      than to United States Senate debate. You will also find that      overly zealous attacks on other members or on their states      are always extremely counterproductive, and that you will      usually be repaid in kind.       Let us strive for dignity. When you rise to speak on this      Senate Floor, you will be following in the tradition of such      men as Calhoun, Clay, and Webster. You will be standing in      the place of such Senators as Edmund Ross (KS) and Peter Van      Winkle (WEST VIRGINIA), 1868, who voted against their party      to save the institution of the presidency during the Andrew      Johnson impeachment trial.       Debate on the Senate Floor demands thought, careful      preparation and some familiarity with Senate Rules if we are      to engage in thoughtful and informed debate. Additionally,      informed debate helps the American people have a better      understanding of the complicated problems which besiege them      in their own lives. Simply put, the Senate cannot inform      American citizens without extensive debate on those very      issues.       We were not elected to raise money for our own reelections.      We were not elected to see how many press releases or TV      appearances we could stack up. We were not elected to set up      staff empires by serving on every committee in sight. We need      to concentrate, focus, debate, inform, and, I hope, engage      the public, and thereby forge consensus and direction. Once      we engage each other and the public intellectually, the tough      choices will be easier.       I thank each of you for your time and attention and I      congratulate each of you on your selection to fill a seat in      this August body. Service in this body is a supreme honor. It      is also a burden and a serious responsibility. Members' lives      become open for inspection and are used as examples for other      citizens to emulate. A Senator must really be much more than      hardworking, much more than conscientious, much more than      dutiful. A Senator must reach for noble qualities--honor,      total dedication, self-discipline, extreme selflessness,      exemplary patriotism, sober judgment, and intellectual      honesty. The Senate is more important than any one or all of      us--more important than I am; more important than the      majority and minority leaders; more important than all 100 of      us; more important than all of the 1,843 men and women who      have served in this body since 1789. Each of us has a solemn      responsibility to remember that, and to remember it often.       Let me leave you with the words of the last paragraph of      Volume II, of The Senate: 1789-1989: ``Originally consisting      of only twenty-two members, the Senate had grown to a      membership of ninety-eight by the time I was sworn in as a      new senator in January 1959. After two hundred years, it is      still the anchor of the Republic, the morning and evening      star in the American constitutional constellation. It has had      its giants and its little men, its Websters and its Bilbos,      its Calhouns and its McCarthys. It has been the stage of high      drama, of comedy and of tragedy, and its players have been      the great and the near-great, those who think they are great,      and those who will never be great. It has weathered the      storms of adversity, withstood the barbs of cynics and the      attacks of critics, and provided stability and strength to      the nation during periods of civil strife and uncertainty,      panics and depressions. In war and in peace, it has been the      sure refuge and protector of the rights of the states and of      a political minority. And, today, the Senate still stands--     the great forum of constitutional American liberty!''                                  ____     May 19, 2010--Rules Committee Hearing, Senator Byrd's Opening            Statement, ``The Filibuster and Its Consequences''       On September 30, 1788, Pennsylvania became the first state      to elect its United States senators, one of whom was William      Maclay. In his 1789 journal Senator Maclay wrote, ``I gave my      opinion in plain language that the confidence of the people      was departing from us, owing to our unreasonable delays. The      design of the Virginians and of the South Carolina gentlemen      was to talk away the time, so that we could not get the bill      passed.''       Our Founding Fathers intended the Senate to be a continuing      body that allows for open and unlimited debate and the      protection of minority rights. Senators have understood this      since the Senate first convened. In his notes of the      Constitutional Convention on June 26, 1787, James Madison      recorded that the ends to be served by the Senate were      ``first, to protect the people against their rulers,      secondly, to protect the people against the transient      impressions into which they themselves might be led . . .      They themselves, as well as a numerous body of      Representatives, were liable to err also, from fickleness and      passion. A necessary fence against this danger would be to      select a portion of enlightened citizens, whose limited      number, and firmness might seasonably interpose against      impetuous councils.'' That ``fence'' was the United States      Senate. The right to filibuster anchors this necessary fence.      But it is not a right intended to be abused.       During this 111th Congress in particular the minority has      threatened to filibuster almost every matter proposed for      Senate consideration. I find this tactic contrary to each      Senator's duty to act in good faith. I share the profound      frustration of my constituents and colleagues as we confront      this situation. The challenges before our nation are far too      grave, and too numerous, for the Senate to be rendered      impotent to address them, and yet be derided for inaction by      those causing the delay. There are many suggestions as to      what we should do. I know what we must not do. We must never,      ever, tear down the only wall--the necessary fence--this      nation has against the excesses of the Executive Branch and      the resultant haste and tyranny of the majority. The path to      solving our problem lies in our thoroughly understanding it.      Does the difficulty reside in the construct of our rules or      in the ease of circumventing them?       A true filibuster is a fight, not a threat or a bluff. For      most of the Senate's history, Senators motivated to extend      debate had to hold the floor as long as they were physically      able. The Senate was either persuaded by the strength of      their arguments or unconvinced by either their commitment or      their stamina. True filibusters were therefore less frequent,      and more commonly discouraged, due to every Senator's      understanding that such undertakings required grueling      personal sacrifice, exhausting preparation, and a willingness      to be criticized for disrupting the nation's business.       Now, unbelievably, just the whisper of opposition brings      the ``world's greatest deliberative body'' to a grinding      halt. Why? Because this once highly respected institution has      become overwhelmingly consumed by a fixation with money and      media. Gone are the days when Senators Richard Russell and      Lyndon Johnson, and Speaker Sam Rayburn gathered routinely      for working weekends and couldn't wait to get back to their      chambers on Monday morning. Now every Senator spends hours      every day, throughout the year and every year, raising funds      for reelection and appearing before cameras and microphones.      Now the Senate often works three-day weeks, with frequent and      extended recess periods, so Senators can rush home to      fundraisers scheduled months in advance.       Forceful confrontation to a threat to filibuster is      undoubtedly the antidote to the malady. Most recently, Senate      Majority Leader Reid announced that the Senate would stay in      session around-the-clock and take all procedural steps      necessary to bring financial reform legislation before the      Senate. As preparations were made and cots rolled out, a deal      was struck within hours and the threat of filibuster was      withdrawn.       I heartily commend the Majority Leader for this progress,      and I strongly caution my colleagues as some propose to alter      the rules to severely limit the ability of a minority to      conduct a filibuster. I know what it is to be Majority      Leader, and wake up on a Wednesday morning in November, and      find yourself a Minority Leader.       I also know that current Senate Rules provide the means to      break a filibuster. I employed them in 1977 to end the post-     cloture filibuster of natural gas deregulation legislation.      This was the roughest filibuster I have experienced during my      fifty-plus years in the Senate, and it produced the most-     bitter feelings. Yet some important new precedents were      established in dealing with post-cloture obstruction. In      1987, I successfully used Rules 7 and 8 to make a non-     debatable motion to proceed during the morning hour. No      leader has attempted this technique since, but this procedure      could be and should be used.       Over the years, I have proposed a variety of improvements      to Senate Rules to achieve a more sensible balance allowing      the majority to function while still protecting minority      rights. For example, I have supported eliminating debate on      the motion to proceed to a matter (except for changes to      Senate rules), or limiting debate to a reasonable     time on such motions, with Senators retaining the right to      unlimited debate on the matter once before the Senate. I have      authored several other proposals in the past, and I look      forward to our committee work ahead as we carefully examine      other suggested changes. The Committee must, however,      jealously guard against efforts to change or reinterpret the      Senate rules by a simple majority, circumventing Rule XXII      where a two-thirds majority is required.       As I have said before, the Senate has been the last      fortress of minority rights and freedom of speech in this      Republic for more than two centuries. I pray that Senators      will pause and reflect before ignoring that history and      tradition in favor of the political priority of the moment.  I urge all Members of this wonderful body to read what Senator Byrd said and urged and counseled and advised. I know the new Members have not had this experience.  When you first went in, you thought, my gosh, how long is this going to last? The man wrote a book about the Senate. As it turned out, we hung on every word and took his advice, and it is good advice. It is printed in the Record. Read it.
