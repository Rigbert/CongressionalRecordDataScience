 Speaker, the pharmaceutical industry is at it again. This industry which has spent $200 million in the last 3 years to defeat all efforts to lower the cost of prescription drugs, this industry which has 300 paid lobbyists here on Capitol Hill, continues to charge the American people by far the highest prices in the world for the same exact prescription drugs.  Mr. Speaker, American women should not have to go over the Canadian border to buy tamoxifen, a breast cancer drug, for one-tenth the price that it is charged in the United States. Seniors should not have to go to Mexico or Europe to pick up the same drugs for a fraction of the price.  Mr. Speaker, in a globalized economy, prescription drug distributors and pharmacists should be able to purchase and sell FDA safety-approved medicine at the same prices as in other countries. The passage of reimportation will lower the cost of medicine in this country by 30 to 50 percent. Let us pass the Sanders-Crowley-DeLauro amendment in the agriculture appropriations bill, which will allow Americans to get fair prices for their prescription drugs.                          ____________________
