Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in very strong support of the Hinchey-Frelinghuysen amendment. I am very proud to be oneof the cosponsors of it, which simply calls for a 1-year moratorium on the VA's implementation of the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation formula, and as Members know by now, hearing it so often, VERA. The moratorium will give Congress and the administration the time needed to make adjustments in the VERA formula that was instituted in 1997 so that veterans in certain geographical areas and age groups are no longer shortchanged by this funding mechanism. Quite simply, we simply need to put E, the big E, equity, back into VERA. Regrettably VERA paints veterans services with a broad brush leaving very little, if any, room for significant examination waiting costs associated with health care. VERA is a mathematical formula that essentially calculates how much a VA network will receive based on the raw number of veterans and whether their health care needs are basic or complex. The formula fails, utterly fails, to take into account the age and perhaps most importantly the specific type of illnesses faced by the various veterans populations.  For example, in New Jersey, our veterans are the second oldest group of veterans in the Nation, if we quantify it by State. As we all know, with age comes a plethora of health care problems, many of them more costly to treat. In our network alone 52 percent of veterans are over the age of 65 compared to 44 percent on the average, and I heard even earlier that many of these people, and they do, many of our veterans do move south and end up living in Florida. They happen to be the healthier ones, those who have the means as well as the health to go down to Florida, often by driving, and to have either a second home there or to actually up stakes and move there.  The sicker ones and the poorer people, the more indigent, stay in New Jersey and New York and they seek to use the services of the VA. They are the ones who cannot move. So it is not just age. It is also their costs, their situation. We have an explosion of things like cancer in our State. Those folks are not moving to Florida. They are seeking to get their health care right at their Veterans Administration, and now they are finding the VA has to do more with less.  Mr. Chairman, it is a 1-year moratorium we are asking for. This has only been in place since 1997. It is not working.                              {time}  1530  I happen to be the vice chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs. We have looked at this. I have sat with, for hours, with VA officials both in-State as well as down here, and I am totally dissatisfied with their answers, and I think I find it regrettable that some of my friends from Florida are standing up and saying it is okay down here. We are losing, and poor, indigent and very sickly veterans are the ones that are the net losers. We are not going to stand by and allow it, and I hope that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) amendment gets passed.  Mr. Chairman, it is a matter of equitable and fairness, and again we are asking for a 1-year moratorium so we can fix it.  Mr. Chairman, I urge support for the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, our amendment today calls for a one year moratorium on the VA's implementation of the Veterans Equitable Resource Allocation Formula--VERA as it is known for short. The moratorium will give Congress and the Administration the time needed to make adjustments in the VERA formula that was instituted in 1997 so that veterans in certain geographical areas and age groups are no longer shortchanged by this funding mechanism. Quite simply, we need to put the ``e''--equity--back into VERA.  Regrettably, VERA paints veterans services with a broad brush leaving very little--if any--room for significant extenuating costs associated with health care. VERA is a mathematical formula that essentially calculates how much a VA network will receive based on the raw number of veterans and whether their health care needs are basic or complex. The formula fails to take into account the age and perhaps most importantly, the specific types of illnesses faced by the various veterans populations. For instance, in New Jersey, our veterans are the second oldest group of veterans in the nation if you quantify by state. As we all know, with age comes new health care problems, many of them more costly. In the New Jersey part of our network alone, 58% of veterans are over the age of 65. Compare this with a nationwide average of 44%. However, the VERA formula makes no allowance for this disproportionate representation of aging veterans. A veteran's decision to stay in New Jersey or the Northeast for that matter, should not mean that their VA health care network is forced to do more with less. Veterans should not be forced to wait for weeks on end to see a primary care doctor or specialist as has been the case with increasing frequency in my state as a result of VERA.  Similarly, VERA fails to specifically weigh the type of medical treatment required in the varying networks.  For instance, the VA has mandated treatment of veterans with Hepatitis C. In New Jersey alone, the VA is treating 12 to 15 veterans per month who have tested positive for Hepatitis C, with a treatment cost of $15,000 per patient. Failing to take into account that we have a high rate of Hepatitis C in our network as well as a high rate of AIDS cases, VERA punishes New Jersey and the larger network that we are in, for treating all veterans, not just those who use the VA for an annual physical or for prescription drugs, but those with serious, ongoing chronic illnesses.  Our veterans served our country in her time of need; we should not forget them now simply because where they chose to spend their ``Golden Years'' does not nicely mesh with the VA's own bureaucratic formula. While VERA is well intentioned, the fact of the matter is that it pits veterans against each other merely on the basis of their geography.  In the 4th Congressional district of New Jersey, which I have the privilege to represent, veterans have felt the effects of VERA first hand. Faced with budget cuts due to the VERA formula, the network administrators who oversee Central and Northern New Jersey first responded with a knee jerk solution: elimination of the specialty services at the VA's clinic in Brick, New Jersey.  Needless to say, this decision immediately mobilized the veterans of Ocean and Monmouth Counties, who joined me in fighting these cuts. These specialty services, whether they be rheumatology or podiatry, free our veterans from being forced to spend valuable hours traveling great distances to see a specialist for the care they desperately need. Through my continued efforts to get the VA to ``think outside the box,'' we have managed to restore specialty services to the Brick Clinic. This is a battle however that we should not have had to wage. Our veterans deserve their health care. It should be reasonably accessible, period. They should not be held hostage to VERA as they are now.  There is simply no question that the VERA formula brought on the Brick Clinic's ongoing financial challenges. Furthermore, we are faced with at least a $36 million cut in our VA network in the upcoming fiscal year, so it is hard to see how threats to specialty services will not resume over the next several months. I ask my colleagues: where is the equity in a cut to Central and Northern New Jersey's network when our veteran population is aging rapidly and will need more, not less, specialty services?  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important amendment.
