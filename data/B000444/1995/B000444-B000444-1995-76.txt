 President, one thing all Americans say they care about is to get a college education for their children.  This amendment will allow--it costs $35 billion, roughly $5 billion a year, and it would allow a $10,000 per year deduction--maximum deduction--for the cost of college tuition for couples making up to $120,000, or individuals up to $90,000.  This is a genuine benefit for the middle class, and we do exactly what the Republican bill does. The way in which we get the money is restrict the growth of tax expenditures.
