President, I rise to recognize a life-long Kansas native, Lucile Wulfmeyer, who passed away on May 11, 1997. Her memorial service at First Presbyterian Church included the following remembrance of Lucile, written by her elder daughter, Roberta Doerges:       My earliest memories of mother and my family roots seem to      materialize in the home she purchased at 316 S. Bluff. Here,      I remember a formal dining room converted to a family room;      learning to ride my first bicycle; and meeting the man who      would later become my father: Lawrence Wulfmeyer. What come      before all of that dims in childhood lost, but along with      Marian's ``I wuv you, Wawrance,'' and my manipulative acts to      prevent my mother's dating, I remember an abundance of      motherly patience and forbearance. The nearly four years      between my father, Francis Chambers' death, and my mothers'      union of 37 years to Lawrence, set the stage for revealing my      mother's life of service.       Today's stories might have described a woman with 18-month-     old and not-quite-three-year-old daughters as capitulating to      welfare, but not so for our mother. A woman wise beyond her      decade, she returned to work at Wichita's McConnell AFB and      managed to provide her daughters with a live-in housekeeper,      as well as financial support. I have always marveled at her      courage to do this: a ``woman's libber'' before her time,      working in a predominately male field, and providing two      young daughters with love and sustenance.       Knowing that she needed companionship, and a helpmate to      raise these little girls, Lucile married again in October of      1959. Lawrence's Brownie camera recorded two little girls,      dressed identically, and participating in the celebration of      their parents' union and a new father. A new home in East      Wichita, and a new family life ensued.       Always a large part of the family picture was First      Presbyterian Church: group calling on prospective new      members, UPY meetings and youth choir through junior and      senior high school years. Even the conception and realization      of the Wulfmeyer ``Dream Home'' in Clearwater did not dim      that emphasis. Many a Lucckock Class picnic, or a Brown      Sunday School Class open house was held at the home in      Clearwater, dubbed ``Spring Creek Acres,'' and the seat of so      many collective family memories.       Mother's life of service continued through all of those      years. Whether creating musical programs for Marian, Roberta      and Lucile to perform, or lovingly constructing costumes to      enhance them; whether taxiing busy daughters to endless high      school extracurricular activities, or typing term papers at      7:30 am (at 120 words per minutes proficiency, this was one      skill that was too tempting for at least her elder daughter      to overlook taking advantage of!) Reading and correcting      school papers, assisting with college choices, consoling      unrequited crushes--no act was too demeaning for Mother. Her      creative juices seemed endless; her power to be supportive      was astonishing; her innovation was impressive. (To this day,      I owe my own extensive and find vocabulary to her love of      literature, and the ingenious idea during our late high      school years to put a ``new'' vocabulary word on the table      daily, at breakfast. The challenge was not only to learn its      meaning, but, by dinner time, to be able to use it correctly      in conversation.)       My mother's ability to teach and instill was amazing. I      never remember learning the 23rd Psalm or the Lord's Prayer.      These were repeated to us as babies, following our father's      death, and were as much a part of our essence as eating or      speaking. The faith which she instilled in us was invaluable:      the unswerving foundation of a God who loves us, in spite of      any adversity.       Mother's ability to teach also shows through in her three      grandchildren: Autumn's love of art; Lauren's organizational      skills, service inclinations, and musical interests; Kyle's      appreciation of theater . . . all of these are owed in great      part to a grandmother who took the time of summer visits to      send grandchildren to art classes, or escort them to Wichita      Music Theater. That love and those lessons will last a      lifetime.       Small wonder that Lucile had already begun a life of      service as a young woman. Her father died when she was      seventeen. She assisted her mother through years of      illnesses, operations at Mayo, bitterness over poor health,      and tender care in her elder years. This attitude of service      also include care for her elderly father-in-law, Sidney      Chambers, and for Lawrence's mother, Clara. Her love and      service seemingly knew no bounds.       Those who loved Lucile will remember her devotion to      protocol, her gracious way of living, and her love of family.      They will remember her acute appreciation of the fine arts;      her gifts of writing prose and poetry; her love of reading      and of books, her fascination with history (especially      through the D.A.R.), and her delight in the unique (how many      American ``witches'' do you know)? She will be remembered for      her life of service to her family and her church; and her      appreciation of God's divine purpose.       While recent months may have seemingly robber her of many      of the things which she appreciated most, her inability to      enjoy those things completely made all of us who visited and      loved her, acutely aware of all those finer appreciations      which she enjoyed and instilled in others.       She was greatly loved, and will be greatly missed. ``Well      done, thou good and faithful servant.''                          ____________________
