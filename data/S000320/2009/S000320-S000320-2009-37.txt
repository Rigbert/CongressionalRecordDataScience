 President, I wish to join in and associate myself with some of the remarks my colleague, the chairman of the committee, Senator Dodd, has made. One, we have what we think, with the Dodd-Shelby substitute, is a step in the right direction. It is a step in the right direction for consumers. It is also a step in the right direction to bring balance to the credit card industry. Is it everything I would want from the Republican side? No, but it is not everything that Senator Dodd and some of the Democrats would want. We have worked together to forge an outcome. We have put a lot of thought and a lot of work into this, as have our staffs, who have worked days and nights. We are close. We could pass this bill today if we could bring a few more people together. I think this is a milestone as far as protecting consumers, informing consumers, as well as to give some balance.  You cannot take risk out of the marketplace. You have to consider risk when you make loans. We have some of that in here. But we have great reforms in here that I think we can live with. Some people don't want a bill on both sides, or the others want something that is probably not achievable, not good for the economy, and not good for the American people. We have to remember that the credit card business does extend credit, to some extent, to people where that is their only credit. This bill will at least let them know a lot of the terms upfront. It will letthem know what they are paying, and so forth. It is a step in the right direction. I hope we can pass that bill. I would like to do it today.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Missouri is recognized.
