President, there will be no rollcall votes on Monday, November 15. Senators can expect the next vote to occur on Wednesday morning, November 17.  On behalf of the Senate, I extend our thanks to the Presiding Officer for his extraordinary contribution, his work in the chair, and for the duty he has assumed this evening.  I also thank all members of the staff, as Senator Reid would say, within the sound of my voice.                          ____________________
