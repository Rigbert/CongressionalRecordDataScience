 That means a balanced mix of responsible spending cuts and new revenue from those who can afford it the most.  All of the bipartisan groups that have examined our budget situation have acknowledged this reality--Simpson-Bowles, Gang of 6, Domenici-Rivlin--and recommended more revenue than the roughly $600 billion that we generated in the yearend deal. In fact, Simpson-Bowles and the Gang of 6 each recommended well over $2 trillion in new revenue, which is several times more than the yearend deal. Repealing this budget's proposed revenue increase and striking the reconciliation instruction would be wholly irresponsible. We cannot cut our way out of this problem.  I urge my colleagues to vote no.  For the information of all Senators, this is the last vote this evening. Tomorrow there are votes beginning at 11. I ask again that all Senators be here. We are going to move through a lot of amendments tomorrow. I have a lot of Senators asking me to have their amendment voted on. I assure everyone that by 1 a.m., 2 a.m. tomorrow night, many Senators won't have that opportunity unless they are here and help move that process along.  I yield the floor and ask for a ``no'' vote.  I ask for the yeas and nays.
