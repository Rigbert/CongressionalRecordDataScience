 President, this weekend U.S. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine will retire his badge and say goodbye to the Senate after several decades of law enforcement service, including more than three right here in the Capitol.  Chief Dine was police chief in a nearby Maryland suburb when he first came to this position in December of 2012. You could say the appointment was a bit of a homecoming for him given that Chief Dine began his more than 40 years in law enforcement with the DC Metropolitan Police Department. He served there for 27 years and rose through the ranks, eventually becoming assistant chief of police.  I know it is never easy to leave the Capitol, but you have to imagine Chief Dine has a lot to look forward to in retirement. After all, this is a guy who has been known to get into the office before the sun rises and leave after it sets. Most would need some rest after so many years of that kind of schedule.  So here is what we would like to say: The Senate appreciates Chief Dine's willingness to serve our country. And after nearly four decades in law enforcement, we wish him all the best in his retirement.                            ____________________
