 President, I am very proud to come to the Senate floor today to announce that the 1992 Census of Agriculture has named Sussex County, the southern most county in the beautiful State of Delaware, as the No. 1 poultry producing county in the United States. As my hometown newspaper, the Wilmington News Journal, so eloquently stated it: ``Sussex County still rules the roost as the chicken-growin'est county in the nation.''  Of course, being the No. 1 producer is nothing new for Sussex County--the county has officially remained the No. 1 producer since 1982. In fact, Sussex County has been the unofficial leading poultry producer since the industry got its start in Ocean View, DE, in 1923.  It all started with Mrs. Wilmer Steele when she placed an order for 50 chicks, intended for egg production, and ended up with 500. She decided to raise rather than return the extra chicks, and when they were big enough she sold approximately 400 of them to a local buyer. Three years later, she and her husband were raising 25,000 young chickens and selling them to the local population who were discovering the versatility of chicken meat. America is eating about 10 times as much chicken today as we were in 1925, numbers attributable to the fact that chicken is high in protein, low in fat, tasty, and very affordable.  Mr. President, we are doing everything we can in Delaware to maintain the productivity of the poultry industry nationwide. Today there is a disease, harmless to humans but deadly for chickens, affecting the productivity of Delaware poultry industry flocks. Avian diseases such as this affect flocks across the country on a regular basis. In an effort to prevent the economic damage done by these outbreaks, the University of Delaware, in cooperation with the Federal Government and private industry, is building a poultry research facility that will help the poultry industry solve this type of disease problem.  I have worked very closely with the poultry industry people in my State to get this facility up and running. The Delmarva poultry industry has an outstanding record of commitment to research and development in avian diseases and I am hopeful that the remainder of the funds needed to finish this project can be secured this year. The growers who are responsible for keeping Sussex County and the Delmarva Peninsula in the ranks of the top producers know the importance of this facility to the national production of poultry.  Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Sussex County for, once again, achieving No. 1 producer status and for providing the American public with healthy and affordable nutrition.                          ____________________
