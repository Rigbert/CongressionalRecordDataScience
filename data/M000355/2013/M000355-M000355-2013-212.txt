 REID. I would be glad to yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. As my friend indicated, we were talking about this before the session opened. This kid is one the most incredible competitors I have ever seen.  The game was on the west coast, and I don't know whether my friend stayed up that late, but I didn't stay up late enough to see the crash into the wall. So when my friend speaks to his mother, remind her that this is one thing on which leaders on both sides fully agree: We are hoping Harper has a speedy recovery and is back in the lineup.
