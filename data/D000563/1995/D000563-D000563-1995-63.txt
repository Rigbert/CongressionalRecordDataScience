Speaker, to my colleague, thank you for the special order. It is a shame we have to come here late at night with an almost empty Chamber to talk about an issue which is literally on the minds of every American.  We are in the eleventh month of this Gingrich revolution in the House of Representatives. America remembers when it got started, some of the promises that were made.  Do you recall the promise from the Speaker that every amendment considered on the floor would go right up on the Internet so all across America Americans would know exactly what was being debated? There was to be no effort to put things through without clear scrutiny.  Do you recall the promise of open hearings so that every American would know what was going on in the House of Representatives under this new Gingrich revolution? Do you recall the promise of open rules, so that we could have as many amendments offered and have a healthy debate, a deliberative procedure?  Well, you may remember those promises but, frankly, take a look at what is happening with Medicare and Medicaid. A 421-page bill that has been heard one or two days at the most in committee, destined to come here to the floor of the House of Representatives next week, and we hear tonight from the majority leader, Mr. Armey, we are going to be given two hours of debate.  Well, one would think surely two hours is enough. It cannot be that complicated. For 70 million Americans it is very complicated. Medicare is literally, literally, their lifeline, as to whether or not they can obtain affordable quality health care. For my mother, for parents and grandparents of so many Americans, Medicare is more than just another government program. It is a lifeline.  The Republicans want to cut $270 billion out of this program. You say, well, in Federal terms that cannot have much impact. But it will, in terms of the services that are offered to our parents and grandparents, in terms of the payments to the providers, in terms of the expenses which may be shifted to the families of our elderly when the elderly themselves cannot pay.  On the Medicaid side, the story is even more horrific. Half of the payments to nursing homes across America are made by Medicaid. The Republicans are coming on the floor with a proposal that does not protect families of those in nursing homes from having their own assets attacked once the elderly person in the nursing home runs out of money.  It has got a long Federal term; it is called spousal impoverishment. In the State of Texas they brought it to the vernacular, it was the hock-your-home provision. Once grandma or grandpa is in a nursing home and runs out of money, they go back to the family and say maybe you ought to pay now, since they run out of money. The Federal law protects that from happening today. The Republican proposal does not contain that protection.  Is that an important thing to debate for families across America? Is that worth two hours of our time at least? You bet it is. Instead, we are going to have this jammed down our throats. And when senior citizens came to this Capitol building and and said they wanted to know what is in this bill, they wanted to know the impact it will have, they were greeted by the Gingrich revolutionaries with handcuffs. Sixty-seven and 68-year-old ladies who come into a committee room, irritate the chairman, and they are escorted out in handcuffs? What has this come to?  Frankly, what we are dealing with here is a fact that has been made known by the gentlewoman from Connecticut. If you are a special interest group, if you have a political action committee, if you have the clout, you get a personal meeting with Speaker Gingrich and a deal. The doctors got it. I guess we should say God bless the doctors. They know how to work this system. But the seniors, obviously, have not figured it out. They still think this is on the square. They think you walk into a hearing room and learn what is in the bill and debate the bill and ask tough, yes, sir, tough questions. They were escorted out in handcuffs.  Thank goodness, the charges were dropped on them. But consider the embarrassment to these people who took time out of their own busy lives at a point in their lives when they are retired to come to the U.S. Capitol here to be arrested.  Now, the Speaker tells us if he does not get his way on this bill, he is going to shut down the Government. He is going to shut down the Government. Well, I have got a bill that I would like him to consider then if he would like to shut it down. If he wants a train wreck, it is called no budget, no pay. It says if Members of Congress are witnesses and part of a train wreck, then as the train crew, they are not going to get a paycheck.                              {time}  2015  That's right. We close down the Federal Government. We close down the paychecks for Members of Congress starting with the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. If we think we can be that irresponsible, to jeopardize critical programs like Medicare and Medicaid in the Federal Government, we do not deserve a paycheck. That is my bill.  I hope Members on the floor tonight, Mr. Speaker, who are joining in this special order will try to address the central theme here, the central question: If the so-called proposal to save Medicare is so good, so right, and so timely, why are the Republicans hiding it? Why will they not bring it out in the public for us to have a hearing? Why can we have no more than 2 hours of debate on the floor?  I will tell my colleagues why. Because these crazy ideas cannot stand the glare of sunlight. They cannot make it in the court of public opinion. And the bottom line is, Americans know, as sure as I am standing here, we are cutting Medicare for a tax cut for the wealthiest people in this country. It is Republican trickle-down economics. It is good news for doctors in big business, but not good news for grandparents.  I thank the gentlewoman for taking the special order.  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois, and It is the question of----
