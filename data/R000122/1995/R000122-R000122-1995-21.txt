Speaker, on July 26, 1994, Yitzhak Rabin, Prime Minister and Defense Minister of the State of Israel, addressed the United States Congress. These are his words on that day:       Each year, on Memorial Day, for the Fallen of Israel's war,      I go to the cemetery of Mount Herzl in Jerusalem, facing me      are the graves, headstones, the colorful flowers blooming on      them, and thousands of pairs of weeping eyes. I stand there,      in front of that large, silent crowd, and read in their eyes      the words of, ``The Young Dead Soldiers,'' as a famous      American poet, Archibald MacLeish, entitled the poem from      which I take these lines:     They say;     Whether our lives and our deaths     were for peace and a new hope,     we cannot say;     it is you who must say this.                              {time}  1300  Today Yitzhak Rabin is among the fallen on Mount Herzl. He has given us his life; we must give it meaning. We must labor and live so that his life and death stands for peace and a new hope.  Prime Minister Rabin closed his remarks with an ancient blessing and a continuing plea for peace. Again, in his words: Blessed are you, oh, Lord, who has preserved us and sustained us and enabled us to reach this time. God bless the peace.
