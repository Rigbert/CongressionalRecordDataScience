. District Court for the District of Nevada and Susie Morgan to fill a judicial vacancy in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. Both nominations have the bipartisan support of their home state Senators, and were reported by the Judiciary Committee over 4 months ago. The Senate is still only considering judicial nominations that could and should have been confirmed last year. The judicial vacancy rate remains nearly twice what it was at this point in the first term of President George W. Bush.  Last week, I noted an article about the ``crushing caseload'' that the Federal courts in Arizona currently face. In that article, the Chief Judge of Arizona's Federal trial court noted that they are in ``dire circumstances'' and that they are ``under water'' from all the cases on their docket. Like the district court in Arizona, the one in Nevada is also in desperate need of judges, as evidenced by its designation as a judicial emergency. As that same article noted, an insufficiency of judges ``lessens the quality of justice for all parties involved.'' This is why it is so crucial that we confirm these nominees as soon as possible.  Delay is harmful for everyone. An editorial from the Tuscaloosa News last week stated that ``[D]elays are objectionable in themselves: They deprive the courts of needed personnel, slow the administration of justice and deter well-qualified candidates from agreeing to be considered for the bench.'' I ask unanimous consent to include a copy of the article, entitled ``Congress needs to stop judicial partisan games,'' in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.
