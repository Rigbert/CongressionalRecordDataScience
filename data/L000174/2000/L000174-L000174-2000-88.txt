In fact, the former Republican Congressman from Oklahoma, Mickey Edwards, co-chaired that study. They found, without taking sides and without taking political stands, that women and minorities took longer to be confirmed by the Senate. Unfortunately, a lot of those women and minorities are not even getting a vote.  Again I say if Governor Bush means it, pick up the phone and call 202-224-3121; ask the Senate switchboard to connect him to the Republican leader and say: You know, I have made it a tenet of my campaign that the Senate should vote on a nomination within 60 days. You can bring every one of these people to the floor for a vote, up or down, today. Let's do so. Who knows. We will find out how the Senate feels about them. Are they for them or are they against them? Right now, instead of voting yes or no, we vote ``maybe,'' by having one or two Senators in the dark of night put holds on these people.  I see the distinguished Senator from Washington State, who has been one of the great leaders on the issue of violence against women, on sex trafficking, and on these other issues. I ask her, how much time does the Senator from Washington require?
