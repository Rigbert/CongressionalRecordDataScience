Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to say this is a bipartisan bill. It will save children's lives. It will prevent other crimes to victims like Megan Kanka from happening not just in the United States but around the world.  I think my good friend, Ann Wagner, said a moment ago that Megan is an angel. Her parents are guardian angels. They have taken a pain, an agony, and a trauma that is incomprehensible and have worked tirelessly to get Megan'sLaw enacted throughout the United States and in some other countries. This will take it to the next level and will establish that true reciprocal reciprocity regimen, whereby we notice, they notice, everybody knows what is going on to take the secrecy out of this travel when a convicted pedophile hops on a plane with the idea of exploiting children.  This will have a very measurable impact and will protect children from this kind of agony.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
