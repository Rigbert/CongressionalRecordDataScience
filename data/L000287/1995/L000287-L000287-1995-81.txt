Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Collins amendment.  It is time to do right by our Nation's poor and minority communities. Too often, we throw garbage, place incinerators and dump dirty water in these communities.  This amendment is an important step in making a bad bill better. People have a right to know what is in their water, the water they drink. The poor and minorities have the same right to clean water as the rest of us.  Mr. Chairman, our right to clean water is threatened.  In 1972, Democrats and Republicans came together to end pollution of our water. They recognized that no industry, no person--no matter how rich or how powerful--has the right to poison our streams, our lakes, or our people.  The Clean Water Act is a proud, bipartisan law that stands up for the common person. It says ``no'' to those who would poison our environment. We must not allow it to be weakened.  I plead, with all my colleagues to make this bad bill a little bit better. Support the Collins en bloc amendment.
