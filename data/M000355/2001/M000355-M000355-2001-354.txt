 WELLSTONE. I am happy to yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. The Senator from Minnesota is entirely correct; that is exactly what will happen.  I wonder if he would be willing to modify his amendment to eliminate the exception for the media. The media are specifically exempt from all of these bills. If we are going to be pure, I say to my friend from Minnesota, why eliminate the media in the last 60 days if we are going to try to get true balance across the entire board?
