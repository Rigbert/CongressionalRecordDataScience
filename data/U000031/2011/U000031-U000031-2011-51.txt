AF&PA Statement on the Energy Tax Prevention Act (H.R. 910)       Washington.--American Forest & Paper Association President      and CEO Donna Harman today issued the following statement      regarding the Energy Tax Prevention Act (H.R. 910) as      introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Energy and      Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton (R-MI), Agriculture      Committee Ranking Member Collin Peterson (D-MN),      Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Ranking Member      Nick Rahall (D-WV), and Energy and Power Subcommittee      Chairman Ed Whitfield (R-KY).       ``I applaud the introduction of this bi-partisan      legislation to bring a halt to regulation of greenhouse gases      through the Clean Air Act. There is broad agreement that the      Clean Air Act is the wrong tool to regulate greenhouse gases.      The rule serves to impose high costs and business uncertainty      related to new investments in the manufacturing sector.      Congress, not EPA, should decide energy policy; in      particular, issues related to investments in renewable      energy, including biomass.       ``The Greenhouse Gas regulations are the latest example of      those that would hamper job growth and put obstacles in the      way of American business to compete in the global      marketplace. Inexplicably, this is happening as other parts      of the Administration are promoting the need for more exports      and job creation.       ``I commend Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred      Upton (R-MI), Agriculture Committee Ranking Member Collin      Peterson (D-MN), Transportation and Infrastructure Committee      Ranking Member Nick Rahall (D-WV), and Energy and Power      Subcommittee Chairman Ed Whitfield (R-KY) for introducing      this legislation. We look forward to working with Congress on      this very important issue.''                                  ____                                            American Coalition for                                       Clean Coal Electricity,                                                   Alexandria, VA.      House, Senate Introduce Legislation To Stop EPA Regulations       Alexandria, VA.--The American Coalition for Clean Coal      Electricity today praised the introduction in the U.S. House      and Senate of bipartisan legislation that would ensure the      authority to regulate emissions of greenhouse gases rests      with Congress, and not the EPA. The bills were introduced by      House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Fred Upton and      Senate Environment and Public Works Ranking Member James      Inhofe.       ``The EPA's sweeping regulations will affect the lives of      millions of Americans, from their electricity bills to the      economy as a whole. Given this wide-ranging impact, it is      important that Congress--not the EPA--address greenhouse gas      emissions in a manner that takes into consideration both      environmental and economic impacts,'' said Steve Miller,      president and CEO of ACCCE.       The bills would eliminate EPA's authority to regulate      greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act, which is      ill-suited for that task. The legislation introduced today      would leave in place all of the essential provisions of the      Clean Air Act.       EPA's proposed regulations on greenhouse gas emissions      could have a dramatic impact     on jobs and the economy. A recent analysis by the American      Council for Capital Formation concluded that uncertainty      caused by these regulations could, by 2014, result in the      loss of between $25 billion to $75 billion in investment in      the economy and that this could result in the loss of between      476,000 and 1.4 million jobs.       ``At a time when Americans are struggling with high energy      costs, the EPA's proposed regulations could make electricity      more expensive. The affordability of coal-fueled electricity      has helped moderate increases in energy costs, and continued      reliance on coal can help the U.S. recover economically and      American businesses to compete globally,'' said Miller. ``We      thank Chairman Upton and Senator Inhofe for their leadership      on this critical issue as well as Members of Congress from      both parties who have agreed to be initial co-sponsors of the      bill.''                                  ____                                      American Electric Power,                                      Columbus, OH, March 3, 2011.     Hon. Fred Upton,     Chairman, House Committee on Energy and Commerce, U.S. House          of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Upton: I am writing today to express my      strong support for the Energy Tax Prevention Act of 2011.       When the Clean Air Act was originally enacted, it was not      the expectation of Congress that this Act be applied to      greenhouse gases. In fact, the Act was designed to regulate      ambient air quality and hazardous air pollutants, among other      matters. Moreover, the regulation of greenhouse gases was not      mandated by the Supreme Court ruling and therefore is not      necessarily required by the Clean Air Act.       It is clear to us at American Electric Power that the issue      of climate change policy should be addressed exclusively      through the legislative process. The Congress of the United      States is better equipped to holistically evaluate not only      the environmental impacts of greenhouse gases but also the      impacts of greenhouse regulation on the economy, employment,      energy and international trade. I firmly believe that this      approach is crucial to ensuring a sound national policy.       I again thank you for your leadership on this important      matter, and AEP looks forward to working with you to enact      this legislation.           Sincerely,                                            Michael J. Morris,                                            Chairman of the Board,     President and Chief Executive Officer.                                  ____                                                          American                                       Farm Bureau Federation,                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2011.     Hon. Fred Upton,     U.S. House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Upton: The American Farm Bureau Federation      (AFBF) strongly supports the Energy Tax Prevention Act of      2011 that you plan to introduce in the House of      Representatives.       This bill would preempt regulation of greenhouse gases      (GHG) by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) based on      climate change considerations. The bill would not affect      previously enacted or proposed rules regarding emissions from      mobile sources.       The regulation of GHG does not fit within the current      framework of the Clean Air Act. Unlike other regulated      pollutants, where Clean Air Act thresholds are sufficient to      regulate the largest emitters, GHG regulation at statutorily      required, thresholds holds the prospect of costly and      burdensome permit requirements on farms, ranches, schools,      hospitals and some large residences.       Farmers and ranchers will be particularly disadvantaged      under such a regulatory scheme. The costs incurred by      utilities, refiners and manufacturers to comply with GHG      regulations will be passed along to their customers,      including farmers and ranchers, increasing their fuel,      fertilizer and energy costs. Unlike other types of      businesses, farmers and ranchers have much less ability to      pass along such costs. Additionally, under the thresholds set      by the Clean Air Act, many farmers and ranchers would      eventually be required to obtain costly and burdensome Title      V operating permits or New Source Review/Prevention of      Significant Deterioration permits. EPA itself estimates that      more than 37,000 farms will be subject to Title V permits, at      a cost of more than $866 million.       While the costs of compliance may be high, the      environmental benefits from EPA regulation are marginal at      best. Unless and until an international agreement is reached,      unilateral action by EPA will have little or no environmental      impact. EPA Administrator Jackson has acknowledged this fact      in testimony before Congress.       The president has stated that congressional action is a      better way to address the issue than EPA regulation. We      agree. The Energy Tax Prevention Act recognizes this as well      and places the responsibility for regulating GHGs where it      belongs--with Congress. We commend you for introducing this      bill and look forward to working with you on it.           Sincerely,                                                     Bob Stallman,                                                        President.  I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton.)                              {time}  1600
