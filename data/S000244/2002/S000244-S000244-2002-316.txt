Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2054) to give the consent of Congress to an agreement or compact between Utah and Nevada regarding a change in the boundaries of those States, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 2054       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. CONSENT TO AGREEMENT OR COMPACT.       (a) Consent Given.--The consent of the Congress of the      United States is given to Utah and Nevada to enter into an      agreement or compact that meets the following requirements:       (1) The agreement or compact is consented to by the      legislatures of Utah and Nevada and such consent is evidenced      through Acts enacted by the legislatures of Utah and Nevada      not later than December 31, 2006.       (2) The agreement or compact is not in conflict with any      Federal law.       (3) The agreement or compact does not change the boundary      of any other State.       (4) The agreement or compact does not result in the      transfer to Nevada of more than a total of 10,000 acres of      lands that are located within Utah on the date of the      enactment of this Act.       (5) The agreement or compact is entered into for the      primary purpose of changing the boundaries of Utah and Nevada      so that the lands located within the municipal boundaries of      the city of Wendover, Utah, on the date of the enactment of      this Act, including the municipal airport, shall, after the      implementation of the agreement or compact, be located within      the boundaries of Nevada. This paragraph shall not prohibit      the agreement or compact from including provisions that are      reasonably related to the following:       (A) A change in the boundaries of Utah and Nevada for the      purposes described in this paragraph.       (B) Including other Utah lands immediately surrounding the      municipal boundaries of Wendover, Utah, as described in this      paragraph, in a transfer to Nevada if such inclusion would--       (i) facilitate the management of lands transferred under      the agreement or compact or the     placement of the boundaries of Utah or Nevada; or       (ii) minimize the likelihood of future residential      development on remaining Utah lands.       (C) Any other provision in the agreement or compact      regarding a change in ownership of, management of, or other      responsibilities or obligations related to--       (i) providing State, county, or municipal services;       (ii) public utilities;       (iii) public schools; or       (iv) the municipal airport referred to in this paragraph.       (6) The agreement or compact is consented to by a majority      of the registered qualified electors who cast a vote on the      agreement or compact held in each of the cities of West      Wendover, Nevada, and Wendover, Utah, on the date of the      regularly scheduled general election for Federal office in      2002. The question in the vote held in each of the cities of      West Wendover, Nevada, and Wendover, Utah, under this      paragraph shall contain the same language to the extent      allowed by local law. Such language shall explain, with      specificity sufficient to inform voters, all components of      the agreement or compact regarding changes in ownership of,      management of, or other responsibilities, costs, or      obligations related to--       (A) State, county, and municipal social and public      services;       (B) public utilities;       (C) land use;       (D) community economics;       (E) public schools; and       (F) the local municipal airport.       (b) Effective Date of Agreement or Compact.--An agreement      or compact entered into in accordance with subsection (a)      shall become effective upon the fulfillment of the      requirement of subsection (a)(1) without further consent or      ratification on the part of the Congress of the United      States.       (c) United States Ownership and Jurisdiction Retained.--     Nothing in this Act or in the agreement or compact consented      to under this Act shall be construed to impair or in any      manner affect the ownership or jurisdiction of the United      States in and over any lands within the boundaries of Utah or      Nevada.
