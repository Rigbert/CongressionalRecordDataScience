 President, first let me say I know on behalf of everyone in the Senate how relieved we are that our colleague Trent Lott and his wife are safe. We all thank him for his inspiring observations about the experiences of the past week, the reactions of the people, the response of people around America to this great crisis. I say to our friend from Mississippi how grateful we are he is safe and sound and back among us. We will be working with him to make sure we deal with the immediate needs and make whatever adjustments we can for the future, to try to make sure the next time, God forbid something like this happens to our country, we will be even better organized to respond.  I yield the floor.
