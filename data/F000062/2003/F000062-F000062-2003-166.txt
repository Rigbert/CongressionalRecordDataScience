 President, the Mayor has asked for a 5-year pilot. He said it would be for the less affluent. They are defined by families of 4 at 185 percent of poverty. This is a family of 4 that earns $34,000 a year, or below, and these children would be given priority by lottery to have an opportunity to go to another school. It is like a golden key. It gives them an opportunity to try something else. It is voluntary. Nobody is forced to do it. Why is everybody so threatened by it? No one is forced to do it. If a family wants to try it, this provides them with that opportunity.  Again, these are schools identified for improvement, corrective action, or restructuring. That is the language from the bill. And priority is given to students and families who lack financial resources to take advantage of educational opportunities. That is the language in the bill. So for $7,500 a child, 2,000 youngsters will have an opportunity to try this, to see if it makes a difference.  It might offer some smaller classes, or uniforms; it might offer more attention; it might offer an easier learning environment; it may offer better discipline. Certainly, there will be some curriculum changes. There will certainly be more emphasis on reading, writing, and arithmetic--the basics, if you will.  Now we have in the Appropriations Committee, thanks to the accommodation of Senator DeWine and Senator Judd Gregg, made several changes in the original bill. It was brought to my attention to take a look at the Zelman Supreme Court case. Senator Voinovich mentioned that to us. I believe he was Governor of Ohio when Cleveland put forward this program, and it went up to the Supreme Court in a case called Zelman v. Simmons-Harris. So we took that case and this bill and we tried to bring them together so that we added religion to the general nondiscrimination clause, which also covers race, color, national origin, and sex, and extend the nondiscrimination clause to both schools and the entity operating the voucher program. We added language clarifying that the bill does not override title VII to ensure that we don't change title VII's provisions permitting religious discrimination under certain circumstances.  We deleted certain other language which we thought might impact the establishment clause. We increased the role of the Mayor to make the Mayor responsible for the details and functioning and accountability of this program, and to ensure the proper use of public funds by the schools participating in this voucher program.  The amendment I have sent to the desk is an additional strengthening of the testing and evaluation components of the bill to try to ensure that scholarship students are taught by quality teachers. Essentially what this bill says is every voucher child must be taught by a teacher that at least has a college education. Additionally, we have changed the testing requirements. I have had a conversation with Cardinal McCarrick. Since about one-third of the private schools in the Districts are Catholic schools, I talked to the Cardinal about the advisability of having the same tests given to a student on a voucher in a parochial, or secular school, as would be given to a student in the public school. He agreed that would be a very significant thing to do.  I would like to read into the Record a portion of the letter from Cardinal McCarrick.       . . . I want to assure you that we are not only open to      being accountable for any public funds which the families of      our students receive, but anxious to be able to prove the      value of our education. This would mean being willing to      administer the same set of examinations that are given in the      public school system.       I was happy to be able to tell you that in the District of      Columbia 47% of our students are non-Catholic--  Forty-seven percent of the students in the DC Catholic schools are non-Catholic--     and in the heavily impacted inner city areas it goes up to      67% or higher. My great predecessor, Cardinal Hickey, used to      say that we don't educate them because they are Catholic, but      because we are Catholic and we accept this as a      responsibility for being good neighbors and committed to      serving the community.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    Archdiocese of Washington,                                Washington, DC, September 8, 2003.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: It was good to be able to speak to      you on the phone on Friday. I promised to send you this      letter to clarify the situation of our Catholic schools in      the District of Columbia. First of all, I want to assure you      that we are not only open to being accountable for any public      funds which the families of our students receive, but anxious      to be able to prove the value of our education. This would      mean being willing to administer the same set of examinations      that are given in the public school system.       I was happy to be able to tell you that in the District of      Columbia 47% of our students     are non-Catholic and in the heavily impacted inner city areas      it goes up to 67% or higher. My great predecessor, Cardinal      Hickey, used to say that we don't educate them because they      are Catholic, but because we are Catholic and we accept this      as a responsibility for being good neighbors and committed to      serving the community.       I am so greatful to you for your concern for the parents of      these children. So many of our parents work three jobs and      more to be able to afford the education in our schools. The      help that this legislation would make available would be such      a blessing for them.       If there is any further information that you might find      useful, please do not hesitate to have your staff contact me.       With every good wish and deepest gratitude, I am           Sincerely,                                      Theodore Cardinal McCarrick,                                         Archbishop of Washington.
