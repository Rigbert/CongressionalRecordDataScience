 President, today I wish to honor a family who has chosen to live and work in the small town of Cromona, KY, which they have come to love over the years. The Whitaker family has successfully owned and operated Superior Printing and Publishing Company, Inc. since 1958. Three generations of Whitakers have been involved in the proceedings of the company, with a fourth learning the family trade as they grow.  Superior Printing was started as a local printing operation by Charles and Bobbie Whitaker. They began the business in a remote part of Letcher County, KY, in a town called Cromona. The small town now has a population of 665 people, but the success of Superior Printing has far surpassed the boundaries of little Cromona. The company has become one of the most popular printing firms in the tristate area, offering business in Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia.  You may be asking yourself, how does a company in such a small town become so successful? Charles's son, Mike Whitaker, president of Superior Printing, thinks it is due to their customer service. He has said that the only difference between Superior and the larger firms in metropolitan areas is the family atmosphere that Superior provides. Superior employees have love and pride for their hometown and home State, and they don't try to hide it.  Superior provides services that promote the local economy and the entities within the local economy alike. They offer professional color printing that has been known to help all of the local schools in the area with various things like sports programs and bulletins. They also are a big distributor of print for local fundraisers and fundraising groups. The Whitakers have also recently just began printing hardback books--something that isn't common in most local printing firms. Mike believes that the new hardback binding will help local authors be able to easily print and publish their books. With some of the amazing artistic talent I have seen come out of the Bluegrass State, I am anxious to see some of the works by Kentucky's own authors that will come from this new way to print and publish.  Not only does the Whitaker family run a successful printing and publishing business, but they keep busy with providing Letcher County with the news in their own paper, the News-Press. The Whitaker family is devoted to keeping the locals of Letcher County informed about what is going on in the county, State, and country, further proving that the Whitakers are truly focused on bettering themselves and those around them.  Charles and his wife Bobbie are the proud parents of Mike, who has two sons, Paul and Nick. Paul is a U.S. Army veteran who has completed two tours of Active Duty in Iraq, while Nick has just recently graduated from Eastern Kentucky University. Both Paul and Nick are planning on staying in Letcher County so that they can be close to their family and local community.  Whether it be creating a business that provides a convenient and professional service to the local community, making a conscience effort to support the local economy with their services, informing the citizens of Letcher County on the news, or helping many undiscovered Kentucky authors and artists get the exposure they deserve, the Whitaker family of Cromona, KY, have made a contribution to their State that will not go unnoticed. I am inspired to see an entire family give in so many ways to their local community.  Mr. President, I would like to ask at this time for my colleagues in the Senate to join me in recognizing the Whitaker family of Cromona, KY. There was recently an article published in Eastern Kentucky's local periodical magazine, the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, highlighting the hard work of the Whitaker family. I ask unanimous consent that said article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Sentinel-Echo: Silver Edition, Nov. 2011]         Superior Printing: Family Pride in Each and Every Job       As you wind along State Route 805 in northern Letcher      County, you may not think there's much going on. But Cromona,      Kentucky (population 665), is home to one of the finest print      shops in the tri-state. Established in 1958 by Charles and      Bobbie Whitaker, Superior Printing and Publishing Company,      Inc. is a thriving, family-owned business with three      generations of Whitakers working and a fourth generation      expected to ``watch and learn.''       Charles and Bobbie Whitaker's older son, Mike, is the      president of the company and currently sees to its day-to-day      operations. The company offers all the expected print shop      products and services like business forms, letterheads and      envelopes, but what is surprising is that it also houses the      region's only four-color, sheet-fed press capable of printing      up to a 19-by-26 sheet.       ``The installation of the press in 2008 has increased our      production capabilities as well as the quality of products      that we can offer,'' said Mike Whitaker. ``Local firms no      longer have to rely upon faraway print houses for their      color-printing needs. We're very competitive with the big,      out-of-town firms so we can save our customers time and      money. Most of our customers really appreciate the      convenience of having us close by, and they understand how      important it is to keep business here at home when they      can.''       Mike explained how their press and booklet maker, which      automatically collates, folds, staples, and trims books and      magazines, has boosted the company's production of programs      local schools use as fundraisers. ``Last fall we produced      football programs for 16 different schools in Kentucky and      Virginia. Our jobs range from full-color brochures and rack      cards for the tourism industry to flyers, multi-page      newsletters, magazines and books. In fact, more than 500      businesses throughout the region have turned to us for their      printing needs.''       Since the press purchase, the Whitakers have added hardback      book-binding capabilities to the business. ``This is new to      us, and we are just getting started producing hardback books      in small and large quantities,'' Mike said. He is especially      proud of a leather-bound project utilizing the new hardback      book-binding equipment. ``With the growing number of local      authors, we are excited to offer both soft- and hardback book      bindings to our customers.''       In addition to commercial printing, the Whitakers own and      operate the News-Press, a newspaper based in Letcher County.      The conservative-based newspaper has promoted the coal      industry, faith and family for over 50 years.       Offering quality products at competitive prices is the mark      of any successful business, and Superior Printing is no      exception. ``Perhaps the only difference between our firm and      one from a metropolitan area is the     sense of family pride that goes into each and every job,''      Mike said. ``We may have to work a little harder at getting      our raw materials such as paper, plates, and ink, but we make      up for it with the satisfaction that we are able to live and      work in the place we love, here in eastern Kentucky.''       Mike Whitaker's sentiments are echoed by his sons, Paul and      Nick, who both work in the business. Paul is a U.S. Army      veteran with two tours of duty in Iraq behind him and is      anxious to spend the remainder of his adult life near his      home. Nick is a recent graduate of Eastern Kentucky      University who chose to stay in the area to be near family as      well. Both plan to raise their families much the same way      they were raised in Letcher County.       If you have a print order for Superior Printing, you may      want to call it in or perhaps email it. If you want to stop      by the printing company to place your order, call ahead for      directions. It is a little hard to find.                          ____________________
