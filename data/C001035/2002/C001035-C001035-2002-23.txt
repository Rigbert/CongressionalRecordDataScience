President, I am pleased to be joining my colleague from West Virginia, Senator Rockefeller, in introducing the Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act, which is intended to improve the way we care for people at the end of their lives.  Noted health economist, Uwe Reinhardt, once observed that ``Americans are the only people on earth who believe that death is negotiable.'' Advancements in medicine, public health, and technology have enabled more and more of us to live longer and healthier lives. However, when medical treatment can no longer promise a continuation of life, patients and their families should not have to fear that the process of dying will be marked by preventable pain, avoidable distress, or care that is inconsistent with their values or wishes.  The fact is, dying is a universal experience, and it is time to re-examine how we approach death and dying and how we care for people at the end of their lives. Clearly, there is more that we can do to relieve suffering, respect personal choice and dignity, and provide opportunities for people to find meaning and comfort at life's conclusion.  Unfortunately, most Medicare patients and their physicians do not currently discuss death or routinely make advance plans for end-of-life care. As a result, about one-fourth of Medicare funds are now spent on care at the end of life that is geared toward expensive, high-technology interventions and ``rescue'' care. While most Americans say they would prefer to die at home, studies show that almost 80 percent die in institutions where they may be in pain, and where they are subjected to high-tech treatments that merely prolong suffering.  Moreover, according to a Dartmouth study conducted by Dr. Jack Wennberg, where a patient lives has a direct impact on how that patient dies. The study found that the amount of medical treatment Americans receive in their final months varies tremendously in the different parts of the country, and it concluded that the determination of whether or not an older patient dies in the hospital probably has more to do with the supply of hospital beds than the patient's needs or preference.  The Advance Planning and Compassionate Care Act is intended to help us improve the way our health care system serves patients at the end of their lives. Among other provisions, the bill makes a number of changes to the Patient Self-Determination Act of 1990 to facilitate appropriate discussions and individual autonomy in making difficult discussions about end-of-life care. For instance, the legislation requires that every Medicare beneficiary receiving care in a hospital or nursing facility be given the opportunity to discuss end-of-life care and the preparation of an advanced directive with an appropriately trained professional within the institution. The legislation also requires that if a patient has an advanced directive, it must be displayed in a prominent place in the medical record so that all the doctors and nurses can clearly see it.  In addition, the legislation authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to study end-of-life issues and also to develop demonstration projects to develop models for end-of-life care for Medicare, Medicaid, and State Child Health Insurance Program, S-CHIP, patients. The Institute of Medicine recently released a report that concluded that we need to improve palliative and end-of-life care for children with terminal illnesses. According to the report, far too often children with fatal or potentially fatal conditions and their families fail to receive competent, compassionate, and consistent care that meets their physical, emotional, and spiritual needs. Our legislation therefore requires that at least one of these demonstrations focus particularly on pediatric end-of-life care.  Finally, the legislation establishes a telephone hotline to provide consumer information and advice concerning advance directives, end-of-life issues, and medical decisionmaking and also establishes an End-of-Life Care Advisory Board to assist the Secretary of Health and Human Services in developing outcome standards and measures to evaluate end-of-life care programs and projects.  The legislation we are introducing today is particularly important in light of the debate on physician-assisted suicide. The desire for assisted suicide is generally driven by concerns about the quality of care for the terminally ill; by the fear of prolonged pain, loss of dignity and emotional strain on family members. Such worries would recede and support for assisted suicide would evaporate if better palliative care and more effective pain management were widely available.  Patients and their families should be able to trust that the care they receive at the end of their lives is not only of high quality, but also that it respects their desires for peace, autonomy, anddignity. The Advanced Planning and Compassionate Care Act that Senator Rockefeller and I are introducing today will give us some of the tools that we need to improve care of the dying in this country, and I urge all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.                                 ______                                       By
