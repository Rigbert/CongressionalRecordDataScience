Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  This has been the process of working together cooperatively over the last several weeks to develop legislation that will meet the needs of small businesses throughout the United States and meet the needs of taxpayers throughout the United States, to develop a regulatory system which is streamlined, efficient and provides for the protection of the public good. And we have reached, I think, major accommodations in terms of language.  Today I hope we can reach additional accommodations in terms of providing a system that will protect the public good and save money.  I am encouraged by the process. I hope in the next few hours we can make changes that will make this legislation even better for the benefit of all of our citizens.  Again, I thank and commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania for his help and effort during this process.
