  I wish to make clear in the Record that I have never had any trouble working with Tom Coburn. He is correct. We did work on this. He is one smart fellow. He knew a great deal about the substance of this legislation but also the financing of it. I wish to thank him and his staff for his cooperation and thank him for his compliment to our staffs on the committee. I share his view about them, but also it has always been a pleasure to work with him.  I yield 5 minutes of our time to the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kerry.
