President, in the closing days of the 111th Congress, a brief flurry of activity led to the confirmation of 19 long-pending judicial nominations. Regrettably, the stalemate that had prevented the Senate from confirming a single nomination between September 13 and December 16 resumed when Senate Republicans denied action on 19 other well-qualified, consensus judicial nominations reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Ultimately, these nominations were returned to the President, including 15 nominations that received unanimous or near unanimous support in the committee. I suspect that when the President renominates these qualified individuals, they will be confirmed with overwhelming bipartisan support. The only question will be why we were unable to take action on them sooner.  In his ``Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary,'' Chief Justice Roberts rightly called attention to the problem facing many overburdened district and circuit courts across the country. The rise in judicial vacancies, which topped 110 in 2010, and an increasing number of judicial emergencies is of great concern to all Americans who seek justice from our courts.  Unfortunately, the unprecedented obstruction of judicial nominations seen in the last Congress, and the dramatic departure from the Senate's long-standing tradition of regularly considering consensus, noncontroversial nominations, marked a new chapter in what Chief Justice Roberts calls the ``persistent problem'' of filling judicial vacancies. A New York Times editorial from January 4, 2011, refers to Senate Republicans' ``refusal to give prompt consideration to noncontroversial nominees'' a ``terrible precedent.'' I agree, and I will ask that the Times' editorial be printed in the Record.  Nearly all of the mere 60 district and circuit court nominations the Senate was allowed to consider last year were confirmed with the overwhelming, bipartisan support of the Senate. Yet nearly a third of these nominations--19--were held up for more than 100 days, only to be confirmed unanimously. As the Times editorializes, ``apart from partisan gamesmanship, there was no reason that Republicansheld up these nominations for months only to unanimously approve nearly all of them in the waning days of the lame duck session.'' Among these nominations was that of Kimberly Mueller, nominated to fill a vacancy in the Eastern District of California. Chief Justice Roberts cited this confirmation as one of the most sorely needed. Yet for more than 7 months, the Senate was prevented from considering the nomination to fill this vacancy. Judge Mueller's nomination was unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee in May; her nomination was unanimously confirmed on December 16. No Senator objected to her qualifications, her record, or her fitness to serve. This sort of delay is the real crisis facing the Federal judiciary.  Lifetime appointments to the Federal bench should not be granted without due consideration. No Senator, Democrat or Republican, should simply rubberstamp the nominations of any President. In the first Congress of the Bush administration, the Democratic majority worked to confirm 100 judicial nominations, turning the page on the Republicans' pocket-filibusters of the 1990s. We proceeded with regular consideration of noncontroversial, consensus nominations, most of which received unanimous support in the Senate. We confirmed 20 nominations during the lameduck session in 2002, including two controversial circuit court nominations which were favorably reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee in the lameduck session. Senate Republicans' decision in December to object to consideration of 19 judicial nominations favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee--including 15 nominations with overwhelming bipartisan support--has established a new low with regard to judicial nominations. They set back the progress we have tried to make in confirming judges.  I suspect that President Obama will renominate these qualified individuals. I hope to work with the Judiciary Committee's new ranking Republican, Senator Grassley, to promptly consider and report these nominations to the full Senate. I hope that Senator Grassley will work with me to ensure the timely confirmation of these and other noncontroversial, consensus nominations, which will help reduce vacancies and address the judicial crisis.  The American people turn to our courts for justice. Likewise, the Senate must return to the time-honored traditions of the Senate, and work together to secure the confirmation of the President's judicial nominations. Judicial vacancies hinder the Federal judiciary's ability to fulfill its constitutional role. Working together, we can restore the judicial confirmation process.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the New York Times Article to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Jan. 3, 2011]                           The Missing Judges       The annual report on the federal judiciary by the chief      justice of the United States is not a place you would      normally go for political agitation. But that is just what      Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. offered by using a portion of      his year-end review to deplore the ``acute difficulties''      created for the justice system by the Senate's slowness in      approving President Obama's nominees for federal judgeships.       Justice Roberts is right to be concerned that mounting      federal court vacancies are creating crushing caseloads in      some jurisdictions and hampering courts' ability to fulfill      their vital role. Given his office, we understand why he did      not point a partisan finger in his report. But he diluted his      message a bit by suggesting that blame for this undermining      of the judicial branch rests evenly with both parties. The      main culprit is an unprecedented level of Republican      obstructionism.       Democrats sought to block a handful of President George W.      Bush's controversial nominees for circuit court seats, but      were open about stating their objections, and promptly      allowed up or down votes on other nominees once approved by      the Judiciary Committee.       In the last Congress, Republicans typically refused to      publicly explain their opposition to individual nominees and      their prolonged blockade of candidates who had cleared the      committee either unanimously or with just a couple of      negative votes. Between Congress's return from its August      recess and the start of the lame duck session, Senate      Republicans consented to vote on just a single judicial      nomination.       Before adjourning, Senate Republicans allowed action on 19      well-qualified nominees--some of whom had been left in limbo      for nearly a year after clearing the Judiciary Committee.      That was welcome progress. But apart from partisan      gamesmanship, there was no reason that Republicans held up      these nominations for months only to unanimously approve      nearly all of them in the waning days of the lame duck      session.       Partisan obstruction was also the only plausible reason      that Republicans declined to allow confirmation of 15 other      nominees who were considered noncontroversial and were      cleared by the committee after the November election. Those      nominations have been returned to the president, ensuring      further delays in filling seats when those individuals are      renominated and a newly reconstituted Judiciary Committee      must hold new hearings.       Four other nominees approved by the committee by a party-     line vote were also denied Senate consideration. That list      includes Goodwin Liu, a well-qualified law professor and      legal scholar whose main problem for Republicans, it seems,      is his potential to fill a future Supreme Court vacancy.       The dismal net result, laments Senator Patrick Leahy, the      Judiciary Committee chairman, is that the Senate confirmed      just 60 district and circuit court judges--the smallest      number of judges for the first two years of a presidency in      more than three decades.       The Republicans' refusal to give prompt consideration to      noncontroversial nominees sets a terrible precedent. It gives      Democrats something to consider as they weigh possible rules      changes in the Senate to curb the auto-pilot filibusters and      secret holds that mindlessly delay essential business, like      the confirmation of federal judicial nominees.                          ____________________
