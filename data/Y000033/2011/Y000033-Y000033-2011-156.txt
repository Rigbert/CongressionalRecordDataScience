Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Steve Borell in recognition of the 22 years of service he has given as Director of the Alaska Miners Association.  An engineering master's graduate of Kansas State University, he began his career as a pit foreman in North Dakota, quickly rising up through the ranks of his profession, eventually starting his own engineering consulting company in Anchorage, Alaska.  He began his role as Director of the Alaska Miners Association (AMA) in 1989. Founded in 1939, the Alaska Miners Association has about 1,000 members throughout Alaska and elsewhere, and exists primarily to support the mining industry and all those who work with and within it.  Through his leadership of the AMA he has unified the industry behind simple and consistent support of the responsible and safe development of minerals, doing his utmost to advocate for the mining industry in difficult economic times and in the face of staunch opposition to progress in this sector.  The mining industry brings a host of benefits to both the State of Alaska and the Nation as a whole. The jobs it creates, the economic and infrastructural development it yields, and the energy security it maintains are some of the most pressing issues facing Americans today. It is these issues that the mining industry and the AMA have always sought to address.  In doing this the AMA has sought to ensure that any restrictions on the use of land and water for infrastructural and energy development are firmly scientifically sound and economically realistic. All modern mining must address the balance between environmentalism and resource utilization--the two need not be mutually exclusive. In recognizing this, Steve has truly helped bring mining into the 21st century.  Steve has been a great Director of the AMA, unifying the industry around common goals and aims, serving the best interests of the working men who make up the ranks of the Association, and last, but not least, his tireless effort to be the voice of a whole new generation of miners.  Thanks for everything, Steve.                          ____________________
