President, I appreciate the generous comments of the Senator from Utah. This can be propounded later on, but we will be voting on this one tomorrow. I ask unanimous consent it be in order to ask for the yeas and nays on this amendment, the Lautenberg, the Craig, and the Brownback amendments at this point.
