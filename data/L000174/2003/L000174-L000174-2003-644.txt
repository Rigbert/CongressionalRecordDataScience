                       Senator Graham's Return   I see the distinguished senior Senator from Florida in the Chamber. First, I will say on a personal basis, I am delighted to see him back. He is looking as healthy as he did before he left. I understand he is even more healthy now. For someone like myself who has probably a couple pounds more than I would like to be carrying, I noticed that he has found a way of losing a little weight. I suspect that what he has gone through is not something that is going to catch on with the various diet fads.  I had a chance to chat with the distinguished senior Senator last night, and he not only sounds even healthier than when he left, but he has the same sense of verve and sense of humor as he had before he left.  I yield to the distinguished Senator from Florida, if he would like to take the floor at this point, such time as he needs.
