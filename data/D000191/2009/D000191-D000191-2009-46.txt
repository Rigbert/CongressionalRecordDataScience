Chair, may I inquire as to who has the right to close?  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Mississippi has the right to close.  Mr. DeFAZIO. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  First off, last week, I was subjected to the absolutely stupid 30-minute rule. United Airlines can't get it into their manual that it was repealed 4 years ago. I did ask to have my card sent up to the pilot, but I have complained several times. Some pilots still think that since it is apparently still in the United manual, that it was not created by the TSA. And our former Chairman Mica knows that. That was a Secret Service directive which preempted all of the agencies of the government and the newly created TSA.  The TSA agreed with us that it was an absolutely asinine rule, but we were told it was a higher authority. So that would never have gone through a rulemaking process. That was imposed.  Now, those sorts of things could be imposed for 6 months still under the gentleman's rule. And I don't knowthat the Secret Service would claim that they could preempt even the 6-month limit. So we can't prevent all stupidity, but we push back against it.  Again, back to the gel rule. Under the gentleman's proposed amendment, they would still be amending the gel rule to get down to the 4 ounces or get to 4 ounces or whatever the current limit is. Maybe it is 3.4. I can't remember. That seems to change, too. But you don't need a 2-year process and shouldn't impose a 2-year process and an extraordinary expense to the taxpayers in that sort of a case.  Yes, there are problems. There is stupidity when it comes to the GA rule. The committee is dealing with it through oversight and pressure.
