 President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that at 11 o'clock a.m., on Wednesday, June 11, the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 220, the nomination of Richard Wesley, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Second Circuit; provided further that there then be 15 minutes for debate equally divided between the chairman and ranking member prior to a vote on the confirmation of the nomination, with no intervening action or debate. I further ask consent that following the vote, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.
