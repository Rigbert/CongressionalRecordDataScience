He spent, I believe, $15 million at that time, which he had to borrow. Put that $15 million, I say to my friend from New Jersey, in today's dollars and it would amount to $225 billion. He had to borrow the equivalent of $225 billion in 1 year for that transaction. We have not had a deficit as high as $225 billion, I do not think since the last deficit during the Bush administration. In fact, $225 billion exceeds all annual Federal deficits except for those in the last 2 years of the Bush administration.  I think that we ought to commend Senator Torricelli for the constructive way in which he has acted in this debate. I agree with what the preeminent historian of the Senate, the Senator from West Virginia, said when he spoke of the debates of Clay and others.  I also agree that this amendment and this debate shows a great deal of thought from the Senator from New Jersey. He was thoughtful and serious during our committee proceedings and debate, as well. He has consistently shown that he has thought hard about and wrestled with this matter. I hope everyone, whether they are for or against his amendment, will listen to his speech. Whether they are for or against this constitutional amendment, I hope everyone will seriously consider the amendment offered by the Senator from New Jersey. The Nation's leading economists all agree that a capital budget is an essential part of the State experience with balanced budget requirements, and that the omission of a capital budget in this proposed constitutional amendment is a major flaw. Over 1,000 economists, including 11 Nobel laureates, noted in a statement of opposition announced by the Senator from West Virginia that you should have this. It is a major flaw in this whole poorly written Senate Joint Resolution 1. Unfortunately, as I have said before, this resolution is one that is written more for a bumper sticker than it is for the Constitution of the United States of America, the greatest Constitution ever.  I wish the manager, my good friend from Utah, and his cosponsors would abandon their blood oath of not allowing amendments and consider the merits of this suggested amendment.  All Senators should consider favorably Senator Torricelli's effort to correct dangerous aspects of the underlying proposed constitutional amendment.                           Capital Budgeting  Senator Torricelli forcefully pointed out during the Judiciary Committee deliberations on the underlying measure that we as a nation are suffering from a capital investment crisis. In 1965, more than 6 percent of Federal expenditures were invested in infrastructure such as roads, bridges, ports, and mass transit systems. By 1992, that share of capital investment had fallen by more than half to about 3 percent of our Federal budget and this year it will approach barely 2 percent.  At the same time as our infrastructure funding has been shrinking, our Nation's needs have continued to grow. The result is that we are becoming a nation in disrepair. For instance, more than a quarter of a million miles of roads need repair and more than 25 percent of our bridges have exceeded their life span.  This failure to maintain adequate infrastructure is hurting our competitiveness in the global economy. We are competing against other countries with the foresight to repair their roads and bridges, modernize their transit systems, maintain their ports, build new schools and make the investments in telecommunications infrastructure that are the keys to success in today's global competition. The United States is dead last among the G-7 nations in public infrastructure investment as a percentage of gross domestic product.  Senator Torricelli is correct that we must reverse this trend and make the long-term investments needed to support a strong economy. I am glad to see President Clinton calling for study and action on capital budgeting. We must be able to invest in capital improvements--and, in my view, in education--if we are to give our children their best chance to compete and win in the coming century.  The underlying proposed constitutional amendment prohibits budgeting for capital expenditures. Instead it would include all expenditures on an annual basis for purposes of calculating balance. All expenditures, whether the equivalent of operating expenses or capital investments, are tallied the same for purposes of the underlying proposed constitutional amendment.  The sponsors and proponents of this measure refuse to permit any exception and future Congresses will be forever barred from solving our infrastructure crisis by creating a capital budget for long-term investments.  The majority report is silent on this important subject. The Committee's past hearings, however, establish an extensive record in support of maintaining a separate capital budget. Herbert Stein, of the American Enterprise Institute and former economic adviser to President Nixon; Edward V. Regan, of the Jerome Levy Economics Institute and former New York State Controller; and Dr. Fred Bergsten, on behalf of the bipartisan Competitiveness Policy Council and former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury during the Carter administration; differed on the wisdom of enacting a constitutional amendment on the budget but all agreed on one thing: If such an amendment were to be considered it should separate capital investments for any annual balance requirement.  Nonetheless, when the Judiciary Committee had the opportunity last month to consider amendments that would have allowed for a separate budget for capital investments, it rejected them. Senator Torricelli offered a substitute amendment to establish a Federal capital budget but the committee rejected the Torricelli amendment by an 8 to 9 vote with all Republican members who voted, voting against capital budgeting.  This inflexibility is one of the principal reasons that President Clinton opposes this constitutional amendment on budgeting. The President stated:       We must give future generations the freedom to formulate      the Federal budget in ways they deem most appropriate. For      example, some believe that the Federal Government should do      what many State governments do: adopt a balanced operating      budget and a separate capital budget. Under this      constitutional balanced budget proposal, the government      would be precluded from doing so.  During the committee's January 17 hearing, Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities explained:       What families do when they balance their budget is families      say that all of their income, including money they borrow,      equals all the cash they pay out. Families borrow money when      they purchase a house through a mortgage, whey they buy a      car, and especially when they send a child to college. If      families had to operate on the basis that this amendment      does, they would have to pay for all of college education out      of the current year's income, all of the entire cost of a      home, not the down payment, the whole thing, out of the      current year's income. Nobody operates that way.  The actions of Thomas Jefferson as President, as opposed to his oft-quoted ruminations about the evils of public debt, are also instructive but ignored by the proponents of the underlying measure. In 1804, President Jefferson had the United States borrow $15 million, in 1804 dollars, by selling bonds to finance the Louisiana Purchase. That amount approximates more than $225 billion in 1993 dollars and exceeds every Federal budget deficit except for the final 2 years of the Bush administration.  Was President Jefferson wrong to invest in the Louisiana Territory that provided this country with 15 States?Of course not. But had the provisions of Senate Joint Resolution 1 been included in the Constitution in the early 1800's, our Nation's westward expansion might well have ended at the Mississippi River.  Under this proposed constitutional amendment, the failure to permit a capital budget would have severe consequences by discouraging long-term investment and ignoring our infrastructure crisis. Just as a budget deficit unfairly harms future generations so, too, does the failure to differentiate capital investments from operating and consumption expenditures. The inevitable result will be less investment in our country's future, pressure to operate through inefficient leasing practices and gimmickry.  The Torricelli amendment should reduce the pressure to engage in some of the gimmickry otherwise likely to be occasioned by this proposed constitutional amendment. It may also result in more accurate disclosure to Americans about how their money is being spent and how the budget is being balanced.  Not many of us could afford homes if we could not borrow and get a mortgage on our home. When we talk about balancing our family budgets, we do not normally mean that we should not invest in a house or a car. We mean that we should not spend more every week or every month than we can afford. We mean to include our mortgage and car payments but not the full extent of the 5-, 15- or 30-year liability.  Likewise, small businesses and large corporations could not do business is they could not borrow to meet their capital budget needs.  Most States with balanced budget amendments have separate capital budgets, as well. I am told that number is 42 States. Indeed, I believe that most States with balanced budget requirements obtain capital funds that finance major capital projects by issuing long-term debt.  The Nation's leading economists agree that a capital budget is an essential part of the State experience with balanced-budget requirements and that the omission of a capital budget in this proposed constitutional amendment is a major flaw. Over 1,000 economists, including 11 Nobel laureates, noted in their January 30, 1997 statement:       Unlike many State constitutions, which permit borrowing to      finance capital expenditures, the proposed Federal amendment      makes no distinction between capital investments and current      outlays. . . . The amendment would prevent Federal borrowing      to finance expenditures for infrastructure, education,      research and development, environmental protection, and other      investments vital to the Nation's future well-being.  The Torricelli amendment to allow capital budgeting is in keeping with traditional notions of balancing our budgets.                            Military Threats  I further commend Senator Torricelli for including within his amendment language to correct a dangerous flaw in the proposed constitutional amendment. The underlying proposed constitutional amendment requires the United States to be engaged in military conflict before a waiver may be obtained. Moreover, the Senate report's section-by-section on this language compounds the problem by indicating that only military conflict that involve the actual use of military force may serve as a basis for this waiver.  I hope that this is not what the authors, sponsors and proponents of the underlying constitutional proposal truly intend, although their votes to table the Dodd amendment seem to indicate that they mean what they say. They are creating constitutional circumstances that make military spending and preparations easier only when military force is actually used and military conflict ensures. Arming to deter aggression would no longer be the preferred course, aiding allies in a conflict rather than dispatching U.S. military forces would no longer be as viable an alternative and rebuilding our military capabilities after a conflict would no longer be possible without a supermajority vote of three-fifths of the Congress.  I cannot support such restrictive measures. I have spent much of my time in the Senate working with Republican and Democratic administrations to avoid the actual use of military force. This amendment is written is such a way that it serves to encourage such use. Nothing that would serve to place our men and women in harm's way more quickly or would leave them less well equipped or prepared should garner the support of this Senate.  I hope that all Senators will consider favorably Senator Torricelli's effort to correct this dangerous aspect of the underlying proposed constitutional amendment and render it more consistent with the foreign policy objectives and vision outlined last night by Senator Torricelli.  I urge the manager and the sponsors of the resolution to abandon their ``no amendments'' strategy and consider the merits of this suggested amendment. Balancing the budget is important. But their underlying proposal turns the world topsy-turvy by making that goal the be-all and end-all of national policy without considering what a supermajority requirement can mean to our Nation's security and defense, to our foreign policy and our military preparedness.  As Senator Sarbanes has so eloquently reminded us, one historic example points out the folly of such a supermajority requirements. In the summer of 1941, Congress was confronted with extending the time of service of those members of the armed services who had been drafted the year before. With the prospect of war increasing, President Roosevelt, in a special message to Capitol Hill, asked Congress to declare a national emergency that would allow the Army to extend the service of draftees. Speaker Sam Rayburn had to twist arms in the well of the House of Representative to get the House to pass the measure regarding the draft for World War II by just one vote, 203 to 202. It then passed the Senate by a vote of 45 to 30.  The Nation was literally a few months away from the outbreak of World War II. But neither the House nor the Senate vote would have met the supermajority requirement in the underlying proposal. Even after the President had declared a national emergency, Congress could not muster a supermajority vote in either body.                           Economic Recession  The third prong of the Torricelli amendment would allow the proposed constitutional restrictions for end of the year balance to be waived in the event of an economic recession or serious economic emergency. He is right on point. More than 1,000 of the Nation's most respected economists, including 11 Nobel laureates, as well as the former chair of President Nixon's Council of Economic Advisors, the current and former Federal Reserve Board Chairmen, and former Democrat and Republican Directors of the Congressional Budget Office all agree that the underlying proposal is unsound economic policy. They all agree that the underlying proposal would hamper the Government's ability to cope with economic downturns.  Economists and financial experts agree that the underlying proposal will straitjacket the economy in hard times. It will hamstring the adjustment mechanisms that have been developed since the Great Depression to preserve jobs and restore the economy after a downturn. The 1,060 economists and 11 Nobel laureates who are opposing the underlying proposed constitutional amendment condemn it because it mandates perverse actions in the face of recessions.  If the economy takes a downturn and Americans are losing their jobs--as happened in the early 1990's--the underlying proposal makes it more difficult for our Government to respond to the needs of working families. As Treasury Secretary Rubin testified before the Judiciary Committee:       A balanced budget amendment would subject the Nation to      unacceptable economic risks in perpetuity. . . . A balanced      budget amendment could turn slowdowns into recessions, and      recessions into more severe recessions or even depressions.  I am deeply concerned about the impact that the underlying proposal might have on jobs for working families in Vermont and across the country during times of recession. As Secretary Rubin explained, the so-called automatic stabilizers in our economy would be ineffective under the underlying proposal. These are mechanisms that have been developed over the last 50 years to reduce the extremes of the ``boom-and-bust'' cycles. They are intended to prevent another Great Depression and have proven effective over time.  Secretary Rubin testified:       [W]ithout automatic stabilizers, the Treasury Department      has estimated that unemployment in 1992 that resulted from      the 1990 recession might have hit 9 percent instead of 7.7      percent, which would have been in excess of 1 million jobs      lost.  Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan recently reiterated his opposition to the proposed constitutional amendment during questioning by Senator Lautenberg during his testimony before the Senate Budget Committee. He urged the Senate Budget Committee to continue to eliminate the deficit, but he joined Secretary Rubin and our Nation's leading economists in the conclusion that the underlying proposed constitutional amendment places too many constraints on our economy.  Although the sponsors of the underlying measure repeatedly outline the dangers of a budget deficit, they fail to address how the proposed constitutional amendment will provide for the flexibility needed in economic downturns without holding working families and hard hit regions hostage to a supermajority vote. This aspect of the Torricelli amendment restores that flexibility by requiring a simple majority vote to respond to economic recessions and emergencies.  When he spoke last night in this historic Chamber, Senator Torricelli spoke about the proper role of Government and redefining its role without sacrificing our ability and ignoring our responsibilities to help our neighbors when they need help. He is right to offer this essential change in the underlying proposal to amend the Constitution.  A waiver of these provisions by a supermajority vote of three-fifths of both Houses of Congress is small comfort to America's working families. Many national recessions start out in different regions of the country. For example, the most recent recession hit New England first. What if citizens of New England, who have fewer Members of the House of Representatives than other regions of the country, needed help? Could they get Senators and Representatives from other States, which were still experiencing good times, to waive a constitutional balanced budget requirement to help protect their livelihoods?  Prof. Robert Eisner of Northwestern University and past president of the American Economic Association understood the economic problems under the underlying proposed constitutional amendment when he recently wrote:       One need only recall the near-collapses, in recent years,      of the economies in New England, California and Texas. Who      would bail them out if their own tax revenues again declined      and there were surges of claims for unemployment benefits,      food stamps and general assistance?  Relief for economic recessions and emergencies must be flexible. Usually, a swift response from the Federal Government is needed to aid State and local relief efforts. Economic emergency relief by constitutional supermajority mandate is a prescription for gridlock, not swift action. When your State or region is hit by recession or economic emergency, do you want critical Federal assistance to hang on the whims of 41 Senators or 175 Representatives from other regions?  I find it ironic that the supporters of the underlying constitutional amendment, who do not trust Congress to continue to reduce the deficit, argue that we should trust future Congresses to muster supermajority votes in both bodies.  Our Founders rejected requirements of supermajorities. We should look to their sound reasons for rejecting supermajority requirements before we impose on our most vulnerable citizens a three-fifths supermajority requirement to provide them Federal relief from recessions and serious economic emergencies. I believe this supermajority requirement would recklessly endanger our economy and our democracy.  We do not need to theorize or speculate about the costs and risks. The Nation got a taste of it just 2 years ago with the longest Government shutdown in history and a debt limit crisis that when on for months. In 1995, 165 Republican Members of the House of Representatives pledged to refuse to vote for raising the debt limit, unless President Clinton accepted their balanced budget plan. The Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, went along with this ultimatum, by declaring ``I am with them * * * I do not care what the price is.'' As a result of this blackmail politics, the American people suffered through two Government shutdowns for a total of 27 days. In the 22 years I have served in the Senate, I have not seen an action more irresponsible by either Democrats or Republicans.  Fortunately, the President stood up to this blackmail and the American public convinced a majority in Congress to act responsibly. Who knows what would have happened under the supermajority votes required in the underlying proposal.  The supermajority requirement lowers the blackmail threshold, in the words of some it its House sponsors. This three-fifths supermajority requirement invites political blackmail and rewards extremism. If both the House and Senate require three-fifths of their Members to agree to waive the end of the year balance requirement or raise the debt limit, then 40 percent plus one in either the House or the Senate could hold the country hostage to their demands.  The House sponsors of this proposed constitutional amendment have acknowledged this folly. In a November 1996 paper on the underlying proposal, Representatives Dan Schaefer and Charles Stenholm wrote that their proposal would have the effect of ``lowering the `blackmail threshold' * * * from 50 percent plus one in either body to 40 percent plus one * * *.'' These are the words of the House sponsors of the underlying proposal, not mine.  As Robert Greenstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a distinguished expert on Congress' ways, testified before the Judiciary Committee, the underlying proposal's supermajority requirements would permit minority factions to extort pork barrel projects or extreme legislation as their price.  Coming from a State with a congressional delegation of three Members, I know something about the rights of small States. Supermajority vote requirements trample on the rights of small States and reward large ones. In the House, a combination of Representatives from six large States could hold a waiver hostage to their demands, even if the vast majority of Representatives from 44 States were in agreement that a waiver was justified.  Our Founders rejected such supermajority voting requirements on matters within Congress' purview. Alexander Hamilton described supermajority requirements as a poison that serves to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junta to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority. Such supermajority requirements reflect a basic distrust not just of Congress, but of the electorate itself. I reject that notion and am prepared to keep faith with and in the American people. We should honor the fundamental principle of majority rule, a principle that has been enshrined in our Constitution for more than 200 years, and a principle embodied in the Torricelli amendment.  Senator Torricelli has approached this matter with seriousness and sincerity. He is attempting to perfect the underlying proposal for a constitutional amendment and cure several of its flaws.  When the Judiciary Committee considered this proposed constitutional amendment last month, we did so on an expedited basis. Nonetheless, Senator Torricelli was a full participant at our hearings. He examined former Acting Attorney General Stuart Gerson and Mr. Gerson conceded to him that the underlying amendment presents the most likely situation in which congressional standing, which has never been recognized, might be recognized and Mr. Gerson described to him the unfortunate Federal precedent in which a Federal court ordered local taxes to be raised. I recall his exchange with Senator Simon regarding the relationship of our national debt to our gross domestic product and how we compare favorably with the other industrialized countries of Europe and the world.  He continued his thoughtful approach to the proposed constitutional amendment during our committee markup when he offered an amendment that Chairman Hatch first praised, then defeated by casting a final and deciding vote against it. At least at the committee we afforded members an opportunity to offer amendments and to obtain votes on those amendments.  This is one of the most important legislative matters we will consider this Congress. It is a proposed amendment to our fundamental charter, the United States Constitution. In my view, allowing amendments, debating amendments and voting on amendments is an essential aspect of developing any legislation and, in particular, a proposed constitutional amendment.  Early in this debate the distinguished minority leader made the point that we do not have the luxury of reexamining constitutional amendments as we would a statute. Once a constitutional amendment is passed, it is almost impossible to revisit. Accordingly, it is essential that Senators have the opportunity to seek to improve the text of the proposed amendment. Even the witnesses called by the proponents of the underlying measure acknowledged that it is not perfect, that it has shortcomings, and that its text could be improved. To do otherwise is to disregard our obligations to our constituents, the Constitution and the future.  Senator Torricelli has come forward with a very important amendment. He is most sincere and serious in this effort and he deserves the courtesy and opportunity to have the Senate vote on the merits of his amendment. Respected economists, the current Chairman and past Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the Treasury, numerous witnesses and the President of the United States have all noted that the underlying proposal for a constitutional amendment runs the risk of strait-jacketing the future, of creating military difficulties and reducing our ability to respond to international crises and of making economic downturns deeper and turning recessions into depressions.  Here is a Senator who has come to this floor willing to put himself on the line and debate, honestly debate, the critical issues affected by this amendment. In matters that affect our Nation's supreme law, we need to vote consistent with our best judgment and our conscience as we represent those who elected us and entrusted us to make these votes. Senator Torricelli has offered this Senate, the people of New Jersey and this country his best judgment regarding how to improve this constitutional proposal. Before we return to the economic and fiscal policies of the Hoover era that led to the Great Depression, I urge the Senate be given an opportunity to vote on the Torricelli amendment on its merits.  I hope that the other side, which has rejected every amendment on Social Security, on protecting working families or protecting children's programs from disproportionate cuts and on everything else--no matter how good the amendment might be--would not require their followers to leap blindly off the cliff of tabling motions but would allow them to listen to this debate and vote honestly on it.  The Senator from New Jersey has raised a very clear issue. Let me tell you right now, anybody who thinks the Louisiana Purchase was a good idea ought to be listening to the Senator from New Jersey and supporting him.
