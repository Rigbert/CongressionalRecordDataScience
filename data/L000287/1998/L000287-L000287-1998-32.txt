Mr. Speaker, there is no question that family planning has promoted the health and survival of women and children in undeveloped nations. For over 30 years, the United States has been a leader and a healer with family planning aid throughout the world. We have led an international crusade to promote child survival in the world, decrease maternal and infant deaths, and end the spread of disease. We have saved the lives of young girls by encouraging them to postpone childbearing. Because of our aid, our help, the size of the average family in poor countries has dropped from six to three. This reduction in family size has helped millions escape poverty. It has increased the prospects of an education and a richer, healthier life for women and children. It has given thousands of families a way up and a way out and helped them survive and thrive.  Despite all of our success, despite the distance we have traveled, there are some who do not understand the importance of our work. This legislation effectively cuts funding for family planning. It has a chilling effect on our family planning efforts abroad. This legislation is a step backward, it is a step in the wrong direction.  Let me be clear. Not one penny of U.S. family planning aid has ever beenused to fund an abortion abroad. Our laws prevent it. We are not trying to change that. We are simply trying to continue a successful program that saves human lives. It is cruel and barbaric to stand in the way of poor families getting basic information about their health in this country or some distant land.  I urge my colleagues to support healthy families worldwide and vote down this destructive and mean legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I think it is unfortunate this legislation is coming to us today when 16 Members of our body, black Members, are in African countries, and I wish it could have been postponed and come up some time later.
