 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Hanh Thai Duong, a woman who epitomizes the American dream. Duong is the owner of a restaurant in my hometown of Louisville, KY, The Lemongrass Cafe.  Duong's journey from Vietnam to America is a miraculous one. In 1979, when she was only 10 years old, the Vietnamese government told her family that they would be able to leave Vietnam because of her father's Chinese ancestry, but only if they gave up all of their possessions and paid a sum in gold to the Vietnamese government. They decided the trip would be worth the risk, so they left everything behind and boarded a fishing boat that took them to a new life in Hong Kong.  A year later, with the help of a relative in Louisville and a number of Catholic charities, Duong and her family left Hong Kong for Kentucky. Duong's unwavering determination and a belief in the importance of an education, helped her work her way through the University of Louisville and earn a degree in finance and international business.  After her parents retired, Duong followed in their footsteps and opened her own restaurant, The Lemongrass Cafe;, bringing a taste of her native land to her new home. I ask my colleagues in the Senate to recognize and pay tribute to this remarkable woman.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article, ``Restaurant a testament to Vietnamese family's drive'' from The Courier-Journal, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, Feb. 22, 2004]          Restaurant a Testament to Vietnamese Family's Drive                          (By Byron Crawford)       The Lemongrass Cafe in Louisville's Highlands neighborhood      is more than a quaint oasis for Thai, Vietnamese and Chinese      cuisine. It is a monument to one Vietnamese family's appetite      for freedom and opportunity.       The cafe's proprietor, Hanh Thai Duong, 34, was 10 years      old in 1979 when the Vietnamese government told her parents      that because of her father's Chinese ancestry the family      would be allowed to leave Vietnam--if they gave up all their      possessions and paid the government a sum in gold.       ``You really leave empty-handed, but my mom and dad were      thinking for a better future for their children,'' Duong      said. ``My parents always said that the United States was the      land of opportunity. We left on a fishing boat for Hong      Kong.''       Such voyages were treacherous. The boats were small and      often unsafe.       The trips sometimes took weeks. Twenty to 30 passengers      jammed into tight quarters and often went days without food.      Pirates roamed the South China Sea, sometimes boarding the      fishing vessels, killing, raping and taking women and      children captives.       ``We were lucky. It only took us four or five days to reach      Hong Kong, but my aunt and her twins did not get to Hong Kong      . . . for like a month or so, and one of the twins died of      hunger and they ended up burying her out at sea,'' Duong      said. ``As soon as my aunt stepped on the ground in Hong      Kong, she passed away, too.''       Duong's baby sister was badly burned in an accident soon      after the fishing boat reached Hong Kong Harbor and was taken      to the mainland for treatment. The family lost track of the      child for months but finally found her in a refugee camp.      Duong's mother, not having seen the baby for months, did not      immediately recognize her.       Another of Duong's aunts, who then lived in Louisville,      sponsored the family to immigrate in 1980, and they were      flown to America by Catholic Charities, which they later      repaid. Duong's father, Trung Thai, had owned a successful      grocery-supply business in Vietnam, and her mother, Nga, was      a good cook. They opened a small restaurant from which they      have since retired.       Duong married at an early age but was determined to get an      education, and she worked her way through the University of      Louisville to earn a degree in finance and international      business. She and her husband, Edward Duong--who had twice      been captured while trying to leave Vietnam in violation of      government orders--later lived in New York City. But they      soon decided that they preferred Louisville, where      Edward Duong now works at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant.       Hanh Duong's older brother and younger sister both earned      degrees from UofL and are working in business. Another sister      owns a nail salon and her youngest sister is working her way      through college.       ``You think about your parents' sacrifice for you and you      don't want to fail,'' she said. ``You don't take things for      granted and you don't give up easily.''       Duong has forgotten much of her early life in Vietnam, but      a few vivid memories remain: one of her parents running with      her for shelter as bombs exploded nearby, and her mother      being wounded by a stray bullet near their home in Saigon      (now known as Ho Chi Minh City).       Today, Duong works hard in the Lemongrass Cafe, on      Bardstown Road to make happier memories for her children--a      daughter, Cheryl, 17, a senior at Male High School and a      Governor's Scholar who will enter the University of Kentucky      next fall, and a son, Nick, 9, a student at Greathouse/     Shryock Traditional Elementary School. Many of their      grandmother's favorite recipes are helping to lure customers      to their mother's cafe.       ``Other than the delicious food, I guess it was just the      simplicity of Lemongrass and the personality of Hanh that I      like about the place,'' said Jeannie Treitz, a frequent      customer.       A few years ago, Hanh said, she took her children to      Vietnam to show them the country their parents and      grandparents had fled.       ``They were raised here and they don't know how people have      to struggle in Vietnam,'' she said. ``I took them back so      they could understand that they have bundles of opportunities      here, and that they should work hard and never give up on      anything.''                          ____________________
