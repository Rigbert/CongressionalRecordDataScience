 Kempthorne) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                              S. Res. 264       Whereas every day in America, 15 children under the age of      19 are killed with guns;       Whereas in 1994, approximately 70 percent of murder victims      aged 15 to 17 were killed with a handgun;       Whereas in 1995, nearly 8 percent of high school students      reported having carried a gun in the past 30 days;       Whereas young people are our Nation's most important      resource, and we, as a society, have a vested interest in      helping children grow from a childhood free from fear and      violence into healthy adulthood;       Whereas young people can, by taking responsibility for      their own decisions and actions, and by positively      influencing the decisions and actions of others, help chart a      new and less violent direction for the entire Nation;       Whereas students in every school district in the Nation      will be invited to take part in a day of nationwide      observance involving millions of their fellow students, and      will thereby be empowered to see themselves as significant      agents in a wave of positive social change; and       Whereas the observance of this day will give American      students the opportunity to make an earnest decision about      their future by voluntarily signing the ``Student Pledge      Against Gun Violence'', and sincerely promise that they will      never take a gun to school, will never use a gun to settle a      dispute, and will use their influence to prevent friends from      using guns to settle disputes: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That (1) the Senate designates October 8, 1998,      as ``the Day of National Concern About Young People and Gun      Violence''; and       (2) the President should be authorized and requested to      issue a proclamation calling upon the school children of the      United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies      and activities.
