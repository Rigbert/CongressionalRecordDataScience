 President, I rise today to help introduce a bill with my good friend from California that will bring new and needed tools to the battle to end violence against children in America, whether it takes place inside the home or out on the street. Today, Senator Boxer and I are introducing the Violence Against Children Act, VACA, which provides a comprehensive approach to prevent crimes against children, treat child victims, and prosecute those who harm our Nation's children.  In 1994, this body passed a piece of legislation that I authored, the Violence Against Women Act. When we passed this landmark legislation, we said as a Congress, and as a Nation as a whole, that domestic violence is not a family problem to be dealt with quietly behind the scenes, but a national crisis in need of a coordinated response from law enforcement, the courts and the medical community. Backed by almost one and half billion dollars of Federal funds, the Violence Against Women Act spurred a sea change on the Federal, State and local levels in how police, prosecutors, judges, medical personnel and others, process and handle cases of domestic abuse, sexual assault and stalking. Most importantly, the Violence Against Women Act also made it clear that victims of domestic violence and sexual assault were, in fact, victims: Victims who deserved the full extend of this Nation's medical and legal resources. The Violence Against Children Act, offered by Senator Boxer and myself today, is designed to bring this same type of concentered focus and coordinated response to end all child abuse, the most heinous and incomprehensible form of violence against the most vulnerable people in our lives.  Last year in my state of Delaware there were 1,073 substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect--46 percent were cases of neglect, 31 percent were cases of abuse and 12 percent were cases of sexual abuse. Nationally, 3.9 million of the nation's 22.3 million children between the ages of 12 and 17 have been seriously physically assaulted. One in three girls and one in five boys are sexually abused before the age of 18. One study recently reported that in 2000, the homicide rate for U.S. infants is almost equal to the murder rate of teens. As stunning as these numbers are, we should be aware that these numbers are not the totals. Like incidents of domestic violence, we know that violence against children is under-reported. We also know that violence against kids cuts across all lines--it happens to children of doctors and lawyers, not just to poor children. We must do more to protect our children, and with the Violence Against Children Act we can.  Designed to be a comprehensive measure, the Violence Against Children Act will fight the battle against child abuse on a number of fronts: by providing states with new resources, law enforcement with additional tools and families with more places to turn to for help. What specifically the legislation do? The Violence Against Children Act has three major provisions; 1. it deters crime by toughening Federal criminal penalties for crimes against children; 2. it requires the Federal Government to provide investigative, forensic and prosecutorial assistance to states working on cases of violent crimes against children; and 3. it authorizes two new grant programs--oneaimed at providing more resources to state and local law enforcement for training, creating new courts and enforcement units focused solely on child crimes, and a second grant program for local governments and nonprofit organizations to provide emergency medical treatment and counseling for child victims, to increase the number of mental health professionals who specialize in child victims, and to establish child abuse and crime prevention programs.  The Violence Against Children Act also encourages State and localities to take affirmative steps to fight crimes against children by conditioning receipt of grant monies on three points: 1. creating a statewide Amber Alert system to alert the public immediately after a child abduction has been discovered; 2. creating Safe Haven programs which allow parents to leave newborn babies for whom they cannot care in hospital emergency room anonymously and without fear of penalty; and 3. improving data gathering so that police, treatment providers and policy makers get a clearer view of the circumstances surrounding child crimes. We need to stop nibbling around the edges with piecemeal legislation that tackles just one aspect of child abuse or child exploitation. The Violence Against Children Act takes into account the larger landscape and provides wide-reaching tools and resources. I feel certain that once my colleagues become aware of this effort, this bill will gather broad and bipartisan support.  Recently the Nation was stunned and relieved at the return of Elizabeth Smart to her parents Ed and Lois. As a father and grandfather my heart went out to them. I don't want to read about these types of cases anymore. My State of Delaware has an Amber Alert system in place. Delaware has a Safe Haven law. Not every State has these critical tools at their disposal. Senator Boxer and I are introducing the Violence Against Children Act for a reason. We must do everything that we can to prevent crimes against children and, if God forbid they do occur, we must do everything we can to treat the victims and their families and prosecute their perpetrators to the fullest extent of the law. As one child advocates succinctly said, ``a civilized society says children matter.'' The Violence Against Children Act says loud and clear, kids matter.                                 ______                                       By
