The eight of us came together to create a bill, and in the end we did a lot more--we created a bond of friendship and trust and a life experience that none of us will ever forget.  Each of us brought our special pleadings to this negotiation. I argued for the protection of refugees, American workers, access to immigration courts and counsel, reforming the flawed H-1B program, a path to citizenship that was a challenge but fair. But my colleagues knew from the start that there was one issue that was more important to me than any other.  It was 12 years ago when I first introduced the DREAM Act. I did it for this young woman, Tereza Lee.
