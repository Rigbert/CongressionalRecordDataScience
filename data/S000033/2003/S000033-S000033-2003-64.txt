 Chairman, let me review the situation and set the facts right.  Number one, historically, it has been my experience, and I think the experience of many Members, that when one files an amendment, when it is placed in the Congressional Record, that, in every instance that I can recall, when one asks for unanimous consent to make a minor modification, that unanimous consent is granted.
