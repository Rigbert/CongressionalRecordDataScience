 President, I realize Democrats want to deflect attention of the impact of ObamaCare from our constituents. That is one ofthe reasons we are having these nominee votes. But our constituents have the right to be heard, so I wish to share some thoughts from a constituent of mine in Owensboro, Cheryl Russell. Here is what she wrote:       We got a letter from our insurance company saying our      current policy will not meet the affordable care act, which      means it will go away.       According to our insurance company, we will have to take      pediatric dental and vision insurance, [even though] we don't      have kids.       They said it was because of ObamaCare. . . .  She goes on:       Another plan . . . will cost us over $150.00 more a month      plus our deductible goes up to $5700.       Please keep taking a stand against Obama Care . . . not      only are we going to lose our insurance, but when we go to a      different policy we have to pay more. . . .       We are 58 & 56 years old. We will have to work the rest of      our lives just to pay for our insurance. . . .       This isn't fair and it isn't right.
