We need to come together and come to an agreement.  Democrats have proposed a different future: one where we invest in a strongeconomy and ask everyone to contribute their fair share; a future where the Medicare guarantee is preserved and seniors' health security is protected; a future where students who work hard, take responsibility for themselves, and get accepted to college won't have to worry about whether they can afford to go; a future where we help businesses create millions of jobs here at home that won't be shipped overseas; a future, ladies and gentlemen, where the deficit is reduced in a balanced way--that's the key, we all know it's the key--with everyone pitching in.  Any of the Democratic alternatives, in my opinion, will be better than this Republican budget. And I don't agree with everything in each one of those budgets, clearly.  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has again expired.
