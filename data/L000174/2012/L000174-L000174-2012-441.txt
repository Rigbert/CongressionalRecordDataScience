 Established in 1790, King Arthur Flour has stood the test of time as the oldest flour company in the United States. Over the years King Arthur Flour has continued to raise the bar as an outstanding Vermont company. Most recently the company redesigned its website to allow for easier mobile phone and tablet use, placing it in the Hot 100 feature of Internet Retailer magazine. This continued focus on technology is propelling King Arthur Flour into the future as a cutting-edge company to watch.  As the company has continued to grow and succeed, it has managed to stay true to its Vermont roots. King Arthur Flour has flourished as an employee stock ownership company (ESOP), a model of business stewardship that highlights a strong commitment to the company's workforce and the local community. I also appreciate that King Arthur Flour has been a long-time participant in the annual Taste of Vermont event in Washington, where we bring the finest Vermont products to the Nation's capital.  I wish King Arthur Flour the best of luck as it continues to grow both its web presence with new technology and its physical presence with a major expansion project set to open this summer. I ask unanimous consent that a December 22, 2011, Burlington Free Press article highlighting the company's achievements be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 22, 2011]                       A (Web) Recipe for Success                           (By Stephen Mills)       Norwich.--King Arthur Flour is America's oldest flour      company, established 1790, a year into George Washington's      presidency.       So how does a company that makes flour and bread--an      ancient art--win national awards and acclaim for its business      practices in the 21st century?       Quite simply, the company has become the toast of the town      among the technocrati of e-commerce.       With the economy flagging, many companies turned to      enhanced e-retailing to capture more sales, offering free      shipping and additional savings for shopping online. King      Arthur Flour is no different, relying heavily on its website,      kingarthurflour.com, to sell its products and services that      can also be found at its ``Norwich, Vermont bakery, school      and store''--a sponsorship refrain often heard on Vermont      Public Radio, which also calls it ``home'' for its company-     sponsored studio there.       But to maximize online sales, King Arthur Flour redesigned      its website to allow its offerings to be displayed on any-     size screen, including phone, tablet or desktop. And it did      so without having to write exotic or expensive software      programs for each device.       Company online services director Halley Silver explains:      ``Our previous site used a template that was 780 pixels wide.      We have moved to a template that adapts its layout from 320      pixels wide to 992 pixels wide. This is called a responsive      website design. It's not a mobile application, but rather a      mobile-friendly website.       ``We have built a new website that works well across mobile      devices and tablet computers, as well as desktops and      laptops,'' Silver added. ``We have seen strong growth in      mobile and tablet traffic to our site, and also realize that      having a usable site while shoppers use their phones in the      supermarket and tablets in the kitchen is critical to our      success online.''       The result has been explosive mobile sales growth for the      company by shoppers using hand-held smartphones and tablets,      up 14 percent in September compared with just 2 percent for      the comparable month last year. The sales spike was 5 percent      from tablets such as iPads, and 9 percent from mobile phones.       The company's success compares favorably with online sales      figures just out for all retailers showing a 15 percent      increase over Thanksgiving, the nation's busiest shopping      period, compared with last year, and even better than those      for mobile devices, which increased 7.4 percent, according to      data from IBM Benchmark.       Company CEO Steve Voigt said: ``I have long been a big      supporter of online efforts and it is very encouraging to see      all the success which our customers and we enjoy by our      efforts to-date. . . . Baking seems custom-made for the      online community; a little online chat, then a little offline      baking.''                              Net royalty       Voigt is demur about the company's financial success,      noting figures for the private company are ``confidential.''      But according to the Internet Retailer Top 500 Guide, King      Arthur Flour reported online sales of $15.15 million in 2010.      Voigt did say the company has $96 million in annual revenues      for the most recent fiscal year.       Internet Retailer magazine, a leading tracker of e-     commerce, picked the company for its Hot 100 feature in the      December issue. The Hot 100 are not ranked but represent the      nation's the most interesting innovations in online retailing      this year.       Under the article heading, ``Mobile Drives Design,'' the      publication notes: ``Founded in 1790, baking ingredient and      bakeware retailer King Arthur Flour is both the oldest brand      in this year's Internet Retailer Hot 100 and one of the most      forward-looking.''       The article added, ``King Arthur's `mobile first' approach      to Web design exemplifies an elegant solution to Web      merchants'' growing challenge of designing for multiple      access devices.''       Internet Retailer also has asked Silver to be a featured      speaker at its annual Internet Retailer Web Design and      Usability Conference 2012 in Orlando, Fla., in February. It      refers to her as King Arthur's ``secret ingredient'' who      ``mixes common sense with tech know-how.''       As Silver said she will explain in the session she'll call,      ``The Mobile-First Approach to Web Multi-Platform Design,''      one key element in the redesigned site is the use of a Web      design language called CSS3 (cascading style sheets) that      presents images and product information differently depending      on the visitor's device and browser.       ``For a small company, King Arthur Flour is a very      innovative retailer,'' magazine editor Don Davis said in a      phone interview. Of Silver, he said, ``She is someone who is      as innovative as anyone at Amazon for the cool stuff they're      doing.       ``One of the things that's so impressive is that she's      extremely knowledgeable about the intricacies of e-commerce      and Web technology, an area that's constantly changing, while      at the same time has a grasp of her company's business      goals,'' Davis said. ``It's not that often you find      someone fluent in the language of bits and bytes who also      understands the overarching importance of the bottom      line.''       How does Silver feel about all the attention she's      receiving?       ``I still am somewhat amazed that a company selling flour      and ingredients online can be seen as an inspiration and used      as an example to other online retailers,'' she said.                          Building visibility       Other online innovations Silver has brought to the company      include:       two website redesigns.       a 55 percent increase in completed checkout sales after      adding items to the cart by streamlining the process and      offering further discounts for additional items.       tools that help website designers face the difficult      challenge of displaying multiple fonts while sticking with a      site's branded look.       the launch of the Bakers' Banter Blog.       This year, 32 videos were also posted to the website to      help customers better-appreciate the ``farm-to-plate''      relationship with mostly Midwestern farmers who supply much      of the grain for King Arthur's flours.       Born in Cleveland and raised in New York City, London and      San Francisco and eventually Vermont, Silver was a math major      at Wesleyan University. She moved through a number of posts      centered on Web technology, including the former Internet      shopping     search portal [emailÂ protected], and Internet security firm      VeriSign. She also built and launched Hoofpicks.com, a free,      Web-based, equestrian-event management service.       She joined King Arthur Flour in 2007 because of her passion      for baking. ``Cooking and baking have been a hobby of mine      since a very early age,'' she said. ``To be able to combine      that passion with building for the Web has been a wonderful      experience.''       What else is in the offing for the company online?       ``We hope to expand our presence in the mobile and tablet      space, and continue to improve all of our offerings online,''      she said.       One new development is a Google ad about the company,      filmed in October that began airing Nov. 27. A longer version      of the ad is available only on YouTube at: http://www.youtube.com/watch&?v=nzjcA2a      WILo&feature=channel_video_title.       Collectively, Silver and the 255 workers at the employee-     owned business have won a host of awards that include: the      2011 Vermont Governor's Award for Outstanding Workplace      Safety in the Large Business category; the 2011 Magnus Opus      Awards for its bi-monthly newsletter, The Baking Sheet; the      2007 Business Innovator of the Year Award from the Hanover      Area Chamber of Commerce; the 2006 Outstanding Vermont      Business Award; the 2006 Best Place to Work Award; and the      2006 Better Business Bureau Local Torch Award for Excellence.       The company is also one of the nation's few to attain B-     Corporation status because of its beneficial balance between      ``people, planet and profit.''       Some of the many ways it does so is through donating to      local food shelves within a 100-mile radius; the Life Skills      Bread Baking Program for 155,000-plus students nationwide,      teaching them to bake bread themselves and for the hungry; a      corporate volunteer program that provides paid time-off for      employees as volunteers in the community (in 2010, 123      employees volunteered 1,075 hours); annual employee      participation in Green Up Vermont Day; Winterbake, when      employees bake bread for donation to local food pantries      annually on the Martin Luther King, Jr. day of service; a      food-diversion program that donates old baking products to      local farmers for animal feed or composting; the use of eco-     friendly certified cleaners in all company facilities and      available to employees for home use at $1 per bottle; and      participation in the Bike/Walk to Work Day program.                             Living history       The company has come a long way from its origins. King      Arthur Flour began in 1790 as the Sands Taylor & Wood Co., a      retailer of specialty flours and cookbooks and baked goods,      based in Boston.       Founded by Henry Wood, primarily an importer and      distributor of English-milled flour, the business grew      quickly. A partner, Benjamin Franklin Sands, took over the      company in 1870, and in 1886, the firm introduced a premium      brand of flour.       At that time, a partner attended a performance of the      musical ``King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table''      that inspired the name of the new product, King Arthur Flour      (and its current logo). The brand was introduced at the      Boston Food Fair on Sept. 10, 1896, to great fanfare.       Subsequently, during ownership changes, retail flour sales      declined, and the company expanded into commercial baking      equipment in the 1960s, and other retail products, including      a line of coffee and prepared pie fillings. In 1978, the      company sold its other interests and returned to a core flour      business, and moved to Norwich in 1984.       Today, new things are cooking at the company.       The Norwich site is undergoing massive changes, with the      expansion of the bakery (to 3,400 square feet), baking      education center (3,400 square feet), store (4,700 square      feet), and cafe (2,200 square feet with seating for 75). The      offsite administration offices and recipe-testing center will      also be housed under the same roof, and continue to be      affectionately known as Camelot. Also offsite nearby is the      manufacturing center, known as Avalon. Begun in June, the      work will be completed in July. Artist renderings of the new      digs, work progress and historic detail about the company can      be found at www.kingarthurflour.com/ourstore/renovations.html.       The company could certainly use the space, officials said.      Business was booming one day a few weeks ago, with shoppers      packed into the store all day long, looking for seasonal      comestibles, while the cafe did a brisk trade in fresh      pastries and coffee. ``This is our peak season, with      Thanksgiving, Hanukkah and Christmas,'' public relations      coordinator Terri Rosenstock said.       Across the courtyard, bakers were busy making bread, pizza      and croissants, and the baking school was fully booked for a      pastry class.       ``We have a lot of people with pie-crust and yeast anxiety      right now,'' quipped the instructor.                          ____________________
