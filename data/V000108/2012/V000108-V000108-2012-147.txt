Speaker, it is with immense sadness and great respect that I rise to remember Army National Guard Specialist Sergio Eduardo Perez for his bravery and willingness to fight for his country. Specialist Perez was a member of the Indiana National Guard 713th Engineer Company, headquartered in Valparaiso, Indiana. While Specialist Perez was on a route clearance patrol in Kandahar Province, Afghanistan, he was killed in an attack that involved rocket-propelled grenade fire and small arms fire. His sacrifice will forever be remembered by those he fought to protect.  A native of East Chicago, Indiana, Sergio graduated from Lake Central High School in 2010. Sergio's high school principal recalls that Sergio was a quiet, reserved young man and a hard worker. His classmates speak of his kindness, respect, and willingness to help others. Shortly after graduating, Specialist Perez joined the National Guard, and his company mobilized at the end of September 2011. Sergio is remembered by friends as an all-around great guy who made a strong impression on those who knew him. According to loved ones, Sergio was a person who genuinely cared about everyone around him. He had a gentle spirit and a deep devotion to his family. In Sergio's own words, ``It takes a lot to make me mad, and when I am, I can't be mad for long. I get along with almost everyone. I work way more than I should and I'm starting to realize how short life is.'' For his remarkable courage and selfless commitment to the Army, Specialist Perez is worthy of the highest praise. His life was taken from us far too soon. He will be greatly missed and forever cherished by those who loved him.  Specialist Perez leaves behind a beloved host of family and friends. He is survived by his adoring parents: Sergio E. Perez, Sr. and Veronica Orozco. Sergio also leaves to cherish his memory three loving sisters: Candice Perez, Andrea Jimenez, and Karyme Jimenez, and his half brother, Axel Perez Martinez. He will be greatly missed by his maternal grandparents, Alicia and Charles Orozco, and his paternal grandparents, Severo and Ramona Perez. Specialist Perez also leaves behind many other dear friends and family members, as well as a grateful, yet deeply saddened community.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army National Guard Specialist, Sergio E. Perez. Specialist Perez sacrificed his life in service to his country, and his passing comes as a great loss to our nation, which has once again been shaken by the realities of war. Specialist Perez will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country. Thus, let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________
