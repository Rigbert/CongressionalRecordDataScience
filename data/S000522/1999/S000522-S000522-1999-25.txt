Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, it is amazing to me what length me people will go to sustain a myth, believe the unbelievable, and aggressively market a collective sense of denial concerning a profound truth.  Mr. Chairman, at a time when we know more and understand more about the magnificent life of an unborn child than ever before in history, at a time when doctors can diagnose and treat serious anomalies that afflict these smallest of patients, at a time when ultrasound imaging has become a window to the womb, revealing the child in utero, sucking his or her thumb or doing somersaults or even little karate kicks, along comes the pro-choice lobby, outraged, angry, fuming, that anyone dare challenge their big lie and suggest that unborn children have innate value, worth, and dignity.  At all costs, abortion advocates must cling to the self-serving fiction that unborn babies are something other than human and alive. By systematically debasing the value of these children, it has become easier for adults to procure the violent deaths of these little ones if they happen to be unwanted, unplanned, or imperfect.  But the inherent violence of abortion is not what is addressed by this bill. As a matter of fact, abortion is expressly outside the scope of this legislation. I say to my colleagues, read the bill.  So for now at least, I say to the advocates of abortion, go ahead, pat yourselves on the back. You have won for now. As a result of Roe versus Wade and its prodigy and 26 years of congressional acquiescence, 40 million unborn babies in America have been dismembered or chemically poisoned or have had their brains sucked out by what some euphemistically call choice.  But that should not mean that murderers, muggers, and rapists should also have that same unfettered ability to maim or kill an unborn child without consequence.  The Unborn Victims of Violence Act is designed to deter and, if that fails, to punish the perpetrators of violence against unborn children in the commission of a Federal offense.  The bill, as we know, would apply to some 65 laws that establish Federal crimes, including violence. H.R. 2436 does not diminish existing law concerning violence against women in any way, shape, or form, but adds new penalties and seeks justice for the harm or death suffered by the child.  Thus, if this legislation is enacted into law, our laws against violence will be stronger, tougher, and more comprehensive. H.R. 2436 merely adds new penalties to existing ones and tracks existing statutes currently in force in approximately 24 States.                              {time}  1415  This initiative adds layers of deterrence and punishment so that violent offenders can be held to account for all of the damage and injury or death and heartbreak they have inflicted on innocent victims.  The Unborn Victims of Violence Act, Mr. Chairman, recognizes in law the self-evident truth that an assault on a pregnant woman is an attack on two victims. Both lives are precious; both lives deserve protection.  This is truly a humane and necessary legislative initiative, and I congratulate the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Graham) for his wisdom and courage in authoring this bill and the skill and tenacity of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Canady), the chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution; and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, in shepherding this legislation to the floor.  I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' and against the substitute.
