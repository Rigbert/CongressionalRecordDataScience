Madam Speaker, I want to thank my chairman for yielding.  Madam Speaker, I have decided that the cost of doing nothing is greater than the cost of doing something.  The fear that is gripping Wall Street has the power to shut down Main Street. We cannot and we must not allow this to happen. The people are afraid. Their retirement savings are slipping away. Small businesses have no sales, no credit, and are closing their doors. People cannot get loans, they're losing their lines of credit. We must act. Now is the time to act. We must do something.  I do not see this as a blank check. In a few months, we will have a new President and a new Congress. We must hold the feet of these financial institutions to the fire. It is with this assurance that I will vote ``yes'' on this legislation.
