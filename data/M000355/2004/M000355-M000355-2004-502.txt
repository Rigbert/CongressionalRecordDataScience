 President, I say to my friend from Nevada, it is likely there will be a side-by-side amendment offered. It is also likely we will get to vote on both of those amendments tomorrow. I would not want to call it a guarantee at this point, but I think it extremely likely we will be able to vote on both tomorrow.
