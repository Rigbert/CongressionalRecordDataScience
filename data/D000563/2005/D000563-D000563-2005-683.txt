President, I thank the Senator from Florida. He has identified an issue which every American family understands every time they go to the gasoline station.  The cost of filling up the tank nowadays is stunning. Even the automobile manufacturers are starting to advertise cars with good gas mileage. We haven't seen that in a long time, have we? It reminds all Americans how dependent we are on foreign fuel and foreign sources of energy.  The Senator from Florida, a leader on this issue, remembers we brought an amendment to the floor on the Energy bill saying we believe America should set as a national goal reducing our dependence on foreign oil by 40 percent over the next 20 years. Sadly, it was defeated on a partisan rollcall.  I cannot believe this is a partisan issue. Our dependence on foreign energy puts us at the mercy of the Saudis and others who really do not lose a lot of sleep if our economy is not doing well and if our families suffer.  I am glad the Senator stepped forward. He identifies ethanol. It is near and dear to my heart because my State produces more than any other State. And it is homegrown. We do not need to have a Saudi prince smiling at us to find a gallon of ethanol. All we need is for God to bless us with a little sunshine on that corn crop, and we know just what to do with it.  I am glad the Senator is raising this issue. It goes back to a point I made in my earlier statement about public health: a stronger America begins at home. What the Senator from Florida is reminding us is whether it is public health or energy, it is time to focus the ingenuity, creativity, and innovation of this country into making America stronger at home. I am glad the Senator is leading us in that discussion today.
