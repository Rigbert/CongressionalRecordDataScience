President, we are trying to bring this Medicare issue to the floor for debate. Nine Republicans joined Democrats and said: Let's do it. But it wasn't enough. We are asking to bring it forward for debate. If you have a better idea, put it on the floor and let's vote on it. But for the Republicans to consistently file these filibusters and object to bringing these measures forward to even debate them, and now it is a take it or leave it. The Senator from Arizona has filed, just like the minority leader did yesterday, this political get-well card which says: We will make a unanimous consent request so we are on the record wanting this. Get on the record and vote for bringing it to the floor for debate. Don't be afraid of a debate. Don't be afraid of an amendment. If you have a good idea, put it forward. Let's see if it wins or loses.  Seventy-seven, one after another, and this one is to stop a cut in reimbursement for doctors providing help through Medicare. These doctors need that help. That is why we wanted to bring it to the floor. I beg the Republican side, for goodness sakes, let's act like a Senate. Let's debate. Let's deliberate. Let's vote on amendments. Let's earn our pay one week.
