President, small businesses and working families throughout Vermont and around the country are facing incredibly challenging times. These problems are especially acute in my State, where we rely so heavily on small businesses to create jobs for our citizens and to make Vermont the desirable place to live and to visit that it is.  The Federal Government has rightly recognized the important role small businesses play in our economy. From SBA loans, to USDA Rural Development grants, to small business set-asides on government contracts, a variety of targeted Federal programs join with small businesses to help them grow and prosper.  This Congress has enacted several job-creating steps. Just last year, I was able to lead the effort here in the Senate to enact a major overhaul of our Nation's outdated patent laws. The Leahy-Smith America Invents Act is going to create jobs, but also, and very importantly, it is going to help unleash more American innovation, and it does not add a penny to our deficit. In fact, last year Vermont was awarded more patents per capita than any State in the Union. Of course, those patents mean more jobs for Vermonters.  And 2 weeks ago we made further progress by passing a transportation funding bill that will make vital investments in our Nation's roads, bridges, and transit systems, and a student loan bill that will lower the costs of college borrowing for thousands of students and their families.  I might say, these student loans are extremely important. I remember the one I had when I was in law school--a 10-year loan. Two things happened the year of that last payment, that 10th payment on my student loan from law school: first, the satisfaction my wife, Marcelle, and I had in paying off the loan, and second, it was that same year I was sworn into the U.S. Senate. I wonder if I would have been here had we not had the money to pay for school.  But I think we can and must do more to help our struggling small businesses and working families.  That is why I strongly support the bill before us today that will provide small businesses with tax incentives to begin hiring again. The bill is a multipronged strategy for spurring job creation. First, it would create a tax credit for businesses to hire new workers or increase wages for their currentworkers. In other words, instead of saying that we just give a tax break to extraordinarily wealthy people and somehow jobs will be created, we say: Let's see the jobs. Show me the jobs. Show me the jobs. If you have a tax credit for businesses that hire new workers or increase wages for their current workers, then that is a good use of our Tax Code. Second, it would allow businesses to immediately write off all of the major purchases they make this year. That is a tangible incentive for new investments and new hires, right away.  I do not support this bill just because the President supports it, or the Democratic leader supports it, or most of the Members of my side of the aisle support it. They all do stand behind this effort, and I am grateful for that. I support this bill because I have heard from small business owners in Vermont, Democratic and Republican alike, who tell me they would make capital improvements and put people to work immediately if this bill were signed into law. And I suspect the same would be true in virtually every other State in this country.  On the shores of Lake Champlain, in the northern border town of Highgate, VT, sits one of America's most genuine and beautiful family resorts: the Tyler Place Family Resort. Year after year, families flock to the resort to spend time with their families, swimming and boating and enjoying a summer campfire. It is the kind of place that draws the same families year after year, where multigenerational families take time to enjoy each other's company as well as the great food and the magnificent views. It is easy to forget, especially when you are sitting there watching the sunset over the beautiful, great big Lake Champlain, that it is one of the millions of small businesses that keep America's economy moving forward and Americans at work.  Last year I heard from the owners of the resort, including Pixley Tyler Hill, a dogged advocate for Vermont, for Vermont's tourism industry, and for Lake Champlain, about their interest in seeing an extension of the bonus depreciation provision that expired in December.  Her brother Ted Tyler summed it up by saying:       These changes in the tax law make all the difference in the      world in decisions whether to spend money, and thereby      stimulate the economy and increase employment in the process.      For example, consider a resort deciding whether to add tennis      courts, put in a new sewer system, upgrade roads or do major      landscaping work--say, at an anticipated cost of $300,000.      Absent bonus depreciation the company will have paid $300,000      but it can only deduct $20,000 that year as an expense for      tax purposes. True enough that over the next 14 years, the      business can continue to write off $20,000. But how many      small businesses can afford to wait that long to recoup the      $280,000 they no longer have?  Pixley and Ted had me sold the minute they explained that this tax incentive was the difference between making new investments and hiring someone, and sitting on their hands waiting for things to change. Extending this provision alone is reason enough to pass the bill.  This bill is full of a million other reasons why we should be working with all the determination we can muster and promptly pass it. Pass it now when the economy needs it. It is a good, solid reason for each of the jobs it would create for working families and businesses all over America.  I urge all Senators to work without delay on this important legislation. Businesses in each of our 50 States are waiting for us to lend another helping hand to the economic recovery act.               Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act  Mr. President, it has been nearly 3 months since the Senate passed the bipartisan Leahy-Crapo Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act--3 months. We are no closer to enacting this bill into law than we were in April when 68 Senators, Republican and Democratic Senators alike, voted for this critical legislation to protect women from domestic and sexual abuse.  I am concerned that politics threatens to get in the way of passing this critical legislation this year. Protecting every victim of domestic and sexual violence should be above politics. Members of Congress in both Chambers, set aside the political rhetoric. Act swiftly to reauthorize this landmark legislation and save countless lives.  Time is running out. There are only a few weeks left in this session before election-year politics take over and Congress comes to a standstill. There are critical improvements in the Leahy-Crapo reauthorization bill that will not take effect unless Congress acts. We cannot simply say: Well, if we do not enact it, maybe we can do it next year or the year after. There are a lot of major programs that can only be enacted in this bill, not in appropriations, not any other way.  Sexual assault programs will not receive the added support they need unless we pass our bill into law. The legislation's emphasis on increasing housing protection for victims and preventing homicides connected to domestic and sexual violence will not have an opportunity to help vulnerable victims across the country. Important improvements in campus safety and prevention programs for teens will not occur. Immigrant victims, Native women, and LGBT victims will continue to remain without the services and protection they need and deserve.  The legislation is too important to wait. I hear from victims and the professionals who work on their behalf. They say they need the improvements made by the Leahy-Crapo bill and they need them today.  The legislation is particularly important during difficult economic times because the economic pressures facing many Americans can pose additional hurdles in leaving abusive relationships. Active community networks are needed to provide support to victims in these circumstances, yet budget cuts result in fewer available services, such as emergency shelters, transitional housing, and counseling.  Late last month, I had the opportunity to speak at the VAWA National Days of Action rally, where survivors and professionals in the field--those who have dedicated their lives to helping victims all over the country--gathered together to send Congress a message. They told me they are very frustrated by the lack of progress in passing VAWA, and rightfully so, because they and the victims they serve are the ones who are affected by Congress's inaction. They were so inspired when this body came together and 68 of us voted to pass it. Now they ask when are we going to finish.  Their message to Congress was loud and clear: Do your job. Pass VAWA now. Supporting the work of these tireless advocates, and the victims they help, should be our priority.  Victims should not be forced to wait any longer. They will not benefit from the improvements we made in the Senate bill unless both Houses of Congress vote to pass this legislation. The problems facing victims of domestic and sexual violence are too serious for Congress to delay. Domestic and sexual violence knows no political party. Its victims are Republican and Democratic, rich and poor, young and old. As I said so many times, a victim is a victim is a victim. Helping these victims, all of these victims, should be our goal.  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
