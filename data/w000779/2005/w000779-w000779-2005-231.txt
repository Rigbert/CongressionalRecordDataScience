President, I strongly believe that parents in our country should have more wholesome entertainment choices for their children. To make that possible, I am today introducing legislation to require that cable and satellite owners allow parents to purchase a child-friendly tier of television programming.  For years, the Congress and the Federal Communications Commission have labored, to little avail, to turn off offensive programming with a variety of technologies. My legislation would ensure that America's families, 24/7, could turn on programming that is reliably friendly to our children.  While the legislation ensures that parents have more choices, the entertainment industry is assured that it has choices as well. Under the bill, Congress does not direct how the law is to be implemented. The Congress does not set prices. And the Congress does not take any step that is inconsistent with the first amendment.  About the only part of the legislation that is nonnegotiable is my belief that Congress should not dawdle any longer when the volume of degrading, violent, and antisocial entertainment our children are exposed to continues to grow.  Here is what America's parents deal with now. A recent study found that the average child in America has seen 8,000 murders depicted on television by the time they graduate from elementary school. Kids see about 10,000 television rapes, assaults, and murders each year. And in 2004, Americans filed more than 1 million complaints with the Federal Communications Commission about indecent programming.  Yesterday the National Cable and Telecommunications Association launched a new public service campaign to alert subscribers to parental control features that are already available and to introduce new larger TV rating icons. I haven't studied their proposal, but it certainly sounds constructive and I look forward to hearing more about their efforts.  The legislation I am introducing today is a truly new approach that has teeth. It is going to give parents more kid-friendly entertainment choices that are easy to understand. The legislation would require that all cable and satellite operators within 1 year of enactment offer a kid-friendly tier of programming. It would require monthly billing statements to include information about how customers can use blocking technology to stop offensive programming. And it would impose big-league fines of $500,000 a day on any cable or satellite operator who doesn't comply with the requirement that they give parents the chance to purchase kid-friendly programming. In this tier parents will know that there will be no content and no advertisements of a violent or sexual nature. Parents and adults who are not concerned about the current level of violence and sex on television would, of course, have access to those options with respect to current law.  This proposal is the first to tell cable and satellite operators they must offer a kid-friendly television tier so parents have more choices. The legislation does not dictate how it must be accomplished. It only says this tier of kid-friendly programming must carry a number of channels.  The legislation leaves it up to the operator whether to offer the kids tier as part of a basic or expanded basic package or as a completely separate package.  Certainly there is going to be some opposition. But I believe good quality programming and an option for families could translate to pretty good profits for those cable and satellite providers. Parents are going to find this option very attractive. If children are watching TV 4 hours a day, you can bet mom and dad are not able to stand there the whole time. A kids tier is going to take the guesswork out of TV time for America's parents.  Now there is an awful lot of guesswork. Time magazine found last month 53 percent of respondents said they thought the Federal Communications Commission ought to place stricter controls on broadcast channel shows depicting sex and violence. Sixty-eight percent of those surveyed said the entertainment industry has lost touch with viewers' moral standards. Sixty-six percent said there is too much violence on open air TV. Fifty-eight percent said there is too much cursing. Fifty percent said there is too much sexual content.  I have worked to make sure that this legislation strikes an appropriate balance, offering choices to parents, not taking them away. A recent Pew Research survey found although 60 percent of Americans are very concerned about what kids see and hear on television, about half of those surveyed were more worried about the Government imposing undue restrictions and thought this was essentially the responsibility of the audience.  So what we are doing here shows a balanced kind of approach in line with the kinds of values Americans are expressing. Don't make choices for parents, but help parents make good choices for their children. With 8 out of 10 American households getting their television through cable or satellite programmers, it is time that parents be given the chance to sign up for programming that works for their family.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 946       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Kid Friendly TV Programming      Act of 2005''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) More than a decade ago, the American Psychological      Society concluded that ``There is absolutely no doubt that      higher levels of viewing violence on television are     correlated with increased acceptance of aggressive attitudes      and increased aggressive behavior.''       (2) A study in 2003 found that adults who were ``high TV-     violence viewers'' as children are more than three-to-four      times as likely as other adults to be convicted of a crime      and to use violence against their spouses and other adults.       (3) Adults who watched more violent programming as children      were more likely to be arrested and convicted for spousal and      child abuse, murder and aggravated assault.       (4) Ten percent of violent acts committed by youths are      attributable to their exposure to violence on television.       (5) Forty percent of parents surveyed in l999 in Rhode      Island reported that at least one symptom of post-traumatic      stress disorder occurred after their child viewed a scary      event on television, and that this symptom lasted at least 1      month.       (6) The average child who watches 2 hours of cartoons a day      will view almost 10,000 violent acts a year.       (7) Teenagers who watched television with the greatest      amount of sexual content were twice as likely to initiate      sexual intercourse the following year as those who watched      television with the least amount of sexual content.       (8) The Kaiser Family Foundation reported in 2002 that 72      percent of teenagers think sex on television influences      ``somewhat'' or ``a lot'' the sexual behavior of their peers.       (9) The Kaiser Family Foundation reported in 2003 that 64      percent of all television shows have some sexual content, and      that in prime time, 71 percent of the top 4 broadcast network      shows have some sexual content.       (10) The continued exposure of children to obscene,      indecent, sexual, or gratuitous or excessively violent      content on television is harmful to the public health and      welfare of communities across the country.       (11) Efforts to limit the exposure of children to      television programming that contains material with obscene,      indecent, violent, or sexual content, or to impose fines and      penalties for the broadcast of such content, have not been      successful in protecting children from harmful content.       (12) The number of homes in the United States that receive      television programming via cable or satellite providers is      estimated to have grown to 85 percent of American households,      and of that percentage, an estimated 95 percent of the      households subscribe to basic or expanded basic programs.       (13) The efforts to limit the exposure of children to      harmful television content have not been successful because      Federal regulatory agencies have not had the authority to      require cable and satellite providers to offer a child-     friendly tier of programming.       (14) Parents need more effective ways to limit the exposure      of children to television with harmful content through      alternative, child-friendly tiers of programs.     SEC. 3. BASIC TIER CONTENT RESTRICTIONS.       Part IV of title VI of the Communications Act of 1934 (47      U.S.C. 631 et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the      following:     ``SEC. 641.
