Speaker, I have never met New York's Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, but on behalf of the citizens of Ohio, I want to thank him. The people of New York should be very proud of their Attorney General, Mr. Spitzer, for he is bringing to justice the robber barons of Wall Street who stole the money in our 401(k)s, who lied to our shareholders about the worth of various investments, who issued fraudulent reports about the value of stocks, and frankly destroyed a great deal of the confidence of our people in our so-called free markets. In fact, some might say they have been a free-for-all market. Some might say what these Wall Street fellows have done is a big heist, a big heist right out of people's pocketbooks and a big heist right out of people's dividends. Because of work that he did, and our Securities and Exchange Commission following behind, the regulators found fault with every single investment banking firm on Wall Street.  I want to include in the Record much of what they said: ``Analysts wittingly duped investors to curry favor with certain corporate clients. Investment houses received secret payments from companies they gave strong recommendations to buy. And for top executives whose companies were clients, stock underwriters offered special access to hot initial public offerings.''  It really is staggering, when we think about the recession that we are in, about the malfunctioning of our own stock markets which lie at the heart of this free enterprise system that has been hijacked time and again.                              {time}  1630  It started with Enron. Then we saw WorldCom. Then it was Tyco. Now it is every single money manager on Wall Street that has your money.  So far, they have been fined as follows: $400 million is to be paid by Citigroup; $200 million each by Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch, which included an earlier Merrill settlement of $100 million in fines; $100 million in fines by Goldman Sachs; $80 million in fines by Bear Stearns; $80 million by JP Morgan; and fines of the same amount to Lehman and to UBS Warburg; $32.5 million in fines by Piper Jaffray. These are names we see advertised in our newspapers. They have got enough money to buy ads all over the country, yet they take your hard-earned money and they gamble it away.  I have to ask myself as a Member of Congress, I am not going to trust those folks with the Social Security funds of this country. Do not tell me to put our people's hard-earned dollars in that stock market that you cannot trust from one day to the next, and do not ask this Member of Congress to vote for a Bush administration tax scheme that rewards some of the same fellows that just ran away with our money in our own equity market. Why was not anybody watching? Why did it take so long?  Now, they tell you anything to get your money. That is what Mr. Spitzer found. And they did tell you anything to get your money. The news articles really say everything. What jumps off the page in the documents is the Wall Street firms' utter, utter disregard for the individual investor in pursuit of their own personal benefit. These are institutions that are supposed to be working for us, and they all, not one, not two, all, the major firms on Wall Street failed the American people.  One investor told a colleague he was trying to make the company look good with his questions. A few moments later he said, ``We got paid for it, and I am going to Cancun tomorrow because of what I did.'' That is someone that took your money.  Here is somebody, Sanford Weill, Citigroup's chairman. He persuaded an analyst to change a rating. This is not some guy in the back closet. This is the head of the largest investment banking firm in this country.  What are they doing up there? What is the matter with them? You know how many people in my district have lost their retirement savings in the 401(k) plans alone? These are the highest paid people in our country that the Bush administration is about to open up the Treasury for. They do not deserve a dime. They ought to pay more of it back to us for what they have done.  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Attorney General Elliott Spitzer of New York. He is a hero in my book.  Mr. Speaker, I include the three newspaper articles for the Record.                [From the New York Times, Apr. 29, 2003] Ten Wall St. Firms Settle With U.S. in Analyst Inquiry: Agree to Pay                               $1.4 Billion                          (By Stephen Labaton)       Washington, Apr. 28.--Prosecutors announced a settlement      today with the nation's biggest investment firms that bars      the heads of the largest bank from talking to his analysts,      details a far greater range of conflicts of interest than      previously disclosed, and leaves the industry exposed both to      further regulation and costly litigation.       The $1.4 billion settlement by 10 firms and 2 well-known      stock analysts reached tentatively last December but      completed in the last few days, resolved accusations that the      firms lured millions of investors to buy billions of dollars      worth of shares in companies they knew were troubled and      which ultimately either collapsed or sharply declined.       The Securities and Exchange Commission, state prosecutors      and market regulators accused three firms in particular--     Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney, Merrill Lynch, and Credit      Suisse First Boston--of fraud. But the thousands of pages of      internal e-mail messages and other evidence that regulators      made public today painted a picture up and down Wall Street      of an industry rife with conflicts of interest during the      height of the Internet and telecommunications bubble that      burst three years ago.       At firm after firm, according to prosecutors, analysts      wittingly duped investors to curry favor who corporate      clients. Investment houses received secret payments from      companies they gave strong recommendations to buy. And for      top executives whose companies were clients, stock      underwriters offered special access to hot initial public      offerings.       ``These cases reflect a sad chapter in the history of      American business--a chapter in which those who reaped      enormous benefits based on the trust of investors profoundly      betrayed that trust,'' said William H. Donaldson, the new      chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. ``The      cases also represent an important new chapter in our ongoing      efforts to restore investors' faith and confidence in the      fairness and integrity of our markets.''       In a reflection of regulators' concerns about the prospect      for conflicts of interest at Citigroup, Wall Street's biggest      bank, the settlement bars its chairman and chief executive,      Sanford I. Weill, from communicating with his firm's stock      analysts about the companies they cover, unless a lawyer is      present.       But the regulators found fault with every major bank on      Wall Street.       In addition to the three firms accused of fraud, five      others--Bear Stearns, Goldman, Sachs, Lehman Brothers, Piper      Jaffray and UBS Warburg--were accused of making unwarranted      or exaggerated claims about the companies they analyzed. UBS      Warburg and Piper Jaffray, were accused of receiving payments      for research without disclosing such payments.       And Salomon Smith Barney and First Boston were accused of      currying favor with their corporate clients by selling hot      stock offerings to senior executives, who then could turn      around and sell the shares for virtually guaranteed profits.       The two banks agreed to end that practice, known as      spinning.       In settling the cases, the firms neither admitted nor      denied the allegations, following the standard practice in      resolving such disputes with the commission.       In monetary terms, the $1.4 billion in fines, restitution      and other payments equals nearly 7 percent of the industry's      profits last year, which was Wall Street's worst year since      1995. Of that sum, $387.5 million will go to repaying      investors who file claims with the government. But armed with      the regulators' findings, lawyers are sure to seek many times      that total in private litigation.       The firms also agreed to abide by what officials said were      significant new ethics rules and to build barriers between      investment bankers and stock analysts in hopes of relieving      analysts from the business pressures that many succumbed to      during the 1990's. For example, the compensation of analysts      is to be based on the quality of their research, not their      contribution to the firm's investment banking business.       As part of the agreement, two analysts whose fortunes rose      with the markets, Jack B. Grubman of Salomon Smith Barney and      Henry Blodget of Merrill Lynch, agreed to lifetime bans from      the industry, along with significant fines.       The singling out of Mr. Weill stemmed in part from his      efforts to try to influence Mr. Grubman to change his view of      AT Citigroup client that had Mr. Weill on its board--to      positive from negative. He and Citigroup's other senior      officers--whose contacts with the banks' research analysts      are also restricted under the settlement--were the only Wall      Street executives to agree specifically to such a      prohibition. Any top Wall Street executive directly involved      in investment banking, however, would be barred from      discussions with his company's analysts under the terms of      the agreements.       For all the anticipation of today's announcement, the      voluminous record of complaints and damaging evidence left      many unresolved questions for both investors and the      securities industry.       Foremost among those was what long-term impact the      settlement will have on the culture of Wall Street, the      integrity of stock analysis and the confidence of investors.      Concerned that the settlement might not be far reaching      enough--and might also have unintended consequences--     officials at the S.E.C. are considering the adoption of a new      set of regulations governing stock analysts.       ``It's critically important that we now step back and      thoroughly examine the issues,'' said Harvey Goldschmid, one      of the commissioners. Wondering whether the settlement might      discourage research for smaller markets, he added, ``No      research is certainly better than skewed research, but honest      research would be even better.''       Critics who fear that the settlement falls short of      protecting investors said that they welcomed further efforts      by regulators.       ``What they have imposed is a solution where they will try      to regulate behavior, ethics and business practices,'' said      Scott Cleland, the chief executive of Precursor Group and a      member of a coalition of small research firms without ties to      investment banks that have been seeking broader changes.      ``What they didn't do is address the conflict at its source--     the commingling of trading, research and banking      commissions.''       ``The analogy is that if this were an operating room, they      disinfected everything but the scalpel,'' Mr. Cleland said.      ``The scalpel is left dirty.''       While providing $375.5 million in restitution that can be      sought by investors, the cases leave unresolved how much      investors might ultimately recoup after relying on the      analysts to make what turned out to have been calamitous      investments. Federal and state officials said today that one      aim of the settlement was to shake out enough strong evidence      to assist shareholders in private lawsuits and arbitration      efforts.       ``This is very much the beginning,'' said New York Attorney      General Eliot Spitzer, whose early inquiry into conflicts on      Wall Street prompted federal and market regulators to begin      focusing on the issue--and who supporters say might try to      ride his success in the case to the governor's office in      Albany. ``One of our objectives was to put information into      the marketplace to permit investors on their own to seek      relief.''       Wall Street executives acknowledged that the findings of      the regulators would probably draw more lawsuits against      their firms.       ``It's sort of like throwing a party and inviting a lot of      people in, isn't it?'' E. Stanley O'Neal, Merrill's chief      executive, said at the firm's annual shareholders meeting in      Plainsboro, N.J.       Government officials also emphasized today that the      settlements did not preclude them from further      investigation--pointedly noting, for example, that they were      examining whether any top executives at the investment firms      had failed to adequately supervise the analysts.       ``Just wait,'' said Stephen M. Cutler, the head of      enforcement at the commission and a leading architect of the      agreement.       In addition to the restitution, the firms also agreed to      pay $487.5 million in penalties, $432.5 million to fund      independent research, and $80 million for investor education.      Mr. Blodget agreed to pay $4 million and Mr. Grubman $15      million to settle the charges against them.       The fines, restitution and other penalties were divided as      follows: $400 million will be paid by Citigroup; $200 million      each by Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch (which includes an      earlier Merrill settlement of $100 million); $125 million by      Morgan Stanley; $110 million by Goldman Sachs; $80 million      each by Bear Stearns, J.P. Morgan, Lehman and UBS Warburg;      and $32.5 million by Piper Jaffray.       One of the final issues that had been negotiated involved      which companies would bear the brunt of the penalties and how      much might be covered by insurance policies and deductible      from the firms' taxes.       Under tax law, none of the $487.5 million in penalties is      deductible, and the firms agreed not to seek reimbursement      under their insurance policies.       Prosecutors also inserted a clause in the settlement that      might make it harder for the firms to try to deduct any of      the $512.5 million in independent research and investor      education.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Apr. 29, 2003]           In a Wall St. Hierarchy, Short Shift to Little Guy                        (By Gretchen Morgenson)       Documents disclosed as part of yesterday's settlement show      how Wall Street firms, in pursuit of investment banking fees,      put the     interests of their individual clients dead last.       As an analyst at Lehman Brothers told an institutional      investor in an e-mail message, ``well, ratings and price      targets are fairly meaningless anyway,'' later adding, ``but,      yes, the `little guy' who isn't smart about the nuances may      get misled, such is the nature of my business.''       In a newly disclosed tactic, Morgan Stanley and four other      brokerage firms paid rivals that had agreed to publish      positive reports on companies whose shares Morgan and others      issued to the public. This practice made it appear that a      throng of believers were recommending these companies'      shares.       From 1999 through 2001, for example, Morgan Stanley paid      about $2.7 million to approximately 25 other investment banks      for these so-called research guarantees, regulators said.      Nevertheless, the firm boasted in its annual report to      shareholders that it had come through investigations of      analyst conflicts of interest with its ``reputation for      integrity'' maintained.       Among the firms receiving payments for their bullish      research on companies whose offerings they did not manage      were UBS Warburg and U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray. UBS received      $213,000 and Piper Jaffray, more than $1.8 million.       What jumps off the page in these documents is the Wall      Street firms' disregard for the individual investor in      pursuit of personal benefit.       One comment made by a Bear, Stearns analyst is telling.      While participating in a conference call by SonicWall, an      Internet company whose shares Bear, Stearns had sold to the      public, the analyst told a colleague that he was trying to      make the company look good with his questions. A few moments      later, he said, ``we got paid for this,'' adding, ``and I am      going to Cancun tomorrow b/c of them.''       But because greed is a part of human nature and human      nature seldom seems to change, Alan Bromberg, professor of      securities law at Southern Methodist University, remains      skeptical that the terms of the settlement will bring      substantive change to Wall Street.       ``I don't see this as a great reformation,'' Mr. Bromberg      said. ``I don't see this as a new world we are moving into.      The pressures are still going to be there. Brokerage firms      don't make money other than by selling securities so they're      going to inevitably be encouraging people to buy and will      always have pressures to hype what they think is good or what      they're otherwise involved in.''       The heaviest penalties in the settlement went to Salomon      Smith Barney, Credit Suisse First Boston and Merrill Lynch.      Regulators contended that analysts at these firms committed      securities fraud by recommending stocks to the public they      had expressed misgivings about privately.       But securities regulators also found that all the firms      failed to supervise adequately the research analysts and      investment banking professionals they employed. They failed,      therefore, to protect clients who were basing investment      decisions on research that had been written to attract or      maintain investment banking clients.       While the symbiotic relationship between Wall Street      research analysts and investment bankers harmed investors, it      was beneficial to the firms. Lehman Brothers and Goldman,      Sachs, according to regulators, encouraged analysts to work      closely with investment bankers to generate deals.       Goldman, Sachs aligned its research, equities and      investment banking divisions to work collaboratively and      fully leverage its limited research resources. In 2000,      Goldman noted happily that ``research analysts, on 429      different occasions, solicited 328 transactions in the first      5 months'' and that ``research was involved in 82 percent of      all won business solicitations.''       Crucial to the firms' failure to supervise themselves was      the tendency by their analysts to publish research that was      not based on sound analysis or principles of fair dealing or      good faith, the regulators said. Eight of the 10 firms that      settled--Bear, Stearns; Credit Suisse First Boston; Goldman,      Sachs; Lehman Brothers; Merrill Lynch; Piper Jaffray; Salomon      Smith Barney; and UBS Warburg--issued such reports. The      firms' research also contained exaggerated or unwarranted      assertions about companies, or opinions for which there were      no reasonable bases.       For example, at Credit Suisse, regulators contend that its      analyst covering Winstar, a small telecommunications concern      that never turned a profit and that filed for bankruptcy two      years ago, failed to disclose the risks inherent in the      company. The firm had initiated equity research coverage of      Winstar in May 2000, with a ``strong buy'' rating and a 12-     month target price of $79. Credit Suisse retained the $79      target from Jan. 5 to April 3, 2001, even as the stock      plummeted to 31 cents a share from approximately $17 and the      company's market capitalization fell to $30 million from $1.6      billion.       Some of the most entertaining reading in the masses of      evidence that regulators have made public for use by      aggrieved investors in their own lawsuits is the commentary      by Salomon Smith Barney brokers about Jack B. Grubman's      performance as the firm's top telecommunications analyst.       As far back as 2000, brokers were expressing outrage and      betrayal over Mr. Grubman's woeful stock picking, which many      noted was related to his dual roles as investment banker and      analyst. Yet even as the brokers howled about Mr. Grubman's      tendency to keep recommending stocks as they collapsed in      price, the analyst retained his job at Salomon until last      August.       Here are some outtakes from Salomon brokers late in 2000.      Mr. Grubman ``should be publicly flogged,'' one said. ``Under      the category, Bonus for Creating Tax Loss Carry Forwards for      Retail Clients, Grubman should be recognized accordingly as      our best analyst.''       Many said the analyst should be fired, while another broker      said, ``If Jack Grubman is a top `research analyst' then I      have a bridge to sell.''       Another remarked: ``Boo Hiss. Banking showed its ugly      head.''       During the year these comments were made, Mr. Grubman was      paid $14.2 million in salary and bonus.       As a result, Salmon's brokers emerge as yet another group      victimized by Mr. Grubman's conflicted status. As one broker,      or financial consultant, put it: ``Grubman has zero      credibility with me or my clients. He is collecting from two      masters'' at financial consultant expense.       Then referring to investment banking functions, he      continued: ``He brings IB business to the firm and loses his      objectivity. I am sure that nothing will come of my comments.      The spin-masters will say that everyone else does it. Is      there an honest person left?''                                  ____         Finding Fraud on Wall St. May Be a Step to Higher Post                         (By Raymond Hernandez)       Washington, Apr. 28.--The question was about tax loopholes      and whether the 10 securities firms that agreed to pay $1.4      billion to resolve charges of wrongdoing by their research      analysts would be able to squirm out of their plight by      writing off their fines. It put the men behind the lectern at      the Securities and Exchange Commission's headquarters on the      spot.       But not Eliot Spitzer. ``Maybe I can be a little less      discreet,'' Mr. Spitzer, the attorney general from New York,      chimed in. ``I always try to be.''       With that, he shifted the focus to Congress, urging      lawmakers to act to close the loopholes, and insisting his      office and the S.E.C. had done their jobs.       ``Spoken like a man whose Hill is in Albany and not in      Washington,'' said William H. Donaldson, the chairman of the      S.E.C., to laughter.       Mr. Spitzer's hill, some say, is just about anywhere he      wants it to be these days, having been indiscreet enough to      take on the biggest names on Wall Street during a relentless      investigation of securities fraud. For more than a year, he      has plunged forward, making cases and headlines along the      way, and some say paving his future with stepping stones      bearing the names of Henry Blodget, Jack B. Grubman and the      like.       At the news conference here today announcing the settlement      of the case against the 10 firms, Mr. Spitzer was just one      player of many. Nonetheless, it was a defining moment for Mr.      Spitzer, who just five years ago took a gamble and used his      family's vast wealth to oust Dennis C. Vacco, the Republican      attorney general at the time.       As attorney general, Mr. Spitzer revived the long-dormant      Martin Act, a 1921 state law giving the attorney general of      New York, jurisdiction over securities trading.       Mr. Spitzer uncovered, among other things, damaging e-mail      messages among stock analysts at Merrill Lynch & Company, the      nation's biggest brokerage firm and a main-stay of New York's      financial community. He accused the analysts of urging      customers to buy stocks that the analysts believed where      losing bets just so that Merrill could curry favor with      companies it wanted as clients.       In doing the job, Mr. Spitzer, 43, has followed in the      tradition of activist and consumer-oriented attorneys      general, like Louis J. Lefkowitz, who set the standard, and      Robert Abrams.       But in his prepared remarks, he likened the pursuit of Wall      Street evildoers to another crusader, Theodore Roosevelt, the      populist Republican president who dubbed himself a Trust      Buster and crusaded against unchecked corporate wealth and      power.       ``We are at a rare moment,'' he said. ``It is akin to the      moment we were at 100 years ago.''       Before he was president, Mr. Roosevelt was New York's      governor, and many say that is the real goal of Mr. Spitzer.       Indeed, many of those who make their living from Wall      Street are seething over Mr. Spitzer, blaming him for      pursuing scandal at the expense of their livelihoods and New      York's economy. Many complain, quietly, of course, that Mr.      Spitzer has relentlessly undermined the public's trust in the      stock market while boosting his own political fortunes.       Many of Mr. Spitzer's fellow Democrats, however, feel      otherwise.       ``New York Democrats need someone who can galvanize them,''      said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic consultant in New York who      was one of Mr. Spitzer's campaign advisers in 1988. ``Eliot      Spitzer appears to be that person right now.''       ``This is not without its perils,'' Mr. Sheinkopf added.      ``The danger is that he has angered a large portion of New      York's traditional fund-raising base, Wall Street.''       Mr. Spitzer, in an interview after the news conference,      acknowledged the potential difficulties. ``This case has left      me without some friends I had before,'' he said.       But, he said, it might have made him friends elsewhere.      ``I've got a job to do and I'm going to do it,'' he said. ``I      hate to sound overly moralistic, but it's the only way to do      this job.''       Mr. Spitzer also said it was premature for him to talk      about a possible campaign for governor, though people in both      parties say he is the man to beat should be choose to run for      governor in 2006. ``All I can tell you is that I have made no      decision about that,'' he said.                          ____________________
