 President, I thank my good friend from New Hampshire for the issue she has raised with regard to the proper way to treat enemy combatants. Her amendment, which we have been discussing off and on here on the floor today, has prompted predications of doom and gloom from our friends on the other side of the aisle, and a lot of very excited rhetoric.  To be clear, I would ask my friend from New Hampshire: Is it not true that the amendment she has offered does not apply to everyone--absolutely everyone--who might be generally labeled a terrorist?
