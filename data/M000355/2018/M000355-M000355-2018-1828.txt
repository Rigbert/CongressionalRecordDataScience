 President, hearts are heavy in Pikeville, KY, this morning. Last night, Officer Scotty Hamilton, a 12-year veteran of the Pikeville Police Department, was shot and killed in the line of duty.  The investigation is ongoing. My Kentucky staff and I are monitoring the situation closely.  For now, our sincere condolences go out to his family, friends, and colleagues at the Pikeville Police Department.  Officer Hamilton leaves behind a wife, a young daughter, and a community that is safer for his service.                          ____________________
