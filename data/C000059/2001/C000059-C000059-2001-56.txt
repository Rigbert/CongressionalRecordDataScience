Speaker, my congressional district in Riverside, California is extremely fortunate to have a dynamic and dedicated group of community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give of their time and talents to ensure the well-being of our city and county. These individuals work tirelessly to develop voluntary community action to improve the community's economy, its education, its environment and its overall quality of life. One individual, who is a member of this group, is Steve Caseldine.  On the 3rd of March, Mr. Caseldine will be honored with the Ira. D. ``Cal'' Calvert Distinguished Service Award by the Corona-Norco Family YMCA. The award is given in memory of my father, ``Cal'' Calvert, and his enumerable philanthropic gifts to the community and his efforts to encourage others to serve their community in a similar fashion. The award recognizes Steve for his exceptional devotion to developing community volunteerism.  A senior vice president and manager of the Corona office of Citizens Business Bank, Steve credits his employer's emphasis on community service for his own history of volunteerism. However, it is his love for fishing and membership with the Inland Empire Bassmasters, not employer, that has motivated Steve for the past three years to help area youth experience the traditional American hobby of fishing. To date, the Inland Empire Bassmasters have introduced more than 250 boys and girls to the joys of fishing. Many of these youth have come from the Corona Boys and Girls Club, Alternatives in Domestic Violence and the YMCA.  Since Joining Citizens Business Bank (then Chino Valley Bank) in 1981, Steve has also been an active participant in the community through the Corona Chamber of Commerce and Corona Rotary Club.  Mr. Caseldine met his wife Docia, while attending a small Christian college. In 1974, he earned a Business Administration degree and began his career in banking at Wells Fargo, in Orange County, before Joining Citizens. Steve and Docia have one son and daughter.  Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to thank Steve Caseldine for his dedication, influence and involvement in our community. He has aided in developing and maintaining community volunteerism in the Corona-Norco area and the Inland Empire. I know that we will continue to benefit from his experience in the 43rd Congressional District and deep commitment to the region. It is a great pleasure for me to congratulate Steve on his outstanding career and lifelong devotion to community volunteerism.                          ____________________
