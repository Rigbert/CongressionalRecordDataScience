 President, we had an opportunity to hear the initial or, as we call it, the maiden speech of the new Senator from Idaho, and I wanted to be on the floor to listen to his words. This is a great opportunity to welcome him to the Senate and to encourage all our colleagues to read what he had to say about this massive spending bill we have before us.  I think his views were right on target, and I congratulate him on his first speech.
