President, on Saturday, August 6, Sister Mary of the Savior, O.P., will reaffirm her professional religious vows on the 25th anniversary of her vows. My dear friend Bishop Moses Anderson, S.S.E., will preside.  I have known Sister Mary as long as I can remember. She was Cathleen Going, and she and her dear sister Patricia grew up near the Leahy family in Vermont. Her parents and my parents were the closest of friends, and when I look at the picture taken 25 years ago at her professional vows I see my mother, Alba Leahy, in the front row.  Sister Mary of the Savior has given her life to help others, both through her deeds and her prayers. In a world when too little of that is done, my wife Marcelle and I so appreciate people like her.  I knew first of this from our friend, Moses Anderson, who has also given of his life and the two of us have talked about Cathleen and what she has done.  It is wonderful to have people like that in one's life, and I want the Senate to know about this remarkable woman.                          ____________________
