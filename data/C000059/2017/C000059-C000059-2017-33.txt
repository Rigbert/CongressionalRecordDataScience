Chairman, while I understand the gentleman's intent, I share his concern with the 2015 ozone standards, the bill's language in the amendment goes a little too far. It ties this new administration's hands with respect to reconsideration or flexibility efforts that they are trying to build in at the present time.  Meanwhile, the ozone language in the underlying bill provides the necessary administrative relief for communities to comply with the overlapping 2008 and 2015 requirements. I think that this administration understands the complexities that are being imposed by this 2015 requirement. They are trying to deal with it. Mr. Pruitt has indicated that publicly.  Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).  The amendment was rejected.                              {time}  2315                Amendment No. 67 Offered by Mr. Lamborn  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 67 printed in House Report 115-297.
