The fact is, it is creating jobs and we are still in a recession. Were we not working with the stimulus bill to put money back in the economy to create American jobs, it would be worse. We all know that.  When the President came to office, he encountered an economy that was losing on average 700,000 jobs a month. Our growth rate had hit a negative 6.3 percent. Foreclosures were at record levels, and residential investment hadfallen. Banks were in crisis and freezing lending. Madam President, $10 trillion in wealth had been lost. Virtually every American with a savings or retirement account had taken a hit. That is when the President took his hand off the Bible and accepted the responsibility of office, and that is what he inherited.  He came to Congress and said: Let's put money in the economy and get Americans back to work. Let's invest in things that will pay off in the long run. Let's build the bridges, the highways, the airports. Let's make sure we make investments that not only create jobs today, but we can rely on in the future to build our economy. And we did it, with limited help from the other side of the aisle.  The Senator who is offering this amendment voted against it. The position for most Senators on the other side of the aisle was, let's do nothing; let's let the market work this out.  Do you have any idea where we would be today if the market was still working this out? I am afraid we would be in sorry shape. We would continue to see job loss and continue to see more and more unemployed Americans, which is exactly the opposite of what we want.  Now comes the Senator from Louisiana who opposed the stimulus package in the midst of this economic crisis and now says: Let's take money out of the stimulus package that is creating good-paying jobs in America. Let's take it away from the States where they get 100 percent Federal funding for their projects. Let's put it in a different fund. It isn't creating any new investment, but let's put it in a different fund that now requires a State match.  What that means is, if your State budget is struggling--we know a lot of States are--the Senator from Louisiana does you no favor. He is taking a project in your State that is important for your economic future, closes it down and says: We will be glad to give you some of that money back as long as you can come up with matching funds.  I am afraid that is not helpful. It is hurtful at a time when this economy needs all the help it can get. When it comes to the stimulus package, understand, we are a little over 4 months into this stimulus, this 2-year stimulus package.  The Senator from Louisiana says: I am prepared to declare it a failure; let's stop right now.  I am not prepared to declare it a failure. In fact, I think there is an indication that it is starting to put America back to work.  Because of the Recovery Act, on which the Senator from Louisiana wants to reduce spending--listen to this--95 percent of working families are already getting tax credits in their paychecks. Those dealing with job loss are collecting an extra $25 a week if they are out of work. That does not sound like much if you have a job, but if you are out of work, it means something.  There also is help for unemployed people to pay health insurance. I don't know if the Senator from Louisiana didn't vote for that. I don't know if he thinks that is a good idea. If I were unemployed, I would want my family to have health insurance. That is pretty basic.  There is money to help seniors and college students, many of whom have faced the idea of suspending their college education because mom and dad are struggling at home. The Senator from Louisiana may be opposed to that; I am not. I want them to stay in school. I want them to get their degrees because they will lead America.  We provided $34 billion in funds for States for Medicaid because our States are struggling to provide health care for the poor. The Senator from Louisiana may oppose that. That is his right to do. I happen to think that providing basic health care to the poor in America is evidence we are a caring and compassionate nation and will continue to be.  The money that has gone to States and local governments has avoided the layoffs of teachers and police officers and other law enforcement in Louisiana, Illinois, California, and around the Nation. The Senator from Louisiana may think that is a waste of money, we never should have done that. But for a safer America and for an America where kids can go to school and have the teachers they need, I think the money was well spent.  Beyond that, this Recovery Act in which we are involved is one that is starting to make some results. Just starting. I am not being Pollyanna-ish about this. We are still in a recession. I think we are coming out--I hope we are coming out.  In January, the month before this Recovery Act went into law, we lost 741,000 jobs. Terrible. By June, the economy was losing one-third fewer jobs. I wish we were not losing any jobs, but the fact is the stimulus is starting to work.  The Senator from Louisiana, who did not support it, who had no plan for this economy, now wants to take the money out just at the moment it is starting to work. Boy, the perfect Washington answer. Let's move in right now, 4 months into a 2-year program, and declare it a failure. That may be his approach, but I don't think it works for America.  In less than 160 days, more than 30,000 projects have been started under this bill--30,000 across the country. I went to Peoria, IL. There is a project at the airport which is critical to its economic future funded by the stimulus bill, creating good-paying local jobs right in the heartland of Illinois. More than $23 billion will be made available to fund over 6,600 shovel-ready construction projects; 3,200 are underway. If the Senator from Louisiana has his way, we will stop right there. We will start cutting back on these projects right now. That is his idea of economic recovery.  Over $369 million has been put into rural water systems. I can tell you, representing a State with a lot of small towns, such as Louisiana, they need this money to make sure their drinking water is safe for the people who live there. The Senator from Louisiana says: Enough said; let's start cutting back on that.  Madam President, $2 billion has been moved out to State governments and community organizations for weatherization and energy efficiency on low-income homes, and half a billion in overdue cleanup of Superfund sites. The Senator from Louisiana says: Let's cut that money; let's reduce that money. I don't think that makes sense.  We know if we did not have this Recovery Act, there would be more unemployment, more people out of work, fewer dollars being paid in taxes to the Federal Government and State governments. Our situation would be worse when it comes to the deficit. The more people who are unemployed, the fewer who are paying taxes, the more people need services. It is a recipe for a deficit that grows.  The Vitter amendment, by reducing the spending power of the stimulus funds, will make our deficit worse. That is a fact. He must acknowledge that. I hope he does.  In terms of obligating these funds, I want to make sure at the end of the day, having voted for this and supported it, that the money is well spent. I don't want a single dollar wasted. We are going to take care to make sure these projects make sense, that we have a justification for them, and they will serve America and our economy's future. That is responsible and accountable transparency.  I know the Senator from Louisiana says we are 4 months in, we have not gotten it spent, it is time to bail out. That kind of shortsightedness will not work. The idea that we would cut back on funds for flood control in the States of Louisiana and Illinois makes no sense whatsoever. The Senator from Louisiana is wanting to cut back those funds so he can transfer money into the highway trust fund.  I think we are on the path to recovery. I hope that path is a short one and we reach it soon. In the meantime, the Vitter amendment will not help. The Vitter amendment makes it worse. The situation is that the projects we are counting on to get America back to work, good-paying jobs right here at home, are in danger because of this amendment.  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, even if they didn't vote for the stimulus package, do the math--100 percent Federal money for the project in that State, as opposed to the Vitter approach which would require 20 percent or more from the State before they could go forward with any projects at a time when most Statesare struggling. This is not the answer. This will not be the only part of the problem; it will be a big part of the problem.  I yield back the remainder of my time.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).
