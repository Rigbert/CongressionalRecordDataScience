President, let me say in response that a couple of times my good friend from Delaware has observed that the American people are not stupid, but the American people also want highways. That is one of the big things they want. In fact, we have a document called a Constitution that says we are supposed to be doing two things here: defending America, and roads and bridges. And I think we both agree on the significance of that.                                Burundi  I hope I will have time to get into something because our State Department of the United States of America is getting involved in Burundi, in their election. They had a duly-qualified election. The constitutional convention declared that Nkurunziza, who is the President, had a legal election, and we ought to stay out of their business. If there is time, I would like to elaborate on that, but I know I am competing for time.                                 Gitmo  On the President's Gitmo message, we have--I will give a little chronology on that. On January 22, 2009, Obama signed an Executive order to close Gitmo within the year.  On February 3 of that same year, 2009, I introduced a bill to permanently prevent Gitmo detainees from being relocated anywhere in the United States. At that time they were ready to talk about relocating them to parts of my State of Oklahoma, in the Fort Sill area.  In May 2009 I authored bipartisan legislation with Senator Danny Inouye to block funding to close Gitmo and to move the detainees anywhere on U.S. soil. That passed 90 to 6.  Every year since, Congress has blocked the attempts by this President and his administration to close Gitmo or move terrorist detainees into the United States.  Every year, Congress has passed laws that continue to limit the transfer of these detainees, including in the conference report for the fiscal year 2016 NDAA bill. That is what we are talking about right now. It prohibits the transferring of Gitmo detainees to the United States through December 31, 2016. That also tightens the restrictions on the detainees being transferred to other countries.  The fiscal year NDAA also included language preventing closure of Gitmo through December 31, 2016. However, this has not prevented President Obama from trying to empty Gitmo and releasing these terrorist detainees to any country he can pay to take them back and now threatening an Executive order to bring them to the United States--to the States of Colorado, South Carolina, and Kansas--against the will of the Senators from those States, the House Members from those States, and the American people.  This is not the first time the President has gone against the will of the American people and violated our laws. The President violated the law last June when he transferred the Taliban Five from Gitmo in exchange for Sergeant Bergdahl, and my colleagues willremember that issue. He failed to notify Congress. The laws we passed said they had to notify Congress 30 days in advance of any transfer of terrorists to any facility. His failure to adhere to the law he signed placed our Nation's security at great risk.  Let me just mention--I carry this with me. If people realize whom he turned loose, the Taliban Five--this is a statement that was made by the Taliban commander. His name is Mullah Khan. He was talking about Mohammad Fazl. Keep in mind he was arguably the most dangerous person--terrorist--who was being held in Gitmo. He said:       His return is like pouring 10,000 Taliban fighters into the      battle on the side of jihad. Now the Taliban have the right      lion to lead them in the final moment before victory in      Afghanistan.  These are the kinds of people he is turning loose.  According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, 29 percent of the detainees transferred out of Gitmo have either been confirmed or suspected of returning to the fight and killing Americans. That is how serious this is.  Gitmo is outside the sovereign territory of the United States, which means detainees held there do not have constitutional rights. But if we put them back in the United States, it is very likely they would have those rights.  I have a quote from former U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who said:       The question of what constitutional rights may apply to      aliens in government custody is unsettled, but it is clear      from existing jurisprudence that physical presence in the      United States would be a significant, if not a decisive,      factor.  I am also concerned about the security of the people here who would have to guard these terrorists.  Back when a Thomson, IL, prison was discussed--that was in 2009--Representative Mark Kirk--at that time he was in the House; that was before he was in the Senate--called the move ``an unnecessary risk,'' and other Illinois Members were concerned that the transfer of prisoners--some for trial and some for indefinite detention--could make the State a target for terrorists. Mark Kirk was then and is now correct that prisons holding these detainees will become magnets, and there is the very real possibility that these detainees would recruit more terrorists.  We have to keep in mind that a terrorist is not a criminal. A terrorist is someone who trains other people to be terrorists, and that is what we would be seeing happening in our courts.  FBI Director Robert Mueller said there is the very real possibility that Gitmo detainees will recruit more terrorists from among the Federal inmate population and continue Al Qaeda operations from outside the country.  I have been to Gitmo several times, as has the occupier of the chair. It is a state-of-the-art facility that provides humane treatment for all detainees. When I was there, the biggest problem they had with the detainees was that they were overweight. They are all obese because they are eating so well. It is fully in compliance with the Geneva Convention and provides treatment and oversight that exceed any maximum security prison in the world, as tested by human rights organizations such as the Red Cross, Attorney General Holder, and an independent commission led by Admiral Walsh. It is a secure location away from population centers, and it has a $12 million expeditionary legal complex. That is a courtroom. We can't use our courtrooms because of the confidentiality of information that is extracted from these individuals and used in the courtroom, so they use the expeditionary legal complex.  The last thing I would say is that it is clear that--and this comes from former CIA Director Leon Panetta. He was talking about the fact that our President--talking about the way they were able to get the bad guy, and what they have refused to understand is the information they extracted at Gitmo was used to actually capture Osama bin Laden.  Anyway, we don't want that to happen, we can't afford to let that happen, and we are going to do everything we can to keep the President from making that happen. This has become an obsession of his, and we are not going to let that happen.                                Burundi  Lastly, I do want to mention that on this whole issue in Burundi right now, we have to understand in this country that there are other nations that have their own systems of government. They are the ones that have their elections. In this case, I happened to be there in Burundi when the court declared that the incumbent President, Nkurunziza, was qualified to run again, even though they have a term limit. The first term was not a complete term, so that didn't count, according to the court. For us to come in afterward and say ``Well, we think the court was wrong, we don't think he is qualified to run, and we are going to withhold things from that country'' is something we should not be doing in this country.  I can assure my colleagues that the six Members who went with me over there were all on the scene and agreed that Nkurunziza should be legitimately elected, and we should stay out of their business.  With that, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
