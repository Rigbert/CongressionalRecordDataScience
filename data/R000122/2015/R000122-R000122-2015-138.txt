President, I am pleased to be joined by Senators Murkowski, Udall, Durbin, Coons, Warren, Schatz, Heinrich, Donnelly, Ayotte, Klobuchar, Blumenthal, Stabenow, Tester, Hirono, Merkley, Sanders, Grassley, Collins, and Reid in the introduction of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act Reauthorization.  This legislation is named for the son of our former colleague, Senator Gordon Smith, who took his own life at the young age of 22. After this tragedy, Senator Smith worked to gain the support of members across the aisle and in both chambers to prevent other children from doing the same with passage of the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act in 2004.  Although great strides have been made over the last decade, suicide remains the third-leading cause of death for adolescents and young adults between the ages of 10 and 24. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, youth suicide results in approximately 4,600 lives lost each year. Additionally, the CDC reports that 157,000 young adults in this age group are treated for self-inflicted injuries annually, often as the result of a failed suicide attempt.  More work must be done to address the mental and behavioral health of children and young adults before they hurt themselves and others. Parents also need help in identifying early warning signs of mental illness and accessing the appropriate treatment before it is too late.  The Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act authorizes critical resources for schools--elementary schools through college where children and young adults spend most of their time--to be able to reach at-risk youth. Since 2005, this law has supported 370 youth suicide prevention grants in all 50 States, 46 tribes or tribal organizations, and 175 institutions of higher education.  The bill my colleagues and I are introducing today, with the support of over 40 member organizations of the Mental Health Liaison Group, would increase the authorized grant level to States, tribes, and college campuses for the implementation of proven programs and initiatives designed to address mental illness and reduce youth suicide. It will enable more schools to offer critical services to students and provide greater flexibility in the use of funds, particularly on college campuses. This change to the Campus Suicide Prevention Program comes at a vital time.  Over the last decade, we have seen an increasing trend in the number of students seeking help for mental health issues on college campuses. Of these students seeking services for mental health issues, over 30 percent report that they have seriously considered attempting suicide at some point in their lives. With more students seeking mental health services, we must work to ensure that college and university counseling centers are equipped with the necessary tools to meet this demand.  We can play a role in helping these children and their families. Indeed, passing the Garrett Lee Smith Memorial Act Reauthorization is one way we can better address the mental health needs of this population. I urge our colleagues to work with us to pass this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
