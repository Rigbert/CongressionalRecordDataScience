President, if you think about it, those who are advocating that we go to 100 percent scanning prior to having the technology in place to do it efficiently without slowing down trade are, in fact, rejecting the whole notion of the C-TPAT Program. Why should a shipper, retailer or manufacturer, secure its supply chain from end to end if they are going to be subjected to the same kinds of inspection as a shipper who has high-risk cargo in an unsecured supply chain? That doesn't make any sense at all. It completely undermines the C-TPAT Program, the container security initiative, because it embraces the concept that all cargo is alike. It is not all alike. There are low-risk containers.  I think we should think very carefully about the implications of this amendment. I think Senator Coleman has come up with an excellent amendment. He has done a great deal of work, and I urge my colleagues to support the Coleman-Collins-Stevens amendment and to vote against the amendment of the Senator from New Jersey.
