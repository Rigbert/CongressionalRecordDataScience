 President, I probably will not take 5 minutes. Again, at risk of being redundant, I do not want to leave anybody in the Senate, or out in the country, who cares about this issue with the impression that one could accept repetitious meals or gifts of any sort, day after day after day, and not be in serious trouble.  In fact, Mr. President, it is interesting to note that some of the most famous ethics cases in recent years have not been a violation of Senate rules. The current case before us that everyone is quite familiar with--certainly, I am--with regard to the Senator from Oregon, some of the charges relate to allegations of sexual misconduct. In fact, those are not technically a violation of Senate rules. But I think we would all agree it is a very serious case. The Keating Five case involved largely no violations of Senate rules. In fact, the Senate adopted a new rule after the Keating case, rule 43.  So regardless of how people may feel about whether the limit should be set at $20 and $50, or $50 and $100, I want to assure the Senate and the public, as chairman of the Ethics Committee, that anybody who took repetitious gifts carefully crafted to circumvent the spirit of this limit, whether it is set at $20 or $50, is in a heck of a lot of trouble. And a candidate for censure. Certainly, the argument can be made that it is technically possible. But, as a practical matter, anybody who did that would be in very serious trouble and would have obviously violated the standards that we all accept as appropriate as behavior of Senators.  I just wanted to make certain that everybody had a clear understanding that nobody--certainly not Senator Lott or Senator Breaux--is suggesting that this is the kind of thing that would be tolerated by the adoption of the $50 to $100 option.  I thank the Chair.
