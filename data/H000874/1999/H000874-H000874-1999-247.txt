Chairman, but I respectfully disagree with him, not in the sense that he wants to shove something down his throat perhaps this time, but there are things in this bill that the President said, ``I view them so seriously that I will veto this bill.'' Now, he has not said that personally, but the Secretary of Treasury said it, and we know he is one of the President's closest advisers.  I want to say, as the ranking member said, the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), Both of us, of course, have absolutely unrestrained affection and respect for the chairman of our committee. We are pleased to have him as our chairman, and like his predecessor, Mr. Livingston, he did not want to do this. He stands here because the leadership has told him to stand here and defend this policy, which is bad policy,which is policy inconsistent with our rules, which is policy hoisted on the petard of their CATs.
