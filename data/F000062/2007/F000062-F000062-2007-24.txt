 President, I wish to notify all Senators that on Friday, November 9, 2007, the Committee on Rules and Administration approved the request of the Select Committee on Ethics and granted a 3-week extension until December 3, 2007, for the Ethics Committee to issue the initial guidelines implementing the new rules on privately sponsored travel required by Public Law 110-81.  In their letter to the Rules Committee, Senators Boxer and Cornyn note that unless the request is approved, the new travel rules would become effective on November 13, 2007. Due to the scheduling of a number of proposed trips on or shortly after November 13, the Ethics Committee believes that the additional required paperwork would not be submitted in time for review before the trips commence.  The 3-week extension will afford the Ethics Committee additional time to post the proposed new travel guidelines on its Web site. These guidelines will be effective on December 3, 2007, and all privately sponsored travel beginning on or after that date will be required to conform to the new rules and guidelines.  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter from the Ethics Committee dated November 7, 2007, printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Select Committee on Ethics,                                 Washington, DC, November 7, 2007.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Chairman, Committee on Rules and Administration, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Robert F. Bennett,     Ranking Member, Committee on Rules and Administration, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Feinstein and Bennett: Consistent with the      Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (the      ``Act''), the Select Committee on Ethics requests that the      Committee on Rules and Administration extends until December      3, 2007, the deadline for the Ethics Committee's formal      issuance of the initial guidelines implementing the new rules      on privately-sponsored travel. (See Section 544(b)(4) of the      Act.)       The legislative history of the Act provides that the new      travel requirements ``go into effect 60 days after enactment,      or the date the Select Committee on Ethics issues the      required guidelines under the rules, whichever is later.''      Without the requested extension, the new travel rules would      become effective on November 13, 2007. The Committee has      prepared guidelines and new forms that     must be completed by Senate members and staff, as well as      trip sponsors, 30 days prior to their travel. We would be      ready to issue these guidelines and forms on November 13.      However, a number of proposed trips that have been submitted      to the Committee for review begin on or shortly after      November 13, and it would be highly unlikely that the      additional paperwork could be completed for review by the      Committee before these trips begin.       If the Committee on Rules and Administration extends the      deadline for issuance of the guidelines until December 3,      2007, all privately-sponsored travel beginning on or after      that date would be required to conform to the new rules and      guidelines.       So that privately-sponsored travel starting on or after      December 3, 2007, may meet the requirements of the new travel      rules, the Committee intends on November 13, 2007, to post on      its Web site a preview of the complete text of the new travel      guidelines, and related regulations and forms, that the      Committee will issue formally on December 3, 2007, if the      Committee on Rules and Administrations grants the requested      extension.       Thank you for your prompt attention to this request,           Sincerely,                                                    Barbara Boxer,                                                         Chairman.                                                      John Cornyn,     Vice Chairman.                          ____________________
