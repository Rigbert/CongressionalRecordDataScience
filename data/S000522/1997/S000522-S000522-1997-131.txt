Mr. Speaker, today two diametrically opposed resolutions will be on the floor, in the next order of business dealing with population control. The Campbell-Greenwood substitute, which is a substitute to a bill or amendment that I am offering along with the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Oberstar], the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde], and the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Barcia], promotes abortion on demand overseas and not family planning.  The Campbell-Greenwood amendment does not add any pro-life conditions to current law. Rather, it blurs the distinction between abortion and family planning in U.S.-supported programs overseas. It allows U.S. dollars to go to the U.N. Population Fund, the UNFPA, even though that organization continues to support China's brutally enforced one-child-per-couple policy, and to nongovernmental organizations that are engaged in a crusade for abortion on demand around the world.  My amendment does not reduce family planning by even one penny. It conditions those funds to those organizations that are all about family planning and not about abortion promotion. I urge a ``no'' vote on the Campbell-Greenwood, a ``yes'' vote on Smith-Barcia-Hyde-Oberstar.                          ____________________
