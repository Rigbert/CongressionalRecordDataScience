Chairman, I make a point of order that section 3006 fails to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI. By addressing funds in all appropriations acts, it implicates funds other than those in the pending bill and therefore constitutes legislation on an appropriations bill in violation of the rule.  I ask the Chair for a ruling on the point of order.
