 President, I wish to congratulate a distinguished Kentuckian and accomplished attorney, Martin Hatfield. Mr. Hatfield recently received the honor of being selected as Pulaski County's ``Attorney of the Year.''  Mr. Hatfield, a native of Nancy, KY, graduated from Nancy High School in 1976. The importance of a good education was instilled in him from a young age by his parents who themselves were educators. There was no question Mr. Hatfield would continue his education after graduating high school, but he was not yet ready to leave home. When the Somerset Community College presented him with a scholarship to play basketball, Mr. Hatfield accepted, allowing him not only to stay close to home, but also to fulfill his dream of playing college basketball.  Upon graduating from SCC, he decided to move on to Eastern Kentucky University. Mr. Hatfield, interested in pursuing a career in Federal law enforcement, began working as a dispatcher and deputy sheriff with the Pulaski County Sherriff's office. Watching the trials sparked his love for the legal side of the justice system and inspired him to apply to law school.  Mr. Hatfield was accepted to the University of Louisville's Brandeis School of Law, from which he graduated in 1981 and returned to Pulaski County. He served as an assistant Commonwealth's attorney for Pulaski and Rockcastle Counties and then went on to serve as assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of Kentucky for 16 years before running for the position of Pulaski County attorney.  In an effort to give back to the community that had given so much to his family throughout his life, Mr. Hatfield ran for county attorney and has held the position since his election in 2010. He now also serves on the boards of many organizations, such as the Somerset-Pulaski County Chamber of Commerce, the Fellowship of Christian Athletes, and the Governor's Kentucky Criminal Justice Council. Recently, he was appointed by Governor Matt Bevin as one of three county attorneys from across Kentucky to serve on the Attorney General's Prosecutors Advisory Council.  This year, Martin Hatfield was chosen as Pulaski County's ``Attorney of the Year,'' and he attributes his success to the support of his family, the education and confidence boost provided to him by SCC, and the dedication of his staff. I want to congratulate Mr. Hatfield for his years of service as an attorney in Pulaski County. I am sure his wife and children are very proud of him, and Kentucky is glad to have benefitted from his work and service.  An area publication, the Commonwealth Journal, recently published an article announcing Mr. Hatfield as county ``Attorney of the Year.'' I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Commonwealth Journal, Sept. 6, 2016] Somerset Community College Alumni Spotlight: Pulaski County Attorney                             Martin Hatfield       Although he now serves his home community in a high-profile      role, Pulaski County Attorney Martin Hatfield wasn't always a      fan of the limelight. In fact, the Nancy native and      basketball stand-out credits his time at Somerset Community      College (SCC) with helping him become more confident in      himself as a student and leader.       Hatfield graduated from Nancy High School in 1976. His      parents, Avery and Lois Hatfield, always encouraged education      in their home.       ``My parents were both educators,'' Hatfield said. ``My      sisters and I saw the value of having a good education      firsthand. High school was seen as a milestone in the      educational process, not the end.''       Given that Hatfield was expected to continue his education      after high school, and had the opportunity to play college      basketball, his decision to attend Somerset Community College      was an easy one, he said.       ``At 17, I wasn't ready to leave home,'' Hatfield said.      ``SCC was part of the University of Kentucky system and had a      basketball team. I was offered a scholarship to play there      and took the opportunity.''       Most of Hatfield's memories and stories about his college      days at SCC revolved around his time on the court.       ``Playing at SCC gave me the opportunity to fulfill a dream      of playing basketball in college,'' said Hatfield, who was      part of the last organized SCC basketball team. ``The      community really pitched in to support the program by feeding      us, giving us a place to practice and play, and by attending      the games.''       After graduating from SCC, Hatfield chose to transfer to      Eastern Kentucky University. He wanted to go into federal law      enforcement, so he paid his dues by working as a dispatcher      and deputy sheriff with the Pulaski County Sheriff's Office      and watching trials. There, he developed a love for the legal      side of the justice system and was later accepted to the      University of Louisville School of Law, now known as the      Brandeis School of Law.       Hatfield graduated from law school in 1981 and came back to      his home county to give back.       ``I chose to come back home,'' Hatfield said. ``I knew I      wanted to marry and have a family someday and that I wanted      to raise my children here in Pulaski County. My wife (Debbie,      a kindergarten teacher at Pulaski Elementary) and I have done      just that. Pulaski County has been very good to my family      throughout the years, which is one reason I ran for County      Attorney . . . to give back to a community that has given so      much to me.''       In addition to his service as County Attorney, a role he      has held since being elected in 2010, Hatfield also serves on      the boards of the Somerset-Pulaski County Chamber of      Commerce, Fellowship of Christian Athletes, Governor's      Kentucky Criminal Justice Council, Kentucky County Attorneys      Association, Somerset Community College Foundation, and is      the Kentucky County Attorney's representative to the Kentucky      Supreme Court Criminal Rules Committee. He was also recently      appointed by Governor Matt Bevin as one of three county      attorneys from across Kentucky to serve on the Attorney      General's Prosecutors Advisory Council. He is a member of      Sievers Lodge #491 and First Baptist Church. Most recently,      Hatfield was recognized as Outstanding County Attorney at the      Kentucky Prosecutors Conference.       Before becoming the Pulaski County Attorney, Hatfield      served as an Assistant U.S. Attorney in the Eastern District      of Kentucky for 16 years. Prior to that, he served as an      Assistant Commonwealth's Attorney for Pulaski and Rockcastle      counties for almost five years.       His path, he said, has been greatly influenced by his      family and education.       ``SCC provided someone like me, who was a little shy and      backward, with the opportunity to not only learn, but to be      comfortable in a new environment,'' Hatfield said.       Hatfield's sisters both attended SCC as well, he said, and      having the opportunity to know everyone from the college      president to his professors to his teammates, made a      difference.       ``I grew so much during my time at SCC,'' Hatfield said.      ``My self-esteem was built through small classes and      professors who took a personal interest in me. When I left      SCC, I knew I could excel in a college environment.''       Today, Hatfield stays connected to the college through his      service on the SCC Foundation board.       ``This is a small community,'' he said. ``We all live here      and are invested in each other. I feel certain the education      I received at SCC played a big role in my success in life and      supporting our local educational opportunities only      strengthens our city and county for the next generation.''       Spending his career in public service, Hatfield said, has      given him the opportunity to help set people up to achieve      and succeed, not fail.       ``It all starts with good raising and good education, and I      was blessed to have both,'' Hatfield said. ``As County      Attorney, one of the things I try to do is to help people      understand what tools they need to change their lives and      become contributing members of their community. I firmly      believe education is one of the major tools necessary to      accomplish that.''                          ____________________
