President, the Senator from New Hampshire is correct that this should not have been done this way and that the Postal Service needs fundamental reform. But the fact is, the Postal Service cannot afford to pay the $5.4 billion that is due on October 1.  The CBO says this provision has no budget impact. So I urge a vote against the Judd Gregg point of order.
