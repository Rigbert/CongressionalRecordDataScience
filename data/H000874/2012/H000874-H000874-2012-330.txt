We ought to pass a $4 trillion to $5 trillion to $6 trillion big deal to get the fiscal house of the United States of America in order. It ought to include all things on the table including Federal employee pay and benefits, including the military pay and benefits and expenditures, and domestic expenditures, as well as entitlements. I've said that. That's what weought to do. We ought not to piecemeal it as this bill reflects.  I hope that we'll support Mr. Van Hollen's bill.
