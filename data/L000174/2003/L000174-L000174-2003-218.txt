President, as colleagues may have gathered, I am not in favor of this piece of legislation, the Class Action Fairness Act. Man, I have heard things. There ought to be a law against misleading labels on legislation we pass because this would break the law. These many injured parties who have valid claims would have no effective way to seek relief. Class action suits have helped win justice and expose wrongdoing by the polluters, the big tobacco companies, and the civil rights violators, and brought about Brown v. Board of Education, as I said earlier. It gives average Americans at least a chance for justice. We should not take that chance for justice away from the American people.  So I hope Senators will consider the harm this bill would do the American people and to their constituents and join me in opposition.  Lastly, Mr. President, as I said, we found time to get highway money for Iraq, but we do not have time to pass the highway bill for America. We had time to get money to improve police departments and law enforcement in Iraq, but we do not have time to pass a bill to do the same here for Americans.  We had time to pass legislation to help military veterans in Iraq, but we can't find time to pass legislation for veterans in the United States.
