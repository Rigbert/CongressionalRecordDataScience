 I ask unanimous consent that the USDA general counsel's response letter dated July 1, 2016, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          United States Department                                               of Agriculture,                                                     July 1, 2016.     Hon. Debbie Stabenow,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition,          and Forestry, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Stabenow, Thank you for your letter of June      29, 2016, inquiring as to the scope and applicability of the      GMO labeling legislation currently pending before the U.S.      Senate. The United States Department of Agriculture, as the      lead implementing agency, has carefully studied this      legislation from legal, program policy, and scientific      aspects. I will respond in turn below to the questions raised      in your letter.       (1) Please explain whether the GMO Labeling Law provides      authority to the USDA to require labeling of food products      that contain widely used commodity crops, like corn,      soybeans, sugar, and canola, which have been genetically      modified, as defined by Section 291(1)?       Section 291(1) of the Senate bill provides authority to      include food in the national disclosure program, including      all of the commercially grown GMO corn, soybeans, sugar, and      canola crops used in food today and reviewed and approved by      USDA's Biotechnology Regulatory Service.       (2) Please explain whether the GMO Labeling Law provides      authority to the USDA to require labeling of food products      that contain genetically modified material, which result from      gene editing techniques?       Section 291(1) of the Senate bill provides authority to      include food in the national disclosure program, including      products of certain gene editing techniques. This would      include novel gene editing techniques such as CRISPR when      they are used to produce plants or seeds with traits that      could not be created with conventional breeding techniques.      In addition, the definition provides authority to include      RNAi techniques that have been used on products such as the      non-browning apple and potato.       (3) Please explain whether the GMO Labeling Law provides      authority to the USDA to require labeling of food products,      which may or may not contain highly refined oils, sugars, or      high fructose corn syrup that have been produced or developed      from genetic modification techniques, as defined by Section      291(1)?       Section 291(1) of the Senate bill provides authority to      include food in the national disclosure program, including      products which may or may not contain highly refined oils,      sugars, or high fructose corn syrup that have been produced      or developed from genetic modification techniques. As a      practical matter of implementation, the Department would look      not only at the definition in Section 291(1) regarding the      genetically modified crops used to produce the refined or      extracted materials, but also consider authority provided      under Section 293(b)(2)(B) and Section 293(b)(2)(C) with      respect to the amount of a bioengineered substance present      and other factors and considerations which might deem the      product to be considered bioengineered food.       If needed, my team and our USDA programmatic and scientific      experts are available to discuss any aspects of the      legislation in greater detail at your request. Please do not      hesitate to reach out.           Sincerely,                                                Jeffrey M. Prieto,     General Counsel.                          ____________________
