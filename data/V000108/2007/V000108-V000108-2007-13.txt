Chairman, I would simply make the observation that for collectively the decisions made for congressional changes in the administration's request represent about 1 percent of the total funding for the Department of Energy in this bill, and they were very thoughtfully made. And whether they be, in this instance, in Dubuque, Iowa, or any other community around the United States, it is certainly the committee's position and belief that those investments are urged for the greater good of everyone living in this country, and that is certainly to the advantage of every taxpayer in the United States of America.
