 President, I want to express what I know each of my colleagues feels today. We, the 100 men and women of the U.S. Senate, send our sincere condolences to the people of France. From across the Atlantic, Americans send condolences to the victims, to the families, and to the first responders.  We understand the pain and the loss that accompany a terrorist attack. Some feel it in the most personal way. Some never come home. But everyone shares in the loss. In our case, many shared in the response and the recovery as well.  In a dark hour we were reminded of the things that bound us together. I hope you will feel something similar take hold in your terrible hour as well.  We have already seen rays of light begin to shine through the darkness. We saw it even last Friday. Then, as Paris reeled, a soft hum emanated from a tunnel. ``March,'' came the echo in French. ``March on.'' Enemies in history and rivals on the soccer pitch had united around a common humanity. Dazed, disoriented but alive, French and German fans marched through the tunnels together. Some put defiance to verse. ``Against us,'' they sang, ``tyranny has unfurled its bloody banner.'' And indeed, that night it had. A song sung so many times before came alive with new meaning that horrible night. Many knew it as the French national anthem, but that night it became an aria for their sorrow and an ode to their fraternity. We heard it here, from an ocean away.  We add our voices to the harmony now. We know that the attacks were not just directed at the victims we mourn today but also at modernity and the free world.  President Obama has called ISIL the face of evil. It clearly presents a challenge to NATO, to our moderate Sunni allies, and to the United States. It has also shown that it can attack innocent victims in the West, too--right where they live. These terrorists have declared their intention to do so again and again.  We know that trying to contain ISIL's conventional advance as an operational concept has proven insufficient in the face of determined terrorist attacks, but we also know something else. With resolve and determination, ISIL can be defeated. It won't be easy. It won't come quickly or without cost, but we also have no other option.  I look forward to engaging with President Obama to determine his strategy and the tools that will be necessary to achieve it. We are looking forward to hearing the President's proposed strategy when Senators are briefed by the White House later this week. Whatever he does, though, I would encourage him to work cooperatively with both parties on the way forward. This is a challenge that is going to require all of our efforts to confront, and it is a discussion that will be ongoing.  But today is a time to remember and to reflect. We have the people of France in our thoughts today. That is true here in the Senate, and it is certainly true out across our country.                          ____________________
