 Chairman, I wanted to say a brief word to set the record straight. The gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Goodling] a few moments ago was critical of the statement of the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Gephardt] talking about trickle-down tax breaks. I think we should set the record straight, not to deter from the debate.  Mr. Chairman, half of the tax breaks in the Republican proposal will go to people earning $100,000 a year or more. A quarter of the tax breaks go to people making $200,000 a year or more. The upper income 1 percent get more tax breaks than do the bottom 60 percent.  Recently, the Republicans have proposed a $23 billion cutback on the earned income tax credit, which hits the working poor and at the same time, several months ago, proposed to eliminate the corporate minimum tax, so that the largest corporations in America will pay nothing in taxes.  Mr. Chairman, it sounds to me like the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Gephardt] was right and this is a trickle-down tax break.
