President, I rise today to introduce legislation requiring parental consent for intrusive physical exams administered under the Head Start program.  Young children attending Head Start programs should not be subjected to these intrusive physical exams without the prior knowledge or consent of their parents. While the Department of Health and Human Services has administered general exam guidelines to agencies, the U.S. Code is not clear about prohibiting them without parental consent. To clarify the code, my bill will not allow any nonemergency intrusive exam by a Head Start agency without parental consent. This would not include exams such as hearing, vision or scoliosis screenings.  This issue was brought to my attention by some of my constituents from Tulsa, OK who felt their rights were violated when their children were subjected to genital exams and blood tests without their consent. I am pleased to see that the Rutherford Institute has taken an interest in this crucial issue and are representing my constituents.  As a father and grandfather, I believe it is vital for parents to be informed about what is happening to their children in the classroom. I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this important bill.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the following article be printed in the Record, ``Federal Head Start suit pending.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    Federal Head Start Suit Pending       A lawsuit against Tulsa's Head Start program alleging a      violation of the constitutional rights of preschool children      remains pending in the U.S. District Court.       The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated the      lawsuit in July 2003 saying the program appears to have      ``directly violated'' their rights by subjecting children to      genital exams and blood tests without their parents' consent.       The appellate decision reversed a 2001 decision by U.S.      District Judge Terence Kern in Tulsa in favor of the      Community Action Project.       The lawsuit arose as a result of exams of Head Start boys      and girls at Roosevelt Elementary School on Nov. 5, 1998. The      appellate judges said a registered nurse, who was a CAP      employee, insisted on the exams over the objection of a      parent, who was also a CAP aide.       The appeals court also reinstated claims for invasion of      privacy and ``technical battery'' under Oklahoma law, and      claims against CAP for allegedly interfering with the      parents' ``constitutional right to direct and control the      medical treatment of their children.''       The parents are represented by Steven Aden, chief litigator      for the Virginia-based Rutherford Institute, a conservative      legal foundation that focuses on religious rights, parental      rights and freedom from government intrusion.                                 ______                                          By
