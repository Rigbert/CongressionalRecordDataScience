Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my good friend for yielding time to me and especially thank him for his leadership.  Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the Chrysler-Berman-Brownback amendment, which will help keep the focus where it belongs, on the real danger of illegal immigration, not on orderly legal immigration by close relatives of U.S. citizens. I am particularly troubled by the provision in the current bill that would cut off eligibility for so-called adult children unless they meet a series of new tests, including economic dependency. Ironically, supporters justify these restrictions by suggesting that we somehow protect nuclear families by excluding other relatives. Most Americans I think would be surprised, perhaps shocked comes closer to describe it, to know that if their 21-year-old daughter or son gets a job, he or she is no longer a member of your nuclear family and can never live with you again.  The present language in the bill also virtually eliminates the Attorney General's power to use the humanitarian parole to deal with compelling cases at the margins of our immigration laws. Most congressional offices have had to deal with cases in which an American family has adopted an orphan overseas or wishes to sponsor a relative for a sick family, only to run up against a brick wall. Humanitarian parole is gone.  Mr. Chairman, I urge support for the Chrysler amendment.
