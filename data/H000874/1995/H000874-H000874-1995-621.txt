Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise as one who supported the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. It was the constitutional amendment that did not require, however, an extraordinary majority to pay for what we buy, unlike spending.  The gentleman from Illinois rose and said that he was elected and he thought the American public had responded to a fundamental issue that this body had been fiscally irresponsible. I believe that many voters have been misled to come to that conclusion, and I think it is a fundamental misunderstanding of the facts of the last 14 years in which, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania pointed out, we quadrupled the national debt.  We did so because the President of the United States wanted to buy his priorities, and the Congress of the United States wanted to buy its priorities. And neither the President nor the Congress made choices to bring within revenues its spending objectives.  The gentleman from Illinois again posited that we were here because of congressional irresponsibility and that this rescission bill obviously was a response to that.  It is important for us to remember that for the past 20 years Presidents have asked for $72 billion in rescissions. This Congress over the last 20 years has rescinded $92 billion, more than the Presidents have asked.  So I suggest to the gentleman from Illinois, to the Congress, and to the American public, in fact this Congress [[Page H1184]] has been willing to do more than Presidents have asked in terms of rescissions.  Now, rescissions are just another way of line-item vetoes, but it does not carry the muscle, which is what the gentleman wants to add.                              {time}  1330  But his facts do not support it, or at least the facts do not support it.  I want to say also to my friend from New York, who is a very good friend of mine, we agree on much, disagree on some. He wants to move this bill along quickly. I respectfully suggest to him, this bill is not a birthday present. My friend from California referenced that. This is a very fundamental proposition that this Congress is considering.  The minority for the last 40 years in this House is now the majority, but I suggest to them they have not come to grips with majority rule because they, for two previous occasions in their rule on tax increases and on their constitutional amendment, suggest that it ought to be the minority, not the majority, that controls.  And this is the third time that they have proposed that the majority should not rule. That is unfortunate, in a country, as the gentleman from California so eloquently stated, that is the beacon for majorities throughout this world.  Katherin Drinker Bowen wrote of the miracle in Philadelphia in 1787, when the Founding Fathers came together and, like us, had differences. And I am sure that they had great suspicions of what the people might do. In fact, the U.S. Senate was juxtapositioned to the House of Representatives to try to leaven what the people's House might do in fits of passion.  But the fact of the matter is, the Stenholm-Spratt-Wise amendment responds to the concerns of the American public.  What were they? To some degree the gentleman is right. They believed that somehow we were out of control in terms of pork barrel projects. In fact, pork barrel projects are a relatively small portion of the budget, as any fair analysis of the budget will show. But they were concerned about that.  I remember the Lawrence Welk house, the birthplace of Lawrence Welk. Somebody had put in $500,000 to rehabilitate that house and set it aside as a national landmark. Most of us did not know it was in the bill. The American public found out about it and were outraged. We took it out.  I suggest to my colleagues, that is the reason that the line-item veto got a life.
