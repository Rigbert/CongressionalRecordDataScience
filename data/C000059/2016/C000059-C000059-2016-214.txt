Speaker, I rise today in proud recognition of the 100th Anniversary of Riverside City College as well as the 25th Anniversary of both Moreno Valley College and Norco College. I have had the honor of representing these world-class community colleges for the majority of my term in Congress and am proud to commemorate today's milestones.  Riverside Junior College was founded on this date in 1916, becoming California's seventh community college. In 1964, voters approved the creation of the Riverside Community College District and elected its five member Board. The Board took on an ambitious effort to expand the college in an effort to meet the needs of a fast-growing student body. In 1991, the Riverside Community College District worked with local and state officials to open new campuses in Moreno Valley and Norco. These campuses opened new doors to educational achievement for students across the Inland Empire.  In 2010, each of the District's three campuses were officially recognized as separate colleges, making Moreno Valley College and Norco College the 111th and 112th community colleges in our state. Together, the three colleges make up the Riverside Community College District.  Serving upwards of 50,000 students annually, Riverside Community College District is by far the largest educational institution in the Inland Empire. It has educational centers throughout the region, including the Ben Clark Training Center, the Center for Social Justice and Civil Liberties, the Innovative Learning Center, Rubidoux Annex, and the Culinary Academy. The District awards nearly $600,000 in scholarships to students each year and its hundreds of thousands of graduates have made significant contributions in science, business, art, education, politics, and medicine.  Supported by the four pillars of--student excellence; academic excellence; community excellence; and workforce excellence, the District and colleges advance our region's economic growth through quality career technical training and services. Their strong focus on continuous workforce development, business attraction, retention and development have helped bring our community through tough recessions and now leave us better prepared for the economy of tomorrow.  Congratulations Riverside City College, Moreno Valley College, and Norco College. It has been my great pleasure to represent you, your faculty and staff, and especially your students. You make the Inland Empire proud.                          ____________________
