 President, let me say to my friend, the majority leader, this is a good example of bipartisanship. I think we have come up with a proposal and achieved a goal that both sides wanted to achieve, which is to get a doctor fix for at least a 6-month period of time. Also, it is paid for. So we have done it without adding to the deficit, and I think that is something both sides can feel good about.
