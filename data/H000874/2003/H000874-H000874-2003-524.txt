Majority Leader, could you advise the House of when your expectation is that the medical malpractice legislation would be coming to the floor?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would continue to yield, I appreciate the gentleman asking. My understanding is that the Committee on the Judiciary and the Committee on Energy and Commerce have tentative plans to mark up the medical liability bills sponsored by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Greenwood) sometime next week. Once that bill is reported by the two committees, I would expect quick action in this House. I would also note that the Committee on Energy and Commerce and the Committee on Ways and Means have held mark-ups of legislation dealing with medical errors. I would expect legislation dealing with medical errors to be considered soon by the House as well, probably in the same week as the medical liability bill.
