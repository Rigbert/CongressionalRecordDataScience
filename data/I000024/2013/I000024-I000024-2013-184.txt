And I would say, if we could pull out maybe 3 or 4 amendments of all the 200 or 300 amendments, this would have to be one that most people would consider to be a very significant amendment.  With that, I would only mention one other thing. I am not going to bring this up, but I do have an amendment--amendment No. 282. A lot of people in States such as Alabama and Oklahoma recognize that our banks were not the problem. We didn't have problems in my State of Oklahoma. So when we talked about State banks and community banks, we were in a position to take care of our own needs and we should not be a part of it. So this amendment--and then I will close--merely says we are going to come forth with legislation. We are going to draw a distinction, not just on Dodd-Frank and that type of legislation, but between community and State banks and Federal banks.
