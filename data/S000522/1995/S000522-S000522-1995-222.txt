Mr. Speaker, 39 years ago yesterday, Hungarian students demanding reforms and democratization demonstrated in Budapest, touching off what has become known as the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. The 2 weeks that followed witnessed events that were truly incredible given the context of the times: following the initial demonstrations, Soviet troops and tanks entered Budapest; hundreds of peaceful marchers were killed at Parliament Square in Budapest; fighting spread across the country; a new Hungarian Government was formed and negotiations for Soviet troop withdrawals were begun; revolutionary workers' councils and local national committees rose to prominence and attention was given to political and economic demands, including calls for free elections, free speech, press, assembly, and worship. Hungary announced its withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact and proclaimed itself neutral. In early November, Soviet forces attacked Budapest and took over strategic locations across Hungary. By mid-November, any hope of advancement was crushed by the ruthless Soviet military assault. Mr. Speaker, the short lived, but courageous struggle against communism and Soviet domination so brutally quelled by Soviet tanks vividly illustrated to the entire world the realities and intentions of Soviet imperialism and totalitarianism.  The West offered no effective response, Mr. Speaker, and the bloody suppression of the Hungarian freedom fighters seemingly underscored the status quo of Soviet power and might. This led to a feeling of impotence in the West. The 1956 Revolution was, of course, a testament to the fortitude, heroism, and commitment to freedom of the Hungarian people. One could note that the uprising also signified the beginning of the end of Soviet rule. The famous Yugoslav dissident, Milovan Djilas, writing very shortly after the uprising, characterized the revolution in Hungary as ``the beginning of the end of communism generally,'' and observed that ``* * * the Hungarian fighters for freedom, struggling for their existence and country, may not have foreseen what an epochal deed they had initiated.''  Innocent lives were lost, hopes were dashed, much of the potential of the States under Soviet dominance was never allowed to blossom, and almost two generations knew nothing of basic freedoms. But, Mr. Speaker, as later events showed, Djilas proved to be prescient in his analysis. The Hungarian Revolution began to expose, Mr. Speaker, the ultimate futility of communism and the inherent weakness of the Soviet Union. Henry Kissinger, in his 1994 book ``Diplomacy,'' notes that: ``A generation later, latent Soviet weakness would cast the Hungarian uprising as a harbinger of the ultimate bankruptcy of the communist system.'' Mr. Speaker, perhaps this was the most important legacy of the Hungarian uprising, attesting that the blood shed by the Hungarian people in 1956 ultimately was not in vain.                          ____________________
