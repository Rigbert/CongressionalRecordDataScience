 Residential Opportunities was incorporated in December of 1977 to address growing concerns regarding the lack of a standard of care for developmentally disabled adults. Based on the principle of normalization, Residential Opportunities began establishing group homes in an effort to combine an independent living experience with a high standard of care. Since that time, ROI has expanded their programs, and this year alone has improved the quality of life for 648 people.  Today, Residential Opportunities operates Homestead Housing Service, which helps find safe, affordable housing; Stone Cottage, a 24-hour residential and support center for military veterans; and Home Health Aide, which provides in-home support to developmentally disabled children. In addition to these endeavors, ROI operates 21 group homes that currently serve 148 of Southwest Michigan's most vulnerable adults.  I would like to extend my sincere gratitude to the staff and caregivers of Residential Opportunities Incorporated, whose compassion, dedication, and strength has brightened the lives of so many. I am confident that the 30 years of good works provided by ROI is just the tip of the iceberg, and we can expect many more years of exceptional care and service to come.                          ____________________
