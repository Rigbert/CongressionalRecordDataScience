 President, as we debate the priorities for spending in the federal budget for the next fiscal year, I am pleased to have voted yesterday for the Bingaman education amendment. Unfortunately, the Senate tabled this amendment yesterday by a 54 to 46 vote. This amendment begins to address some of the critical needs of our schools. But more importantly, it says, ``We think education is important. We think education is a priority. We think education should be nourished, not starved.''  This amendment adds important resources in several ways:  It supports the $4.5 billion or 12.6 percent increase for education that the President proposed for FY 2001 over the previous year.  It adds $1 billion for Title I, the program that helps school districts educate disadvantaged students. If Congress follows through with FY 2001 appropriations, this would bring total Title I funding next year to $9.9 billion, up from $8.5 billion in FY 2000.  It adds $2 billion to train new teachers and current teachers.  It provides $1.75 billion to continue to reduce class sizes in the early grades.  It increases funds for afterschool programs to give students extra help.  It provides $1.3 billion to repair schools in high-need areas.  It adds $1 billion for special education, programs to help disabled students.  It raises the maximum Pell Grant, aid for needy college students, from $3,500 to $3,700.  This amendment is timely because the federal share of elementary and secondary education has declined from 14 percent in 1980 to 6 percent in 1999-2000. Hopefully, this amendment will begin to reverse that decline.  The schools in my state face huge challenges--low test scores, crowded classrooms, teacher shortages, growing enrollments, decrepit buildings. In short, they are overwhelmed.  California has 5.8 million students, more students in school than 36 states have in total population and one of the highest projected enrollments in the country.  California will need 300,000 new teachers by 2010. Eleven percent or 30,000 of our 285,000 teachers are on emergency credentials.  California has 40 percent of the nation's immigrants; we have 50 languages in some schools. Children from these families need special attention, not just in English language learning but in dealing with huge adjustments of learning to live in a new country.  California's students lag behind students from other states. Only about 40 to 45 percent of the state's students score at or above the national median, on the Stanford 9 reading and math tests.  For school construction, modernization and deferred maintenance, California needs $21 billion by 2003 or 7 new classrooms per day. Two million California children go to school today in 86,000 portable classrooms.  California's Head Start programs serve only 13 percent of eligible children.  For higher education, the University of California has the most diverse student body in the US. Federal programs provide nearly 55 percent of all student financial aid funding that UC students received. Our colleges and universities are facing ``Tidal Wave II,'' the demographic bulge created by children of the baby boomers who will inundate California's colleges and universities between 2000 and 2010 because the number of high school graduates will jump 30 percent.  California's schools are in crisis. The needs of my state are huge.  While these needs cry out for resources, the federal government is contributing only 6 percent of total education funding. Funds are so short in my state that California teachers are spending around $1,000 a year out of their own pockets to pay for books, magic markers, scissors and other school supplies, according to the San Diego Tribune, August 16, 1999.  Why should we be increasing funds for education? Let me answer that question by giving you an example of the state of our schools, as expressed by a young student. I would like to read a letter from Hannah Wair, a 14-year-old from Santa Rosa, California, who graphically describes her school:                                               Santa Rosa, CA,                                                December 13, 1999.     Diane Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Ms. Feinstein: My name is Hannah Wair, and I am 14      years old and I attend Rincon Valley Middle School in      California. I am writing you this letter because I am      concerned about the amount of money that is given to the      Santa Rosa City Schools. It seems as though far too many kids      attend these schools without enough supplies, computers,      books, and sports equipment. On top of that, most of the      schools (with an exception of a few new ones) are in need of      extreme repairs. Many schools have trashy, dirty, bathrooms      and locker rooms that have not been repaired or updated in      about 20 years. The fields and tracks are invaded with weeds      and rocks, and there have been many injuries because of this.      Many of the classes are over-populated, with an average of 30      or 35 students per class. This gives the students less      attention, which makes it harder to learn.       Although there are many aspects that need to be improved      about our schools, they are all still great schools, and I'm      sure that you could change all of this in only a matter of      time. Thank you so very much for your time. I hope to hear      from you soon!           Sincerely,                                                      Hannah Wair.  The Clinton-Gore Administration has proposed to increase education funding in FY 2001 by 12.6 percent, to $40.1 billion. Yet the budget before us does not add, it cuts the President's education request by $4.7 billion. I submit, Mr. Chairman, that this is no time to be cutting education:  American students lag behind their international counterparts in many ways. American twelfth grade math students were outperformed by students from 21 other countries, scoring higher than students from only two countries, Cyprus and South Africa.  Three-quarters of our school children cannot compose a well-organized, coherent essay, says the National Assessment Governing Board in September.  U.S. eighth graders score below the international average of 41 other countries in math. U.S. twelfth graders score among the lowest of 21 countries in both math and science general knowledge.  Three-quarters of employers say that recent high school graduates do not have the skills they need to succeed on the job. Forty-six percent of college professors say entering students do not have the skills to succeed in college, according to a February Public Agenda poll.  These statistics speak for themselves. Our schools are failing many of our youngsters. It is not the students' fault. It is our fault. We need to be nourishing education, not starving it, especially at a time of budget surpluses when the needs of our children are so stark.  I am especially pleased that this amendment increases funds for Title I, adding $1 billion to the program.  Title I provides grants to help disadvantaged children, grants designed by Congress in 1965 to provide supplementary services to low-achieving children in areas with high concentrations of poverty. Title I reaches virtually every school district and is very important in my state. Schools serving disadvantaged populations of students receive fewer resources than other schools, according to the Public Policy Institute of California in a new report.  With 18 percent of the country's Title I students, California only receives 11.4 percent of Title I funds. At least, 775,000 eligible Title I students are not getting services in my state.  It is my hope that when Congress takes up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization and the FY 2001 appropriations bill, we will rectify the long-standing inequities in the funding formula to give fast-growing states like mine their fair share of Title I and other funds.  In 1994, Congress included in the Title I law a requirement to annually update the number of poor children so that the allocation of funds would truly reflect the most up-to-date number of poor children. This is a very important provision to growing states like mine. However, despite my opposition, a ``hold harmless'' provision has been included in annual appropriations bills, effectively overriding the census update requirement and locking in historic funding amounts for states despite the change in the number of poor children.  As Secretary of Education Riley said last year, ``a basic principle in targeting should be to drive funds to where the poor children are, not to where they were a decade ago.'' While today's amendment includes an assumption that Title I would go up $1 billion and does not address the ``hold harmless'' one way or another, I want to make it clear that a ``hold harmless'' should not be part of our final funding bill.  I am also pleased that the amendment adds $2 billion for teacher training. What are the needs? For starters, my state has 30,000 teachers on emergency credentials. That is 11 percent of our 285,000 teachers. We have high teacher turnover. We face a severe teacher shortage. California will need 300,000 new teachers by 2010.  Not only do we face a serious teacher shortage, we need to beef up training of current teachers in order to improve student learning. There is no substitute for a good teacher. A good teacher can make a lifetime of difference in a student, especially a struggling or low-performing student. Teacher quality has more impact on student achievement than any other single factor, including family income and parent education, according to a Texas study by Ronald Ferguson of Harvard University. Studies show that the teacher's qualifications account for more than 90 percent of the variation in student achievement in reading and math.  Another disturbing statistic in my state is this: In California, the lowest-scoring students are five times more likely than high-scoring children to be placed in a classroom with under qualified teachers, concluded a study by the Center for the Future of Teaching and Learning last December. ``More than a million children in California go to school where they have particularly high concentrations of teachers who are under prepared to teach them,'' the study said. Similarly, the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future noted,       In the nation's poorest schools, where hiring is most lax      and teacher turnover is constant, the results are disastrous.      Thousands of children are taught throughout their school      careers by a parade of teachers without preparation in the      fields they teach, inexperienced beginners with little      preparation and no mentoring, and short-term substitutes      trying to cope with constant staff disruptions. It is more      surprising that some of these children manage to learn than      that so many fail to do so.  Without strong teachers, our children suffer. We must enhance teacher training.  The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future found that teacher training has suffered for years saying it has been ``historically thin, uneven and poorly financed.'' That commission has called for strengthening teacher training requirements and better rewarding teaching knowledge and skill.  I welcome the additional funds in this amendment to train more teachers and to strengthen teacher training.  This debate today is not just about raw numbers, this increase or that decrease. This debate is about the future of our nation. We must ask some fundamental questions about our spending priorities. Why it is important to increase spending on education? Here are some reasons:  The economy of my state is transitioning from manufacturing toward a more higher-skilled, service and technology jobs. Since 1980, jobs in the ``new economy'' (services and trade) have jumped nearly 60 percent.  Over the next 10 years, nationally, computer systems analyst jobs will grow by 94 percent; computer support specialists, by 102 percent; computer engineers, 108 percent. Jobs for the non-college educated are stagnating.  High tech employers say they cannot find qualified people. They plead for Congress to expand visas to bring in employees from abroad.  Low literacy levels are powerful predictors of welfare dependency and incarceration. More than half the adult prison population has literacy levels below those required by the labor market.  Near 40 percent of adjudicated juvenile delinquents have treatable learning disabilities that went untreated in school.  Seventeen years ago, the nation's attention was jolted by a report titled A Nation at Risk. In April 1983, the Reagan Administration's Education Secretary, Terrell Bell, told the nation that we faced a fundamental crisis in the quality of American elementary and secondary education. The report said:       Our nation is at risk. If an unfriendly foreign power had      attempted to impose on America the mediocre educational      performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it      as an act of war.  The report cited declines in student achievement and called for strengthening graduation requirements, teacher preparation and establishing standards and accountability.  Today, we still face mediocrity in our schools. While there are always exceptions and clearly there are many excellent teachers and many outstanding schools, we can do better. To those who say we cannot afford to spend more money on education, I say we cannot afford to fail our children. Our children do not choose to be illiterate or uneducated. It is our responsibility and we must face up to it.  I urge adoption of the education amendment.
