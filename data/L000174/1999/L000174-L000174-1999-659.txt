President, my friend from Utah attacked the motion picturetheater industry yesterday for not enforcing their voluntary rating system. Though no system, voluntary or mandatory, can every be perfect, the fact is that the exhibition industry is doing an increasingly better job enforcing those movie ratings.  The National Association of Theater Owners, the industry trade association, and its members have made ratings enforcement a top priority. The association has developed a videotape training series on the ratings and their enforcement for theater managers and employees.  It has distributed hundreds of thousands of brochures through theaters to the public which explains the rating system.  It has published weekly bulletins to its members and newspapers on new ratings.  It has published educational articles for its members, and it has held industry-wide meetings twice a year in which code enforcement is emphasized.  Recently, the Motion Picture Association and the National Association of Theater Owners began developing slide presentations for display during intermissions about the ratings.  The motion picture theater industry may be the only industry in the country which voluntarily turns down millions of dollars in ticket sales to enforce a voluntary rating system. We should all encourage the industry to do more. But in our rush to judgement, let us remember to consider the facts.
