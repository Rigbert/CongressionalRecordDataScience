 President, I would only add, briefly, that Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby are on the floor. I would encourage them to continue to do what they have been doing, which is to try to reach an agreement.  The only place where I would disagree with my good friend, the majority leader, is I think it does make a difference which bill we turn to. Hopefully, the bill we turn to will not be a bill that came out of the committee on a party-line vote but, rather, a bill negotiated on a bipartisan basis by those who know the most about the subject: Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby, and the members of their committee.  It is still my hope we will be able to go forward on a bipartisan basis, and I look forward to hearing from Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby about the progress they make.  I yield the floor.
