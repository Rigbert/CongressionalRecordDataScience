Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. William ``Bill'' Densmore is one of these individuals. On January 12, 2008 he will be honored at a retirement dinner.  Bill was born October 17, 1945 in Turlock, California and he was raised in the small town of Newman, California with a population of 2,500. He graduated from the prestigious University of California, Berkeley in 1967. Bill also attended Hastings College of the Law from 1967 to 1969. Bill served his country honorably in the United States Coast Guard from 1969 to 1973. In 1973, he was employed by the Riverside County Department of Veteranswhere he is now retiring from after 34 years of excellent service. He became Director of the Department in 1989.  Bill has achieved many successes during his time as Director--not only for the Riverside County Department of Veterans but for the entire community of Riverside. He founded the Interagency Coalition on Homeless Veterans and hosted ten annual Homeless Veterans Care Fairs to publicize the plight of homelessness. Bill remains active as an advocate for homeless veterans, serving on the City's Homeless Task Force, the FEMA Local Board, and advocating with the JPA at March Air Force Base for a permanent facility for U.S. vets, and homeless veterans service provider. Bill also founded the Riverside National Cemetery's (RNC) Memorial Honor Detail, an all-volunteer organization providing military honors for veteran burials at RNC. Bill founded Vets Express, a free transportation service for veterans traveling from Blythe and the Coachella Valley to the VA Medical Center in Loma Linda. He worked to name a stretch of I-10 the Veterans' Memorial Freeway and successfully advocated for the placement of three VA Outpatient Clinics in Riverside County. Bill also founded the Annual Salute to Veterans' Parade in the City of Riverside.  Bill has worked on several memorials and monuments task forces, including the Villegas Memorial, the Riverside County Wall of Honor, the Riverside County Veterans' Memorial, and the monuments and memorials at the Riverside National Cemetery. As a member of the Veterans' Advisory Committee, he instituted the annual David Goldware Friend of the Veteran Award, the Legislative Breakfast series, and regular county-wide veterans' benefits workshops. Bill has advocated for and staged events at RNC as a way of introducing RNC to more Inland Empire residents.  Bill has also served on the GoRiverside Committee to promote the use of public transportation and he conducted the first county and state veterans' needs surveys, published the results with the help of the San Bernardino Veteran Service Officer, and distributed the surveys statewide to elected officials and veterans advocates and leaders. Bill continues to serve on the Evergreen Memorial Cemetery Committee to assist in restoration of this historic landmark in the city of Riverside and has served two four-year terms on the city of Riverside's Planning Commission.  Bill Densmore's tireless passion for veterans and community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. Bill has been the heart and soul of our veterans community events and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
