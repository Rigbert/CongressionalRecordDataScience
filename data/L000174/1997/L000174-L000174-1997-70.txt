President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my bill to preserve State and local authority to regulate the placement, construction, and modification of telecommunication facilities be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1350       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.       (a) Findings.--Congress make the following findings:       (1) The placement of commercial telecommunications, radio,      or television towers near homes can greatly reduce the value      of such homes, destroy the views from such homes, and reduce      substantially the desire to live in such homes.       (2) States and localities should be able to exercise      control over the construction and location of such towers      through the use of zoning, planned growth, and other controls      relating to the protection of the environment and public      safety.       (3) There are alternatives to the construction of      additional telecommunications towers to meet      telecommunications needs, including the co-location of      antennae on existing towers and the use of alternative      technologies.       (4) On August 19, 1997, the Federal Communications      Commission issued a proposed rule, MM Docket No. 97-182,      which would preempt the application of State and local zoning      and land use ordinances regarding the placement of      telecommunications towers. It is in the interest of the      Nation that the Commission not adopt this rule.       (5) It is in the interest of the Nation that the second      memorandum opinion and order and notice of proposed rule      making of the Commission with respect to application of such      ordinances to the placement of such towers, WT Docket No. 97-     192, ET Docket No. 93-62, and RM-8577, be modified in order      to permit State and local governments to exercise their      zoning and land use authorities, and their power to protect      public health and safety, to regulate the placement of      telecommunications towers and to place the burden of proof in      civil actions relating to the placement of such towers on the      person or entity that seeks to place, construct, or modify      such towers.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:       (1) To repeal the limitations on the exercise of State and      local authorities regarding the placement, construction, and      modification of personal wireless service facilities that      arise under section 332(c)(7) of the Communications Act of      1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)).       (2) To permit State and local governments to regulate the      placement, construction, and modification of such facilities      on the basis of the environmental effects of the operation of      such facilities.       (3) To prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from      adopting rules which would preempt State and local regulation      of the placement of such facilities.     SEC. 2. STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITY OVER PLACEMENT,                    CONSTRUCTION, AND MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN                    TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES.       (a) Repeal of Limitations.--Section 332(c)(7)(B) of the      Communications Act of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 332(c)(7)(B)) is      amended--       (1) in clause (i), by striking ``thereof--'' and all that      follows through the end and inserting ``thereof shall not      unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally      equivalent services.'';       (2) by striking clause (iv);       (3) by redesignating clause (v) as clause (iv); and       (4) in clause (iv), as so redesignated, by striking the      third sentence and inserting the following: ``In any such      action in which a person seeking to place, construct, or      modify a tower facility is a party, such person shall bear      the burden of proof.''.       (b) Prohibition on Adoption of Rule.--Notwithstanding any      other provision of law, the Federal Communications Commission      may not adopt as a final rule the proposed rule set forth in      ``Preemption of State and Local Zoning and Land Use      Restrictions on Siting, Placement and Construction of      Broadcast Station Transmission Facilities'', MM Docket No.      97-182, released August 19, 1997.
