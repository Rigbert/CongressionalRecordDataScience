 Zafra M. Lerman is no ordinary science teacher, and she has led no ordinary life. Born in Israel just before the second World War began, the young Zafra found high school chemistry a bore. It wasn't until she was a soldier in the Israeli Army and taking evening classes that she discovered her aptitude--and love--for the subject. Zafra went on to earn a doctorate in chemistry from Israel's renowned Weizmann Institute of Science and then did post-doctoral research at Cornell University in New York.  As remarkable as these achievements are, they are really only the beginning of a career that--though certainly filled with personal accolades--is most notable for the success of those she has guided. ``Equal access to science education is a right that belongs to all,'' she says, and she has lived by that axiom both professionally and personally. As a professor, scientist and friend, Zafra has been a mentor first and a chemistry teacher second.  In 1977, Zafra Lerman became the very first professor of science at Columbia College in Chicago, a liberal arts college that at the time didn't even have a single science course. Her first course, Chemistry in Daily Life, was filled with artists and writers and historians who hadn't the first thought of majoring in science. One day near the beginning of the school year, Zafra took a group of students to a pub atthe Congress Hotel, across the street from the college. There, she realized she could connect the unfamiliar scientific world to a world the students knew well. The alcohol in the drinks and the acid in the salad dressing became links between science and experience that brought meaning to molecules and bonds and chemical reactions.  And so began an innovative curriculum that has been as successful as it is unconventional. What began as a new way to look at science has grown into a new way of bringing the power and wonder of the subject to those who for whom learning has all too often been an unrealized privilege rather than the right Zafra Lerman believes it to be. Over the past two decades, Zafra has made it her mission to ensure that all students, regardless of their background, can experience science in a meaningful way. She has encouraged her students to explore chemistry through music and dance rather than forcing them to work behind a lab bench and has helped them learn the abstract material on their own terms.  Each week, students from the Chicago Public Schools board busses and travel to Columbia College to experience science the Lerman way. During the summer, Zafra leads a month-long ``science boot camp'' where teachers learn for themselves how to unite the realm of science with the universe of a teenager in Chicago. Over the years, more than 16,000 youths on the southwest side of Chicago have found the potential in science education and--thanks to Mother Zafra, as they call her--have for the first time seen high school as a beginning to their education rather than an end.  Zafra Lerman's work doesn't end at the shore of Lake Michigan. In addition to her devotion to the students of Chicago, she has long been a champion of international human rights. She has traveled extensively overseas--often to the most dangerous corners of the world--to help address the plight of dissident scientists in China, Russia and Belarus. She even learned the Russian language so she could converse directly with Andrei Sakharov instead of relying on the translator provided by the KGB.  I would like today to congratulate Zafra Lerman on being awarded the Charles Lathrop Parsons Award for Outstanding Public Service to Chemistry from the American Chemical Society. I assure you this is not her first honor--indeed, she is the recipient of more than three dozen well-deserved awards and grants over the past 15 years, including the prestigious Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics and Engineering Mentoring. But I know this one means a great deal to her, for the late Franklin A. Long, her mentor at Cornell University, received the same honor in 1985 and had dreamed that she would one day follow in his footsteps.  ``If I am able to see that I made a change for the better in someone's life,'' Zafra has said, ``then I know that it was a good day.'' Madam President, Zafra Lerman's life has been a collection of good days from which so many have benefitted. All of us whose lives she has touched owe her a debt of gratitude.                          ____________________
