 President, basketball is very important to us in my home State of Kentucky, and that is why I am so honored and pleased to recognize the winners of the Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA) State Basketball Championship for boys. The Owensboro Red Devils won a decisive 74-58 game over rival Bowling Green this March 22.  It is the fourth State championship for Owensboro High School, and the first since 1980 for the Red Devils. Owensboro came into the tournament having shot 55 percent from the field during the first three rounds of the tournament. During the championship game, they never trailed.  Owensboro is only the seventh school in State history to win the championship four times. And Owensboro's head coach, Rod Drake, was a senior on the Owensboro 1980 championship team. A crowd of over 11,000 saw Owensboro clinch the win inside of Lexington's legendary Rupp Arena.  I want to recognize every member of this championship team that is bringing the KHSAA trophy back to Owensboro. Team members include Darius Brown, Deonte Douglas, Gabe Fillman, Jacoby Harris, Aric Holman, James Howard, Darion Marrow, Justin Miller, Ishawn Murphy, Shawn Pendleton, Airius Phillips, Dylan Sanford, Trevor Washington, and Rashai Wimsatt. Matthew Cook and Seth Garrard are student managers. Rod Drake is the head coach and he is assisted by Chad Embry, Zach Erwin, Scott Hogg, and David Phillips.  The Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article about the Red Devils' victory. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Herald-Leader, March 22, 2015]    Owensboro Boys Win Their First State Basketball Title Since 1980                           (By Mark Maloney)       It was a long time coming, but Owensboro finally snatched      its fourth state championship Sunday.       The Red Devils led wire-to-wire in downing Bowling Green      74-58 in the finals of the 98th Whitaker Bank/KHSAA Sweet      Sixteen in Rupp Arena.       Owensboro, playing in its record 43rd State tournament,      also won in 1949, '72 and '80.       Dylan Sanford led a balanced scoring attack with 21 points,      hitting all four of the Red Devils' three-pointers.       ``My teammates got me the ball right where I needed it,''      said Sanford, a 6-foot-1 senior. ``Everybody knows I'm a      shooter, and they got me the ball in the pocket and I hit      some shots.''       Then there was the inside tandem of senior big fellas Aric      Holman and tourney MVP Justin Miller.       ``He dominates,'' Coach Rod Drake said of Holman. ``He gets      there, and he changed the game.''       Holman, a 6-9, 185-pounder, netted 20 points, 14 rebounds      and eight blocks.       ``It feels amazing,'' Holman said. ``Especially when you      work your butt off, you and your teammates. You do everything      together, and when you work as hard as we do, we knew what      our goal was. And we're just glad we accomplished it before      we left.''       Miller, a 6-7, 290-pounder, played through what he called a      groin/hamstring injury and finished with 11 points, 10      rebounds and five assists.       ``I was about 30 percent, honestly,'' Miller said. ``But I      wasn't going to let that stop me from playing my last game      with my brothers, so I'm just glad we got it done.''       Jacoby Harris, a 5-10 sophomore, added 14 points and five      assists as the 3rd Region team won its seventh game in a row.       The Red Devils (31-4) beat Bowling Green twice during the      regular season--79-71 on Jan. 3 and 69-66 on Feb. 10. But      that didn't make them overconfident.       ``To be honest, we had a little doubt,'' Holman said.      ``Because to beat a team three times in a row is pretty hard.      So we just took it as we never played them before. . . . Took      it back to square one, and that's how we got here now.''       This marked the first finals between Western Kentucky      schools since 4th Region Edmonson County beat 2nd Region      Christian County in 1976.       Fourth Region champion Bowling Green (31-6), in its first      State finals and 15th tourney, was led by Terry Taylor with      16 points and nine rebounds. Tucker Sine had nine points and      seven boards, and Kyran Jones netted eight points and eight      caroms.       ``Coming into this tournament, we were playing as well as      anybody,'' Purples Coach D.G. Sherrill said. ``And in this      championship game, we just kind of ran into a buzz saw. We      ran into a team that shot a little better, they fought around      the rim a little harder, they hit their free throws (20 of      23), and it was just a tough game for us. But we got beat by      a bunch of good players and a great coaching staff over in      Owensboro.''       Owensboro jumped to a 4-0 lead to start.       Ahead 4-3, the Red Devils went on a 9-0 run, only to see      the Purples come back with a 9-0 rally to leave the score 13-     12.       Owensboro led 16-12 through one quarter and 27-23 at      halftime.       The Devils opened the third quarter with a 7-1 run to push      the lead to 34-24.       Then, a 9-0 blitz widened the gap to 43-26.       Holman started the action by converting a three-point play      for a 37-26 lead.       Darion Marrow, who finished with six points, hit a short      jumper.       Sanford scored on a fast break, and Marrow flipped in a      shot from the lane.       The lead was 49-33 through three quarters.       The closest Bowling Green came from there was 61-49 with      3:06 left, when Taylor scored on a put-back.       Both teams came into the finals having shot 55 percent from      the field during the first three rounds of the tourney.       Owensboro nearly matched that Sunday, going 25 of 48 (52.1      percent), but Bowling Green came in 23 of 64 (35.9 percent).       ``Defensively, it's all about heart,'' Sanford said. ``And      our team has a lot of heart.''       ``The basket got a little small for us tonight,'' Sherrill      said. ``We picked a bad game to have one of our lower      performances in the shooting from the field. But to come in      here and play in a state championship time for the first time      in Bowling Green history . . . I'm still so proud of them.      We're taking home a big old silver ball tonight. That means      we accomplished something up here.''                          ____________________
