Do you have any idea what ``as soon as possible'' is, the time frame? Next 3 weeks, next month, late October, November? Do you have any idea on that?  Mr. DeLAY. There is really no way of knowing. It is really up to the committee and how fast they can do their work. I might say that the chairman of the committee's wife is having a baby today so that has created a problem. Not for him, but for our schedule. So they are working as hard and as fast as they can, and it is incredibly important for us to deal with this issue as soon as possible.
