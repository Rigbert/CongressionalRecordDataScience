  The only word I want to add to what you are saying, I say to the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. Kaptur], as important as it is to document the loss of jobs, there is another process going on as well, and that is the lowering of wages of workers whose jobs remain in existence.  Very clearly when you have a process by which jobs are going to Mexico and China, when workers go into their employers and say, ``We want a decent wage increase,'' what the employers are saying is, ``Hey, you better take a 10-percent decrease in wages or we can take your jobs to Mexico or anyplace else.'' So this whole process in putting continuous pressure on the decline of real wages in America. That is a very important point to keep reaffirming.
