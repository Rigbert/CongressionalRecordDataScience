 Mr. McCARTHY. The gentleman brings up a very serious issue. This is something that should not be taken lightly. This should not be partisan in any way shape or form. This is something we should get ahead of. That is why the Energy and Commerce Committee has already scheduled and sent out letters for hearings. Susan Brooks has a bill that she has been working on dealing with this as well.  So, yes, we want to get in front of this. I know we have been talking to the administration as well. I look forward to working with you in dealing with this issue because this is not something that should lay by the wayside. This is something we have to get in front of.
