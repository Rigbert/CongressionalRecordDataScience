 President, I am out here again today to urge the Senate to pass the bipartisan joint funding resolution that is before us. It is H.J. Res. 20. As I mentioned yesterday evening when I was out here on the Senate floor, President Bush's Transportation Secretary, Mary Peters, testified before us last week that we will see ``drastic consequences'' if we fail to pass this funding resolution that is now in front of us. We are going to see painful cuts to aviation safety, highway safety, and highway construction. I also can tell my colleagues we will see painful and unnecessary cuts in housing, law enforcement, and veterans health care.  I want to make sure every Senator understands the importance of the votewe are going to have and understands the difference between the continuing resolution that our Government is currently running on and the joint funding resolution, H.J. Res. 20, that we are currently debating.  If we fail to pass H.J. Res. 20, the bill before us, and, instead, extend the current continuing resolution for the rest of this year, we are going to see families across this country lose their housing. We are going to see airline safety inspectors who are furloughed. We are going to see air traffic controllers who will be furloughed, highway construction will be cut, and, as a result, some States are going to have to wait until the next construction season to deal with very critical safety and congestion problems.  In short, failing to pass H.J. Res. 20, the issue before us, we are going to hurt our communities severely. That is why it is so important we pass this resolution, which is a bipartisan bill, that has been very carefully crafted to address the most critical funding shortfalls across our entire Government. We have to pass H.J. Res. 20, and we need to do it this week, by this Thursday.  Communities across our country need more help in fighting crime, and that is one reason we have to pass this joint funding resolution. Without this resolution, without this bill, our State and local law enforcement will be cut by $1.2 billion. The joint funding resolution we have before us will prevent that drastic cut, and our resolution adds money for Byrne grants and COPS grants, providing a $176 million increase over last year for those two programs. That money will go straight to our local communities to help them fight crime.  When I go home and sit down with our law enforcement officials in my home State of Washington, they tell me they need more help from all of us in the Federal Government.  A few months ago, I was out in Yakima, WA, listening to our local law enforcement officials talk about their tremendous efforts to fight meth and gangs. They told me that Byrne grants are absolutely critical to their efforts.  There is a huge difference for Byrne grant funding under a continuing resolution--that we would be under if we do not pass this joint funding resolution--and the joint funding resolution. Under the joint funding resolution, the Byrne Grant Assistance Program is funded at $519 million. That is an increase of $108.7 million over fiscal year 2006. Under our bill, the COPS Program is funded at $541.7 million. That is an increase of $67.9 million over fiscal year 2006.  Those programs are exactly the type of support that our local law enforcement officials need. But they will only get that--they will only get that--if we pass the joint funding resolution that is now before the Senate.  Our resolution also supports national efforts to fight crime. Under a continuing resolution, the FBI would have to lay off 4,000 special agents. Let me repeat that for my colleagues. If we go under a continuing resolution and fail to pass the funding resolution that is before us, the FBI will have to lay off 4,000 special agents.  Now, at a time when violent crime is rising, when robberies are up nearly 10 percent nationwide, when the FBI is working very hard to fight crime, do we really want to lay off 4,000 FBI agents? Of course not. That is why the resolution provides the FBI with an additional $216 million over fiscal year 2006. That means the FBI will not have to lay off those special agents if we pass this funding resolution. If we do not pass H.J. Res. 20, those FBI agents will be furloughed, sitting at home, unpaid, rather than out working to fight crime.  Also the Justice Department's Violence Against Women office is funded at $382.5 million in our resolution. That is nearly $1 million over their funding of fiscal year 2006, critical dollars for a very important initiative to fight violence against women.  The joint funding resolution will also help us to cut off funding to terrorists. The Treasury Department today is working very hard to block the flow of money to terrorists. Last year, Treasury hired new intelligence analysts in that effort. Under a CR, those new analysts would be furloughed. Talk about a step backwards in the fight against terror. Our joint funding resolution, however, ensures that those analysts will stay on the job and keep disrupting terror financing.  In short, we have to pass H. J. Res. 20 so we prevent cuts in local law enforcement, so we prevent the layoffs of thousands of FBI agents, and we keep our Federal law enforcement efforts on track. This vote coming up is very critical. Either you vote to support funding law enforcement at an appropriate level or you are voting to cut funding to your local law enforcement community. That is the choice every Senator will have to make.  America's veterans also have a great deal at stake when the Senate votes on this joint funding resolution. I just came from a hearing with VA Secretary Nicholson this morning. It is absolutely clear to me that we are not doing enough yet to meet the needs of those who have served our country so honorably. Veterans today are facing long lines for health care. Veterans who need mental health care are being told they have to wait to see a doctor. The VA is not prepared for the many veterans who are coming home with serious physical challenges. We need a VA budget for the current year that meets their needs. If we pass a continuing resolution, veterans are going to get less funding and, with it, fewer medical services, less funding for medical facilities, and more delays in getting the benefits they have earned. We owe our veterans more than cuts and delays. Under the joint funding resolution, total funding for VA medical care is $32 billion. That is an increase of about $3.5 billion over the fiscal year 2006 appropriated level.  Let me talk about one other VA account in particular. Under the joint funding resolution we have before us, VA medical services are funded at about $25 billion. That is an increase of $2.965 billion over the fiscal year 2006 appropriated level. That money is going to help our veterans with medical care, including inpatient and outpatient care, mental health care, and long-term care. Under our bill, there is an extra $70 million for the VA's general operating expenses, and some of that money is going to help our Veterans Benefits Administration deal with the massive backlog of benefit claims. The VA has told us they wanted to hire a net of 300 more employees so we can cut down this waiting time all of us are hearing about from our veterans when we go home who can't get the benefits they need. Without the joint funding resolution, the VA will not be able to hire those new employees, and veterans are going to continue to tell us they face long delays for the benefits they have earned and deserve.  I also want to talk about the effect that not passing the joint funding resolution would have on critical programs under my own jurisdiction in the Transportation, Housing, and Urban Development Subcommittee. If we do not pass the joint funding bill, our air traffic controllers are going to be furloughed. Our air safety inspectors will be furloughed. If we fail to pass this bipartisan bill, we are going to see a decline in our ability to provide railroad inspections, pipeline safety inspections, and to make sure we get truck safety inspections across the country. Simply put, if we don't pass this bipartisan bill, the safety of the people we represent is going to be put in danger.  We are also going to feel the consequences in the critical area of housing. If we don't pass this funding resolution, hundreds of thousands of Americans are going to face a housing crisis. In fact, 157,000 low-income people could lose their housing; 70,000 people could lose their housing vouchers; and 11,500 housing units that are housing the homeless could be lost.  Those are only some of the consequences Americans will face if this Congress fails to act in the next 2 days to pass this joint funding resolution. Don't take my word for it. Last Thursday I held a hearing with President Bush's very able Secretary of Transportation Mary Peters. At that hearing, she talked in very clear terms about the consequences of not passing this joint funding resolution. I asked Secretary Peters what it would mean for safety and hiring if we did not pass this joint funding resolution. She said to me:       [W]e will see a serious decline in the number of safety      inspectors: truck safety inspectors, rail safety inspectors,      aviation inspectors across the broad range in our program.  That is directly from the Transportation Secretary.  Does any Senator want to be responsible for voting for a serious decline in the number of truck safety inspectors, rail safety inspectors, aviation safety inspectors? How would you ever explain that to your constituents, that you voted to undermine their safety as they travel by car or train or plane?  We also need to pass this joint funding resolution because without it, our States will not be able to address their most pressing highway, bridge, and road problems. In fact, Secretary Peters, President Bush's Transportation Secretary, warned us last week that some States could miss an entire construction season if we do not pass this bill this week. She said:       It is especially important to those States who have a      construction season that will be upon us very, very shortly,      and if they are not able to know that this funding is coming      and be able to let contracts accordingly we could easily miss      an entire construction season.  All of us better recognize that our constituents are going to feel the impact of this vote on their roads and bridges and highways if we do not pass the joint funding resolution. The bill before the Senate provides an additional $3.75 billion in formula funding for our Nation's highway and transit systems. That funding will serve to create almost 160,000 new jobs, and it will help us alleviate congestion, an issue many of us face in our States. It is going to be an important infusion of cash for the States to address their needs.  I ask unanimous consent that a table that has been provided to me by the Federal Highway Administration which displays the highway funding increases that will be seen by each of our States be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:   U.S. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION, FEDERAL HIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION--COMPARISON OF ACTUAL FY 2006 OBLIGATION
