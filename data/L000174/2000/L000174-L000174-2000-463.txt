President, I am very hopeful that this bill can, at long last, make crop insurance work for all regions of our nation. It includes creative provisions to bring new producers under its protections, and to bring new crops under its protections. The compromise worked out yesterday protects what the Midwest wanted while reaching out to other regions and producers.  Historic participation in New England has been very low--this bill helps address this issue. Crop insurance will give our producers one more tool to help manage risk--risks from ice storms, droughts, flood, hail and other natural disasters.  I want to thank Senators Roberts and Kerrey for their leadership and willingness to include our region, so that we can all now vote together for this effort.  Chairman Lugar and Ranking Member Harkin were faced with a very difficult challenge--leadership of the Agriculture Committee, as I well know, can be a very difficult balancing act. Also the Democratic leader and his staff--Zabrae Valentine--were extremely helpful in delicate negotiations.  Bev Paul with Senator Kerrey, Mark Halveson with Senator Harkin, Dave Johnson, Keith Luse, Michael Knipe and Andy Morton with Chairman Lugar, put in very long hours in this massive effort. Ken Ackerman, of USDA, provided excellent technical advice in this complex area. Senator Conrad and his staff Scott Carlson put a huge amount of effort into this.  I am grateful that the Leahy, Torricelli, Schumer, Rockefeller, Reed, and Kennedy amendment was included in the managers' package.  The Senate has spoken in a united voice on this amendment and it is crucial that it be included in any conference report.
