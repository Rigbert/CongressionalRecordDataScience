 President, what we have is a debate that is proceeding in such a way that amendments are not being allowed.  One of the things we talked about this year, and Senator McCain indicated he wanted, was an open debate, in which Senators would be able to lay down their amendments, get debate, and get votes.  I say to all of my colleagues, we have Senator Bennett and Senator Burns here with a very important amendment they would like to get offered. Senator Sessions is on the floor. He has an amendment he would like to offer. Senator Thompson and Senator Lieberman have an amendment they would like to offer. Senator Nickles has an amendment he would like to offer; Senator Hatch, in all likelihood. Senator Hagel has indicated he may be offering an amendment, as well.  We have an opportunity here to lay down and discuss these amendments, lay them aside, and guarantee these Senators an opportunity to vote.  I am somewhat confused about where we are. I thought the whole idea behind having 4 or 5 days of debate, I would say to my friend from Arizona--although he did not object; it was the assistant minority leader--I guess I am perplexed about where we are. I would like to protect the opportunity of my colleagues on the Republican side to offer amendments about which they feel strongly about.  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.  Mr. McCONNELL. I am going to retain the floor, but I will be glad to yield for some observation.  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from Kentucky yield to me?  First of all, I believe we should move forward and have amendments. I would like to discuss it with all of us discussing it, go into a quorum call in a second, if we might.  First of all, I would like to frame a parliamentary inquiry very quickly.  Mr. President, if an amendment in the nature of a substitute were to be offered, how many votes would be needed to affirmatively adopt the amendment?
