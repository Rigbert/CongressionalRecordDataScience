 President, I would like to take a few moments to recognize some of the most brilliant and hardest working young adults in our Nation and in the world today. These seventeen outstanding scholars have recently been named 2005 Davidson Fellows and are being rewarded for their cutting-edge and distinguished work. The Davidson Institute Fellowships promote and reward under-18 year olds who have undertaken invaluable projects and studies for the greater good of our country and the world. The Davidson Institute awards scholarships to each of the Fellows to assist them in furthering their education. I don't believe the Davidson Institute could have found a more distinguished or more deserving group of young scholars. I would like to detail their accomplishments for a moment.  Karsten Gimre was just 11 years old when he became a Davidson Fellow based on his project entitled ``Conversation Without Words.'' This young pianist from Banks, Oregon has performed with several professional orchestras and has been winning awards for his exceptional abilities since the age of 6 when he earned first place at the International Young Artists Concert here in Washington, D.C. At the age of 12 he is now studying math and physics at the Pacific University while continuing his musical instruction.  As a young writer from Canton, MI, Heidi Kaloustian's unique talent and creative genius allowed her to explore complex relationships and personal identity in her portfolio entitled ``The Roots of All Things'' while still allowing the reader to emotionally connect with the work and characters. Heidi plans to continue creative writing at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor and I have no doubt that she will be very successful as a professor and as a writer.  Tiffany Ko, a 16 year old from Terre Haute, IN, put herself on the cutting edge of technology and science when she used electric field sensing to design a new type of computerized security system. Her project is a significant advancement from current security systems and could be used to make people and businesses safer than ever before.  At the age of 17 years old, Milana Zaurova from Fresh Meadows, NY has begun developing a new way to treat the most deadly form of brain cancer, malignant glioma. She combined chemotherapy and gene-therapy to develop a creative new method that has the potential to save many lives.  As a 12-year old from Chapel Hill, NC, Maia Cabeza has already developed an extensive resume as a violinist. She has earned praise in the United States and abroad for her technical proficiency and musicality. Maia has the noble goal of using her music to breach cultural and language barriers, and I wish her the best of luck and success.  When Brett Harrison was just 16 years old he was able to develop a mathematical proof that actually improved upon a conjecture developed by a Princeton University professor. This Dix Hills, NY native's work is applicable to numerous fields such as communications, structural design, and computer networking systems.  Tudor Dominik Maican is a gifted and talented 16-year-old composer from Bethesda, MD. He has already been commissioned by the Dumbarton Musical Society for a piano solo and has been the recipient of numerous awards for his imaginative and wide-ranging compositions.  Justin Solomon, from Oakton, VA, designed an algorithm to recognize an object based on its three dimensional features. Most recognition programs only use two dimensions, so Justin's new algorithm increases a program's accuracy and can potentially be used in the fields of security, robotics, and artificial intelligence.  John Zhou of Northville, MI took an interest in biomedicine because of its scientific and humanitarian aspects, and has now studied the DNA replication process with the goal of understanding and ultimately halting mutations and cancer development. John is also accomplished in many other fields including mathematics, physics, and Spanish.  Kadir Annamalai's project focused around building nanowires, or wires only about two molecules thick that could be used in devices like power generators and circuit boards. In addition to this extremely technical work, Kadir, who is from Saratoga, CA, is also an Eagle Scout and is the recipient of numerous Future Business Leaders of America awards.  Motivated by a strong desire to help those affected with Alzheimer's disease, Stephanie Hon, from Fort Myers, FL, investigated a creative method that her study suggests could possibly reverse some of the effects of Alzheimer's. Stephanie is considering continuing her Alzheimer's research at Harvard University this fall and we all wish her continued success.  Benedict Shan Yuan Huang's project, Changed Particle Production in High Energy Nuclear Collisions, is as technical and advanced as it sounds. He has created a new technique that promises to achieve quicker and more accurate results when studying the structure of matter. Benedict, who is from Coram, NY, will attend Harvard University in the fall and will most likely study science as well as the piano.  At the age of 16 Lucas Moller from Moscow, ID has already worked with NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. His study on Martian dust and its effect on Martian lander missions has been incorporated on the Mars Surveyor lander and the Mars Express/Beagle 2 mission.  Nimish Ramanlal from Winter Springs, FL was able to advance the field of quantum computing by creating a new framework for quantum computing that overcomes the limitations on the effectiveness of quantum computers. His work could help a new form of computing to emerge with profound implications in nanotechnology, medical research, and advanced physics.  With the internet growing every day, Tony Wu of Irvine, CA created a new internet search method that could be highly useful in the information society of the 21st century. He has competed successfully in numerous science competitions and plans to study computer science or electronics engineering in college.  Fan Yang, a 17-year-old young woman from Davis, CA, developed a method of preventing eye infections byusing three compounds that prevent bacteria from forming and growing on the contact or intraocular lenses. This is a promising line of research that demonstrates the combination of Fan Yang's love of science and desire to help people.  At the age of 6 years old, Marc Yu, who is from Monterey Park, CA, has already won numerous awards and competitions for both his piano and cello performances including both first place for the cello and second place for the piano at the Southwest Youth Music Festival.  Mr. President, despite their relatively young age, these seventeen outstanding young men and women have all achieved remarkable things and fully deserve the awards that they have earned. Their past is overshadowed, however, by their even brighter futures and careers made easier by becoming 2005 Davidson Fellows. I would like to thank these young scientists, mathematicians, writers, and musicians for their accomplishments, past, present, and future, that will no doubt improve the lives of a great many people in this country and abroad.                          ____________________
