Speaker, there is a reason why the Republicans oppose the Democratic rules change in this closed rule. Our rules change makes every rules change proposed by the Republicans today pale in comparison. Theirs are plastic and papier mache. Ours have the hard steel of real change because they address the key issue of the integrity of Congress.  Today as we speak on this floor with a few Members, so many others are enjoying this wonderful first day of service in Congress. They came here promising to represent their districts, not the special interests. Our rules change addresses that straightforwardly. It prohibits and limits any gifts from lobbyists and special interest groups so that new Members and old Members alike will not be ensnared in these special interest tangles. And equally important, Mr. Speaker, it closes or at least restricts a dangerous loophole.  By the rules of the House I cannot go out and give a speech and earn one dollar. But I can go out, and in the name of writing a book, supposedly earn legally millions of dollars. That kind of ridiculous loophole puts this House in jeopardy and every Member of it.  I would suggest that we stick with the Democratic changes and defeat the previous question.
