Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank again the gentleman for his thoughtful remarks. We see it differently, Mr. Leader. What we have created is the ability of both sides to stop investigations in their tracks. Both sides. Our side, if we block up, and our five say you are not going to investigate Steny Hoyer, they can do it. Formerly they could not do that. And I believe your analogy is not apt, and I want to tell you why I think so, Mr. Leader.  The investigation is the gathering of facts, not the charging, not the finding of involvement. We do not use the term ``guilt,'' but the finding of involvement. It is an investigation to gather the facts from which the decision-makers, whether it be a grand jury or a petit jury, whether it be a judge or whether it be a prosecutor who determines whether to bring an indictment. Once those decision-makers have the facts, they can then make a rational decision, we hope.  What we have done, however, in changing the rules, which were adopted in a bipartisan fashion, is to allow either side to preclude the investigator from gathering the facts. That is as if we could preclude the police or the FBI or others from gathering facts that they would then, in turn, submit to a decision-maker, whether a grand jury to bring an indictment, a prosecutor to bring a charge, a petit jury to bring a conviction. I think that is inaccurate  Mr. DeLAY. Will the gentleman yield?
