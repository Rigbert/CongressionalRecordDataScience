 It is from Michael Darling, who wrote:       Digital Systems International settled two securities cases      in 1993 for payments of cash and stock valued at $7.5      million, not including litigation expenses. The costs of the      litigation forced the company to lay off 30 workers--and to      ask those remaining to accept pay cuts.  Mr. President, I have also heard from the opponents of the legislation. I have listened carefully to every argument against the bill. I have worked to make this legislation good for all the parties involved.  In fact, I have studied this issue for more than 2 years with members of both sides of the aisle--in a strong bipartisan fashion--to make this bill work for the American people.  As we debate this bill, there are ads running in the papers and inflammatory attack ads being broadcast by both sides in this debate. Given the lengthy debate we have had on this bill, I find these campaigns very disturbing.  Let me say to these groups, Mr. President, they are not serving anyone's purpose but their own.  They are not helping craft legislation that works for America--they are slugging it out trying to seek advantage.  I stand here on the floor today and say clearly to both sides of this issue--  Keep things in perspective. Use some common sense. Stop attacking and start cooperating.  Mr. President, I have seen some unfortunate--and inaccurate--statements made about this bill. Many have referred to an editorial from a Seattle newspaper which overlooked some of the bill's most important provisions.  First, their editorial states that high-profile, meritorious cases of securities fraud could not be brought once S. 240 becomes law.  That is simply not true. The SEC can always fight fraud, and they do so with vigor and clear purpose.  This point is made quite clearly in the committee report:       None of the provisions in S. 240 affects the SEC's ability      to bring enforcement actions.  Second, the editorial stated the bill contains a loser-pays provision.  Again, this is untrue. S. 240 does not contain any fee-shifting provisions.  It merely modifies rule 11 of the Federal Rule of Civilian Procedure. And, rule 11 does not sanction anyone just for losing their case.  This provision actually favors the small investor. S. 240 states that the sanction does not apply if it will cause undue financial hardship on the sanctioned party.  Mr. President, this editorial has been challenged aggressively by public officials, business people, and many constituents in my State. I now ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a series of letters-to-the-editor to Washington newspapers on this issue.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            [From Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 19, 1995]           Editorial on Fraud Law Shows Homework Wasn't Done                            (By John Level)       Your June 2 editorial regarding Sens. Patty Murray and      Slade Gorton was certainly not good reporting. Both senators      became co-sponsors of S. 240 because the bill is long      overdue. If you had done your homework, you would have found      the following information.       High-growth companies have become targets of abusive      securities litigation. There are about 300 lawsuits filed in      each of the past few years. Ninety-three percent are settled      before they go to court with settlements that amount to $8.6      million or a $2.4 billion a year industry.       The only reason that these cases are settled out of court      is that it is cheaper in the long run. The trail lawyers are      the only big winners in these suits. In many cases, over 60      percent of the settlement goes to the legal system.       Nearly seven out of 10 investors surveyed by Public Opinion      Strategies for the National Investor Relations Institute say      they want the bill passed. The only people who do not want      the bill passed are the lawyers, people who make a living      from lawsuits and some people who have not read the bill or      even seen it. I suspect that is the case with you.       Your editorial was written without a full understanding of      the bill, and your remarks about Murray are fully uncalled      for. A retraction should be made to her. While I don't agree      with Murray all of the time, she certainly made a good      decision in supporting this bill and it appears that she      ``read'' it.                                  ____                   [From Seattle Times, June 7, 1995]                     Investors Retain Right To Sue                        (By Scott G. Hallquist)       The misleading information printed by The Times concerning      securities litigation reform has been a disservice to Times      readers. In both an editorial published May 29 and a news      article published May 31, Times writers incorrectly suggested      that the proposed legislation will strip investors of their      right to sue companies for fraud. This is simply not true.       The legislation to be considered by the Senate represents a      negotiated compromise that preserves an investor's right to      sue, while implementing reforms intended to curb lawsuits      that are filed without reasonable basis.       By providing a safe harbor for forward-looking company      forecasts made in good faith, the legislation is expected to      improve the quality of information companies can make      available to investors.       Most troubling to me was a personal attack upon the      integrity of Sen. Patty Murray by a local attorney who      specializes in securities litigation. Unlike her accuser, I      do not believe that Sen. Murray can be ``bought off'' and      applaud her courage for voting in favor of this legislation.       In our securities markets, the ability of individual      investors to sue for damages for fraud by securities issuers      does provide an important incentive for companies to provide      accurate and timely information to investors. In approving      the legislation now being considered by Congress, Sen. Murray      and other members of Congress balanced the need to preserve      redress for investors in fraud cases, against the need for      public companies to be able to discuss future performance      without the fear that unanticipated developments will      invariably result in costly and protracted litigation.       Growing public companies are primary engines of job      creation and economic growth in our state. Appropriately      balanced legislation such as the securities litigation reform      bill supported by Sen. Murray is a reasonable step that need      not be feared by individual or public investors.                                  ____                  [From Seattle Times, June 19, 1995]       Reform Measure Doesn't Limit Liability of Accounting Firms                           (By John A. Moga)       Your May 29 editorial and your May 31 news report on      congressional efforts to repair a securities litigation      system that is drowning investors and businesses in a sea of      unmerited lawsuits included a number of disturbing factual      errors.       Your report that legislation (S. 240) introduced in the      Senate by Republican Sen. Pete Domenici would relieve      accounting firms of liability is simply not true. Rather, the      bill establishes a system of proportionate liability that      would base liability on a defendant's degree of      responsibility for any plaintiff damages. In cases of      ``knowing fraud'' where the defendant was guilty of      deliberate misconduct, the defendant would remain liable for      the total amount of damages assessed by the court. By the      way, this provision applies to all defendants--not just      accounting firms as you suggest.       The report also erroneously says that the bill eliminates      the ``fraud on the market'' provision of current law. This,      too, is untrue. S. 240 retains fraud on the market--which      enables shareholders to recover even when they are unaware of      the erroneous statement--an important provision for      investors.       Finally, I was distressed by the flat assertion in your      editorial that the proposed reform measures strip investors      and government of their right to sue. Neither the Senate bill      nor a measure passed by the House earlier this year does any      such thing. I believe you should re-visit this issue and make      sure you have all the facts right. Your readers deserve it.                                  ____                 Lawyers the Only Ones to Reap Benefits                          (By Austin L. Wolff)       Your editorial in defense of the current class-action      securities law is very wrong. You have not looked at the real      issue. Stockholder class-action suits enrich the lawyers at      the expense of the stockholders and the consumer.       Most suits against small public companies are never proved      but instead settle out of court because, regardless of right      or wrong, it is cheaper to pay than to defend. A word that      would describe this type of settlement is ``blackmail.''      Carol Bartz, president of Autodesk, a CADD software company,      explained it this way at President Clinton's business      conference. A lawyer, using the name of a couple of      shareholders, instigated a class-action suit. Autodesk's      lawyers reviewed the claim and concluded that the company was      not in the wrong but advised the company to pay $10 million      because it would cost $100 million to defend. That is called      a ``negotiated'' settlement.       In a recent stockholder case against Egghead, the Issaquah-     based software retailer, I personally heard the judge approve      a similarly arrived-at settlement that paid the suing lawyer      about $700,000, which computes out at the rate of $700 per      ``billable'' hour. That is almost 200 times minimum wage.       The two stockholders in whose name the suit was brought had      lost a total of less than $1,200. The managers who were      running the company at that time paid nothing because they      were covered by a company guaranty. The total cost to the      company, and thus to the rest of the stockholders, was in the      order of $3 million, plus the loss of much management and      employee time. Among those stockholders, and thus among those      who in essence paid, was my nephew, a minor, whose savings      account for college was invested in the company. . . .       The judge implied that settlements like this would      encourage more such suits. Woe to small businesses, woe to      the investing public.       There are adequate criminal laws regarding fraud that are      handled by state and federal agencies; let those agencies      prosecute. . . .                                  ____            [From Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 16, 1995]     Editorial Fails To Acknowledge the Need to Reform Existing Law                             (By Dan Grimm)       As state treasurer and a member of the State Investment      Board, I read with interest your June 2 editorial on      securities litigation reform. The SIB has been involved in      costly and protracted litigation involving allegations of      securities fraud. (Your editorial noted the SIB's recent      recovery of $1 million in the settlement of a securities      fraud case. And like some corporations, the SIB has had to      deal with hastily drafted lawsuits filed by attorneys who      were out to make a quick buck.       I was disappointed that you failed to acknowledge the need      to reform the securities litigation law. The fact is, many      organizations representing investors and government entities      support legislation designed to deter costly and frivolous      litigation while preserving vital investor rights and      remedies.       Your editorial correctly pointed our that legislation under      consideration by Congress could unduly burden investors and      limit their access to the courts. That's why I sent a letter      to our Senate delegation urging them to oppose legislation      that does not strike an appropriate balance between the      concerns of investors and corporations.       I have been in contact with Sen. Patty Murray to share      those concerns, and contrary to the assertions of your      editorial, she shares the view that securities-reform      legislation must protect the rights of investors as well as      address the problems of frivolous lawsuits. In fact, Murray      was instrumental in making sure that legislation under      consideration by Congress will reasonably protect the rights      of small and large investors. With her assistance, the      draconian ``loser pays'' provision was tempered in the      Banking Committee. I am optimistic that Murray will be      successful in her efforts to see that other anti-investor      language is moderated or even removed from the bill as it      moves through the Senate.
