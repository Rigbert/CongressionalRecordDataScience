Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 1208) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that youth who age out of foster care should be given special care and attention.  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.  The text of the resolution is as follows:                              H. Res. 1208       Whereas 12,000,000 Americans spend time in foster care;       Whereas every year, more than 24,000 youth turn age 18      while in foster care;       Whereas the safekeeping of most youth who age out of foster      care is the responsibility of the State governments, which      receive Federal funding to assist them in doing so;       Whereas family reunification, kinship care, and adoption      are the preferred solutions for children who are placed in      foster care;       Whereas Congress created a new Independent Living      initiative in 1986, and expanded the program by passing the      Chaffee Foster Care Independence Act in 1999 to assist youth      who are emancipated while in foster care: Now, therefore, be      it       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--       (1) supports former foster care youth as they overcome many      emotional, physical, and social obstacles in the pursuit of      healthy, independent, and fulfilling lives;       (2) recognizes former foster care youth organizations for      their dedication to reforming and improving the foster care      system;       (3) appreciates individuals, mentors, and social workers      who provide assistance to former foster care youth beyond      resources available through Federal, State, and local      services; and       (4) encourages reviews of Federal and State programs      conducted under title IV of the Social Security Act that      would improve services to help former foster care youth      succeed in their transition to adulthood and independence.
