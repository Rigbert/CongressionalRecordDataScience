 President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter dated October 17, 1996--speaking of superseding--which supersedes the statement referred to by my colleague about the Australia Group. It says:       In this context, the maintenance of effective export      controls will remain an essential practical means of      fulfilling obligations under the CWC and the BTWC.  Translated into ordinary English, it means that we adhere to the commitment we made in the Australia Group with export controls. We believe it is consistent with the CWC and required by the CWC.
