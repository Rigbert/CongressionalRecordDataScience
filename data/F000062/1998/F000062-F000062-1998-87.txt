'' I am concerned that this would limit grants to programs that train teachers pursuing certain academic majors, such as biology or history or French.  My concern is that individuals in teacher preparation courses preparing to teach in the elementary grades might be excluded. Students in preparation to teach at the elementary level would not have an academic major, in the traditional sense that is directly related to the subject that they plan to teach, in part because elementary teachers teach all subjects.  Yet, I'm sure we all agree that strong teaching, particularly the teaching of reading and math at the elementary level, in the primary grades, is critical. It is fundamental to a student's educational success in the subsequent grades.  Do you not agree?
