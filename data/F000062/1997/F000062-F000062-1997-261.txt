 I am pleased to join with him in this joint resolution, disapproving the certification of Mexico.  Mr. President, my disappointment in the administration's decision to certify Mexico's antidrug efforts last week, I think, was known to all. I believe that decision was a mistake, and I said so.  The decision to certify Mexico in the face of what I consider to be an overwhelming lack of cooperation undermines the integrity of the certification process itself, as well as damaging the credibility of the United States in our dealings with other countries with whom we seek cooperation.  I rise today to join with the Senator from Georgia and a number of my colleagues in introducing this resolution. But I do so with some regret. I regret the need for the resolution for two reasons. First, Mexico is a neighbor, a friend, and an ally of our country. Second, I very much regret the need to disagree with my President on this issue. I believe he made what he believes to be the right decision, but I respectfully disagree with him.  Our intention is clear: We believe that the evidence overwhelmingly supports decertification of Mexico, and then if the President sees fit, invoking a vital national interest waiver. For that reason, Senator Coverdell has introduced a second resolution that allows the President to waive the sanctions on grounds of vital national interest after we enact our resolution of disapproval.  Last week, a bipartisan group of 39 Senators sent a letter to the President urging that this be his decision.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record following my remarks.
