President, as we approach the beginning of the next century, we have much to be proud of as a nation. The stock market has reached an historic 10,000 mark. We are in the midst of one of the greatest economic expansions in our nation's history. More Americans own their own homesthan at any time, and we have the lowest unemployment and welfare caseloads in a generation.  Yet, there are millions of Americans who go hungry every day. Just this past July, the Department of Agriculture published a report entitled ``Household Food Security in the United States 1995-1998'' which reported that last year, 36 million persons--of which approximately 40% were children--lived in households that experienced hunger.  While it is true that food stamp and welfare program caseloads have dropped over the past few years, hunger has not. As families try to make the transition from welfare to work, too many are falling out and being left behind. And too often, it is our youth who is feeling the brunt of this, as one out of every five people lining up at soup kitchens is a child.  Second Harvest, the nation's largest hunger relief charity, distributed more than one billion pounds of food to an estimated 26 million low-income Americans last year through their network of regional food banks. These food banks provide food and grocery products to nearly fifty thousand local charitable feeding programs--food shelves, pantries, soup kitchens and emergency shelters.  Yet as the demand has risen at local hunger relief agencies, too many pantries and soup kitchens have been forced to turn needy people away because the request for their services exceeds available food.  Last year, the U.S. Conference of Mayors released its Annual Survey of Hunger and Homelessness, which reported that the demand for hunger relief services grew 14 percent last year. Additionally, 21 percent of requests for emergency food were estimated to have gone unmet. This is the highest rate of unmet need by emergency food providers since the recession of the early 1990s. And this is not just a problem of the inner cities. According to the Census Bureau, hunger and poverty are growing faster in the suburbs than anywhere else in America. In my own state of Vermont, one in ten people is ``food insecure,'' according to government statistics. That is, of course, just a clinical way to say they are hunger or at risk of hunger.  Under the leadership of Deborah Flateman, the Vermont Food Bank distributes food to approximately 240 private social service agencies throughout the state to help hungry and needy Vermonters. The local food shelves and emergency kitchens which receive food from the Vermont Food Bank clearly are on the front-line against hunger. And what they are seeing is very disturbing--one in four seeking hunger relief is a child under the age of 17. Elderly people make up more than a third of all emergency food recipients. We cannot continue to allow so many of our youngest and oldest citizens face the prospect of hunger on a daily basis. Another extremely troubling statistic about hunger in Vermont is that in 45 percent of the households that receive charitable food assistance, one or more adults are working. Nationwide, working poor households represent more than one-third of all emergency food recipients. These are people in Vermont and across the U.S. who are working, paying taxes and contributing to the economic growth of our nation, but are reaping few of the rewards.  Our government has taken numerous steps to alleviate hunger in America, but clearly more still needs to be done.  The Emergency Food Assistance Program has been essential in the fight against hunger by providing USDA commodities to the nation's food banks and local emergency feeding charities. As the demands continue to grow, however, TEFAP resources are running on empty. The Hunger Relief Act would increase funding for TEFAP, thus helping community charities cope with increased local demand for hunger relief.  Perhaps more than any other program, the Food Stamp Program has been critical to the prevention and alleviation of hunger and poverty, and is essential to helping families on welfare transition to work. Nationally, one in ten people--half of which are children--participates in the Food Stamp Program.  In this time of economic booms, one in five U.S. children--approximately 15 million children--lives in a household receiving food stamps.  And far too many families with full-time or part-time minimum wage jobs need food stamps just to approach the poverty line.  For many families, the choice between paying the rent and buying food is becoming more and more common. While the Food Stamp Program does adjust benefits for families with high shelter costs, this adjustment has been artificially capped. In 1993, Congress passed a phased-out elimination of the cap on the food stamp shelter deduction. With the passage of the Welfare Reform bill, however, Congress repealed the phase-out and the cap remained in place.  The cap on the shelter deduction has had a significant impact on working families, who tend to have higher shelter costs than families receiving public housing assistance. The Hunger Relief Act raises the shelter cap from $275 to $340, and then indexes it to inflation, increasing access to Food Stamps for approximately 1.25 million people.  Many working poor families, particularly in rural areas, own a modestly valued car, necessary to get to work, but of a value greater than the antiquated food stamp vehicle limit. In the last 22 years, the limit on car values has increased a total of $150, and in many states the Food Stamp vehicle allowance is much lower than the TANF vehicle allowance. The Hunger Relief Act would give states more freedom, allowing states the option of using the same limits for vehicles under both TANF and Food Stamps. The Hunger Relief Act would also complete the restoration of food stamp benefits to thousands of immigrants who were pushed out of the program by the Welfare Reform Act.  Last Congress I worked hard to include $818 million in the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reauthorization Act to restore food stamp benefits for thousands of legal immigrants. This legislation restored food stamps to legal immigrants who are disabled or elderly, or who later become disabled, and who resided in the United States prior to August 22, 1996. That law also increased food stamp eligibility time limits--from five years to seven years--for refugees and asylees who came to this country to avoid persecution. Hmong refugees who aided U.S. military efforts in Southeast Asia were also covered, as were children residing in the United States prior to August 22, 1996.  Though the Agriculture Research Act restored food stamp eligibility to children of legal immigrants, many of these children are not receiving food stamps and are experiencing alarming instances of hunger. In its recent report entitled ``Who is Leaving the Food Stamp Program? An Analysis of Caseload Changes from 1994 to 1997,'' the United States Department of Agriculture reported that participation among children living with parents who are legal immigrants fell significantly faster than children living with native-born parents. It appears that restrictions on adult legal immigrants deterred the participation of their children. That is a disturbing development that must be rectified, and the Hunger Relief Act would go along way toward making the situation right by restoring food stamp eligibility to all legal immigrants.  Of the many problems that we face as a nation, hunger is one that is entirely solvable. Hunger is not a Democrat or Republican issue. Hunger is a problem that all Americans should agree must be ended in our nation. I am proud to join with Senators Kennedy, Specter, and Jeffords in introducing the Hunger Relief Act, and I look forward to working with members of the Senate to see the passage of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
