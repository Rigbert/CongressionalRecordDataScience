 Well, the Republicans have got the wheel hard over, pedal to the metal. They are spinning doughnuts. And they want another 90 days or 60 days--it was 90 days yesterday; 60 days today--to spin doughnuts until they run out of fuel on their side of the aisle.  Look, the Senate, which previous to this leadership was the most dysfunctional legislative body in the land, has passed a 2-year bill with reforms and streamlining with half of the Republican Senators, including some members of the Flat Earth Caucus, voting for it. It received 74 votes in the Senate. Nothing gets 74 votes in the Senate. But you're refusing to bring that bill up because--we might get something done around here. So how about another 60 days to spin our wheels?  Well, let's have a little bit of history here: February 8, 2011, Chairman Mica: ``We'll have a surface transportation bill by the August recess.'' That was, what, 2011. Oops. Well, then in August of 2011, Chairman Mica: ``I will agree to one additional highway program extension.'' Oops. He's asking for yet another and another and today yet another.  Well, then, spin forward quickly to November of 2011, Speaker Boehner: ``House will pass a highway bill this year.'' That was last year. Then we go forward to February 1, 2012. Here's the problem: they've got a bunch of people on their side who hate government so much that they're willing to destroy the national transportation program to kill it. We are not making the claim, Speaker Boehner, that spending taxpayer money on transportation projects creates jobs, are we, huh?  They hate government so much, they will say that investment by the government in building a national transportation system and maintaining it and rebuilding it with ``Made in America'' requirements does not create jobs. Why would he say that? Because they've got 80 people on their side of the aisle who do not believe we should have a national transportation plan or policy. They're willing to let our roads, bridges, and highways crumble.  This is the pre-Dwight David Eisenhower--a Republican President--National Highway System program. This is the brand-spiffy-new Kansas Turnpike that ended in this farmer's field on the Oklahoma border. This went on for years because Oklahoma didn't deliver its section. They want to go back to those good old days. No Federal mandates. No Federal transportation system. Oh, okay. So the Port of Los Angeles and the people of southern California should pay for everything that relates to getting freight in and out of L.A. It doesn't affect the rest of the United States of America. Or the Port of Portland or the Port of Seattle or the ports on the east coast.  Our competitor nations get it. They're spending. They're investing. Even countries with austerity programs, like Britain, they're putting people back to work. Despite what the Speaker had to say to the Flat Earth Caucus over there, it does create jobs and investments. We need to move forward.  Now they're saying, Oh, no problem, just another temporary delay while we get our act together on our side of the aisle. Well, again, we already heard the statement, no more, only one more temporary extension. That was about 9 months ago. And we're finding now that actually the delays are costing jobs, uncertainty costs jobs. States can't make commitments for major projects and investments if they don't know if there is going to be Federal money there in 90 days. Ninety days? Oh, 60 days. I forgot. In 60 days. They're going to plan a long-term project that can last 60 days? No, I don't think so.  So in North Carolina, the Secretary of Transportation says: The delays have cost 41,000 jobs. That seems a little high to me. But Nevada, 4,000 jobs. Maryland, 4,000 jobs. Michigan, 3,500 jobs. Adding it up across the country, even if we use the low numbers, we're talking tens of thousands of job opportunities lost because they can't get their act together.  Just let us vote on the Senate bill. That's all we're asking. I mean, I think there might be a few people on your side of the aisle who would agree with their Republican colleagues in the Senate and support it. And I can guarantee we would get almost every Democrat on this side of the aisle to vote for it.  You can't even get your own people to vote for your own bill. You are wrapped around the axle on your own caucus day after day. You have to pretend it won't create jobs. Well, that's not enough for them.  Paul Ryan has now proposed in the budget, which we're going to vote on next, that we should decrease funding in transportation by 35 percent. But you're saying over there that you want to continue the current levels. Well, you'd better get it together because if you're going to support the Ryan budget, then you've just voted to cut transportation beginning October 1 by 35 percent. That's about 500,000 jobs. But what the heck.  You guys hate government so much, you hate America so much that you won't do what's necessary to put this country back together, to rebuild the infrastructure that was given to us by Democrats and Republicans alike for more than half a century, never in a partisan way. This is the first experiment, the first attempt to pass a totally partisan bill, and you're failing on your own side of the aisle.                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
