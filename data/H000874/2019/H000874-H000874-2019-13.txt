Speaker, let me tell the gentleman very candidly, I have not discussed with Mr. Nadler or others on the Judiciary Committee that issue. So I really can't give you the rationale that was articulated by the chair or by others.  I will say, however, that the President has indicated he wants to move with dispatch on this issue. We are doing that, and we have little time left. Very frankly, there were other witnesses to come forward, and very frankly, there were a lot of witnesses who were precluded from coming forward that we thought would amplify, frankly, people who work for and with the President who may have had information to give. But I can't specifically articulate the rationale, but we can get that for you.
