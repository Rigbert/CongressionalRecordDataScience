 President, I rise today to pay tribute to someonewho has given so much back to the great Commonwealth of Kentucky--someone who has taken it upon himself to make an investment in the betterment of his community, county, and State for generations to come. I am speaking of Mr. Jim Booth of Inez, KY.  Mr. Booth has kept the town of Inez, located in Martin County, close to his heart his entire life. In this town he graduated from high school, met his wife, Linda, and paid his way through Morehead State University by working part-time in the region's coal mines. So many milestones in Jim Booth's life have taken place in this eastern Kentucky town, it is no surprise that he is so devoted to giving something back to the place that's given him and his family so much.  Jim Booth combined a business administration degree, love for his community and its residents, and hard work to stimulate the local economy across the board. It has been said that there isn't a single growth project in Martin County that doesn't have Jim and Linda Booth's fingerprints all over it. The couple manages a coal company, a Ford dealership, real-estate agencies, convenience stores, hotels, insurance agencies, and a building supply store.  With so many successful projects in so many industries, it may seem that Jim Booth has a lot to brag about. But Jim is a man of modesty and humility. He makes it a point not to boast about his own accomplishments, but the accomplishments others have made from the little push that he gave them. Jim has helped to bring over 2,000 jobs to the area, and he is grateful for the exceptional employees that he has been so blessed with.  Booth's story is one of success in the free market, and a testimony to what can happen when a small business is given room to take root and grow. Mr. Booth bought his first coal mine when he was just 25 years old. At the time, the tax rate was 70 percent, and he remembers having to borrow against his own income for the next year just to pay the business's taxes. ``Then, when Reagan became President and taxes went down--BOOM. We're the best story you'll find for how success comes from tax relief,'' says Jim.  Over the next few years, the business experienced tremendous growth and success. Jim went on to start a building supply company, and from this he put into effect his most important piece of business advice--be your own best customer. Mr. Booth made the necessary purchases from the building supply store to assist in building numerous hotels, convenience stores, and other various buildings and business over the years.  Mr. Booth has a vision of renovating and remodeling virtually the entire city of Inez's local infrastructure at some time or another. He is almost halfway through this process, as he has already made headway providing new facilities for the Martin County Board of Education and the Martin County Economic Development Board, of which he is the chairman.  The most prized accomplishment of Mr. Booth is the Roy F. Collier Community Center, named in honor of Jim's late friend and business partner who passed away in 2005. The facility houses a movie theater, indoor track, fitness center, arcade, and large meeting rooms available for reservation. The versatile community center provides entertainment to over 200,000 residents of Kentucky from across the state annually.  Along with all of these major improvements to his local community, Jim has also sponsored a local basketball tournament, provided the chance for anyone who is interested to become a certified coal miner, and headed up a campaign that helps combat youth obesity called ``Martin County on the Move'' with United States Representative Hal Rogers. While it may seem like Jim has a lot to celebrate, he stays focused on what all of his hard work is really about.  ``This is home, Linda and I decided to stay here; build here and improve our community for the next generation,'' Jim says. Jim is determined to providing as much inspiration and as many opportunities as he can to those individuals who share with him the same ``home'' of Martin County, KY.  Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask my Senate colleagues to join me in commemorating the accomplishments of this treasured citizen of the Commonwealth of Kentucky.  In 2011, an article was included in a publication released by the Southeast Kentucky Chamber of Commerce that featured the many accomplishments that Jim Booth has been able to generate throughout his life thus far. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record that article.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to appear in the Record as follows:        [From the Southeast Kentucky Chamber of Commerce, 2011]                               Jim Booth                   Committed to Economic Development       There's an old adage that says ``Bloom where you are      planted.'' It's apparent that Jim and Linda Booth have taken      that saying to heart. Not only have their family and      businesses prospered in Martin County, but they have worked      to make the entire county ``bloom.'' You can hardly enter a      building, walk a trail, or have a bite to eat in which the      Booths weren't involved. A short list of businesses the      Booths operate include coal mining, a Ford dealership,      convenience stores, real estate, building supplies, hotels,      and insurance, but the underlying theme is their dedication      to cultural and economic development in their hometown.       ``There's no question, we could have gone other places and      it would have been easier, and maybe more profitable as far      as the retail side goes,'' Jim explains, ``but I really know      that someone had to be involved here in our community. There      haven't been very many people willing to do that, but I can      tell you, the team we've put together has been able to make      our enterprises profitable. Mostly, it has allowed us to      employ a lot of people. We employ about 800 in retail and we      have around 1,400 coal miners. One way we have made our      enterprises work is that we are one of the best customers of      about every business we've started. That's given us a base      for some sustainability.''       ``One of the first businesses we started was a building      supply, and the next one was a mine supply business, so we      were, of course, good customers of both of them. When we      built hotels, we used our building supply to furnish the      materials. Then we put a team together to build the hotels. I      entered into a partnership with my brother-in-law, Kevin      Davis, who operates Fast Change Lube & Oil, a chain of      Pennzoil Lube Centers. Kevin has done an excellent job in      growing our stores, which today we have over 21 lube centers      and six car washes. We're a good customer of our insurance      companies and, of course, our convenience stores. Even the      Ford dealership, we're probably one of the best customers of      the dealership. It's not necessarily all been calculated in      advance--sometimes opportunities just arise. We entered into      the car dealership business in order to keep one here, then      we lost the Chevrolet store when the government took over GM.      But we still have Ford.''       Jim and Linda Booth both graduated from Warfield High      School; Linda a year after Jim. Jim started college at      Morehead State University and Linda began next year. In order      to pay their way through school, Jim became a part-time coal      miner. ``We drove here (Inez) on weekends,'' Jim remembers,      ``and I worked in a service station for my brother. Then,      during the day, I worked underground in the mine. Linda and I      would drive back to Morehead in time for school. I had Monday      through Thursday classes typically, so we could come home on      Thursdays. When I graduated, I interviewed for a couple of      personnel jobs--I have a business administration degree--and      I realized I made more money working part-time as a coal      miner than any other offer I was getting at the time.       I said to Linda, `Let's go back and let me work a little      while at the mine,' '' Jim remembers. ``I had a hard time      talking her into it but I convinced her,'' he smiles. ``Real      quickly I got into management, and by the time I had      completed three years' experience, I became a foreman. When I      was 25 years old, I got the opportunity to start my own mine.      Then, when I was 27, I incurred a hefty sum in income tax!      That was when the tax rate was 70 percent. I had a hard time      scraping up the money, and then there was no money left for      us--it all went to the federal government and I was      struggling. I had to borrow money from the next year's      earnings to pay the taxes. Then, when Reagan became president      and taxes went down--BOOM. We're the best story you'll find      for how success comes from tax relief. We would not have      survived if the taxes had stayed the same. We bought a brand      new set of equipment for our mine. We'd been in business nine      years and had not been able to afford new equipment. We had      money to use to invest then, and we started growing. We had      operated only contract mines until 1988, at which time we      were able to get our own operation. We bought an Ashland coal      operation in Johnson County, and we began cleaning and      washing the coal at the prep plant, marketing the coal--the      entire process.''       ``During that time was when we started to diversify,'' Jim      continues. ``We built our first development building--a      building that we leased to the post office--it had apartments      upstairs. That was the very first investment we completed. We      bought the building supply in the early '80s and put the     group together that started using our supplies--we buy from      ourselves when we build houses, apartments, hotels, and any      other retail developments.''       Jim Booth has many things to be proud of--building an      economic conglomerate from scratch, for one--but he is very      modest when speaking of his business accomplishments. What he      seems most proud of are the jobs and opportunities he's been      able to bring to the local people.       ``We started the convenience stores in '84. The first Fast      Lane was in Lovely, KY. We have a really good team--James      Mills manages Fast Lane, Fast Lane Tobacco Stores, and      Mountain Petroleum, and he does a really good job. Fast Lane      has been a great success--not just for Martin County but for      the region. Locally, we do tremendous things for the school      system. The Fast Lane Classic is second to none--I doubt      there is a better pre-season basketball tournament in the      state of Kentucky. It's held at Sheldon Clark High School on      the Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend, and some of the best      teams in the tri-state participate. UK Wildcat Patrick      Patterson participated in our tournament when he played at      Huntington High.       ``Through our businesses, we're able to help a lot of these      kids get into the workforce,'' Jim continues. ``They'll tell      me, `I got to buy a car because of Taco Bell or KFC' because      that's where they work. There wouldn't be those kinds of      opportunities here for kids if we didn't have the retail      jobs.       ``On the coal mining sector, we've allowed anybody from the      area who wants to be a miner and is qualified to train and      become a certified coal miner. To be honest with you, we need      coal miners right now. We have several vacancies in our      mining operations. We could hire qualified people right      now.''       After Fast Lane, knowing the area needed a hotel, Jim and      his team built the Inez Super 8 Hotel. He chose the location      because the site had the necessary infrastructure. From      there, they moved out from Martin County and began what he      refers to as the Interstate Hotels--located in Mt. Sterling,      Catlettsburg, and two in Huntington--all on I 64. They're all      doing well.       When asked to describe his business plan, Jim explains it      very simply: ``We have mostly grown from within based on      common synergies. Almost everyone in management has started      on the ground floor and worked their way through the system.      Most are local residents. We have a lot of families that      every member of the family has worked for us. We try to      provide all the opportunities this area can support.''       The companies have ventured out of Martin County. Jim's      son-in-law, Jeff Fraley, operates the United States      Achievement Academy in Lexington, which is similar to Who's      Who. They do all the printing for the book and have about 100      employees. Two other businesses in Lexington are Southeast      Mail, the largest bulk mailer in Lexington, and a Bluegrass      branch of Elite Insurance.       Booth Enterprises has gone into Louisa with the new      Yatesville Crossing shopping center, containing retail      businesses such as Wal-Mart, Appalachian Wireless, and Radio      Shack. Plans are to build a medical center on the lower      level. As an offspring of the building supply in Lovely, a      Surplus Home Center has been opened in Louisa. The company      buys oversupply items from different places and ships them to      the Center. The buyer is Martin County native Carolea Mills      who is also a board member of the Roy F. Collier Community      Center.       Jim Booth really lights up when describing the Collier      Community Center and its programs. ``It is probably the most      unique centralized facility Martin County has ever      established, and it is highly utilized by the community,'' he      says. ``Roy Collier was one of my business partners when I      started out, and he passed in 2005. I donated the property,      so I was allowed to name the building in honor of Roy. The      Community Center has four digital 3 D cinemas with surround      sound, an indoor walking track, a gift store, a Fun Zone      Arcade, a fitness center, video conferencing, a computer lab,      and large rooms for receptions or meetings. Over 125,000      people per year make use of it. It's a real drawing card--     people come from surrounding counties--especially for the      cinema.''       Jim was also instrumental in working with Morehead State      University, where he has served as chairman of the Board of      Regents, to bring the ``Martin County on the Move'' program      to Martin County and the Collier Community Center. He and      President Wayne Andrews of Morehead State University met with      U.S. Representative Hal Rogers to discuss the problem of      obesity in young people. The Congressman secured a year's      grant to encourage Martin County kids to be more active and      to select healthy food. Although the program is based at the      Collier Community Center, the health directors work through      the local school system. One year, Jim bought pedometers for      all the kids in 6th grade! Started in Martin, the program      will progress into other counties, with Lawrence County the      next possible choice. ``Martin County on the Move'' has been      hugely successful in creating new health and wellness      initiatives in the community.       Jim's personal involvement throughout Inez is evident by      his leadership as chairman of the Martin County Economic      Development Board, which has oversight of the new Business      Center. The Martin County Board of Education and the office      of the Kentucky Health & Human Services were both in      buildings that were falling apart around them. Now an open,      light-filled, modern building with walls filled with art and      the very best in technology stands as a beacon of progress in      the community. It is home to both organizations and has      additional leasable space as well. Built with coal severance      tax money and the support of Judge Kelly Callaham, the county      is allowed to keep the revenue to maintain the facility.      Christi Brown, executive director of the Martin County      Economic Development Authority, spearheaded development of      the Business Center and presently manages the Center.       The Martin County Historical Society was also built on      property Jim and Linda Booth donated. The Historical Society      has a small privately owned gift shop, located on the first      floor of an adjoining building, and the rent helps with      operating expenses of the Society. Mike Duncan, president of      Inez Deposit Bank, allows students from their summer intern      program to volunteer at the Society. The students work at the      bank, participate in cultural programs, hear business      speakers (including Jim Booth), and work on their own family      trees at the Historical Society.       Jim transitions seamlessly from recalling the past to      looking toward the future. ``County Judge/Executive Kelly      Callaham wants to build a new courthouse and continue to      utilize the existing facility as a redesigned cultural      center. We're also looking at doing some redevelopment on the      east side of Inez's Main Street. We want to remodel or      replace most of the buildings, and we hope to make retail      space downstairs and office or living quarters upstairs.      We're working with the Appalachian Regional Commission to      develop a plan.''       It's safe to say that whatever Jim puts his efforts into      will exceed expectations, will definitely be something to      benefit both Martin County and southeastern Kentucky, and      will be a source of pride and inspiration.       It's plain to see that Jim Booth is dedicated to making      things happen in Martin County, buy why does he put such      effort and heart into every project?       ``This is home,'' he says. ``Linda and I decided to stay      here; build here and improve our community for the next      generation.'' That they have done, and they are to be      commended for their efforts.                          ____________________
