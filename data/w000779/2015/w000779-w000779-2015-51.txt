However, I am especially troubled about amendment No. 2626, which would significantly expand a badly outdated Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. I have sought to modernize the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and I believe that amendment No. 2626 would take that law--the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act--in the wrong direction. I would object to any unanimous consent request that includes that amendment. Therefore, I object to this request.
