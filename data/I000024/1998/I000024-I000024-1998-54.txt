I think the point is here in today's report. We talk about the fact that only 27 eligible carrier pilots had applied for the ACP agreements. The minimum expectation of the Navy was 82. That means that approximately one-third are re-upping for this particular duty.  It costs $6 million to put a new pilot in the seat of an F-16. We are at the lowest retention rate in the history of America. And if you look at the exits surveys, they will say it is not because of pay, it is because of the type of operation they are having to do to support Bosnia. And they are unable to carry out the red flag training and all the serious training that would be necessary should we have to send them into combat.  So I do support this. I would like a much stronger amendment than this, but I would certainly support--this is the best thing out there.
