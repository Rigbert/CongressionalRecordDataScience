 President, I rise today to honor the service and sacrifice of the hundreds of Korean war veterans living in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. This July 27 marked the 55th anniversary of the cease-fire that ended that conflict.  After 3 years of battle which nearly forced American and South Korean troops from the peninsula, the determination and bravery of our servicemen prevailed. Our heroes in uniform ensured that the people of South Korea would remain free.  Recently, nearly 300 Kentuckian Korean war veterans were recognized for their service by retired Korean Major General Seung-Woo Choi. Major General Choi was a child during the Korean war, but he wanted to say thank you to the brave Americans who fought to protect his and his family's freedom. So he traveled from South Korea to my hometown of Louisville, KY, to honor them.  I ask unanimous consent that the full newspaper article describing this ceremony be printed in the Record. I know the entire U.S. Senate stands with me to recognize the tremendous valor of our veterans, and to honor the sacrifice of those who did not return.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          [From the Louisville Courier-Journal, July 25, 2008]     Korean War Vets Honored: S. Korean General Presents Medallions                           (By J.D. Williams)       Looking back, Joseph Scott said he is thankful to be a      veteran of the Korean War.       In 1950, Scott joined his two brothers, James and Talmadge,      and enlisted in the Army.       Yesterday, the 77-year-old and nearly 300 other Korean War      veterans from Kentucky were honored at the Kentucky      Exposition Center for their service.       ``I'm thankful I was there,'' Scott said of the war. ``It      was quite an experience.''       The veterans were given a medallion designed by retired      Korean Maj. Gen. Seung-Woo Choi, who came to Louisville from      South Korea to honor them. Choi was a child during the Korean      War, but has made it a priority to offer his thanks to      veterans of the war that ensured South Korea's freedom.       Since 2002, Choi has presented over 5,000 medallions to      veterans across the nation.       People from various veterans' organizations spoke at the      event, and the Kentucky Korean Women's Choir performed.       ``The sacrifice you made for the Korean people has not been      forgotten . . . you saved our freedom,'' said Charles Park, a      native of Korea who is with the Korea Foundation of Kentucky.       Marilyn Mullins, 67, the widow of Edward Mullins, said her      husband would have loved to be there. He died in April 2007      of complications from diabetes.       ``I wish he could have been here to accept it himself,''      Mullins said of receiving the medallion. ``He would have been      glad to meet the general.''       She said the medallion is the only award her late husband      has been presented. She said he was supposed to receive the      National Defense Service Medal, the Korean Service Medal and      the United Nations Service Medal, but they never reached him.       James Hall, 76, of Bowling Green, said he was glad to be      with fellow Korean War vets.       Hall, who was 18 when he was deployed to Korea, was in the      battle at Chosin Reservoir, which he called a ``horrible      place at a horrible time.''       He said the severe cold with snow and without heat and warm      food was nearly unbearable, but soldiers endured to ensure      South Korea's freedom.       ``I had tried to put a lot of things about Korea out of my      mind, but it was wonderful to be with the veterans I served      with,'' Hall said. ``It reminded me of how important it was      for us to be there so South Korea could be free.''                          ____________________
