President, I have spent a great deal of my time in the U.S. Senate working on telecommunications issues, and studying how changing technology is having an impact on our Nation. In particular, I have been interested and concerned about the effect of the so-called information superhighway on rural States like Vermont.  With this in mind, I asked a young student at Champlain Valley Union High School to take a broad survey on computer use in his high school. What I will include in the Record is the report that this student, Steve Waltien, sent to me recently.  I find his results fascinating and encouraging. You will see the vast majority of high school freshmen and seniors are familiar with computers, and use computers whether in school, at home, or both. Now, I realize that Champlain Valley Union High School is not necessarily indicative of the rest of Vermont or the Nation. It is no doubt on the cutting edge of new technologies, and is led by one of the finest principals in the country, Val Gardner.  But Mr. President, this study shows just how dramatically our lives are changing; in particular, it shows how dramatically our children's lives are changing. The decisions we make on issues affecting access to telecommunications issues will have a direct impact on our children, especially in rural areas like Vermont.  I am grateful to Steve Waltien for his well-written and thorough study. He and I have e-mailed each other on this subject, and am delighted to share his work with my fellow Senators.  I ask that a study on high school computer use be printed in the Record.  The study follows:                          Computer Use Survey(By Stevenson H. Waltien III)                          ____________________
