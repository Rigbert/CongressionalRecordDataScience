  I quote Washington Post columnist William Raspberry, writing in a recent op-ed piece:       Fatherless families are America's single largest source of      poverty. The Annie E. Casey Foundation, ``Kids Count,'' once      reported that Americans who failed to complete high school,      to get married and to reach age 20 before having their first      child were nearly 10 times as likely to live in poverty as      those who did these three things.  The Brookings Institution, obviously a liberal think tank, published an analysis of a variety of factors that couldreduce poverty. The authors from Brookings concluded that the combination of education, full-time work, and marriage could reduce poverty rates from 13 percent to 17 percent.  The bipartisan welfare reform bill reported out of the Senate Committee on Finance would make substantial progress in helping families make progress in areas that we know would reduce poverty. We could not get an agreement with the other side to get this legislation discussed on the floor. We got it out of the committee in a bipartisan way. It deals with the issues of education, work, and marriage.  Following upon the views of the Brookings Institute and the views of the Annie E. Casey Foundation, rather than engage in politically motivated efforts, we should work together to implement these serious policies of education, of work, and of marriage. Together, by implementing these policies, and we know these policies work, we will take one giant step toward reducing poverty.  I don't think Senator Kennedy's amendment is necessary. I yield the floor.
