I know that Mr. Terry has spoken for all of us, and Mr. Engel, Mr. Pomeroy.  For those of us who had the opportunity to serve for an extended period of time with Peter Hoagland, for those of us who knew Peter after he left the Congress of the United States, this is a sad day. It is an appropriate day, however, to remember, as Mr. Engel said, a gentleman who had nothing bad to say about any of our Members on either side of the aisle; a Member who was positive in his approach; a Member who was gracious to all; a Member who cared deeply about his country, about his State, and about his service in this institution.  Peter Hoagland was a good and decent man who served his country well, and will be sorely missed by us all.
