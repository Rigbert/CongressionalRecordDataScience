 I do know that. The gentleman has to balance a whole lot of priorities. I appreciate that very much.  However, I think the gentleman would not disagree with me that if we help the lower-income senior citizens with LIHEAP to adequately heat their homes, their electric bills are going to go up because their energy is going out the door and out the roof, would the gentleman not agree with that?
