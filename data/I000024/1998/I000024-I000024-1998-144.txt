President, today I would like to salute several outstanding young women who have earned the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. Gold Award. All are members of the Red Lands Council of Girl Scouts in Oklahoma City, OK.  These outstanding young women will be honored on April 30, 1998, for earning the highest achievement award in Girl Scouting. The Girl Scout Gold Award symbolizes the outstanding accomplishments in the areas of leadership, community service, career planning, and personal development. The Girl Scout Award can be earned by girls ages 14-17 or in grades 9-12.  Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., an organization serving over 2.5 million girls, has awarded more than 25,000 Girl Scout Gold Awards to Senior Girl Scouts since the inception of the program in 1980. To receive the award, a Girl Scout must fulfill five requirements: earn four interest project patches, earn the Career Exploration pin, earn the Senior Girl Scout Challenge, and design and implement a Girl Scout Gold Award Project. A plan for fulfilling the requirements of the award is created by the Senior Girl Scout and carried out through close cooperation between the girl and an adult Girl Scout volunteer.  The names and projects of the young women receiving the Girl Scout Gold Award are as follows:  Mary Foster put up a fence, cleaned up and fixed headstones in her community cemetery.  Laura Hubbard made a camp song book and set up a workshop to teach children and adults.  Taneya Hamlin made a take-home booklet for children to learn about nature. She achieved this by designing and drawing an activity/coloring book for young visitors to Martin Park Nature Center.  Rebecca Shappie provided a method to raise money for scholarships for kids to go to camp.  Christina Hammond, Carrie Heaton, and Sara Brannan, designed an Erosion Control Project at Lake Keystone which will benefit present and future generations.  Patricia Bardick designed a program called ``Babies, Bears and Books.''  Jennifer Hall designed a program called ``Boredom Buster and Beauty Bags'' for the Baptist Children's Home.  Parthenia Harding, Erica Hill, Nina Holman, Jamila Jones and Rachel Landry-Gators set up and taught a basic American Red Cross course at an elementary school.  Michelle Lambertus created ``Huggable Gingerbread,'' a puppet show for children in the hospital.  Joelle Parrot and Jamie Smith organized and staffed a community blood drive.  The earning of the Girl Scout Gold Award is a major accomplishment for these young women, and I believe they should receive the public recognition due them for this significant service to their community and their country.                          ____________________
