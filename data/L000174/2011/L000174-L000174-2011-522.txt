This has been very helpful. I appreciate what he said. I found interesting the list of patents from his home State of Illinois, and I think each one of us can point to some of those with pride. If we are going to stay competitive with the rest of the world, we have to get this bill passed.It has been more than 60 years since we updated our patent law. We are way behind the rest of the world. We have to be able to compete, so I thank the Senator.           Further Modification to Amendment 121, as Modified  Madam President, I have cleared this with the Senator from Iowa. Notwithstanding the adoption of the Leahy-Grassley amendment No. 121, as modified, I ask unanimous consent the amendment be modified further with the changes that are at the desk.
