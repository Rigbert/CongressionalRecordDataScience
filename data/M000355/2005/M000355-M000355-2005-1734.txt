 President, this morning there will be a 2-hour period for morning business. Following that time, the Senate will resume consideration of S. 5, the Class Action Fairness bill. As the majority leader noted last night, we made substantial progress on the bill yesterday. Senator Feingold's amendment on remand limit is pending. It is our desire to have that vote around 12:30 or so today.  We will also need to dispose of the Durbin amendment on mass actions. I know that discussions continue with respect to that Durbin amendment.  We are not aware of any other amendments to be offered, and therefore it is hoped and expected that we can proceed to final passage of the class action bill at a reasonable hour this afternoon.  Finally, I would say that the two leaders are close to an agreement on the consideration of the Chertoff nomination for next week. We will lock in that unanimous consent at the first opportunity.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
