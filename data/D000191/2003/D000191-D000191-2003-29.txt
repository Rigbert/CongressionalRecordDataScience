He read from something from the Coast Guard that says they are neutral on this. If someone else condemns the land and the museum is built there, they will accept it. That is what that letter says. That is the bottom line here. We are not protecting these families who have lived on that land for nearly a century and do not want to give it up. An 87-year-old woman and her husband, a merchant mariner from World War II. I would just like a simple answer. I know the gentleman does not generally support eminent domain, he added something with his own family, but the question is simple. Would the gentleman agree, will he stand up and say ``yes'' in response to the question, will the gentleman say that this museum should not be built on property taken from these families in New London, Connecticut, by eminent domain, yes or no. It is a simple question.
