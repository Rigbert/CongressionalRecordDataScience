Unfortunately, it does not look like that for most people in my district. In fact, it really is not that way for most people in America. The combination of misplaced priorities and trade policies that export jobs and depress wages in this country have hurt Americans. In fact, last year, according to the IRS, 99 percent of Americans, all those who earn less than $350,000 a year, saw a decline in their real income. But I think the gentleman from California and the Republican leadership and the White House are looking at that 1 percent, who are doing phenomenally well. The tax cuts have been an incredible boon, over $120,000 per year in tax cuts for families who earn over $1.3 million a year. They are doing just great. Unfortunately, we are borrowing the money to give them the tax cuts and handing the bill to working families and their kids and their grandkids as we continue to reduce the tax burden on corporations and the wealthy.  He said, ``Boy, the economy is booming.'' That is kind of interesting. Over the last 17 quarters, the GDP has grown at 2.8 percent, right around the rate of inflation, but in the last six business cycles, it grew at a rate of 40 percent more than that during recovery periods. He bragged about job growth. The United States only has 1.3 percent job growth, much of it in the public sector, under the watch of this administration, since March 2001, whereas in previous business cycles, job growth was closer to 9 percent over the same period, six times the rate of growth. Private sector job growth is only up 0.8 percent. Wage and salary income has also grown anemically. As I said earlier, 99 percent of families and working people in America saw their real incomes decline last year. One percent, $300,000 to $1.3 million, did pretty well. But the people over $1.3 million, they did phenomenally well.  So what is the answer of the Republicans this week? Cut benefits that might flow to that 99 percent of the people. Student loans for kids trying to learn and do better and have a better ability to earn in their adult lives and become more productive Americans, $14.3 billion in cuts for student loans, double the origination fee for student loans. That is a cut that needs to be made according to the Republican majority.  And then there are the cuts in long-term care, foster care. The family values side of the aisle over there wants to cut long-term care for struggling seniors and their families and foster care. That is extraordinary. And then, of course, they want to slash Medicaid. What they do not tell you is they are dumping that burden on our States who are already struggling. They are going to add to the 45 million people who are uninsured for health care in the United States of America through those cuts. But they say those cuts must be made. Why? Because they have become suddenly fiscally responsible after a 62 percent increase in the debt during the Bush administration and the Republican Congress over the last 5 years? No. Because they want to make room for more tax cuts because, as we heard earlier, trickledown is working great. Those people who earn $1.3 million with that extra 130,000 bucks a year in tax cuts, which are added to the deficit which all the rest of us will have to pay for, they are spending some of that money, some of it even in the United States of America. Sometimes they are hiring people to cut their lawns, or wash their boats. Yachts. They need that money. They need it more than the kid who wants to get a college education. They need it more than the family that is struggling to figure out how they are going to pay for long-term care for their seniors. They need it more than the kids who need foster care in this country. Those rich people need it more because they will trickle it down upon the rest of us.  So that is the game they are playing this week. They are going to pretend they are making tough cuts that need to be made. They won't take on the tough cuts. You want to talk about tough cuts? Let's do away with the stupid idea of going back to the Moon by borrowing $100 billion. We have already been there. Why do we want to borrow $100 billion to go to the Moon? How about Star Wars? The general in charge says, hey, it has better than a zero percent chance of working if anybody ever shoots a missile at us. Better than a zero percent chance at a cost of $100 billion, $10 billion a year ongoing. Farm subsidies for farmers who earn over $100,000 a year on corporate farms, we could save billions there. Not to mention if we just reinstated the rate of taxation for people who earn over $300,000 a year that they paid during the booming nineties, we would save $300 billion over the next 5 years. There is a better way to run this country and we are not hearing it from them.                          ____________________[Page H9700]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    FEDERAL SPENDING AND THE DEFICIT
