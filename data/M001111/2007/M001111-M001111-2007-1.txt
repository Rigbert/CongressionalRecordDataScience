 President, the final paragraph of the letter our Appropriations Committee received from Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley of the Finance Committee states that they look forward to working with our Appropriations Committee as partners in advancing the needs of our aviation system.  As one member of the subcommittee that oversees aviation funding, I express my strong interest in working as a partner with both committees to come up with a bill that fully addresses the future needs of our national aviation system. I hope that important effort will be one of the Senate's first priorities when we reconvene next year.  I yield the floor.
