President, I rise to introduce, with my good friends Senator Hatch, Senator Mikulski and Senator Durbin, the Federal Prosecutors' Retirement Benefit Equity Act of 2003. This bill would correct an inequity that exists under current law, whereby Federal prosecutors receive substantially less favorable retirement benefits than other nearly all other people involved in the Federal criminal justice system. The bill would increase the retirement benefits given to Assistant United States Attorneys by including them as ``law enforcement officers'', LEOs, under the Federal Employees' Retirement System and the Civil Service Retirement System. The bill would also allow the Attorney General to designate other attorneys employed by the Department of Justice who act primarily as criminal prosecutors as LEO's for purposes of receiving these retirement benefits.  The primary reason for granting enhanced retirement benefits to LEOs is the often dangerous work of law enforcement. Currently, Assistant United States Attorneys, AUSAs, and other Federal prosecutors are not eligible for these enhanced benefits, which are enjoyed by the vast majority of other employees in the criminal justice system. This exclusion is unjustified. The relevant provisions of the United States Code dealing with retirement benefits define an LEO as an employee whose duties are, ``primarily the investigation, apprehension, or detention'' of individuals suspected or convicted of violating federal law. See 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec.  8331(20) & 8401(17). AUSAs and other federal prosecutors participate in planning investigations, interviewing witnesses both inside and outside of the office setting, debriefing defendants, obtaining warrants, negotiating plea agreements and representing the government at trials and sentencings, all of which fall within the definition of the duties performed by law enforcement officers. Indeed, once a defendant is brought to into the criminal justice system, the person with whom they have the most face-to-face contact, and often in an extremely confrontational environment, is the Federal prosecutor.  Although prosecutors do not personally execute arrests, searches and other physically dangerous activities, LEO status is accorded to many criminal justice employees who do not perform such tasks, such as pretrial services officers and probation officers and accountants, cooks and secretaries of the Bureau of Prisons. Moreover, because they are often the most conspicuous representatives of the government in the criminal justice system, Federal prosecutors are natural targets for threats of reprisals by vengeful criminals. Indeed, there are numerous incidents in which assaults and serious death threats have been made against federal prosecutors, sometimes resulting in significant disruption of their personal and family lives.  Only recently a veteran Federal prosecutor in the Western District of Washington was murdered in his home, and, although the crime remains unsolved, based upon the facts of the case the authorities have referred to the crime as a hit. In addition, I have received many other accounts from Federal prosecutors regarding specific threats to which they and their families have been subjected because of the performance of their duties. Federal prosecutors have written to me that they have been forced to relocate themselves and their families due to death threats; that they have been assaulted; that they and their families have been followed by members of criminal organizations; that have been forced to install security systems at their homes and to change their routes to and from the office to protect their safety and the safety of their families.  As our fight against terrorism continues, Federal prosecutors arel on the front lines once again as the symbols of our criminal justice system, and unfortunately therefore the targets of those who seek its downfall. Among other tasks, the Attorney General has designated AUSA's to play a major role working with police and Federal agents in each judicial district's Anti-Terrorism Task Force. One Federal prosecutor wrote to me stating that shortly after his name was in the local news as heading his district's Anti-Terrorism Task Force and he had spoken to his family about taking suitable precautions, that his young son came into his bedroom one night holding a hockey stick for protection asking about their safety. Thus, Federal prosecutors and their families will deal more than ever with a level of stress and danger that justifies their being treated as LEOs.  Another example of the danger facing Federal prosecutors appeared in the USA Today earlier this month. That article, which I ask unanimous consent to make part of the Congressional Record, reports that United States Attorney's will also be asked to play an advisory role in potential hostilities with Iraq. If there was ever an illustration of the importance of granting Federal prosecutors equal retirement status as their other law enforcement partners, this is it.  Enhanced retirement benefits are also justified by the Federal Government's need for experienced prosecutors to bring ever more sophisticated cases under increasingly complex Federal criminal laws. In recent years, we have seen the growth of complex Federal prosecutions to combat the threats posed by organized crime, drug cartels, terrorist groups and other sophisticated criminals. The prosecution of such difficult cases is best handled by experienced prosecutors. It is therefore in the public interest to provide reasonable financial incentives for talented, experienced prosecutors to remain in government service.  This bill would make Assistant United States Attorneys and other Federal prosecutors designated by the Attorney General eligible for immediate, unreduced retirement benefits at age 50 with 20 years of service. For example, prosecutors who are covered by the Civil Service Retirement System would receive 50 percent of the average of their three highest years' salary. Atthe same time, it would exempt prosecutors from the mandatory retirement provisions that require other law enforcement officers to retire at age 57. Because the loss of physical strength and agility does not adversely affect a person's ability to function as a prosecutor, there is no reason to mandate early retirement.  Two important features of this bill will contain its costs. First, the bill provides that incumbent Federal prosecutors are themselves responsible for making up the difference in individual contributions owed to the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund for their prior service. An incumbent has the choice of making up this difference either by making a payment up front or by accepting a reduction in retirement benefits. Second, government contributions for the prior service of incumbents are made ratably over a ten-year period under this bill. Thus, payments for prior government contributions are spread out to lessen the financial impact. These two provisions will insure that the cost of the bill is kept well within reason.  This bill enjoys broad, grass roots support. When Senator Hatch and I introduced this same bill in the last Congress, I received literally hundreds of letters supporting this bill, sent from over 40 states, District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The bill also enjoys support in the law enforcement community. The National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys, the Federal Criminal Investigators Association, and the Southern States Police Benevolent Association have all wrote me to voice support for the inclusion of AUSAs in the definition of an LEO. I tried, with Senator Hatch, to include this measure in our Department of Justice Authorization legislation in the last Congress, but the House would not agree to its inclusion in the conference report. I hope that we can work together in both houses to enact the bill in this Congress.  In addition, I know that other Senators, including Senator Mikulski, are considering additional measures to expand these same retirement benefits to other Federal employees who perform law enforcement functions, including IRS employees whose primary duty is to collect delinquent taxes. I cosponsored such a measure in the last Congress, and I continue to support and commend her leadership in bringing these matters to the forefront.  For all of these reasons, I am pleased to introduce this legislation with Senators Hatch, Mikulski and Durbin, and I urge its swift enactment into law.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record along with the sectional analysis and the newspaper article to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 640       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Tanks could be      parked next to mosques. Chemical weapons plants might also      produce medicine.       In a war with Iraq, U.S. commanders could often have an      agonizing choice: strike a target and run the risk of killing      civilians, and being accused by the rest of the world of      committing a war crime, or hold fire and run the risk that      Saddam Hussein will still have deadly weapons he can use      against U.S. and British troops or neighboring countries.       To help weigh those issues, the Pentagon has dispatched      dozens of attorneys to command posts in the region. Their      job: help keep the United States legal if President Bush      unleashes its fury against Saddam's forces.       Military commanders have long had legal advisers. But more      than ever, attorneys are in the teams that choose the      strategies, the targets and even the weapons to be used.      Lawyers from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines will be      working around-the-clock to be on hand when targets appear      and fast decisions are needed.       With so much of the world skeptical of U.S. intentions,      pressure will be high. ``The world expects the United States      to do the right thing,'' says Capt. Noah Malgeri, an Army      lawyer.                           Collateral damage       Col. Rocco Lamuro, who runs a course on ``targeting law''      at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, say that when air power came      of age in World War II, the missions would almost always be      planned weeks in advance. There weren't any spy satellites      sending ``real-time'' pictures of enemy movements--and thus      pushing commanders to make quick decisions on whether to      strike. In World War II, there was plenty of time to discuss      legalities and debate the potential ``collateral damage,''      the unintentional killing of civilians.       It was also true back then that collateral damage was      accepted as an unfortunate but natural part of war. Sixty      years ago, ``you might send 100 B-17 (bombers) to try to      destroy something that's within an acre,'' Lamuro says. There      were no ``smart bombs'' that could zero in on small targets.      It was assumed that many bombs would hit ground far from the      target. Today, Lamuro says, ``you'd send only one'' bomber or      missile, and the weapon would be expected to hit its target.       When missiles do go awry, as happened when the United      States accidentally struck the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade in      May 1999 or when a bomb dropped on Baghdad hit a shelter and      killed 408 civilians in 1991, there is alarm worldwide.       What do U.S. military lawyers--who work in offices of each      service's Judge Advocate General (made famous by the CBS-TV      show JAG)--use to guide them? The Law of Armed Conflict is a      set of rules derived primarily from post-World War II Geneva      Conventions. Commanders also must follow U.S. law and the top      command's rules of engagement.       The rules are not pie-in-the-sky pronouncements. They      reflect how battles are fought. They try to protect innocents      but recognize the reality of battle. ``If you're a priest      who's running around blessing people on the battlefield,      you're OK,'' Lamuro says. ``If you pick up a gun, you'll get      shot. You can't use a technicality to shield yourself.''       In most cases, there's little dispute about the legality of      clear military targets. A tank on a battlefield is always      fair game. A school is not--unless it can be proved that it's      used as a military site.       Other cases are less clear, and legal issues aren't the      only factors. There is, for instance, the issue of human      shields. The 1949 Geneva Convention specifically states that      the presence of civilians cannot be used to render a target      immune from attack. Just because an enemy has surrounded a      weapons depot with civilian volunteers does not make it an      illegal target. Even so, Lamuro says, commanders must also      worry about ``the CNN test.'' Is the target worth all the      loss of innocent life--and the inevitable outcry? Targets      such as dams and power plants also are hot-button issues      because their destruction would harm civilians. The      lawyers would advise they be destroyed only when      necessary, Lamuro says. It's practical advice, he says,      because the military must be ``as concerned with winning      the peace as winning the wars.''                              individuals       Targeting individuals is an especially difficult issue. A      year ago, there were numerous reports that a Predator drone      aircraft loaded with Hellfire missiles had the ousted Taliban      leader Mohammed Omar in its sights in Afghanistan. But no      missile was fired, reportedly on the advice of a lawyer.       It isn't known for sure whether the strike was scrubbed      because civilians were nearby or for some other reason. But      the incident provoked discussion about whether attorneys have      too much influence. Lamuro says it would be wrong ``to      overstate the lawyers's role.'' They are advisers, he says.      Commanders make the ultimate choice.       One of the hottest legal topics that would be decided only      at the highest levels is whether to target Saddam himself.      Legally, it could depend on timing: Lawyers say that before a      war, he would not be considered a valid military target. U.S.      policy also prohibits assassinations of leaders.       If there was a war and Saddam was commanding the Iraqi      army, he would be considered a combatant and could be      targeted.       If he no longer had that role and allied forces caught him      fleeing, the target status might be revoked. Instead, he      might be given exile or arrested and charged with war crimes.       Another tenet of the Law of Armed Conflict is that the      force used should be proportional to the task. For targeters,      that fits neatly into their objective of conserving      firepower.       ``I look for the minimum number of targets that must be      struck to adequately achieve the commander's objective,''      says one U.S. intelligence officer, who asked that his name      not be reported to protect his identity. In the end, neither      the lawyers nor the other officers in the targeting teams      have the final word on what will be struck.       Air plans are reviewed and approved up the chain of      command--again with attorneys on hand--to make sure the      individual pieces add up to a war plan that is legally      defensible.                                  ____     ``Federal Prosecutors Retirement Benefit Equity Act of 2003''                      section-by section analysis       Sec. 1. Short title. Contains the short title, the      ``Federal Prosecutors Retirement Benefit Equity Act of      2003.''       Sec. 2. Inclusion of Federal prosecutors in the definition      of a law enforcement officer. Amends 5 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 8331      and 8401 to extend the enhanced law enforcement officer,      ``LEO'' retirement benefits to Federal prosecutors, defined      to include assistant United States attorneys, ``AUSAs, and      such other attorneys in the Department of Justice as are      designated by the Attorney General of the     United States. This section also exempts Federal prosecutors      from mandatory retirement provisions for LEO's under the      civil service laws.       Sec. 3. Provisions relating to incumbents. Governs the      treatment of incumbent Federal prosecutors who would be      eligible for LEO retirement benefits under this Act. This      section requires the Office of Personnel Management to      provide notice to incumbents of their rights under this      subtitle; allows incumbents to opt out of the LEO retirement      program; governs the crediting of prior service by      incumbents; and provides for make-up contributions for prior      service of incumbents to the Civil Service Retirement and      Disability Fund. The section gives incumbents the option of      either contributing their own share of any make-up      contributions or receiving a proportionally lesser retirement      benefit. The section allows the government to contribute its      share of any make-up contribution ratably over a ten year      period.       Sec. 4. Department of Justice administrative actions.      Allows the Attorney General to designate additional      Department of Justice attorneys with substantially similar      responsibilities, in addition to assistant United States      attorneys, as Federal prosecutors for purposes of this Act      and thus be eligible for the LEO retirement benefits.                                 ______                                       By
