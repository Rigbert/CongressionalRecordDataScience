President, today I am introducing legislation that would replace the current fragmented Federal food safety system with a consolidated, independent agency with responsibility for all Federal food safety activities--the Safe Food Act. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Torricelli in this important effort.  Make no mistake, our country has been blessed with the safest and most abundant food supply in the world. However, we can do better. The General Accounting Office estimates thatas many as 33 million people will suffer food poisoning this year and more than 9,000 will die. The Department of Health and Human Services predicts that foodborne illnesses and deaths are likely to increase 10 to 15 percent over the next decade. The annual cost of foodborne illnesses in this country may rise to as high as $22 billion per year.  According to a Princeton Research survey conducted last summer, 44 percent of Americans believe that the food supply in this country is less safe than it was 10 years ago, while another 30 percent feel it is only ``about as safe.'' The survey also found that 48 percent of Americans are ``very concerned'' about the safety of the food that they eat.  Currently, 12 different Federal agencies and 35 different laws govern food safety and inspection functions. Of these 12 agencies, six have major roles in carrying out food safety and quality activities. With so many bureaucrats in the kitchen, breakdowns can more easily occur. With overlapping jurisdictions, Federal agencies many times lack accountability on food safety-related issues. A single, independent agency would help focus our policy and improve the enforcement of food safety and inspection laws.  At a time of government downsizing and reorganization, the United States simply can't afford to continue operating multiple systems. In order to achieve a successful, effective food safety and inspection system, a single agency with uniform standards is needed.  The Safe Food Act would empower a single, independent agency to enforce food safety regulations from farm to table. It would provide an easier framework for implementing U.S. standards in an international context. Research could be better coordinated within a single agency rather than among multiple programs. And, new technologies to improve food safety cold be approved more rapidly with one food safety agency.  With incidents of food recalls and foodborne illnesses on the rise, it is important to move beyond short-term solutions to major food safety problems. A single, independent food safety and inspection agency could more easily work toward long-term solutions to the frustrating and potentially life-threatening issue of food safety.  The administration has stepped forward on the issue of food safety--from working with Congress to enact HACCP to increased funding to improve surveillance and monitoring to last week's announcement on the ``Fight Bac--Keep Food Safe From Bacteria Campaign'' initiative. I commend President Clinton and Secretaries Glickman and Shalala for their commitment to improving our Nation's food safety and inspection systems. A single, independent food safety agency is the logical next step.  Mr. President, together, we can bring the various agencies together to eliminate the overlap and confusion that have, unfortunately, at times characterized our food safety efforts. I encourage my colleagues to join me in this effort to consolidate the food safety and inspection functions of numerous agencies and offices into a single, independent food safety agency.                                 ______                                       By
