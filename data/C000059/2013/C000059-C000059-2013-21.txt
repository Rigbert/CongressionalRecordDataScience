Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Captain Sam Howe, who has worked in my office for the past year as a Defense Fellow. Capt Howe started in my office last January and he has truly been a pleasure to have on the staff. His extensive military experience has benefited the office tremendously as he offers a unique perspective, is always prepared, takes on any task and does it with a smile.  Captain Howe was born in 1986 and grew up with his two younger sisters, Georgia, 25, and Willa, 21, in the friendly suburb of Belmont, Massachusetts, just outside of Boston, where his parents, John and Teresa, still live today. In 2004, Capt Howe graduated from Belmont Hill School.  Capt Howe would go on to attend Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. While there, he earned a B.A. in Public Policy Studies with a minor in Political Science and met the love of his life, his wife, Casey Freeman. Following his junior year of college, in 2007, Capt Howe completed Marine Officer Candidate School in Quantico, Virginia, which involved a ten week screening and training program for prospective Marine Officers. Upon his graduation from Duke in 2008, Sam was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps.  Following commissioning, Capt Howe returned to Quantico to attend the six month Basic Officer Course and, after being designated as a Marine Communications Officer, he completed the five month Basic Communications Officer Course. He was subsequently assigned to First Marine Logistics Group, I Marine Expeditionary Force, of Camp Pendleton, California.  While stationed in California, Capt Howe served as a platoon commander, company operations officer, company executive officer, and acting company commander. In those roles, he was responsible for the welfare and readiness of his Marines, planning and conducting training, administration, and preparing Marines for deployments in support of Operation Enduring Freedom or other contingencies. In 2010, Capt Howe completed a seven month deployment to Afghanistan, supervising a platoon of 55 Marines.  As a civilian, Capt Howe enjoys good food, craft beer, and traveling abroad, as well as running, skiing, working out, and reading. He completed the Marine Corps Marathon in 2012 after moving to Washington, D.C. from California. He and his wife live in Washington, D.C.  During his time in the office he has focused his efforts on defense acquisition, defense appropriations, the intelligence community, Navy SEALs training, and many other policy areas. He has been an invaluable resource to all my staff and I would also like to take this opportunity to thank his family for supporting him through the years; he truly is one impressive guy. On behalf of everyone in the office, I would like to extend a heartfelt thank you to Captain Sam Howe for all his hard work and let him know that my office door is always open to him.                          ____________________
