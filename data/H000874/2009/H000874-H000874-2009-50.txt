 President Obama called the incident a horrific outburst of violence, and he went on to say these are men and women who made the selfless and courageous decision to risk their lives in the service of our Nation. The President went on to say it's horrifying that they should come under fire at an Army base on American soil.  I know that all of us are extraordinarily saddened and shocked by this incident. Our hearts, our minds, our prayers go out to the families of all of those whose lives have been lost and our prayers for their wholeness and health go out to those who have been injured.  Now, Madam Speaker, I yield to Congressman Carter in whose district Fort Hood is located.
