 President, I see the ranking member of the Appropriations Committee on the floor. I would recount to everyone that I said to her weeks and weeks ago that we will devote as much time as it takes to try to get back to a regular process and move appropriation bills across the floor. So we have devoted an enormous amount of time to try to get the appropriations process functioning again here in the Senate.  I don't understand why the Democratic leadership refuses to honor what I think are the wishes of the majority of the Democrats on the committee who have been supporting these bills--most of which have come out of committee on an overwhelmingly bipartisan basis and this particular defense bill, unanimously. They don't even want to go to it and let the Senate function.  But I know the hour is late. That is the final observation I intend to make tonight.  I understand Senator Merkley is going to make a motion.
