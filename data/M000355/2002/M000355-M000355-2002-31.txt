 President, the people of Macedonia and Montenegro will participate in parliamentary elections-on September 15 and October 6, respectively. Given recent history in that region, the successful conduct of these polls is in the security interests of both the United States and all of southeastern Europe.  Free and fair elections in Macedonia could serve as the beginnings of a new chapter for that country. It was only last year that ethnic grievances in Macedonia turned violent, resulting in deaths, casualties, and thousands of internally displaced persons and refugees. While on the mend, successful elections could prove to be a critical milestone for both the people of Macedonia and the international community.  A major challenge for the Government of Macedonia and all political parties is to earn the trust and confidence of the electorate before the first ballots are cast. Let me be clear: there is no room for election chicanery and violence.  The Government of Macedonia should be aware that the Foreign Operations Subcommittee, on which I serve as ranking member, increased fiscal year 2003 funding provided to the Assistance for Eastern Europe and Baltic States, SEED, account. The subcommittee has suggested that additional funds be provided to Macedonia--over and above the administration's request, but our continued support will be gauged by the successful conduct of the September polls.  In Montenegro, I am troubled by Parliament's recent amendments to the election and public information laws, and the method by which these changes were made. In the past, Parliament utilized a process of consensus and agreement when deliberating election-related issues, which helped create a democratic and stable framework for contentious polls. Last month, the majority coalition in Parliament disregarded past practices and the technical advice of the international community and muscled through changes to the laws. Such heavy-handedness undoubtedly sours the preelection environment, and raise suspicions and political tensions.  The amendments to the laws are equally troubling, particularly for the ethnic-Albanian community whose reserved seats in Parliament were reduced from five to four. The majority coalition in Parliament empowered themselves to appoint members to national and local election commissions, permitting total and partisan control over the electoral process. Further, changes to the laws prohibit pollwatchers to question or challenge officials on the conduct of the poll on election day, and private media is banned from accepting paid advertising from political parties.  Let me close by strongly encouraging the State Department, along with the OSCE, to take appropriate actions to ensure free and fair elections in Montenegro. I will continue to closely follow developments in that region, as well as the reports and updates issued by the International Republican Institute and the National Democratic Institute.                          ____________________
