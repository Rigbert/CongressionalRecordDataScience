 President, I rise today to pay tribute to William S. Conn Jr., a resident of Louisville, KY, who will soon retire from two decades of service as president of the Kentucky Hospital Association.  A native of Monticello, Mr. Conn began his career pursuits at Western Kentucky University where he received a degree in Business and Accounting. He then went on to receive his graduate degree in Hospital Administration from the University of Michigan.  After serving 7 years with the Kentucky Department of Mental Health, he became president and CEO of the Kentucky Hospital Association and the Kentucky Hospital Research & Education Foundation in 1975. His dedication to professional excellence took him one step further in 1980 when he became president and CEO of the Kentucky Hospital Service Corp., a wholly-owned, for-profit subsidiary of the Kentucky Hospital Association.  Mr. President, William Conn has given faithful service to his country and community. From 1954 to 1958 he served in the Medical Service Corps of the U.S. Navy. Throughout the years, William has invested both his time and creativity in community service. Mr. Conn is a former member of the U.S. Jaycees and is past president of the Fleming County Jaycees. He is currently a member of the Masonic Lodge and the American Society of Association Executives. He has also served as past president of the Kentucky Society of Association Executives.  His extensive service to his community and dedication to his field has earned Mr. Conn such admirable awards as the Distinguished Service Award from the Kentucky Hospital Association.  Administrator, community leader and friend--Mr. Conn's retirement is well deserved. His accomplishments over the past two decades are too extensive to capture in these few words. He is a respected and admired Kentuckian, and I appreciate this opportunity to honor his professional and community achievements today.                          ____________________
