  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the reason we are still doing 1-minutes is because the Republican leadership is twisting the arms of their caucus to try to get the votes for this tax giveaway, the same arms that they did not twist last week when term limits was on the floor.  There was a shameful time in this country in the mid-1980's when the largest, most profitable corporations in the land paid no income taxes, and we are about to turn back the clock. This bill repeals a modest income tax on the largest, most profitable corporations in this country, so they can go back to paying zero.  People who earn over $200,000 a year, they can get capital gains at 14 percent. That is half of the tax bracket for middle income Americans. Is it not a great country when people, Members of Congress earning $133,000 a year, can vote themselves a wonderful juicy tax break, because they are in a big enough tax bracket to take advantage of it?  When the dust settles, average Americans are going to get it stuck to them again, and the rich are going to be drinking champagne and eating caviar.                          ____________________
