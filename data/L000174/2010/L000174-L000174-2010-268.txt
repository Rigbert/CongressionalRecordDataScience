President, I would say to my distinguished friend from Wisconsin, I was delighted to hear those words about Gaylord Nelson. I had the privilege of serving for a term with Senator Nelson. He was down-to-earth, respected by all in this body, and he had a commitment to the environment rarely ever matched. The Senator from Wisconsin has said it far more eloquently than I could. But I think how fortunate we are that we have this Senator from Wisconsin who has carried out that commitment to the environment, that commitment to the best ideals of our government. I know our dear, departed friend Gaylord Nelson would be so proud to have the Senator here representing Wisconsin.
