  What I said about the lack of an intelligence community, CIA conclusion that Russia has exploded a nuclear device was cleared by the CIA to be able to be said. The operative word is ``conclusion.'' They reached no such conclusion, and that was cleared. I did not speak out of turn.  No. 2, with regard to yesterday's--and through the kindness of my friend from Virginia, he has allowed a lowly member of the Foreign Relations Committee to sit in on his hearings. Yesterday, in front of the Armed Services Committee, all three lab Directors testified that our stockpile today is safe and reliable.  Let me read what Dr. Browne said. Dr. Browne said:       I am confident that a fully supported and sustained program      will enable us to continue to maintain America's nuclear      deterrent without nuclear testing.  Let me further lay out for you that each Director--all three--answered this when Senator Levin asked the following question. Senator Levin asked the following question to all three Directors:       Are you on board with this treaty?  Every single one of the lab Directors said, ``Yes.''  People will say: How can the honorable Senator from Virginia--and he is--say what he said and the Senator from Delaware say what he said? How can they be in disagreement? I will answer the question for you.  Remember, I said at the beginning ``keep your eye on the ball here.'' It is true, if we do not fully fund the stockpile at $4.5 billion per year for 10 years, that all three of them lose confidence in the ability to do that.  It is kind of ironic. The main reason why we fear that we will fund this--and I challenge anyone to show me this is wrong--is because a Republican-controlled House of Representatives is balking at funding it, not because we have not; we have funded it. The distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee is sitting behind me. We did our part.
