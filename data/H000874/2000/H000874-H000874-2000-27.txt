Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute and 10 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, the majority whip says the truth has not been told on this side of the aisle. I beg to differ with my friend, and I certainly beg to differ with his recitation of history. He relates that the President has vetoed every one of the bills where they tried to cut spending. Now, if that is the case then the fact is that nothing they did on their side has brought us this surplus.  The CBO says that, in fact, the Republican Congresses have added to the deficit, not cut it. Now I will remind the public that in 1993, the majority whip stood on this floor and said if we pass the President's economic program, the deficit is going to soar, unemployment is going to soar, inflation is going to soar, and the economy will go in the Dumpster. He was 180 degrees wrong.  In fact, we now have the best economy in the lifetimes of anybody in this Chamber because of the leadership of this President and the courage of Members to vote for tough programs, tough spending cuts and tough revenues.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior), the distinguished minority whip.
