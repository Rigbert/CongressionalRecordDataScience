Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, we started this debate talking about opportunity, and that all of us on this floor, I believe, are for an opportunity society, and that, generally speaking, our constituents believe that opportunity's door is through the schoolhouse.  The schoolhouse door is the door that has given most Americans the opportunity to better themselves, prepare themselves for the workplace, prepare themselves to be responsible, participating citizens. Yes, taxpaying citizens of our country who wanted to participate in making America great, they have done so.  We have then talked about, however, the deficit, and how the deficit is of great concern to all of us. I want to tell again my friends that I voted for the balanced budget amendment. I voted for the Stenholm amendment, which would balance the budget in 7 years. I did not vote, however, for a large tax cut in the face of large deficits. It clearly does not make sense, because we need to get the deficit down first.  The only reason I continue to suggest that we need to make these draconian cuts in education, in shortchanging the children of America, is because of the necessity of the Republican side to get to some numbers caused by their very significant tax cut of $245 billion.  Now, someone said oh, yes, but that is distributed evenly throughout middle American the middle class, and the rich were not getting rich, and it was unfair of us to say we were taking $9 billion from children and putting that $9 billion, just a portion of the $245 billion, over here for a tax cut for the wealthy.  My friends, here is the distribution: Here is the distribution of the tax cut. On the far right you have the bottom 20 percent, then the second 20 percent, the third, the fourth, and the top 20 percent. But then, my friends, you have the top 1 percent, and the tax cut they get.  Now, I suggest if somebody says this is factually incorrect, I am sure they will correct me. But I am sure that I will not be corrected, because this is the accurate depiction of what your tax cut will result in and that is the distribution.                              {time}  1415  Twenty thousand dollars that everybody in the top 1 percent will get is being taken from Head Start children, chapter 1 children, student loan children, energy assistance, from this bill.  Now, an additional argument that was made was, it all ought not to be in Washington. We agree with that. As a matter of fact, we agree very much that it ought to be local people, local school systems, local parents, local teachers that become engaged in how to make the education of our children better and more effective.  That is why only 2 percent, only 2 percent of the money in this bill for education is kept in Washington; 98 percent, out to students, goes out to State school systems and local school systems. Hear me now, 98 percent. That is not a bureaucracy in Washington being made fat. That is Washington trying to make sure that, as a nation, these are not just Maryland students and California students and Maine students and Florida students. These are Americans who will participate in the future in making America great. That is why we who represent all of the American people direct ourselves to this program.  It is $3.8 billion cut in education in this bill, again, I suggest to you, made necessary not by budget deficit reduction but by the $245 billion in the tax cut. You have to get it from somewhere, and the kids are here, and that is where you are getting it.  Now, title I, 1 million students are being cut out. Safe and drug-free schools, 60 percent is being cut. I frankly do not have any of my constituents come up to me and say, hey, we have accomplished our objective. We have safe schools, no violence in them, no drugs in them; we do not need to make the effort anymore. They do not believe that. We still have a very virulent cancer on our community, and it is drugs and violence in our schools. We need to help.  We are not the sole answer, but we need to help our local school systems, Goals 2000. The former Governor of Delaware rose and said this is a good program. The gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Gunderson] came up and said, the macroobjective of bringing the deficit down is excellent. I disagree with that. But the micromethod you have undertaken on your side of the aisle, he said, Republicans, you are wrong. That was Mr. Gunderson from Wisconsin, not the gentleman from Maryland, Mr. Hoyer.  Under the Reagan-Bush 12 years, we quadrupled the budget. Let me say to my Republican friends again, not one red cent was spent in America from 1981 to 1993 that Ronald Reagan and George Bush did not sign off on. They could have stopped any and all funding in its tracks. They did not do that. They chose to endorse the priorities that were sent to them.  This President, by the way, is not going to do that, because he is right. These priorities stink and he is going to veto this bill. I am going to support his veto and applaud him in effort. I guarantee you in my opinion the American public are going to support him, too.  Why? Because over 90 percent of them think, yes, balancing the deficit is important, but saying to a child, you will not be able to compete, you will not be able to have a job, you will not be able to support your family, you will not be able to compete in global economy but, by the way, you will owe less debt, you think that makes any sense to them? They will not have a job. They will not care what debt they owe.  Vote against this cruel cut in education for our children.
