President, I appreciate the choices, but it is going to be none of the above. I know the Senator is very passionate about this issue. I also know that currently in title 23 there is this 1.5 percent that is taken out of the programs it is designed to be used for and put into other programs, such as the section 402--the alcohol-impaired driver countermeasures and all that. Now, this is different in that it takes money away--well, look at it this way. The States pay the taxes that go into the Federal Government, and then we take those and go back to the individuals and say: Unless you do something in the wisdom of us here in Washington, even though your State does not agree with it, we are going to withhold your money.  Let me share a short story with my friend from North Dakota. Many years ago, I was elected to the State legislature. My first trip to Washington was 1967. Do you know what it was for? To testify before the Environment and Public Works Committee protesting Lady Bird's Highway Beautification Act of 1965 because of this very reason: philosophically using money that comes from the State to blackmail them to do something, however good the cause.  I was sympathetic with Senator Warner on his seatbelt amendment, but I had the same objections. I think the Senator is going to find some philosophical objections to his amendment. Yet I assure everyone within earshot, the Senator from North Dakota is very passionate about this issue, he believes in it, but I will respectfully vote against it.
