President, my amendment, which is cosponsored by Senator Inouye, adds Tunisia to the list of countries that is eligible to receive excess defense equipment from the United States. I am offering this amendment because of Tunisia's support for the Middle East peace process, its geographical location between Libya and Algeria, and the fact that its armed forces do not have a history of engaging in violations of human rights.  Recently, Tunisia opened interests sections with Israel. This was a courageous step, and it is important that the United States affirm its support for Tunisia's positive role in the Middle East peace process. Additionally, Tunisia is located in an unstable and dangerous part of the world. Colonel Qaddaffi is unpredictable, and he has made no secret of his displeasure with Tunisia's actions vis a vis Israel. Algeria, on Tunisia's western border, is struggling with civil unrest stemming from clashes between the secular government and a fervent fundamentalist movement.  So while I am extremely concerned about the proliferation of conventional weapons in this volatile region, I understand the administration's purpose and I am prepared to support modest amounts of excess defense equipment to Tunisia.  However, this amendment also takes into account the serious human rights concerns that I and others have about Tunisia. According to the State Department and respected international human rights monitors, civil liberties are severely curtailed in Tunisia. Lawyers, journalists and human rights activists are frequently harassed, intimidated, jailed and otherwise mistreated for expressing their political opinions. Nejib Hosni, a well-known human rights lawyer, has been accused of various misdeeds and imprisoned, after an unfair trial. Mohammed Mouadda, leader of the largest opposition party in Parliament, has been similarly silenced. Dr. Moncef Marzouki, former president of the independent Tunisian Human Rights League, has been repeatedly harassed and his passport has been revoked. These are only three examples, but they illustrate a disturbing pattern.  In addition, the State Department reports that the Tunisian judiciary is ``not independent of the executive branch, and that judges are susceptible to pressure in politically sensitive cases.''  The Tunisian Government should recognize that it only hurts itself by acting this way. By attempting to silence its critics, especially individuals who do not advocate violence, it creates resentment and closes out alternative forms of expression, which can lead to violence. This is the antithesis of democracy.  This amendment requires the Secretary of State to report on actions taken by the Tunisian government to improve respect for civil liberties and to promote the independence of the judiciary. Our hope is that the Tunisian government will treat these concerns with the seriousness they deserve, and initiate a sincere effort to deal with these human rights problems on an urgent basis.                           amendment no. 5025  (Purpose: To provide additional funds to support the International                         Development Association)       On page 135, line 7, delete ``$626,000,000'' and insert in      lieu thereof ``$700,000,000.''
