 President, on behalf of Senator Hutchison and myself, I have just sent to the desk the Amber Hagerman Child Protection Act. The purpose is to try to provide a Federal response to those who molest children.  Recently, a study showed about 40 percent of the child molesters are recidivists. I, frankly, think that could well be even higher than that.  In virtually every community throughout the United States, there is a story to tell. Senator Hutchison will speak in a moment about a story from Texas. I can speak about a story from California. I can speak of Polly Klaas, and the person who was just convicted of abducting, kidnaping, raping and killing her had a prior record.  The bill we are proposing today attacks the problem of sex offenders on both the State and Federal level. The purpose of the bill is to require life imprisonment for a repeat, two-time child sex offender and to provide an opportunity for the second offense to be heard in a Federal court.  The purpose of this bill is that if an individual is convicted of child molestation and repeats that felony, either on Federal land or in the crossing of State lines, that it will become a Federal offense and subject to life imprisonment.  This is a harsh bill. It is a tough bill. It has been introduced in the House by Representative Frost. It is my hope, and I believe Senator Hutchison's hope, that tomorrow in the Judiciary Committee I will offer it as an amendment to the child pornography bill. If it fails there, we will try at a later time to offer it as an amendment on the floor to a bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1985       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Amber Hagerman Child      Protection Act of 1996''.     SEC. 2.
