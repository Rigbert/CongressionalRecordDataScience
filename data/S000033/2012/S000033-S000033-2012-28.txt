 President, I have talked for a long time on this issue, so I do not want to make a great speech and continue speaking at great length. I do want to say a few things.  First of all, I want to thank Senator Inhofe for his kind words. Let me respond in the same way. He and I philosophically and politically come from very different places. I have never doubted for one moment the honesty or the sincerity of the Senator from Oklahoma. He is saying what he believes. He has the courage to get up here and say it, and I appreciate that. So we are good friends, and I hope we will continue to be good friends.  I think, frankly, it does this Senate, and it does this country, good when people hear varied differences of opinion on an issue that I consider to be of enormous consequence. So what I would say to my friend is, I hope, in fact, this is the beginning of a resurgence of discussion about this issue, and I look forward to engaging in the discussion with my friend from Oklahoma.  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
