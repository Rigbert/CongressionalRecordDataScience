Mr. Speaker, here is what the New York Times has to say about the campaign finance reform bill Republicans will bring to the House floor this week: ``Newt Gingrich has a plan to snooker Americans yearning for a cleanup of their corrupt election finance system.''  Here is what the Republican bill will do, among other things. It would increase the amount of money rich individuals could contribute to a candidate from $1,000 to $2,000. It would increase the amount of money a rich individual could contribute to a political party from $20,000 to $60,000, and it would increase the total amount a rich individual could contribute to candidates and parties from $25,000 to $75,000; $1,000 to $2,000, $20,000 to $60,000, $25,000 to $75,000.  That is the Republican campaign finance reform. If you think there is not enough money in politics, this is the campaign finance reform bill for you.  This bill is a scam, it is a sham, it is a shame and a disgrace. The Republican majority ought to be embarrassed to bring this bill to the floor.                          ____________________
