 President, I am not sure who has the floor, but I would say, in response to my friend from Georgia----  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator, we have unanimous consent for a colloquy.  Mr. McCONNELL. There may have been examples, but I am hard pressed to think of one recently. The tradition of passing the Defense authorization bill is there for a good reason. The national defense of the United States is the most important thing the Federal Government does. The committee upon which the Senator from Georgia and the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from New Hampshire serve is expert on this matter, and I find this truly astonishing.  It is consistent, however, I must say with the pattern around here in recent times: no amendments, fill up the tree, deny the majority and the minority--in this case, both the majority and the minority--the opportunity to have any input on a piece of legislation that determines what we do on the Federal Government's most important responsibility.  I think this is another example of the way the Senate has deteriorated into operating like the House, and it is an extremely bad direction for this institution and for the American people.
