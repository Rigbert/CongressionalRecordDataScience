President, this morning, at 10 a.m., the Senate will vote on the supplemental appropriations conference report. Following the vote, the Senate will resume consideration of the Defense authorization bill. The two managers have made substantial progress, but we will need to work through a number of amendments today in order to complete the bill in a timely fashion.  Those Senators who have amendments should be working with Chairman Warner and Senator Levin to get in the queue. The Santorum amendment on Iran is the pending business and we will need to schedule a vote on that today. The majority leader has announced that Members should stay close to the floor so that we can make significant progress during today's session.                          ____________________
