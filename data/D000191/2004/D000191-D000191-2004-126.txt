Speaker, let us go to Europe, which is a higher cost competitor than the United States with all the social welfare and all the other programs over there. Airbus is now exceeding Boeing in terms of production. Now how can that be? Well, all of their costs of development are subsidized by the European consortium. If you buy an Airbus plane, they will throw in goodies. Buy an Airbus. Well, there are no slots to land at Heathrow. Buy an Airbus, we have a spot to land at Heathrow, prime time. Oh, okay.  So they use the laws and the rules of their own countries and the European Economic Union to further their own critical technology and high technology and high-value manufacturers like Airbus. Boeing is now going to China and Japan. It will not be long before we do not make planes in this country any more. Then what happens?  So they have a much more global view and long-term view of where they want to be positioned in the world economy, and we are just engaging in laisse faire, saying, no, our highest priority is the cheapest production of a good by the cheapest unit of labor somewhere out there, and we do not care what it does to our economy or the people at home because it is good for consumers. But, again, consumers are not able to consume much if they do not have jobs.
