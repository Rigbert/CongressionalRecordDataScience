Mr. Speaker, not long ago I received word of some remarkable work by a very special young man from my district in Trenton, NJ. His efforts were truly commendable and an inspiration to us all. And so I rise today to pay tribute to Sammy Gordon for his efforts to help the victims of last year's bombing in Oklahoma City.  Last April, upon hearing of the tragedy in Oklahoma, Sammy, then age 12 and a 7th grader at Holy Cross School in Trenton, decided he wanted to help the victims. And help he did. Enlisting support from friends, parents, and local merchants, but mostly by his own wits and gritty determination, Sammy managed to raise $3,300 selling lemonade. He chose a truly ingenious location--a local drive-by ATM machine--where the customers were both easily accessible and possessed of ready cash.  Sammy and his friend's original motivation for the endeavor had been the worthwhile goal of building a clubhouse. However, when Sammy heard of the hardships that the bombing victims were enduring, he decided that it would be better to put the needs of others ahead of his own wants.  Sammy's compassion and determination to relieve suffering, stands in marked contrast to the despicable act of wanton cruelty which inspired his efforts in the first place. When a calamity like Oklahoma City is intentionally inflicted, it defies explanation. In the face of such meaningless terror, all of us can be tempted to despair. Responses like Sammy's, however, offer the rays of hope we all need to prevent this despair from setting in. By his act of kindness, Sammy reminds us that this world is far more defined by goodness, than by the evil. The extraordinary success of his endeavor also reminds us that when we take a small step to do good, it can serve as a catalyst and big things can sometimes result.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, this young man demonstrated that personal acts of charity are indispensable to the kind of society we all want to live in. In contrast to Sammy's fast action, it took the Government over a year to decide what the appropriate legal response to this tragedy ought to be. Sammy and others like him stepped forward almost immediately, as only individuals can, and began to fill the overwhelming needs of a community which had been so terribly battered.  In these respects, the money Sammy raised selling lemonade, and forgoing--temporarily, I hope--the construction of his clubhouse, not only helped those who were directly affected by tragedy, but rather it helps us all. That is no small accomplishment.  And so, Mr. Speaker, I rise not only to commend Samuel Gordon, but to thank him as well. I wish Sammy and his friends the best of luck in whatever the future brings them. I believe that if they continue to put the needs of others ahead of their own desires, they will be very happy in their own lives and we will all be richer for it.                          ____________________
