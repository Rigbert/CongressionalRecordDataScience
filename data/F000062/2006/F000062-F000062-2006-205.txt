 President. I rise today to join my distinguished colleague, Senator Murkowski, chair of the Subcommittee on Water and Power, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, in introducing legislation to provide new authority and streamlined review criteria for the Bureau of Reclamation's title XVI Water Recycling Program.  I first want to thank Senator Murkowski for her leadership in this area. I deeply appreciate her willingness to work with me on this issue.  I also want to thank my California colleague and friend, Representative Grace Napolitano, ranking member on the Water and Power Subcommittee, who is introducing identical companion legislation in the House of Representatives today.  This legislation is an outgrowth of subcommittee oversight hearings last February and is the product of more than 2 years of discussion, evaluation, and consultation with the Bureau of Reclamation as well as numerous water agencies and communities.  Today, the West faces two daunting challenges simultaneously. The first is drought and the impacts of continued climate gyration--wild swings in previously established weather patterns. The second is the unprecedented growth throughout California and the Western States. Population continues to not just grow but surge throughout this region.  The title XVI, Water Recycling Program enables water users in the West to stretch existing supplies through the application of reclamation, reuse, recycling and desalination technologies.  Title XVI was initially authorized in 1992, following a severe multiyear drought in California and other Western States. A drought of equal severity reduced the mighty Colorado River to record lows only a few years ago. We must find ways to expand our water supplies, and do so without generating regional or environmental conflict. Reusing our existing supplies and stretching those supplies is a significant part of the solution. The title XVI program provides the authority and framework to accomplish these water resource development objectives to meet the needs of our cities and urban areas, our farms and ranches and our diverse environment.  This legislation clarifies and makes permanent the U.S. Department of the Interior and Bureau of Reclamation's title XVI water reuse/reclamation/recycling grant authority for the development of new sources of water. In so doing, this proposed legislation will help State and local governments and water departments and agencies develop new water and reliable water supplies.  The bill amends the Reclamation and Wastewater and Groundwater Study and Facilities Act, 1992, to provide new standards and procedures for the review of water reclamation and reuse projects by the Interior Department's Bureau of Reclamation. Additionally, the legislation sets forth specific criteria to assist Congress in the evaluation and selection of projects for Federal funding.  In the recent past, the Bureau of Reclamation was not able to review and report on proposed projects in a timely fashion. This legislation establishes firm deadlines, a clear process, and very specific criteria by which project reviews are to be conducted.  This program, unlike traditional Bureau of Reclamation project funding, provides a grant, not to exceed 20 percent of the capital costs or $20 million making this the most leveraged and most cost-shared Federal water resources program. In setting the 20 percent cap, this legislation reduces the overall percentage Federal participation to 20 percent from the 1992 standard of 25 percent to enable more projects to receive Federal cost-share support.  Reclaiming the Nation's Water Act is designed to accomplish one major objective--development of new water supplies responsibly--and in a timely manner. From a California perspective, this legislation compliments and is fully consistent with the recently published California Water Plan Update 2005--published in 2006--by California Department of Water Resources and the 2002 State of California's Water Recycling Task Force, Water Recycling 2030. Both reports conclude that a significant portion of new water to be developed in California will come from water recycling.  Throughout the Nation's more than 200-year history, water conflicts in the West have ``erupted'' periodically. This program is designed to reduce conflict through sound planning, improved management, expanding existing supplies, leveraged financing and meaningful partnerships.  The Subcommittee on Water and Power will hold a hearing on this proposed legislation later this month. At that time, the subcommittee will also hear testimony on three proposed projects, one each in Riverside, Orange and San Bernardino Counties. I have carefully reviewed these projects. They are designed to produce approximately 300,000 acre-feet of new water annually. These projects simultaneously reduce pressure on the Bay Delta--and other Federal and State water users dependent on the water from the delta--as well as the Colorado River. They will help drought-proof their water service areas.  Not too long ago, in a speech delivered at a WateReuse Association conference, John Keys, the recently retired Commissioner, Bureau of Reclamation, called recycled water The Last River to Tap. Commissioner Keys was right.  I would like to provide some additional detail on the legislation. The legislation provides new authority for the Secretary of the Interior to review non-Federal water reclamation and reuse project proposals, pursuant to new standards and procedures for such review.  New standards would include providing sufficient evidence to the Secretary of Interior that the project: (1) is technically viable and (2) has a financially capable project sponsor. The Secretary would have 180 days to submit to Congress: (1) a statement and explanation of the project's technical and financial viability, and (2) a recommendation on whether the project should be authorized for construction based on several specific factors. Factors to be considered would range from items related to project costs and benefits, to whether the project would help serve an identified Federal interest. The bill also includes transition procedures.  This program is vital to the West's future. I look forward to working with Senator Murkowski and my colleagues on the Energy Committee. I want to also thank Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici and the committee's ranking member, Senator Jeff Bingaman for their support and assistance in the preparation of this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
