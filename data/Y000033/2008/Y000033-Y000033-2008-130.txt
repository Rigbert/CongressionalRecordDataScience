Madam Speaker, today I am introducing, along with Alaska's Senators, legislation to authorize the Secretary of Commerce to set the bowhead whale quota for the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission in the event the International Whaling Commission does not set an Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling quota for the bowhead whale.  Madam Speaker, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) is at a crossroads. Many observers of the IWC have raised concerns that the Commission will either fall apart in the next few years or it will turn into a whale protection organization that will allow no take of whales--even for subsistence purposes. In either case, without an alternative mechanism for authorizing the Alaska subsistence harvest of bowhead whales, the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission could find itself with no quota authorized by the IWC. In the event that this were to occur and the Alaskan hunters tried to fulfill the communities needs for whale meat, they could find themselves in violation of the Whaling Convention Act of 1949 for attempting to feed their people.  And even if the IWC remains a viable management entity, the Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling quotas have been rejected by the IWC several times in recent memory due to political fights between the whaling nations and those nations that are opposed to any whaling. These fights have used the Alaskan Natives as political footballs and left the Native people of Alaska without a quota of whales. This happened most recently in 2002 when the IWC rejected the Alaskan quota for no other reason than politics. And at this year's IWC meeting, the Greenland Natives submitted a request to substitute humpback whales for the current quota of fin whales--something the IWC's Scientific Committee had already considered and determined that the harvest of 10 humpback whales would not endanger the stock. Despite the Scientific Committee's determination, the IWC did not have enough votes to allow this quota. In both of these cases, the IWC did not act on Native quotas despite recommendations or determinations by the Scientific Committee that the quota was sustainable and would not endanger the stocks. In both cases, the Aboriginal Subsistence Whaling quotas were rejected because of politics and not science.  Madam Speaker, it is clear that in the fight to outlaw scientific whaling and commercial whaling, many IWC member countries are being pressured by animal rights groups to stop all whaling. These animal rights groups do not understand the subsistence needs of Native people--or they don't care.  Alaskan Native whalers have already been held hostage during these fights over scientific and commercial whaling and that is not right.  Today, the Alaska delegation is introducing legislation to regulate domestic Native subsistence whaling under domestic law in the event that the IWC cannot authorize a quota for the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission's bowhead whale harvest.  The legislation will allow the Secretary of Commerce to set the annual quota for the bowhead harvest in the event that the IWC is unable to set the quota. Under the legislation, the Secretary must set the quota based on science and the needs of the Alaska Natives.  The Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission's harvest has always been sustainable, based on science, based on harvest levels approved by the IWC's Scientific Committee, and set at a level that has allowed the bowhead whale population to increase to the point where some scientists are now calling for the downlisting of the stock.  The Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission has continually had to justify their harvest--both their cultural need and their nutritional need. They have done this and have also responded to every hurdle that anti-whaling nations have put in their way. In addition, they probably have provided more scientific information to the IWC on the bowhead whale than the IWC has on any other whale species. All of this was done to justify a harvest that has gone on for centuries.  The Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission has continued to respect the IWC, continuedto respect the scientific recommendations of the Secretary of Commerce and the IWC's Scientific Committee, and continued to respect the bowhead whale. But they cannot be used as political footballs by the IWC and they cannot have their need for the bowhead whale delayed if the IWC fails to renew their quota in a timely manner.  This legislation will ensure that the AEWC will have their cultural and nutritional needs met in the event that the IWC fails to act to renew their quota or if the IWC decided to hold their quota hostage for political reasons, but does so in a manner that is based on science and the needs of the Alaskan Native people as determined by the Secretary of Commerce.                          ____________________
