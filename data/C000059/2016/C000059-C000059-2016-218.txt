Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose commitment to the Corona, California community is truly exceptional. Next week, on January 21, 2016, Bob Hemborg will be honored as a recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Corona Chamber of Commerce. Bob has dedicated himself to the Corona community.  Bob is the founder and owner of Hemborg Ford, a local business fixture. He initially purchased the Ford dealership in Corona and he quickly realized he wanted more land. He relocated his business to the neighboring community of Norco. Bob has worked tirelessly with a strong work ethic and business practices that have enabled his dealership to grow and thrive in the community. Bob prides himself on having many repeat and multi-generational clients.  Family is also very important to Bob. When it came time for him to retire, he entrusted the day-to-day operations to his son Tor, though he is quick to tell you he is in the office regularly. Since semi-retiring, Bob has become involved in philanthropic outreach and business-related groups.  Bob's tireless passion for his family, community service and giving back has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. I am proud to call Bob a close friend, fellow community member and great American. Today, I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating Bob on receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award.                          ____________________
