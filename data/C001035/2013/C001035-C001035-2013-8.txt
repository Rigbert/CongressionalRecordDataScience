President, I am very pleased to be here on the Senate floor with my friend and colleague from Minnesota Senator Klobuchar as we submit an important resolution.  This month is National Alzheimer's Awareness Month. Alzheimer's is a terrible disease that exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on both the individual and the family. As have many families, mine has experienced the pain of Alzheimer's. I know there is no more helpless feeling than to watch the progression of this devastating disease. It is equally painful to witness the emotional and physical damage inflicted on family caregivers exhausted by an endless series of 36-hour days.  Moreover, Alzheimer's disease is the only cause of death among the top 10 in our Nation without a way to prevent it, to cure it, or even to slow its progression. More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease--more than double the number in 1980. Based on current projections, as many as 16 million Americans over the age of 65 will have Alzheimer's by the year 2050.  In addition to the tremendous human suffering it causes, Alzheimer's costs the United States more than $200 billion a year, including $142 billion in costs to the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. This price tag will increase exponentially as the baby boom generation ages. If we fail to change the current trajectory of Alzheimer's disease, our country will not only face a mounting public health crisis but an economic one as well. If nothing is done to slow or stop this disease, the Alzheimer's Association estimates that Alzheimer's will cost our country an astonishing $20 trillion over the next 40 years.  It is estimated that nearly one in two baby boomers reaching the age of 85 will develop Alzheimer's. As a consequence, chances are the members of the baby boom generation will either be spending their golden years suffering from Alzheimer's or caring for someone who has it. In many ways, Alzheimer's has become the defining disease of this generation.  If we are to prevent Alzheimer's from becoming the defining disease of the next generation, it is imperative that we dramatically increase our investment in Alzheimer's disease research. According to a study commissioned by the National Institute on Aging, Alzheimer's and other dementias cost the United States more than cancer and heart disease. This study finds that both the costs and number of people with dementia will more than double within 30 years--skyrocketing at a rate that rarely occurs with a chronic disease.  At a time when the cost to Medicare and Medicaid of caring for Alzheimer's patients exceeds $140 billion a year, we are spending only slightly more than $500 million on Alzheimer's research. We are spending $142 billion under Medicare and Medicaid, more than $200 billion overall, and yet only $500 million on research. We currently spend $6 billion a year for cancer research, $3 billion a year for research on HIV/AIDS, and $2 billion for cardiovascular research. And I wish to emphasize that those are always worthy investments--investments that have paid dividends in terms of better treatments, cures, and in some cases prolonged lives. Surely we can do more for Alzheimer's given the tremendous human and economic price of this devastating disease.  The National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease was authorized by a bipartisan law passed in 2010 called the National Alzheimer's Project Act, which I authored with then-Senator Evan Bayh.  The national plan has as its primary goal to ``prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's disease by 2025.'' The chairman of the Advisory Council on Alzheimer's Research, Care, and Services, which was created by the National Alzheimer's Project Act, has testified before Congress that the United States must devote at least $2 billion a year to Alzheimer's research to achieve that goal.  I am therefore joining with my colleague from Minnesota Senator Klobuchar in submitting this resolution declaring that the goal of preventing and effectively treating Alzheimer's by 2025 is an urgent national priority. Our resolution recognizes that dramatic increases in research funding are necessary to meet that goal and resolves that the Senate will strive to double the amount of funding the United States spends on Alzheimer's research in fiscal year 2015 and then develop a plan to meet the target of $2 billion a year over the next 5 years.  Just think of the figures. We are spending some $212 billion a year treating, caring for people with Alzheimer's.All we are asking is that over the next 5 years we achieve the goal that the Alzheimer's Council--a council of experts in Alzheimer's--including experts from the Mayo Clinic in Senator Klobuchar's home State, have recommended that we spend $2 billion. Mr. President, $2 billion is such a tiny percentage of the amount we are spending.  So this is a worthy investment. It is one that will not only relieve suffering, save lives, potentially, but it will also more than pay for itself.  I urge our colleagues to join us as cosponsors.  I ask unanimous consent that letters from the Alzheimer's Association and the UsAgainstAlzheimer's group--both predominant national advocacy groups endorsing our resolution--be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Alzheimer's Association,                                                November 19, 2013.     Senator Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Senator Amy Klobuchar,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins and Senator Klobuchar: On behalf of      the Alzheimer's Association and its nationwide network of      advocates, thank you for your continued leadership on issues      and legislation important to Americans with Alzheimer's and      their caregivers. The Alzheimer's Association proudly      endorses your most recent Alzheimer's resolution, which      supports the goals of the National Plan to Address      Alzheimer's Disease and increased funding for Alzheimer's      research at the National Institutes of Health.       The Alzheimer's Association is the world's leading      voluntary health organization in Alzheimer's care, support      and research. Our mission is to eliminate Alzheimer's disease      and other dementias through the advancement of research; to      provide and enhance care and support for all affected; and to      reduce the risk of dementia through the promotion of brain      health. Our vision is a world without Alzheimer's.       As two of our nation's strongest voices on behalf of      Americans living with Alzheimer's, you know that more than 5      million Americans are living with the disease, and without      significant action, as many as 16 million Americans will have      Alzheimer's by 2050. A recent study funded by the National      Institutes of Health and published in the New England Journal      of Medicine further confirmed that Alzheimer's disease is the      most expensive disease in America. Additionally, as the baby      boomer generation ages, one in eight will develop      Alzheimer's. This explosive growth will cause Alzheimer's      costs to Medicare and Medicaid to increase from $142 billion      today to more than $800 billion in 2050 (in today's dollars)      and threatens to bankrupt families, businesses and our health      care system. Unfortunately, our work is only growing more      urgent.       The passage of the National Alzheimer's Project Act in      2010, and the subsequent release of the National Plan to      Address Alzheimer's Disease, marks a new era for Alzheimer's      disease and other dementias. Achieving the first goal of the      National Plan, to prevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's      disease by 2025, and supporting individuals with the disease      and their caregivers are critical to the success of this      legislation. The Alzheimer's Association strongly supports      efforts to increase funding for Alzheimer's research at the      National Institutes of Health, and we applaud you for your      efforts.       The Alzheimer's Association deeply appreciates your      continued leadership on behalf of all Americans living with      Alzheimer's. If you have any questions about this or any      other legislation, please contact Rachel Conant, Director of      Federal Affairs, at [email protected] or at 202.638.7121.           Sincerely,                                                      Robert Egge,     Vice President, Public Policy.                                  ____                                       US Against Alzheimer's,                                Washington, DC, November 19, 2013.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Amy Klobuchar,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Sen. Collins & Sen. Klobuchar: On behalf of the more      than five million Americans currently struggling with      Alzheimer's disease and the millions of family caregivers      working each and every day to care for their loved ones, I am      writing to thank you for your powerful resolution declaring      our national goal of preventing and effectively treating      Alzheimer's disease by 2025 an urgent national priority. I      also applaud you for including in this resolution the call to      double the National Institutes of Health (NIH) research      commitment to Alzheimer's disease in Fiscal Year 2015 and to      meet by FY 2019 the $2 billion in annual Alzheimer's research      funding metric called for by the Advisory Council on      Alzheimer's Research, Care and Services. USAgainstAlzheimer's      is pleased to endorse your resolution and to commit to      working with you to build cosponsors.       Three years ago, Congress took the bold action of enacting      the National Alzheimer's Project Act which led to the      development of the National Plan to Address Alzheimer's      Disease and the 2025 goal. Much has occurred in the ensuing      period, including the reallocation of some NIH research      dollars to focus on Alzheimer's disease. But despite these      efforts, our annual Alzheimer's research budget remains at      about $500 million--one quarter of the $2 billion in annual      funding leading Alzheimer's researchers and the advisory      council have deemed the minimum necessary to enhance our      chances of achieving the 2025 goal.       As your resolution so ably notes, the United States does      not have a choice as to whether or not we will pay for      Alzheimer's disease. We are paying today, dearly, in the more      than $140 billion in annual costs of care borne by the      taxpayers through Medicare and Medicaid, an amount that will      escalate sharply over the years if the current trajectory of      the disease is left unchanged. The amount we invest annually      in Alzheimer's research today is but a fraction of 1 percent      of this total care burden, an amount that is simply      insufficient given the enormity of the task at hand. While a      bold and visionary plan and 2025 goal are important political      statements, absent commensurate resources and the necessary      focused national leadership, the plan and goal will be worth      precious little.       By urging that our 2025 goal be viewed as a national      priority and setting the $2 billion goal over the next five      years, you have provided our nation--and your fellow      appropriators--with a clear goal at which to aim. I applaud      you for recognizing the plight of our current patients as      well as caregivers the need to similarly bolster patient and      caregiver support initiatives. We look forward to working      with you to engage the Senate Appropriations Committee to      ensure that your call for a doubling of Alzheimer's research      funding at the NIH in FY 2015 is reflected in key spending      bills.       I thank you, again, for your leadership and for all you do      to stop Alzheimer's disease.       Sincerely,                                                George Vradenburg,                                                         Chairman.
