Speaker, I rise today to recognize Augusto Bordelois, an internationally acclaimed artist who is opening a new art studio, Augusto Fine Art, in Berea, Ohio, this week.  Augusto has a deep connection to Berea, as the city has been his home since 1999. Augusto Fine Art studio will establish a dedicated art space for the entire community, building Berea, brick by brick, in the same way Augusto creates his own artwork.  At the new location Augusto will be teaching jointly with watercolorist Nancy Notarianni, who will also have a gallery in the Berea studio. His vision is to create a centralized space that will foster community and collaboration among local Cleveland-area artists who wish to teach or display their work, and by Cleveland-area residents who wish to connect with their artistic, creative side.  Augusto, who emigrated from Cuba as a young man, describes his painting style as `magic realism' that has been largely influenced by the Renaissance, as is typical for prominent and gifted artists from Latin America and the Caribbean. He graduated from the University of Havana in Cuba, and has an inestimable and broad knowledge base that he is more than willing to share with others.  Augusto is a natural and enthusiastic leader and an active member of the arts community in Northern Ohio, where he is a teaching artist and member of the Center for Arts-Inspired Learning, the Ohio Arts Council, and most recently The Art House. He has been awarded `Best in Show' and an Ohio Arts Council Special award at the Ohio State Fair Fine Arts exhibition.  Through his leadership in judging Ohio's 9th Congressional District's annual Art Caucus competition for promising high school artists, I have been fortunate to witness firsthand his influence across Northern Ohio, and his passion for helping others reach their full potential. I greatly appreciate his efforts to continue fostering and promoting a growing art community. Augusto's passion has inspired resurgence in community art and, through the new Augusto Fine Art Studio, a dedication to increased access to community art spaces.  Northern Ohio should have a minimum of 1,000 art studios across our lush region, which has a natural beauty and rich culture, and Augusto is a leader in reaching that goal.  The arts have long been celebrated throughout northern Ohio, with each region hosting multiple arts festivals, in addition to the many small, locally owned shops that populate the region. From the Black Swamp Arts Festival in Bowling Green to the FireFish Arts Festival in Lorain, there are many opportunities to be immersed in the local northern Ohio art scene.  I greatly admire Augusto Bordelois and celebrate his vision and legacy in northern Ohio. His unwavering dedication to teaching and promoting the arts has made a lasting mark.  Please join me to congratulate and celebrate Augusto Bordelois on this exciting next phase.                          ____________________
