Speaker, I want to add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed strong support for this bill, H.R. 1911. It is imperative that the United States leads in the effort to stamp out anti-Semitism both at home and around the world. That's why we need an ambassadorial-level special envoy to monitor and combat anti-Semitism.  In recent years, we've witnessed a disturbing rise in attacks against Jews and Jewish communities all around the world. Americans were deeply shaken last year by the virulent anti-Semitism on display in our own country during the white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. I continue to be alarmed by attacks on Israel and its policies that employ rhetoric historically associated with anti-Semitism and that repeat old patterns of singling out the Jewish State in ways that mimic ancient biases. There must be no place for such rhetoric or activities in our country or anywhere that calls itself a free and democratic society.  I commend Ranking Member Engel of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, along with Reps. Lowey, Schneider, Deutch, and Veasey, for their hard work with the bill's Republican cosponsors to ensure bipartisan passage of this legislation. I hope it will send a strong message throughout the world that the United States will never waver in its effort to end the scourge of anti-Semitism and defend our ally Israel.                            ____________________
