It is going to be on the Travel Promotion Act. I have opposed this in the past. I have already voted against it three times. I am not going to hang here and waste the whole day just to vote against it a fourth time.  I ask unanimous consent that I make a very brief statement and it be printed in the Record immediately following the vote that takes place this afternoon.
