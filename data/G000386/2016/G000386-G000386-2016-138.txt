 President, Des Moines police officer Susan Farrell had a lifelong dream of a career in law enforcement. At the young age of 30, she was living out her dream and on course for a bright career.  But on March 26, just five months after joining the Des Moines Police Department, Officer Farrell lost her life in the line of duty along with fellow officer Carlos Puente-Morales when their vehicle was struck by another that was driving the wrong direction on Interstate 80 near Waukee. I wish to take a moment to celebrate Officer Farrell's life and service.  Early on, growing up in the Des Moines area, Officer Farrell knew she wanted a career in public service. She studied criminal justice at Hamilton College and returned to her home town after graduating to begin living her dream. She worked as a detention officer in Polk County Jail for several years and was promoted to deputy just a year ago. She joined the Des Moines Police Department last fall and was excited to expand her education there.  Along the way, Officer Farrell quickly earned the respect of her colleagues. She was someone they could always count on to help resolve situations. She also received awards of commendation and lifesaving for her work on the response team. One colleague summed up her abilities like this: ``There wasn't a situation where I wouldn't want Susan with me.''  Officer Farrell will be greatly missed by her family and friends, as well as the Des Moines community that she worked to protect.  I express my deepest sympathies to Officer Farrell's family, friends, and colleagues and my sincere gratitude for her service to our State and for her work to keep our communities safe.                          ____________________
