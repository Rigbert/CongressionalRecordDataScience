Mr. Chairman, I think the gentleman from Connecticut makes a very helpful suggestion. I would hope that the gentlewoman from California would agree to that, and that would require us proceeding out of order.  A unanimous consent would be proposed to let the gentleman from California (Mr. Bilbray) proceed while we discuss, and hopefully we can come to language that will send the message to the Peruvian government, to Fujimori, that we are united, that she has been denied her due process rights, and I mean we all want justice. I do not know if exoneration, release is justice. It may be; I do not know. I have looked at the case. If I were a jury, I would want to know a lot more.  So I would hope that we can do what the gentleman from Connecticut has suggested.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Would the gentlewoman from California be willing to withdraw her amendment momentarily in order to accommodate the suggestion made by the ranking member?
