Chairman, I want to salute my colleagues who have joined me in offering this amendment. The gentleman from Utah [Mr. Hansen] and the gentlewoman from Washington [Mrs. Smith] have been kind enough to join me in this bipartisan effort. This is an important and perhaps historic debate on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. We will decide tonight in no small measure whether Uncle Sam is going to get out of the tobacco business.  Let me tell my colleagues what ever Member of Congress in this Chamber has faced and what I have faced many times throughout my career in town meetings where ordinary Americans asked a very difficult question. ``Congressman,'' they say, ``if the Federal Government tells us that tobacco kills you and is dangerous for you, why in God's name do the Federal taxpayers have to subsidize the growth of this tobacco?''  And time and again my colleagues on the floor here will answer, ``Well, perhaps it is not such a good idea; we ought to do something about it.'' Tonight my colleagues have a chance to do something about it because tonight this amendment addresses two specific areas of spending on the Federal tobacco program, mainly the Extension Service and the crop insurance program.  Mr. Chairman, I wish it were within my legislative power to completely abolish the tobacco programs at the Federal level tonight with this amendment, but, because of budgetary constraints, I cannot. What I will attempt to do with this amendment is to address two large parts and very serious parts of our Federal tobacco program, and I hope in so doing to not only demonstrate why this is good philosophically, but good from a budgetary viewpoint.  First and foremost, the tobacco growers and their supporters on the floor will tell us time and again until they are blue in the face that the tobacco program does not cost the taxpayers anything. My colleagues will hear that tonight at least a dozen times and believe each time they have heard it that it is not true. The tobacco program costs American taxpayers each year $42 million, $42 million of Federal tax money going to support an industry that generates $40 billion a year in sales, 40 billion. These are not mom-and-pop pauper operations. These are huge tobacco companies working in many instances with huge tobacco growers, and we still subsidize their effort.  The amendment which I have introduced addresses the Extension Service. We have men and women in the Extension Service traveling across the country giving advice to growers and farmers as to the best way to grow their crop. What we are saying is get them out of the tobacco business. They can advise people who are growing crops that are good for us how to grow those crops more efficiently, but tobacco, tobacco is the only subsidized crop by the Federal Government which, when used according to manufacturers' directions, will kill us. It is not an ordinary agricultural crop. It is a killer, and each year it is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in America. We cannot say that about cotton, or corn, or wheat, sugar beets, or any other commodity that the Department of Agriculture deals with.  The second area is crop insurance. Those who grow tobacco buy insurance in the likelihood or in the circumstance where their crop might be endangered because of floods or drought, whatever it happens to be. They pay a premium, but the premium does not cover the cost of the program. In other words, when they get paid back, they receive more back from the Government than they paid in premium. The difference is paid for by America's taxpayers, and that unfortunately adds again to the cost that we pay each year to the tune of about $23 million.  Today's debate is not about whether small tobacco farmers will survive. One acre of tobacco can generate 2,000 pounds of product a year, currently selling, I understand, for about $1.80 a pound; in other words, $3,600 gross. Now it is much more labor-intensive than most other crops, but a person with 1 acre of tobacco under cultivation can expect to make several thousand dollars from that 1 acre. In my part of the world where we grow corn, if someone can net $200 an acre from growing corn, they are lucky. If someone is a tobacco grower under the program, we are talking in terms of several thousand dollars.  The program continues, the tobacco allotment program will continue, those profits will continue for those families. They can afford to buy their own crop insurance.  The issue here is should the Federal Government use taxpayers' dollars to subsidize this crop. I will tell my colleagues I would like to have every Member of Congress tonight to have an opportunity the next time that a town meeting comes up to say, ``Yes, I cast a ``yes'' vote for the Durbin-Hansen-Smith amendment to make it clear that Uncle Sam ought to get out of the tobacco business. We have no business subsidizing the growth, production, and processing of a product which kills hundreds of thousands of Americans each year.''  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1945
