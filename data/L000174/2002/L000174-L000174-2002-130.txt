This is the 14th circuit court nominee to be considered by the Senate since the change in Senate majority and reorganization of the Judiciary Committee 14 months ago. That is an average of one Court of Appeals judge a month since the Democratic majority has been in place. This pace is almost double that maintained by the Republicans during their 6\1/2\ years of control of the Senate. This is also the 78th judicial nominee we have confirmed in the past 14 months.  In contrast, our Republican predecessors voted on only 46 of President Clinton's more moderate Court of Appeals nominations in their 76 months of control for an average of closer to one circuit court confirmation every other month. In fact, during the entire 1996 session the Senate Republicans stalled all Court of Appeals nominees and not a single one was confirmed. Court of Appeals vacancies went from 16, when the Republicans took over in January 1995, to 33 by the time they finally relinquished control last summer and allowed the Judiciary Committee to reorganize. During the Republican stall on judicial confirmations, vacancies more than doubled on the Courts of Appeals. However, since last summer, the Democratic majority has exceeded the rate of attrition and confirmed 14 circuit court judges, in addition to 64 district court judges. Even with extraordinary attrition of 10 new circuit vacancies during this period, we have lowered the number of Court of Appeals vacancies from the 41 it would have been if Democrats were blocking judges as Republicans falsely claim, to 27.
