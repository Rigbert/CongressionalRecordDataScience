 President, will the chairman yield for another response? I will be very brief. Let me make an analogy for the chairman.  Say we have a contract with someone on the rental of an apartment building. We say we want to renegotiate that contract to be able to rent to build 12 more units on that apartment building. We say: By the way, although parking is no part of this lease, we want to renegotiate our parking lot agreement with you as well. Before we agree to go into a new deal with you on the building, we want to get 10 more parking spaces. The guy who owns the building says: Wait a minute. I don't want to. I will only negotiate with you on the building. We say: We are not going to do it unless you give us more parking spaces.  That is what we did here. They said they want to go to START III. We said we are not going to do that unless you give us more parking spaces--unless you allow us to do something the ABM does not allow us to do right now. You give us the ability to test these missiles at a faster speed to be able to intercept your missiles that are called theater nuclear missiles. You allow us to do that. If you do not, we are not going to renegotiate a deal on the whole building. Do the parking, or we will not even talk about the building.  That is what we said. We said allow us to amend ABM, or we are not going to go down to these levels.  That is what happened.
