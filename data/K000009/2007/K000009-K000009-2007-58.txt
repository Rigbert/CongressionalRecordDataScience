What happens under this bill is these 15 factors that the courts like because it helps them make a judgment in whatever the particulars of the case might be, are reduced to one and the other 14 factors don't really have to be weighed. So there is a significant change in this legislation that would heavily impact on what the courts can do and how they look at a given case.  I will submit this article for the Record that talks about Bose's port tube technology being infringed on by JBL as an example of what is happening.         [From Manufacturing & Technology News, June 29, 2007]    Covering Innovation, Globalization and Industrial Competitiveness                   Patent ``Reform'' Is Anything But                            (By Pat Choate)       Ironically, Congress is now threatening China with harsh      remedies if it does not quickly stiffen its patent      protections, even as Congress marks up legislation that will      dramatically weaken U.S. patent protections. This bill is the      Patent Reform Act of 2007.       This schizophrenic policy is being driven by a group of      ``Big Tech'' transnational corporations that repeatedly      infringe the patents of others, get sued, lose in court and      are then forced to pay billions of dollars in penalties. Now,      in response, they are financing an expensive lobbying,      propaganda and legal     campaign to weaken U.S. patent laws by passing this Patent      ``Reform'' Act. They cleverly call themselves The Coalition      for Patent Fairness (CPF); included are large transnational      corporations such as Adobe, Microsoft, Cisco, Intel, eBay,      Lenovo, Dell and Oracle.       During the period 1993-2005, four of the CPF companies paid      out more than $3.5 billion in patent settlements. In the same      period, their combined revenues were $1.4 trillion, making      their patent settlements only about one-quarter of one      percent of their revenues. Now, they wish to reduce even      those costs, not by changing their obviously unfair, and      often illegal, business practices, but by persuading      Congress, and also the Supreme Court, to weaken U.S. patent      protections.       These corporations have convinced many members of Congress      and many editorial writers that the U.S. patent system is      badly broken and that it requires a major legislative      overhaul. Supposedly, they say, the U.S. is in the midst of a      ``litigation crisis'' where responsible corporations (CPF      members) are being penalized by unworthy lawsuits. And, also      supposedly, the United States Patent and Trademark Office      (USPTO) is issuing massive numbers of unworthy patents that      are being used in lawsuits against innovative companies      (again, CPF members).       The ``litigation crisis'' and ``unworthy patents''      allegations simply do not hold up under examination.       The real facts of the so-called litigation crisis are that      for the past two decades the number of patent lawsuits      commenced annually has been about 1.5 percent of all patents      granted. In 2006, it was 1.47 percent. This is business as      usual. Most patent lawsuits, moreover, settle before trial.      In 1979, some 79 percent of patent cases settled before      trial, while in 2004 almost 86 percent did. Matters are      actually improving.       Also, the U.S. has few patent trials: For instance, in 2001      only 76 patent lawsuits were tried and only 102 went to trial      in 2006. By no measure can 102 patent trials be considered a      national litigation crisis. The annual report of Federal      Judicial Caseload Statistics, which is on the Internet,      provides the factual antidote to false claims of a litigation      crisis (www.uscourts.gov/caseload2006/contents.html).       As to the massive numbers of ``unworthy patents'' argument,      the real-world test is how many patents are challenged and      the outcome of those challenges. Between 1981 and 2006 the      USPTO issued more than 3.1 million patents. In that period,      8,600 were challenged at the Patent Office through inter      partes and ex parte reexaminations. The number challenged      amounts to less than three-tenths of one percent. Of those      challenged, about 74 percent resulted in claims narrowed or      cancelled. In addition, almost 60 percent of the relatively      few patents challenged in a court trial are sustained.       My point is that the USPTO's work is certainly not perfect,      but the Patent Office is also not pouring out a stream of bad      patents.       If there are no patent ``litigation crisis'' and no patent      ``quality crisis,'' what is the real purpose of the Patent      Reform Act of 2007 legislation before Congress?       A main goal is to legislate changes that will reduce      penalties paid by infringers. Under existing law, a patent      holder who is infringed upon is entitled to damages adequate      to compensate for infringement, but in no event less than a      reasonable royalty. The courts now consider a list of 15      factors in that calculation, including apportioning the part      of the realizable profit created by the infringed invention      versus other factors such as the manufacturing process,      promotion, sales or other patents owned by the infringer.       Under this bill, however, Congress mandates that the court      ``ensure that a reasonable royalty is applied only to the      economic value properly attributable to the patent's special      contribution over the prior art'' while only allowing the      consideration of the other 14 factors. The bill goes on to      require that the court subtract from the analysis ``the      economic value properly attributable to the prior art, and      other features or improvements, whether or not patented that      contribute economic value to the infringing product or      service.'' Think of this as a big finger on the scales of      justice that favors the infringer.       Often, the infringed component is only one of dozens of      parts and contributions that make up the product, but that      component may be the very thing that makes the product sell.       JBL infringed Bose's patented port tube technology, for      instance, which gives Bose speakers their distinctive      clarity. Bose's technology vastly improved the sound of the      JBL speakers and drove JBL's sales. Bose sued and won. JBL      wanted the royalty determination based on the small value of      a cheaply made, plastic port tube. The federal court,      however, determined that Bose's technology is what drove      JBL's sales and set the damages on the value of the entire      speaker system. If the damages were apportioned only to the      cost of making the port tube, Bose would have received a tiny      fraction of what its invention was worth. If JBL were allowed      to subtract the value of all prior art in the damage      calculation, which this legislation would allow, Bose would      likely have gotten almost zero.       Cutting the damages paid by infringers is the goal of the      many serial infringers supporting this provision.       Chief Judge Paul R. Michel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for      the Federal Circuit advised Congress in a letter dated June      7, 2007, that the current law on apportionment is stable,      works well and is understood by litigators and judges, and      that the new proposal would be a radical change that would      cause great chaos in the legal system. He noted that this      change would require a massive damage trial in every case and      a new kind of costly macroeconomic analysis. ``Resulting      additional court delays would be severe,'' he wrote, ``as      would additional attorneys' fees and costs.'' I think that we      can mark him down as opposed.       One other pernicious result is this ``primary factor''      apportionment provision would actually encourage more      infringement. Rather than negotiate with a patent owner and      pay for use of an innovation, many infringers would simply go      ahead and use it, pay nothing and, if caught and proceeded      against, then pay a small royalty payment eventually set by a      federal judge.       If Congress enacts this provision, it is sanctioning the      ``taking'' of a patent owner's property and drastically      reducing the price, if anything, an infringer must pay. Think      of it as ``self-licensing'' someone else's patent. During the      life of a patent, copyright or trademark, there is no      difference between real property and intellectual property. A      patent belongs to someone. Often it has great value. The      owners should decide how it is used and the terms of that      use, not the infringers.       A second goal of the proposed legislation is to force the      USPTO to publish on the Internet all patent applications 18      months after the date they are filed. Since most patent      applications now take an average 31 months to process, the      Big Tech corporations that are sponsoring this legislation      would get an advanced peek at an applicant's secrets more      than a year before the inventor has patent protection, that      is, if the patent is even granted, which for half of all      applications, it is not. If an infringer took those secrets      to China or India or anywhere where patent protection is lax,      as many would, the inventor's only recourse would be to go      to those countries and file a lawsuit. Few small      companies, universities and inventors can afford this.       Foreign pirates find this mandatory publication provision      particularly useful. For China, South Korea and many other      nations, the USPTO's computer in Arlington, Va., is their      primary source of R Many foreign corporations and      governments fill a room with computers, engineers and fast      Internet connections and then task them with finding new      technologies in unprotected U.S. patent applications. The      U.S. isn't the only country with this problem; the Japanese      Patent Office reports their computers get 17,000 hits per day      from China and 55,000 hits per day from South Korea.       When Congress first enacted this 18-month publication      requirement in 1999 it also created a loophole. Inventors can      opt-out of having their applications published if they agree      not to file for any foreign patents. About half of all      applications from small businesses, universities and      independent inventors select to opt-out. The proposed bill      would eliminate this opt-out choice.       The Big Tech corporations also want Congress to change the      long-standing practice of the U.S. Patent Office of granting      a patent to the first-person-to-invent to the practice used      in Europe, Japan, China and elsewhere where the patent goes      to the first-person-to-file the patent application.       A firt-to-file system strongly favors big corporations, who      have the resources to track every aspect of an invention and      file boxes and boxes of materials to support their claims,      over small businesses, independent inventors and      universities, who do not.       Equally important, this change of systems would create      chaos at the USPTO and greatly contribute to the slowing of      U.S. innovation. The USPTO would have to create numerous new      forms and procedures and retrain its thousands of patent      examiners and administrative people, even as it works down a      backlog of 750,000 applications. All inventors, companies,      patent lawyers and federal judges in the U.S. would be forced      to learn this new system, its procedures and rules.       The turmoil created by this shift in the already      beleaguered USPTO would guarantee a logjam there--one far      greater than the passport backlog fiasco now underway at the      State Department.       Incongruously, this legislation also proposes to solve      America's supposed patent ``litigation crisis'' by creating a      new forum for more litigation. This proposed ``post grant''      opposition process provides an infringer a lowcost means to      challenge the very patent it is infringing and allows it to      do so over the entire 20 year life of the patent at a lower      burden of proof than required in a federal court.       Europe has the very system that Congress is being asked to      copy. It is a litigation heaven for the patent bar. The      annual European Patent Office (EPO) challenge rate was 5.4      percent of granted patents in 2005. The combination of all      USPTO ex parte and inter partes challenges, all interference      cases, plus all patent lawsuits commenced calculated as per      the number of patents granted produces a comparable U.S.      challenge rate of 1.8 percent. The EOP challenge rate is      three times that of the United States and that does not count      any patent lawsuits in Europe.       Japan dropped this system in 2004 because it created too      many lawsuits. Of the many     bad ideas in this legislation, this post grant litigation      process is probably the worst.       The principal victims of these and other Patent Reform Act      of 2007 proposals will be small entity inventors--small      businesses, individual inventors, universities and non-profit      research organizations. Their patents are often the greatest,      if not only, assets they hold. Most often, they need      ownership of an unchallenged patent in order to get financing      to actually develop it. And, when their patent secrets are      stolen and used by larger infringers, they are generally      unable to finance a lawsuit, particularly if the infringer      operates outside the United States.       Yet, it is small entity inventors who file almost 30      percent of all U.S.-origin patent applications and receive 31      percent of all patents granted. Unlike the Big Tech      companies, most of these innovators keep their R and      production in the U.S. They are vital to America's future.      But they are fragile. Special consideration of their      situation and needs is in the nation's best interest.       Fortunately, many U.S. groups and organizations oppose the      Patent Reform Act of 2007. Included are the National      Association of Manufacturers, the U.S. Business and      Industrial Council, more than 450 venture capital firms, the      Big Ten universities, plus dozens of other organizations. The      Department of Commerce and the USPTO have written Congress      that they do not support eliminating the 18-month opt-out      rule, changing to a first-to-file system, altering the      apportionment provision or creating a new litigation forum.      Unfortunately, all this opposition has mattered little so far      and this dangerous legislation is still moving forth in the      House and Senate Judiciary Committees.       Each Member of Congress needs to closely examine the Patent      Reform Act of 2007 for it will deeply affect every state,      every community and every congressional district. We face a      historic economic challenge in the global economy. Now is the      time for Congress to strengthen U.S. patent protections      rather than weaken them.
