President, just from a housekeeping point of view from this side of the aisle, if we have Democrats who have amendments, I wish they would contact me. We want to be as cooperative with the distinguished chairman as possible and slot these in. I would be happy to go to third reading in the next 15 minutes, if we could. I do not think that is possible. But I urge Senators to move as quickly as possible if they have amendments and get them up and go forth.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, very quickly, there are 28 amendments that we are currently aware of. At least seven of those we now know we can accept. So we should be able to move along here with dispatch.  I see the Senator from Georgia is on the floor. Mr. President, I yield the floor.
