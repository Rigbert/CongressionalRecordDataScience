 The Foreign Operations Subcommittee has provided significant increases for the ATAP Program through the regular appropriations bill and the supplemental appropriations bill last year, and the President proposes another $106 million for this program, an increase of nearly $42 million above the current level.  I believe these programs with law enforcement personnel from other nations are more important than ever, and there is a significant benefit to the State Department in using the facilities at LSU and New Mexico Tech to continue these training programs. I would concur that the Department should continue to carry out these courses at these two universities.
