Speaker, I submit the following biographies.                             Baker O'Brien       This year's Milestones Award Recipient for the Arts      category is Baker O'Brien, an established world-class glass      artist and long-time supporter of the arts in Toledo, Ohio.      Ms. O'Brien was the sole apprentice of legendary glass-master      Dominick Labino and has been mixing, melting, blowing and      casting vividly colored glass for over 30 years.       Her work is part of private collections around the world,      and some of the more well-known recipients of her work      include Her Majesty Queen Noor of Jordan, Her Majesty Queen      Sirikit of Thailand, Former Secretary of State Madeline      Albright, Former Mayor of New York City Rudy Guliani, Dr. C.      Everett Koop, China Wildlife Conservation Association of      Beijing, Beijing, China, and concert pianist Andre Watts.       Ms. O'Brien has also donated her work to a wide variety of      local organizations for fundraising. Over nearly 30 years,      she has further supported the development of the arts in the      Toledo area by educating docents from the Toledo Museum of      Art. These docents, who are primarily women, are on the front      lines of public arts education. Ms. O'Brien passionately      ensures that they have correct and accurate information to      pass along to museum patrons regarding both the art and      science of glass. Her lectures and demonstrations include a      combination of not only the science and history of glass art,      but also the Labino Studio. She has served as a guest artist      for the museum on numerous occasions.       Outside of her work creating and supporting the arts, Ms.      O'Brien has a passion for animals and owns several horses and      purebred dogs. This community is truly fortunate to have a      local champion for the arts and art education.                            Kathleen Zouhary       Kathleen M.

She also served as      the Vice-President and General Counsel for Ohio Care Health      System, Inc. Her wisdom and expertise assisted physicians,      board members, and executives in fulfilling the mission of      providing healthcare to Toledo-area residents.

She has served as a      mentor to other women and is known for her inspiring      perseverance, patience, and professionalism in eliminating      barriers to success for women of all walks of life. She is an      active member of the Toledo Women's Bar Association, Ohio      Women's Bar Association, and several other professional      groups.       Her colleagues have described her approach as ``grace under      fire,'' and she is certainly an inspiration to business-women      in the Toledo community. Ms. Zouhary's dedication and      integrity make her an outstanding role model for Toledo      women, including her two daughters Katie Marie and Alexis,      who are now both successful attorneys in their own right.

Dr. Oatis's contributions to this area have achieved      significant recognition outside of the YWCA.

She has used this training to devote the      past 20 years toward responding to social injustice,      particularly the abuses of women who are victims of human      trafficking.       Dr. Williamson founded the first anti-trafficking program      in Ohio in 1993, long before the human trafficking      conversation came to the forefront. As a social worker, Dr.      Williamson founded the Second Chance program, now known as      RISE, in Lucas County. RISE continues to work with women and      girls who were victims of the human trafficking industry. Her      academic work includes 9 completed studies, 17 articles, and      2 edited books on sex trafficking. Her work was recognized      via federal funding from 2002 through 2012 to conduct      research in this area. In fact, she has been awarded research      grants totaling over $1 million to assist vulnerable women      and trafficked youth.       As an activist and community organizer, Dr. Williamson      founded the International Human Trafficking and Social      Justice Conference, and chairs the Research and Analysis      Subcommittee for the Ohio Attorney General's Human      Trafficking Commission. Her devotion to helping the most      vulnerable women in our community is undeniable, as she was      instrumental in securing an FBI task force in Lucas County to      address the issue of rescuing children from Toledo's sex      trade. Dr. Williamson also devotes her time to teaching      interns who are interested in addressing the issue of human      trafficking, and she has been a lifelong educator on      oppression and social justice.       Dr. Williamson has received much recognition for her work      in social services, and truly embodies the YWCA's mission.      Her work to address the issue of ``modem slavery through      human trafficking has cemented her status as an inspiration      to women in Toledo and throughout the country.                             Adrienne Green       This year's Milestones Award recipient for Volunteerism is      Adrienne Green. Ms. Green was selected for her outstanding      leadership and tireless efforts in raising awareness about      the importance of volunteerism in the Toledo community.       Although Ms. Green is not originally from Toledo, she is      deeply passionate about the impact volunteers play in      improving the lives of Toledo-area residents, especially      women in need, and has consistently demonstrated her      commitment by serving in a variety of volunteer leadership      roles.

Many of these endeavors overlap with the mission of the      YWCA by providing services and opportunities for women,      especially those with limited resources. In addition to this      work, Ms. Green works as a project manager at Owens Corning.      She has consistently been willing to take on difficult tasks      to support the community when others may be reluctant to do      so.

In 2015, she served on      the Girl Scouts of Western Ohio Women of Distinction      Committee, which selects exceptional women honorees leading      the way for future female leaders.       Ms. Green is a role model for women everywhere, proving      that one can combine both professional and philanthropic      goals to help her community. She is truly a leader by example      and has generously invested her time and resources to support      volunteer efforts in Toledo and beyond.                          ____________________
