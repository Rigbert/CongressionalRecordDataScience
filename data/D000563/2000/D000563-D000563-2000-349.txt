President, I want to take a moment to note that Senator Thurmond, who took the floor and introduced a joint resolution commending our Armed Forces, is someone who should also be commended personally today. This is the 56th anniversary of Senator Thurmond's landing in the D-Day invasion.  As we consider the construction of the museum in New Orleans, LA, to pay tribute to those soldiers and all those involved in the D-Day invasion, we should take a moment on the floor of the Senate to pay tribute to our colleague from South Carolina, who had such a distinguished career in the military. It is almost inconceivable to think he was there as a volunteer to fly a glider into the D-Day invasion--probably one of the more dangerous assignments of the men and women in uniform who made that invasion such a success. The fact that he is here today is a tribute to not only his longevity, but his continued dedication to this country.  On behalf of a generation--frankly, I wasn't born when that occurred but have been the beneficiary of that victory--I say to my colleague from South Carolina that we are in deepest debt to him for his personal service to this country, and for his courage in participating in that D-Day invasion. I commend not only him but also all of those who made that invasion such a success, and hope that on this 56th anniversary all of the people involved, and their families who waited expectantly to hear the results of that invasion, will be remembered in the thoughts and prayers of every American family.
