 Let me follow up and perhaps engage in a brief dialog. I think the Senator from Minnesota made a good point about the heart of the Republican legislation. The most telling point, in my view, is the coverage. It simply covers one-third of the eligible private-insured individuals throughout the country.  As I understand the legislation, it is aimed at those self-insurers. These are businesses that contract with HMOs simply to manage the health care of their employees, so the only people who will directly be impacted by their legislation are those individuals who are essentially insured by their employers directly through self-insurance.
