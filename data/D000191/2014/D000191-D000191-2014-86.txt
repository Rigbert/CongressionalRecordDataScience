Speaker, the amended version of H.R. 4414 that was brought up today is a marked improvement over the previous version of the bill that was brought up earlier this month. I again commend Representative Carney for proposing fixes to the Affordable Care Act. I also commend him for trying to work with House leadership and the Administration to come to an agreement on how to properly treat expatriate plans under the Affordable Care Act. Unfortunately the bill on the House floor today does not have the Administration's support. The potential of lawful permanent residents and other visa holders in the United States to erroneously be considered expatriates under H.R. 4414 still exists. I expect the Senate to fix this potential loophole and look forward to supporting final passage of the bill after the Senate has made targeted changes.
