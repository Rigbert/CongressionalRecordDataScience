Six individuals were selected from these new members and inducted as Society Fellows for their exceptional efforts in innovation. These individuals are: Ralph W. Braun, the late Robert H. Forney, Jr., P. Scott Bening, Howard Cohen, Ph.D., Tom Sourlis, and Ernest Talarico, Jr., Ph.D. Also honored were two Chanute Prize team recipients: ``Exploration Earth: Mission Ocean'' and ``Dage-MTI.'' For their outstanding efforts, these honorees were recognized at an award and induction ceremony sponsored by The Society of Innovators. This prestigious event took place at the Pavilion Ballrooms at the Horseshoe Casino in Hammond, Indiana, on Thursday, October 21, 2010.  The Society of Innovators of Northwest Indiana was created by Ivy Tech Community College with the goal of highlighting and encouraging innovative individuals and groups withinthe non-for-profit, public, and private sectors, as well as building a ``Culture of Innovation'' in Northwest Indiana. The importance of innovation in Northwest Indiana, as well as globally, is crucial in today's ever-changing economy.  The six Fellows selected by the Society of Innovators were chosen for their remarkable diversity of innovation and the impact of their efforts throughout the community of Northwest Indiana. The 2010-2011 individuals named Society Fellows are as follows:  Ralph W. Braun is the CEO of The Braun Corporation in Winamac. Ralph is truly an inspiration. His personal challenge, being dependent upon a wheelchair for mobility, has inspired him to create a corporation that has become the largest manufacturer of wheelchair accessible mini-vans and lifts in the world. The late Robert H. Forney, Jr. is the former President and CEO of the Chicago Stock Exchange, Inc. Mr. Forney founded the Chicago-based Global FoodBanking Network, a foundation set up to fight hunger worldwide, in which independent food banks were established and work with over 30 countries. Tom Sourlis of MotarNet in Burns Harbor created a proper drainage system for masonry walls, changing the masonry construction industry. This original idea led to major support for local non-profit organizations. P. Scott Bening is the President and CEO of Monosol in Merrillville. His company has become the global leader in specialty water-soluble, polymer-based film manufacturing. His facilities are currently located in Portage, LaPorte, and Hartlebury, England. Howard Cohen, Ph.D., is the Chancellor of Purdue University Calumet (PUC) in Hammond. Throughout his tenure he has been the inspiration behind turning PUC into ``a high quality, regional, full-service University.'' Ernest Talarico, Jr. Ph.D., is the founder of the International Human Cadaver Prosection Program, a program that prepares cadavers for study with the goal of encouraging respect for donors and families. This program is based at Indiana University Northwest (IUN) and has brought professionals from around the world to Gary.  The recipients of the Chanute Prize for team innovation are: ``Exploration Earth: Mission Ocean'' and ``Dage-MTI.'' ``Exploration Earth: Mission Ocean'' is a submarine stimulation program geared toward enhancing the development of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills in elementary and middle school students. The Center for Science and Technology Education at PUC hosts this program, which is currently being expanded nationwide with a major grant from the U.S. Navy. ``Dage-MTI'' is a camera company located in Michigan City and is the oldest camera company in the United States. Current owners, John and Peggy Moore, rescued the store as it was about to close its doors seven years ago. ``Dage-MTI'' now offers some of the finest digital cameras for microscopic research in the world.  Madam Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these outstanding innovators on being named Society Fellows and Chanute Prize winners. Their dedication and commitment to innovation is truly an inspiration. Their years of hard work have played a major role in shaping future development in Northwest Indiana and communities worldwide, and each recipient is worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
