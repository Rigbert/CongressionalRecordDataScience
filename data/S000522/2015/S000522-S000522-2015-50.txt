I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 337, calling for substantive dialogue without preconditions to help secure a negotiated agreement for the Tibetan people. I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), my friend and colleague, for his leadership in introducing this bipartisan resolution.  This week, Madam Speaker, when so many voices around the world are joined in wishing his holiness the Dalai Lama a happy 80th birthday, it is a fitting time to recommit ourselves to Congress' longstanding support for the fundamental rights of the people of Tibet, because the situation in Tibet has never been more bleak. Those basic rights involve fundamental and foundational rights of freedom of religion.  The recent State Department Human Rights Report offered a withering criticism of the Chinese Government's oversight of Tibet and Tibetan areas in China. It said:       The government engaged in severe repression of Tibet's      religious, cultural, and religious heritage by, among other      means, strictly curtailing the civil rights of China's      Tibetan population, including the rights of the freedom of      speech, religion, association, assembly, and movement.  Unfortunately, the regime's interference extends even to the most elemental aspects of Tibetan Buddhist practice. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the disappearance of the Panchen Lama, who was detained by Chinese Government officials back in 1995 when he was a young child. Zhu Weiqun, a top Communist official dealing with ethnic and religious affairs, has claimed, ``decisionmaking power over the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and over the end or survival of his lineage resides with the central Government of China.''  Sadly, we know that Tibetans have used self-immolations as a protest against religious and political oversight by the Chinese Government. There have been 134 self-immolations since 2009. The numbers are decreasing because of heavy security and punishments that target family members and entire villages. It is difficult to fathom the despair and the desperation felt by Tibetans who take this last act of defiance. The Chinese Government has blamed the Dalai Lama and ``foreign forces'' for self-immolations instead of looking at how their own despicable policies created such deep grievances.  Madam Speaker, the Tibetan people want to be free to practice their unique faith and to live by the dictates of their faith. This freedom is denied to them. The Chinese Government expanded its efforts last year to transform Tibetan Buddhism into a state-managed institution. They sought to undermine the devotion of the Tibetan people to the Dalai Lama and control the process of selecting Buddhist leaders. The Chinese Government wants a Tibetan Buddhism that is attractive to tourists and which allows the Communist Party to manage its affairs.                              {time}  1530  The U.N. Special Rapporteur on religion recently criticized China's efforts to control Tibetan Buddhism and the process of selecting leaders. He said:       The Chinese Government is destroying the autonomy of      religious communities . . . creating schisms and pitting      people against each other in order to exercise control.  This is exactly what the Chinese Government has done to other religious groups, including Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, and the Falun Gong. When the faithful don't fall in line, they are jailed.  Madam Speaker, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, of which I serve as chairman, has a prisoner database that contains records on 617 Tibetan political and religious prisoners. Forty-four percent of those detained are monks, nuns, and religious teachers. Almost all were imprisoned since 2008.  Unfortunately, our ability to get accurate information in real time about this situation in Tibet is complicated by restrictions on access to Tibetan areas by United States officials, journalists, and other U.S. citizens. This has frustrated U.S. consular officers' ability to provide services to American citizens.  In October 2013, the Chinese Government delayed access for over 48 hours during an emergency situation involving a bus accident that ultimately resulted in the deaths of three U.S. citizens and injuries to others.  As the Chinese Government pushes for new consulates and official facilities in the United States, our government must insist on an official presence in Lhasa, which is called for in section 618 of the Tibetan Policy Act, which became law in the year 2002.  The Dalai Lama is recognized internationally for his commitment to peaceful and nonviolent conflict resolution. The recipient of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize and a Congressional Gold Medal winner in 2007, he has made clear his willingness to engage in dialogue with Chinese counterparts at any time, at any place, and without any preconditions.  Unfortunately, this commitment to peaceful dialogue is not reciprocal, and Chinese officials have not met directly with his representatives in over 5 years. This is the longest break since the dialogue--or so-called dialogue--started in 2002.  Indeed, a Chinese Government white paper on Tibet published this April states that China will ``only talk with private representatives of the Dalai Lama'' to discuss ``the future of the Dalai Lama'' and how he can ``gain the forgiveness of the central government and the Chinese people.''  That is outrageous. Instead of asking for the Dalai Lama's forgiveness for the decades of brutal repression, the Chinese Government demands that he ask the government of China for forgiveness.  This is unfortunate and highly counterproductive. If China's goal is to build a ``harmonious society'' in Tibet, which they love to tout, it cannot be done without the Dalai Lama. He is the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people. His views are widely shared throughout Tibetan society, and he can be a constructive partner with China in addressing continuing tensions and deep-seated grievances.  In light of this, the resolution before us calls for fuller implementation of existing U.S. law in support of direct dialogue between Chinese officials and the Dalai Lama; it calls for an official U.S. presence in Lhasa and urges our government to ensure that religious rights and religious freedom issues are consistently raised in the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue and other high-level meetings.  It has many, many other provisions which I know the prime sponsor will elaborate.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
