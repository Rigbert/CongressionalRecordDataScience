 President, I know the Senator from Louisiana wishes to speak in morning business, which is fine. I wonder if I could make one brief announcement. Members are interested in bringing this bill to a conclusion. There are a number of amendments that were listed in the consent order. I ask that Members come to the floor to call up their amendments shortly. Senator Coburn has a number, Senator Reid, Senator Collins. Senator Ensign has a motion to recommit. If these Members could come to the floor and call up their amendments, it would be appreciated. We would be able to, hopefully, conclude the bill.
