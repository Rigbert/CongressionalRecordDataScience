President, I am pleased to be able to support the amendment offered by Senators Torricelli, Corzine, and Durbin. I believe that allowing candidates the opportunity to let their message be known to the public, through television ads, without having to raise an obscene amount of money to finance those advertisements is a needed step toward truly reforming our campaign finance system. During the 2000 election broadcasters' advertising prices soared precisely when airtime was most valuable to candidates. Due to this dramatic increase in prices the broadcasters earned record profits from political advertising.  David Broder of the Washington Post articulated the need for TV advertising price relief. He writes, ``Common sense tells you that if the TV bill remains . . . exorbitant, politicians will continue the `money chase' under any rules that are in place.'' The rules to which Mr. Border refers are the rules drafted in the campaign finance reform bill.
