Created by The Times and BusINess magazine, induction into the Indiana Business and Industry Hall of Fame is determined by a panel of local civic and business leaders. While there were many deserving nominees, the individuals selected as the 2008 Indiana Business and Industry Hall of Fame inductees are: Mark Maassel, Donald Powers, Mamon Powers, Jr., Denis Ribordy, Frank Van Til, Robert Welsh, Jr., and Dean White. For their many contributions to the enhancement of Northwest Indiana, these honorees will be recognized at a ceremony taking place at the Radisson Hotel at Star Plaza in Merrillville, Indiana, on Friday, March 7, 2008.  Mark Maassel is the former president of the Northern Indiana Public Service Company (NIPSCO), as well as a leader of the Northwest Indiana Forum. For many years, Mark has been seen as an innovative leader, not only in terms of his profession, but for his charitable efforts in the community as well. In one of many examples, Mark is largely credited with bringing together the United Way campaigns throughout Lake, Porter, and LaPorte Counties in Indiana. He has also been an active leader with the Indiana Humanities Council, the Indiana Chamber of Commerce, and the Ivy Tech Foundation.  Donald Powers is the president and CEO of the Community Foundation of Northwest Indiana, Inc. and the Community Healthcare System and the founder of a very successful real estate development company. Known throughout Northwest Indiana and beyond for his vision and determination, Donald is credited with the development of Munster, Indiana, as well as the Community Hospital and the Center for Visual and Performing Arts. In addition, he has been instrumental in the development of the Purdue University-Calumet campus in Hammond, Indiana.  Mamom Powers, Jr. is the president and CEO of Powers and Sons Construction Company, Inc., the company founded by his father in 1967. After learning the value of hard work and dedication from his father, Mamon took over the company and has always found a way to give back to his community. Mamon has always been active in serving the youth and has been a constant supporter of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Northwest Indiana. In addition, he also serves as a trustee with Purdue University.  Denis Ribordy was the owner of Ribordy Drugs, Inc., a very successful chain of twenty-six drug stores throughout Indiana, prior to its sale in 1985. He was also president and CEO of Ribordy Enterprises, which consisted of eight Hallmark stores. Having started his drug store business in Gary, Indiana, in 1955, Denis has always remained active in the community. Throughout his career, Denis has been recognized on numerous occasions for his commitment to Tradewinds and many charities throughout his community.  Frank Van Til is the co-owner of Van Til's supermarket in Hammond, Indiana. Raised in the grocery store business, Frank's parents opened their first store in Hammond in 1936. The Van Til family eventually went into business with the Strack family to create what would become a successful chain of 29 supermarkets throughout Indiana and Illinois. Although the Strack and Van Til stores were sold in 1998, Frank continues to operate Van Til's supermarket in Hammond. Not only did Frank learn the grocery business from his father, but he also learned the importance of being an active member of the community, and to this day, he remains an active member of many civic and charitable organizations in Northwest Indiana.  Robert Welsh, Jr. was the owner of the former Welsh Oil Company and is the current CEO and chairman of Welsh Holdings LLC. Throughout his career, Robert's innovative thinking has made him a true pioneer in his field. As the owner of Welsh Oil Company, he is credited with many modern advancements, including self-serve gasoline stations, alcohol-blended fuels, and food service within gasoline stations. Robert has been the recipient of many accolades, not only for his business ventures, but also for his constant commitment to his community. Most notably, Robert has been recognized as the University of Notre Dame's Man of the Year. Always an advocate of the youth, Robert has been an active contributor to the Calumet Council of the Boy Scouts of America for over 30 years.  Dean White, CEO of Whiteco Industries, is credited with turning Merrillville, Indiana into the retail center that it is today. Dean is the founder of the Star Plaza in Merrillville, and he has developed much of the surrounding area, which includes hotels, businesses, shops, and offices. With business ventures ranging from billboard advertising to residential and hotel development to high-technology innovations, Dean's holdings include companies local to Northwest Indiana as well as businesses throughout the world. While Dean's contributions to business and development in Northwest Indiana are well known, it is equally important to acknowledge the impact he has made on his community through his constant support of local charities and organizations in the area.  Madam Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending these outstanding leaders on their induction into the Indiana Business and Industry Hall of Fame. These individuals are most deserving of being named the Inaugural Class of 2008, and for their leadership and commitment to the Northwest Indiana community, each of the recipients is worthy of our respect and admiration.                          ____________________
