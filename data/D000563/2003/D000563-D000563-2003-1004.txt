We did not try to ask him his opinions on how he was going to vote, all of which was done with Miguel Estrada, and he refused to answer those kind of questions, as he should have, as anybody who reads Lloyd Cutler would agree he should have.  I refer you to the President's letter which I am going to get to in a minute, if my colleagues will allow me to, because I want to make a statement before we finish this evening. In all honesty, Miguel has not been treated very fairly and he is certainly not being treated fairly by a filibuster--or should I say the ``filibustero''?--on the floor of the Senate.  Several Senators addressed the Chair.
