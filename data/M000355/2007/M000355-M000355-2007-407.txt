 Let me repeat publicly what I have said earlier, both publicly and privately, to my good friend the majority leader.  Republicans are going to need more amendments. We have had 12 rollcall votes on our side of the aisle on this bill to date. I think, at a very minimum, we need to have the same number of Republican rollcall votes on this bill we had last year. I think we can get there. We are not going to get there by shutting off additional important and worthwhile amendments on this side of the aisle. But it is certainly not my goal to not get this bill to passage, provided we have fair treatment on this side of the aisle.  I do think we made progress last night. I think we can make a lot of progress today. But we are not there yet. So I wish to make it clear that I urge a ``no'' vote on cloture, shortly. But again, having said that, I think we have a chance to get enough amendments processed to possibly finish this bill in the near future.
