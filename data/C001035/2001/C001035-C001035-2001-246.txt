President, I am delighted to join with my friend and colleague, Senator Johnson, in introducing the Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act of 2001. This legislation, which is an updated version of the measure we introduced in the 106th Congress, will provide our veterans with expanded educational opportunities at a reasonable cost. Endorsed by the Partnership for Veterans Education, a broad coalition including over 40 veterans service organizations and education associations, our legislation provides a new model for today's G.I. Bill that is logical, fair, and worthy of a nation that values both higher education and our veterans.  The original G.I. Bill was enacted in 1944. As a result of this initiative, 7.8 million World War II veterans were able to take advantage of post-service education and training opportunities, including more than 2 million veterans who went on to college. My own father was among those veterans who served bravely in World War II and then came back home to resume his education with assistance from the G.I. Bill.  Since that time, the G.I. Bill has seen a number of changes but has continued to assist millions of veterans in taking advantage of the educational opportunities they put on hold in order to serve their country. New laws were enacted to provide educational assistance to those who served in Korea and Vietnam, as well as to those who served during the period in between. Since the change to an all-volunteer service, additional adjustments to these programs were made, leading up to the enactment of the Montgomery G.I. Bill in 1985.  The Montgomery G.I. Bill has served our country well over the past 15 years. However, the value of the educational benefit assistance it provides has greatly eroded over time due to inflation and the escalating cost of higher education. Military recruiters indicate that the program's benefits no longer serve as a strong incentive to join the military; nor do they serve as a retention tool valuable enough to persuade men and women to stay in the military and defer the full or part-time pursuit of their higher education until a later date. Perhaps most important, the program is losing its value as a means to help our men and women in uniform readjust to civilian life after military service.  This point really hit home for me when I met last year with representatives of the Maine State Approving Agency (SAA) for Veterans Education Programs. They told me of the ever-increasing difficulties that service members are facing in using the G.I. Bill's benefits for education and training.  For example, the Maine representatives told me that the majority of today's veterans are married and have children. Yet, the Montgomery G.I. Bill often does not cover the cost of tuition to attend a public institution, let alone the other costs associated with the pursuit of higher education and those required to help support a family.  The basic benefit program of the Vietnam era G.I. Bill provided $493 per month in 1981 to a veteran with a spouse and two children. Before the reforms of last year, a veteran in identical circumstances received only $43 more, a mere 8% increase over a time period when inflation has nearly doubled, and a dollar buys only half of what it once purchased. In constant dollars, the amount was the second-lowest level of assistance ever extended under the G.I. Bill to those who served in the defense of our country.  While we made progress last year in increasing stipend levels under the G.I. Bill, the reforms fell drastically short of allocating sufficient funds to cover the current cost of higher education. Moreover, the increase failed to address the structural reforms needed to ensure that the G.I. Bill provides sufficient funds for the education of our nation's veterans long into the 21st Century.  To address these problems, we are offering a modern version of the Montgomery G.I. Bill. Our new model establishes a sensible, easily understood benchmark for G.I. Bill benefits. The benchmark sets G.I. Bill benefits at ``the average monthly costs of tuition and expenses for commuter students at public institutions of higher education that award baccalaureate degrees.'' This common sense provision would serve as the foundation upon which future education stipends for all veterans would be based and would set benefits at a level sufficient to provide veterans the education promised to them at recruitment.  The current G.I. Bill now provides nine monthly $650 stipends per year for four years. The total benefit is $23,400. Under the new benchmark established by this legislation, the monthly stipend for this academic year would be $1025, producing a new total benefit of $36,900 for the four academic years. By using our benchmark, which is updated annually by the College Board, the G.I. Bill benefits will truly reflect the current cost of higher education.  Mr. President, today's G.I. Bill is woefully under-funded and does not provide the financial support necessary for our veterans to meet their educational goals. The legislation that we are proposing would fulfill the promise made to our nation's veterans, help with recruiting and retention of men and women in our military, and reflect current costs of higher education. Now is the time to enact these modest improvements to the basic benefit program of the Montgomery G.I. Bill. I urge all members of the Senate to join Senator Johnson and myself in support of the Veterans' Higher Education Opportunities Act.                                 ______
