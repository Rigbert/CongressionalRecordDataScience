 SPC Earl Wilson of Liberty, KY, received his Purple Heart with Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for wounds suffered while serving our country in Vietnam. I want to share the honor and majesty of this event with my colleagues and so therefore ask unanimous consent that the full text of my remarks at the ceremony to award SPC Earl Wilson his Purple Heart with Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster, as well as the text of the two proclamations for the Purple Hearts, be printed in the Record following my remarks.  There being no objection, the remarks were ordered to be printed in the Record:Senator McConnell's Remarks at Awarding of Purple Heart With Bronze Oak           Leaf Cluster to Specialist Earl Wilson, July 2, 2014       Thank you for that kind introduction. It is my great honor      to be here for the presentation of the Purple Heart Medal      with Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster to Army Specialist Earl Wilson      of Liberty, Kentucky, for wounds received in action while in      service to our country in Vietnam.       It's a long-overdue honor that is finally upon us, thanks      to Earl's many family and friends who helped make this moment      possible. This event today is a testament to the unbreakable      bonds of family and friendship.       Because this ceremony is a high honor and a prestigious      occasion, we have several dignitaries with us who I want to      recognize, including State Senator Jimmy Higdon and Casey      County Judge-Executive Ronald Wright. Casey County Sheriff      Jerry Coleman and the county circuit court clerk, Craig      Overstreet, are with us. And I'm pleased to welcome Casey      County Attorney Tom Weddle and Liberty Mayor Steve Sweeny.       It's a pleasure to have Chris Smrt of the Kentucky chapter      of the Military Order of the Purple Heart here today to      welcome Specialist Wilson into their ranks, as well as VFW      Post 5704 Commander Claude Wyatt. Both organizations are      strong advocates for our veterans.       I'd like to recognize Glen Phillips, a veteran who played      an important role in today's ceremony.       Let me also say a special hello to my longtime friends,      Betty Lou and T.M. Weddle.       It's also an honor to recognize Sergeant Jesse T.      Wethington, fellow resident of Liberty and fellow member of      the Military Order of the Purple Heart, here today. Jesse,      welcome.       Finally, I'd like to welcome the members of Earl Wilson's      family who are from right here in Liberty and came to join us      today, including Earl's wife, Brenda, and family members      Crystal and John Davis; Melissa Wilson Durham; Addison and      Ian Davis; Tanner and Blake Durham; Jimmy Couch, Cierra      Couch, and Dave Brown.       The original Purple Heart was established by General George      Washington himself, and as such the Purple Heart is the      oldest existing military award that is still given to      servicemembers.       For a period in our country's history, however, the honor      fell into disuse. In 1932, to mark the bicentennial of      Washington's birth, it was General Douglas MacArthur who      spearheaded its revival.       We remember MacArthur for many things, not least of which      are his words. To an audience at West Point Military Academy,      he once said:       `` `Duty, Honor, Country'--those three hallowed words      reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be,      what you will be. They are your rallying point to build      courage when courage seems to fail, to regain faith when      there seems to be little cause for faith, to create hope when      hope becomes forlorn.''       As it turns out, these words have particular meaning for      the life and service of Specialist Earl Wilson. In the      jungles of Vietnam, he found courage where we could have not      blamed him for his courage failing, he found faith where      there was little cause for it, and he created hope when it      might have been lost.       Earl's time of service ended nearly 40 years ago, but our      admiration of it has not. Earl was drafted into the U.S. Army      and inducted on November 17, 1969. After completing basic      training, he was sent to Fort Polk, Louisiana, for infantry      school. Earl has said that in those days, if you went to Fort      Polk, you knew you were going to Vietnam, because Fort Polk      was the hottest, most miserable place there was. It was like      training for the intense heat.       Sure enough, Earl was deployed to Vietnam and served there      for one year, from July 1970 to July 1971. Traversing the      mountains and jungles of Vietnam, in an entrenched battle      with the enemy, was hazardous duty. Earl spent as long as 40      days on patrol in the sweltering jungles, without hot food,      without showers, without any of the luxuries or amenities so      many of us take for granted here at home.       Deployed with Company D, 1st Battalion, 6th Infantry      Regiment, 23rd Infantry Division, Earl and his unit came      under attack one night in January 1971. As daylight broke on      the morning of January 7, Earl's unit went in pursuit of the      enemy. Following a blood trail, they were in hot pursuit when      they came upon a gate along their path.       One of Earl's fellow soldiers tried to open the gate. It      was stuck, so he yanked on it, not knowing the gate was booby      trapped. A hand grenade went off, knocking Earl and several      other soldiers clean to the ground. Earl got pieces of      shrapnel lodged in his leg, and had to be flown out for      medical treatment.       Earl may have been down, but he was not out. After      receiving care for his wound, he was back in action with the      1st Battalion, and was present on January 25 later that year      on patrol in Quang Ngai.       As his unit proceeded on foot patrol, Earl was at the      point. Earl circled back to the rear to check on his fellow      soldier and best friend Specialist William Creech Jr. of      Paris, Illinois. Earl's entire company had trekked the same      path through the bushes, but as Specialist Creech entered the      bushes along the same path he stepped on a hidden landmine      and was killed.       Shrapnel from the landmine struck Earl in his head and arm      and threw him backwards onto the ground. Earl suffered not      only the loss of his best friend but also a severe hearing      loss, which he still carries to this day. But Earl's injuries      could have been worse. The landmine was so powerful it tore      down trees that were up to five inches thick within the blast      radius. Earl is lucky to be alive today.       Earl spent another six months in Vietnam before shipping      out on July 8, 1971. It's ironic that as he was handed a      four-inch thick stack of paperwork to process out of Vietnam,      Earl accidentally dropped one of the folders--and learned      from one document that he had received the Bronze Star Medal      for bravery. But Earl never received the Purple Heart he      earned with his blood and sacrifice--until now.       It is thanks to the unbreakable bonds of family and      friendship that Earl is receiving his Purple Heart with      Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster today. Earl's daughter, Melissa      Wilson Durham, wrote me to ask for help getting her father      the medals he deserved. Thank you, Melissa, for honoring your      father's service.       Earl was also helped by his friend and fellow soldier, and      friend to Kentucky soldiers everywhere, retired Staff      Sergeant Glen Phillips. It was Staff Sergeant Phillips who      helped gather the facts in order for Earl to receive his      Purple Heart today.       Glen, who is also from Liberty, has helped look out for      many veterans in the area over the years. Thank you Glen, for      your service and for your efforts on behalf of Earl and so      many other fellow veterans.       Earl, I know you accept this award with humility and grace,      and with reverence and respect for your fellow soldiers who      fought alongside you in the jungles of Vietnam, including the      many who did not make it home, such as Specialist William      Creech.       We're grateful for your service, Earl, and we're grateful      to celebrate your sacrifice. It's never too late to honor the      brave.       By the way, for those who do not know, the Bronze Oak Leaf      Cluster is to signify that     Earl is actually eligible to receive two Purple Hearts, for      the incident on January 7 and then also on January 25.       The presentation of this Purple Heart with Bronze Oak Leaf      Cluster is just a small recognition of the wealth of respect      you deserve for your service to our country and your service      in protecting all of us.       And to the values of duty, honor, country that you hold in      abundance, as General MacArthur prescribed--in a way that you      have demonstrated to all of us that it is possible to build      courage where there is none, to regain faith when it seems      lost, and to create hope when hope is what's most needed.       Now, the solemn moment we're gathered here for today has      arrived. Specialist Earl Wilson, Brenda, and members of the      Wilson family--please join me for the reading of the      proclamation and the presentation of the Purple Heart Medal      with Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster.
