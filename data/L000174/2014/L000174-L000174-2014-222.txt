President, last month, I spoke on the Senate floor about a friend from my hometown of Montpelier, VT, GEN Richard Cody. General Cody left Montpelier--one of our Nation's smallest State capital--to serve his country, beginning as a student at West Point. He had an outstanding military career serving all over the world and culminating with his service as Vice Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army.  General Cody recently returned to Vermont, where he was honored by his alma mater, Montpelier High School. Prior to the testimonial dinner saluting him, General Cody went back to the high school, where he inspired students with his patriotism and commitment to making a positive difference in the world. In fact, his student audience was so inspired with this tremendous leader that he received a standing ovation at the end of his remarks.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the article by Amy Nixon published in the April 5, 2014, edition of the Barre-Montpelier Times Argus in honor of General Cody's return to Vermont.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         [From the Barre-Montpelier Times Argus, Apr. 5, 2014]                    General Welcomed Back to Capital                             (By Amy Nixon)       Montpelier.--Gen. Richard Cody, a retired four-star general      who came up through the ranks at Montpelier High School,      returned to his alma mater Friday afternoon to share with      students, staff and faculty his story, as well as inspiration      for how the coming generation of young Americans can serve      their nation as leaders, whether or not they choose to wear a      uniform.       Cody is a graduate of the Class of 1968, and the message      board in front of the high school was changed to welcome him      back for the day's events. After high school he went on to      West Point and ascended through the ranks to become a four-     star general and the 31st vice chief of staff of the Army. He      retired in 2008, and serves today as the chairman of the      board for ``Homes for our Troops,'' a national nonprofit      organization which builds handicapped-accessible homes for      disabled veterans and their families.       Cody served in the Army for 36 years, and was one of fewer      than 40 four star generals in all of the armed forces      combined at the time of his retirement.       His visit was sponsored by the Montpelier High School      Boosters, who are also hosting a dinner tonight in Cody's      honor at the Capitol Plaza Hotel as part of their Celebration      of Excellence program. A short film presented to Cody at his      retirement, about eight minutes in length, was shown, with      photos of him as a young boy growing up here to his high      school sports accomplishments in newspaper headlines of the      day, his high school photo, shots of him during his career in      the Army and during his time at West Point, at his wedding,      with his children, and with the troops with whom and for whom      he served for nearly four decades--including several      returning soldiers whose bodies had been tangled by war, and      were in military hospitals with the General visiting their      bedsides.       Cody was known as the ``G.I.'s General,'' and at one time      former President George H.W. Bush introduced Cody, quipping,      ``Take a good look at him. I'm glad he's on my side!''       The film ended with Cody stating, ``You can't ever leave      the Army, you just take the uniform off.''       After the film, Cody shared stories of what it was like to      be the second in command of the U.S. Army, with more than 1.1      million American men and women in active duty, the reserves      and National Guard being his responsibility.       ``It's great to be back at Montpelier High School with the      Solons,'' he said, offering a walk-back through his life      before and after the Army by way of providing some life      lessons to the hundreds of young people sitting before him in      the same seats he once sat in.       ``I think back on all the things I learned in the schools      here,'' began Cody, saying as he came of age and entered West      Point, the United States was in troubled times, with riots      playing out in Detroit and elsewhere and an unpopular war in      Vietnam being waged. He said he enrolled at West Point with a      desire to learn to fly helicopters, thinking he'd be back      home in Montpelier in five or six years working at his      family's car dealership washing cars and changing oil.      Instead, he rose through the ranks and ended up in the halls      of the Pentagon.       ``I had no idea that I would spend four decades in uniform      and travel all over this world,'' he told students, coming      down off the stage with a microphone in hand to answer      questions after he spoke for some time.       Cody credited his upbringing and family, and his teachers      and coaches here with helping him to succeed, saying many of      the people who supported him through the years in the city's      schools ``saw potential in me,'' and encouraged him, as he      encouraged the students before him in the assembly to      ``choose the harder right over the easier wrong.'' He told      the group that really everything they need to know in life      they learned as little kids, from saying please and thank you      to not cutting line, to holding hands with a friend going out      to recess, to sharing toys, and cleaning up your toys when      you're done. He urged the high schoolers to be kinder to one      another, to support one another, to honor and respect the      people in their company now--and always.       ``My hope is you will reach the highest potential you have,      no matter what it is,'' said Cody. ``Do what's right when      everybody else wants you to do something different,'' he      urged. He told the students to ``seek the whole truth versus      the half truth'' in life.       Having traveled the world, including war zones in      Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere, Cody said ``People want what      you have,'' from clean water to plentiful food, sewers that      work, books, schooling--including for females--and peace and      safety. ``This is a great country. We need to make it      better.''       ``What type of American citizen do you want to be?'' Cody      asked. He urged them to be the type that ``goes into this      world to make a difference.'' He told them to be the people      who can look themselves in the mirror ``and say, I `did      good.' ''       Shelby Copans, 18, a junior, asked the general about the      lessons he learned, and he responded, ``As a leader, you have      to believe every day that everyone in your unit will do well.      Everybody has great potential. . . . It's your job to help      them reach that potential.'' He also said he learned to not      play favorites, ``because that really erodes team work.''       ``Respect for each other,'' was another critical component,      he said.       Students asked him about the Middle East, about the recent      shooting at Fort Hood by a military man, and conflicts around      the world.       Of Aghanistan, he said, ``It's not any better today than it      was on 9/11, and I could make the case it's worse.'' Some of      the hopes to really change conflicts in other parts of the      world are so deep culturally they are things that will take a      century to try to change, but the U.S. over and over works to      reduce violence, to ``stop things from boiling over,'' he      said.       A major problem worldwide, he said, is the lack of job      opportunity for young people, leading to unrest and      recruitment by terrorists.       Samantha Flanagan, 15, a freshman, asked Cody about the      recent shooting at Fort Hood, where Cody was twice stationed.      That shooting left four dead, including the shooter, all      members of the military.       Cody said the man was likely suffering from post traumatic      stress, saying, ``When you mix guns and you have medical      issues and mental health issues, it's tragic. We need to      figure out why can't we get medical and mental help they need      to them faster?''       In closing, Cody told students, ``You don't have to join      the military to serve this country. You can serve this      country in many ways, but if you go into the military, you'll      grow faster.''       ``Treat each other well, take care of each other,'' he      said, thanking those in the auditorium as they rose to their      feet, applauding their hometown hero.       As the event closed, it was announced that Cody is donating      a new custom-made, illuminated scoring table to his alma      mater.       After the auditorium event, Cody was given a tour of the      high school, and there was a reception for him in the      library. Later Friday afternoon, Cody was celebrated during a      meet and greet at VFW Post 792, an event sponsored by the      Montpelier High School Boosters and the American Legion Post      3.                          ____________________
