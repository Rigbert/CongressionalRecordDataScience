President, I rise today to pay tribute to Maj. Gen. Donald Edwards, who has served for the last 16 years as the Adjutant General of the Vermont National Guard. Ever since Ethan Allen and his famous Green Mountain Boys took the British fort at Ticonderoga, Vermonters have had a propensity to serve their nation as citizen-soldiers. That tradition is alive and well today, and thanks to Don Edwards, the Vermont National Guard is stronger today than ever before. Don was instrumental in starting the Army National Guard Mountain and Winter Warfare School, which trains soldiers from around the Nation in the rigors of winter warfare. He also excelled at being an advocate of Vermont's interests within the Pentagon.  I remember the case of the 1-86th artillery battalion, which in 1992 was abruptly threatened with elimination, even though it had one of the highest readiness and retention rates in the entire U.S. Army. It was the kind of short-sighted bureaucratic decision that Don Edwards could not tolerate, and he made a strong case to me. I helped save that battalion, although I had to hold up a defense bill to do it. Don never wavered in his devotion to do what was right for the men and women of the Vermont National Guard.  Recently, the Vermont Air Guard received four first-place awards at the Air Force's premier air combat competition, known as William Tell. Don always stressed to the soldiers and airmen under his command the importance of training hard and as realistically as possible.  During Desert Storm, his philosophy paid off, as several Vermont Guard units deployed to Southwest Asia and performed flawlessly during that conflict. Those were anxious times, and Vermonters saw a side of Don Edwards that they had never seen before. He was a tireless advocate for our deployed soldiers, and he acted with great compassion to do whatever he could to help the families of those who were deployed overseas.  I am sure that some of that attitude was shaped by his own experiences in Vietnam. I know that his tireless devotion to Vermont veterans of all wars has helped Vermonters appreciate the extraordinary sacrifices that were made by ordinary citizens. It seemed like whenever two or three veterans gathered together, Don Edwards was there to lend weight to their cause.  As Don Edwards hangs up his uniform for the last time, I want to give him my personal thanks for all he has done for Vermont, and to wish him good luck and Godspeed in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
