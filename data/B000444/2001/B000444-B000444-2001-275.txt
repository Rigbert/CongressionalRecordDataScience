 President, I rise today to introduce, along with Senator Hutchison, Senator Lott, Senator Daschle, and 47 other cosponsors, the High Speed Rail Investment Act of 2001. With this legislation we continue the work begun by our former colleagues, Senator Bill Roth, Senator Pat Moynihan, and especially Senator Frank Lautenberg, who worked so hard in the last Congress to support high speed intercity passenger rail.  Since the very first steam locomotive in this country rolled in Newcastle, Delaware, railroading has been a capital-intensive industry. From the rolling stock to the right of way, railroads require major long-term investments. But unlike every other passenger rail system in the world, Amtrak has lacked a secure source of public support for its capital needs. Over the years, along with many of my colleagues here in the Senate, I have looked for ways to right that wrong.  The bill that Senator Hutchison and I introduce today is designed to provide Amtrak with the capital funds to establish a truly national high speed passenger rail system. The idea is simple, and it is modeled on a program we already have in place to support another important public priority, public school construction. Under this legislation, Amtrak is authorized to issue, over the next ten years, up to $12 billion in bonds. Instead of an interest payment, the holders of those bonds will be paid by a rebate on their federal income taxes.  The funds generated from the sale of the bonds will be available for investments in high speed rail corridors throughout the country, from the established and profitable Northeast Corridor to planned corridors from Florida to the Pacific Northwest. One thing I learned from my days on the County Council in Delaware was that each route on a bus system supports and sustains the others. Cut one route, and ridership will fall off on the others as the whole system becomes less useful. Conversely, the more complete the system the more people will find that it meets their needs.  Another thing I learned on the county council, Mr. President, is that if state and local governments are required to put up some of their own funds to match assistance from the federal government, they will think long and hard about the best use of their funds. That is why this legislation requires a twenty percent match by the state before a high speed rail project can qualify for the support this bill provides. This provision not only provides an additional safeguard that high speed rail investments meet the many real needs the states have, but it also assures that the funds will be there to pay off the bonds as they come due.  Before a project is eligible for the funds raised under this bill, it must be reviewed by the Secretary of Transportation for its financial soundness, its role in a national passenger rail system, and its contribution to balance among the many regional corridors in the national system.  I know that I don't have to tell my colleagues about the growing chorus of public complaints about air travel in this country. All over the country, overworked and over booked airports and flyways keep passengers sitting in terminals or out on the runways, waiting for some movement in a clogged system. The vast majority of our most crowded airports are located near rail lines that could take some of those passengers where they need to go faster, safer, and more comfortably.  But only if we make the same investment in passenger rail that every other advanced economy does, Mr. President. Today, those tracks carry no passengers while our airports are bursting at the seams.  The same is true for the major highway corridors between our nation's cities. Those arteries are clogged with every kind of traffic, from freight haulers to vacationers to business travelers. Many of them run parallel to major rail corridors, that could share some of that load. But only, Mr. President, if we make the same investment in passenger rail that every other advanced economy does.  Just look at the lack of balance in our transportation spending, Mr. President. We spend $80 billion a year on our highways. We spend a billion just cleaning up road kills, and more than a billion a year salting icy roads. But we spend less than $600 million a year on rail infrastructure.  We spend $19 billion a year on aviation, but, again, less than $600 million on rail.  These numbers are even more disturbing when you realize what you get for each dollar spent. Look at the enormous cost of individual projects. Construction of a freeway in Los Angeles costs $125 million per mile. Per mile, Mr. President. But that is cheap compared to the ``Big Dig'' Central Artery in Boston--the price tag on that is $1.5 billion per mile. Airport construction is just as expensive: the Denver International Airport cost $4.2 billion. To expand the Los Angeles International Airport will involve $3 billion to $4 billion in ground transportation costs alone.  High speed passenger rail investments can get a lot more done for a lot less money--five to ten times as much as an investment in new highways. For example, expanding I-95, our major east-coast highway corridor, by just one lane can cost as much as $50 million a mile. That works out to about 45 passengers per hour for every million dollars. But a mile of new, high-speed rail track, which can cost $8 million a mile, will move 450 passengers per hour for every million dollars invested. That's a good deal all around.--fewer cars, less pollution, more people getting where they want to go.  Under the terms of the Amtrak Reform Act of 1997, we have put Amtrak on a path to self-sufficiency in its operating budget by the year 2003. I have said many times that I do not think that this is the wisest course. Given the long history of underfunding Amtrak's needs, I am far from convinced that we have put Amtrak in a position to reach full operating self sufficiency by that artificial deadline. But whatever we make of that deadline on operating support, Mr. President, it is clear that the very least we can do is provide Amtrak with the capital funds to become the passenger rail service this nation needs.  With the commitment of the leadership in both parties, with the support of over half of the Senate on the day of its introduction, this legislation is off to a great start. We will need all of these resources and more to see this through to final passage, and to get a real, world-class passenger rail system for the United States under way.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 250       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
