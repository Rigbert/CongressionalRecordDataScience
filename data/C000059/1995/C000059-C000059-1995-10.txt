Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Roemer amendment and in strong support for the international space station.  We have already spent billions of dollars over the years on this necessary program and I find it amazing that we are now discussing terminating funding at a time when mission launches begin next year.  The space station is needed to develop new materials and processes in industry.  This space station will accelerate breakthroughs in technology and engineering that will have immediate, practical applications for life on Earth--and will create jobs and economic opportunities today and in the decades to come.  It would maintain U.S. leadership in space and in global competitiveness, and serve as a driving force for emerging technologies.  The space station will force new partnerships with the nations of the world.  It would inspire our children, foster the next generation of scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs, and satisfy humanity's ancient need to explore and achieve.  We need the space station to invest for today and tomorrow.  Every dollar spent on space programs returns at least $2 in direct and indirect benefits.  And finally, the space station will help sustain and strengthen the United States' strongest export sector--aerospace technology--which in 1993 exceeded $39 billion.  We need the space station, for the present and for the future.  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Roemer amendment.
