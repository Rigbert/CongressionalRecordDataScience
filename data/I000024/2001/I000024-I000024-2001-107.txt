 This budget resolution stays on line to ultimately fully fund the impact aid.  I want to share an experience that I am going to abbreviate because I know we are short on time. I do not have that much time.  I was having a townhall meeting in Frederick, OK. Frederick, OK, is in the southern part of the State. At the meeting, I noticed on the sign-in sheet--I know the Senator from North Dakota and Senators from all the other States have townhall meetings. People sign in so we know where they are from.  There were two ladies there in Frederick, OK, who were from Texas. I said: I am glad to have you ladies here. You are certainly welcome to stay; however, I am a Senator from Oklahoma. I don't have a lot of say about what goes on in the State of Texas. They said: No, we want to be here because we want to give a testimonial. These two ladies stood up and they said: We are Democrats. We are very strong supporters of the NEA. When Governor Bush came out with some new programs we were violently opposed to them because they deviated from the programs we have been used to. The values have been increased. And we decided, since we were leading the opposition to what Governor Bush was trying to do in Texas, we would now come up here and say to you, in every place we can, that we were wrong, because essentially what we have been doing--and what I hear a lot of these Democrats over here talking about--is taking a failed system, a system that has not worked, and just pouring more and more money into it.  The criticism I hear on this budget is that we are trying to pour on more and more money without making major changes. I think we ought to have vouchers. We ought to do a lot of things we are not doing. At least we are trying some things that are new and different. That is what President Bush was doing when he was Governor Bush in the State of Texas.  These two ladies, these Democrats came up to make their testimonial at my public hearing in Frederick, OK. They said: What he has done is try new things. It is having a huge, positive impact on the quality of education, on testing in the State of Texas.  We need to try something new and innovative, and we are.  I will share an experience. Some of these things that are new and innovative really go back and latch on to things that have been discarded over a period of time. I happen to have four children and eight grandchildren. Back when my kids were young, I can remember coming home after I had been out of town. My older son at that time, Jimmy, who is now in his forties, was 7 years old or something like that. He came up to me and he had a smile across his face. I said: Jimmy, you look like something good happened.  He said: Yes, you know, daddy, I am in the fourth grade.  I said: Yes, Jimmy, I know that.  He said: Did you know that in reading and in arithmetic I am in the fifth grade?  I said: No, how does that work?  He said: Well, it is something that is brand new and innovative. What they do is, if you excel in one particular area, they move you up a grade so you can compete with those who are at your level, and you are not down there competing with someone who is at a lower level. He said: It is brand new and innovative.  I said: That is really great, Jimmy.  Then I remembered back. I always remember the timeframe of this because it was during the bombing of Pearl Harbor. I happened to be going to a country school. It was called Hazel Dell. And in this school there were eight grades in one room. There was a big potbellied, wood-burning stove. The school master's name was Harvey Bean, a giant of a man, I thought. Probably he wasn't all that big after all, if I were to meet him again today, if he were still alive. But I remember that they had eight grades in one room.  The first row was for the first grade; second row for the second grade, on up. So my brother was in the second row. I was in the first row. My sister was in the eighth row at this country schoolhouse called Hazel Dell. Every time you missed a spelling word, you would have to go up in front of the class and Harvey Bean and you would have to bend over. He had a big wooden paddle and he would swat you.  I tell my colleagues, I was the best speller in the first row. And so I was moved up to the second row so I could spell with the second graders, with my brother and some of the rest of them. So that program that my son called brand new and innovative was alive and well back in the early 1940s.  I understand in the State of Texas some of these things that they have tried that deviate from what we are trying to do now is just going back and getting things that worked in the past. I have to say that this President is going to do things that are new and innovative. He is going to try things that haven't been tried before. Our system has not worked. Our test scores have not gone up. Rather than just pour more money on a failed system, we need to try these things that worked in Texas. I think they are going to work in our Nation.  It is high time we try something new and that we get in a position where we can actually compete now with some of these other industrial nations.  I yield the floor.

Inhofe,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: On behalf of the Garrison School      District including the students and the community we serve, I      want to thank you for your leadership and support for the      Impact Aid Program. The amendment you offered on the Senate      floor to the Fiscal Year 2002 Budget Resolution is      appreciated by federally connected school districts all      across the country. You have consistently been there for the      Impact Aid Program, but the leadership you have brought to      the Senate floor the past two years has put Impact Aid on the      list of priority education programs among your Senate      colleagues. Although the program does enjoy a broad base of      bi-partisan support in the Senate, because of your role      Impact Aid has been taken to a new level.       All of us working with Impact Aid realize that much work      still remains if the $1.293 billion figure you placed in the      Senate Budget Resolution is to become reality. Please know      you can count on our school district and the community it      serves to do whatever it takes to help make that happen. You      have been there for us and now is the time for the     Impact Aid community to be there for you. Again, thank you      for taking on the challenge of putting Impact Aid on a      timeline that hopefully will get it to a point where the      federal obligation of full funding is realized. Not since the      late 1960's has the program been fully funded, but due to      your efforts we find ourselves at the threshold of a new era      for Impact Aid.           Sincerely,                                                        Mike Klabo     Superintendent.                                  ____                                         Minot Public Schools,                                        Minot, ND, April 27, 2001.
