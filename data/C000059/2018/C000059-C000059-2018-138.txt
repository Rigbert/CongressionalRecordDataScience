Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to William Richard Cramer, who passed away in California on Wednesday, June 20, 2018. Richard was an innovator in the feed and egg industries, and an active member of our community. He will be deeply missed.  Richard was born in Anaheim on July 25, 1931 to parents Olin and Ruth. He graduated from Anaheim Union High School in 1949 and received his B.A. from Claremont McKenna College in 1953. During college he served two years in the California Air National Guard and met Carole Furman, whom he married in 1952. They were married 45 years until Carole died in 1997. Richard married Mary Eisen and they have been together for 20 years. After graduating college, Richard joined the family egg production business. Over time this business grew to include Star Milling Co. in Perris, California, that was owned through a partnership between Richard and the Eisen family of Norco Ranch.  Richard was acknowledged as a leader in the animal feed and egg production industries and was awarded ``Farmer of the Year--Poultry'' by the California Department of Food and Agriculture in 1959. There were many other agricultural and business enterprises that Richard had ownership in, including Goose Creek Golf Club in Jurupa Valley, Orchard Egg Farms in Anaheim and Manchester Feeds in Arizona. Richard also served as a Trustee of Claremont McKenna College from 1987 to 2006. He was a leader in many civic and community organizations, past and present, as Member of the Board of Governors of the Bowers Museum, a founding donor to the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa, and a 35-year member of the Lincoln Club of Orange County.  I extend my heartfelt condolences to my good friend Mary Cramer, the extended Cramer family, his friends, and everyone fortunate enough to know Richard. Although Richard may be gone, the many significant contributions he made to his family and our community will have a lasting impact.                            ____________________
