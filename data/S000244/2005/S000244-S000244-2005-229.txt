Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 1065, the United States Boxing Commission Act. This is a big government bill that creates a new Federal agency that provides for more regulation and is not self-financing as has been intimated.  The top of page 13 of the Energy and Commerce Committee's report uses a CBO estimate that says: ``Assuming appropriation of the necessary amounts, CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 1065 would cost $5 million in 2006 and $26 million over the 2006-2010 period.''                              {time}  1615  That means that we are adding $26 million to the deficit to regulate one sport. That is not right. The Judiciary Committee received the sequential referral of this bill to consider several provisions within the legislation. The Judiciary Committee has long been involved in issues relating to professional sports, including oversight of the U.S. Olympic Committee, Major League Baseball, and the NCAA.  Many are concerned and have raised serious questions about the commercial and legal aspects within the sport of professional boxing. As a result, some have urged the creation of a Federal boxing commission to regulate this sport. The legislation would accomplish that goal.  Although the creation of the U.S. Boxing Commission itself does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, significant provisions relating to title 18 of the U.S. Code, which is the criminal code, and the authority of the Attorney General and the commission's executive director are within the committee's purview.  During the markup of this bill, the Judiciary Committee adopted a technical change to ensure that the use of administrative subpoenas comports with existing title 18 provisions. Additionally, as amended by the committee, the legislation will now allow a designee of the Attorney General to represent the commission in judicial proceedings rather than requiring the Attorney General himself to do so. Finally, the Judiciary Committee amendment removed the authority of the commission's executive director to make unilateral determinations regarding violations of this act or to bring action in Federal court. This means that such determinations will be required to be made by the full commission before action can be taken.  Although these Judiciary Committee amendments improved the legislation, the committee reported the bill with no recommendation, no recommendation, as a result of the concerns of many Members on both sides of the aisle regarding the underlying merits of the legislation. I share these concerns and do not support the goal of the legislation.  Notwithstanding the fact that there are well-founded concerns surrounding the support of boxing, I believe that the creation of a boxing commission is unnecessary and urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
