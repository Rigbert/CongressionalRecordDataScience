Speaker, reclaiming my time, I understand from those last comments, then, the position still is, if we cannot do it permanently we will not do it temporarily.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield. The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) is correct. Temporarily means that you cut taxes for a family and then raise them a year or 2 later, and we think that is incredibly unfair. We think people should not be charged for having children by the government, and it ought to be made a permanent thing.  Child tax credits are something that the American family enjoys. They like having more of their hard-earned money to pay for their children rather than for government, and we are standing with the American family.
