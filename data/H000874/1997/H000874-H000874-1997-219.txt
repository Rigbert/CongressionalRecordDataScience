Speaker, I have been listening to this and did not intend to speak on this particular subject.  Talk about class warfare, 50 percent of American workers pay more FICA than they do income tax, that big goose egg on the 1040 of which the gentleman speaks, 50 percent. But they are not Republican types because they are not making over $50,000 or $60,000 or $75,000 like all of us are. Everybody in this Chamber, are we not big deals?  But let me tell my colleagues about my three kids working and paying more FICA, and let me tell them something if they do not think these people need relief, trying to get a house and buy a car and do what we want them to do. Hard-working Americans, not our crowd, not the big bucks guys that my Republican colleagues want to give the big tax cuts to that bust the budget in the second 10 years and do exactly what they did in 1981, create $4.5 trillion dollars of new debt for working Americans to pay.  Yes, we want to give relief to hard-working Americans who pay taxes.                          ____________________
