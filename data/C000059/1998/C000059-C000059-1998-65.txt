Speaker, in 1956, President Dwight D. Eisenhower established the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports through an executive order as part of a national campaign to help shape up America's younger generation. In 1966, the Presidential Physical Fitness Award was initiated by President Johnson and is a prestigious accomplishment.  On October 1, 1998, the Linfield School in Temecula, CA, was designated as the 1997-98 President's Challenge State Champion School for Category II schools in California. The State Champion Award is presented to schools with the highest number of students scoring at or about the 85th percentile on the President's Challenge, a fitness awards program for children ages 6 through 17. The Linfield School had more than 82 percent of their student body score at or above the 85th percentile in the fitness program.  The five assessments of the President's Challenge measure four components of physical fitness: a one-mile run/walk for heart and lung endurance, curl-ups for abdominal strength and endurance, a ``sit and reach'' stretch for muscular flexibility, pull-ups for upper body strength and endurance, and a shuttle run for agility and explosive power.  On behalf of the residents of the 43rd congressional district, I congratulate the Linfield School for this award and commend them for recognizing that physical activity is an important component of health and development for future generations.                          ____________________
