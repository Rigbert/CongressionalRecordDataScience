Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would just like to remind everybody, the treaty for the Heritage Areas was ratified by the Senate and voted on by the House, but not the Biospheres. That is why we had to leave the Heritage. If I had my way, they would be out too. Let us be very up front about this. The Biosphere is, again, a designation by the U.N., by UNESCO, without any local input.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Idaho [Mrs. Chenoweth].
