 President, I wish to comment this morning on the Department of Energy's proposal to import spent nuclear fuel from foreign research reactors through commercial ports such as Tacoma, WA.  Before I begin, I would like to thank DOE, and in particular Mr. Charles Head, for the outstanding efforts put forward by DOE to ensure that the citizens of Tacoma have had adequate opportunities to review information and make comments on DOE's proposal. The additional public hearing held last week was well received and well attended and the extension of the public comment period until July 20th is appreciated. DOE's efforts have not gone unnoticed.  Mr. President, I fully appreciate the United States nuclear nonproliferation policies and objectives. I also understand the important role that removing spent nuclear fuel from the global marketplace plays in those policy objectives. Nonetheless, I would like to express my serious concerns regarding DOE's proposal. DOE's draft environmental impact statement on the handling of foreign spent nuclear fuel does not adequately assess the potential risks that alternative #1, the importation and interim storage of foreign spent nuclear fuel in the United States, could pose to the citizens of the United States, particularly those who reside in the port communities suggested as points of entry in the DEIS and those near proposed waste storage facilities.  Along with my colleagues from the State of Washington, I recently sent a letter to Secretary O'Leary outlining the reasons behind our concerns. I ask that a copy of that letter be printed in the Record. In summary, we raised concerns over the evaluation of the potential exposure of the general public to radiation, the inadequate training and equipment possessed by Tacoma emergency response units to deal with a radiation emergency, the failure to address the potential for terrorist activities during the importation process, and the proposal to use the Hanford nuclear facility as an interim storage facility. Given these concerns, we asked DOE to no longer consider using commercial ports such as Tacoma, but to limit further consideration of alternative #1 to military ports.  It has recently come to my attention that alternative #2 in the DEIS, facilitating the management of the spent nuclear fuel overseas, may be a better choice. Although the DEIS presents a number of difficulties in implementing alternative #2, it may be more feasible than previously thought. There is a processing facility in Scotland that is apparently both able and willing to take the spent nuclear fuel and reprocess it into more stable, less threatening material. I want to encourage DOE to fully investigate this possibility. It could ensure that we meet our nuclear nonproliferation goals without threatening the health and safety of United States citizens.  I look forward to working with DOE and the administration to ensure that we meet our nuclear nonproliferation objectives while simultaneously protecting the citizens of the United States.  The letter follows:                                                   U.S. Senate                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 1995.     Hazel O'Leary,     Secretary, U.S. Department of Energy,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary O'Leary. We are writing to express our      concerns over the alternatives proposed in the Department of      Energy's (DOE) Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) on      the management of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from foreign      research reactors. We are concerned about the proposed option      of importing the foreign SNF through commercial ports such as      Tacoma, WA.       While the desire to encourage other nation's research      reactors to switch to low-enriched uranium (LEU) from highly-     enriched uranium (HEU) is an integral component of the United      States overall nuclear nonproliferation policy, importing      foreign SNF through commercial ports may not be necessary.      The DOE DEIS lists two military ports among the ten possible      ports of entry for the SNF. We feel that DOE should limit      further consideration of importing SNF to these or other      appropriate military ports because of the considerable      concern amount citizens and city officials about importing      SNF through commercial ports.       First, there is significant apprehension about the threats      to public health importing this SNF through commercial ports      would create. Although DOE has stated that the threats to      public health are not significant given the state of the      material and the overly cautious design of the storage casks,      we are not convinced that no public health threat exists.      There is public concern that longshoremen, sailors, and      average citizens could potentially become exposed to      significant radiation levels. Whether this risk is real or      only perceived is irrelevant. Importing foreign SNF through      commercial ports would at best threaten public confidence and      citizens' sense of security and at worst pose a significant      threat to public health.       Second, the DEIS states: ``Primary responsibility for      emergency response to a foreign research reactor SNF incident      would reside with local authorities.''. Although the port and      city of Tacoma have emergency response plans for hazardous      materials, neither the Police and Fire Departments nor the      Port workers are properly equipped or trained to contend with      a significant radiation emergency. Properly equipping and      training these people would add a significant and unnecessary      cost to the overall proposal. In addition, it is not clear      that Police Officers, Fire Fighters, and port workers would      be willing to undergo such training, knowing that it opens      them up to potential future radiation exposure. In fact, port      workers in Tacoma may declare their unwillingness to handle      the material during even routine transport procedures, let      alone emergencies.       Third, importing foreign SNF through commercial ports runs      contrary to the overall policy objective of reducing the      world-wide availability of HEU and other nuclear waste. If      lengthy, unnecessary and relatively low-security      transportation of SNF occurs through commercial ports, the      increased opportunities for theft, hijacks, and sabotage      could result in greater accessibility to the SNF than      desired. As current events have unfortunately revealed, the      United States is not immune to terrorism, either foreign or      domestic. Even if this material could not be used in the      making of nuclear weapons, and some of it could, the very      fact that it is radioactive makes it dangerous. Transporting      this material through commercial ports would create an      unnecessary threat to national security.       These concerns present a compelling case for DOE to      preclude further consideration of commercial ports like      Tacoma, WA for the importation of foreign SNF. While removing      HEU and other nuclear waste from the global marketplace is an      essential aspect of nuclear nonproliferation, importing this      material through military ports may prove more reasonable      given the increased protection that could be provided to      public health and safety and national security.       We are also concerned about the proposal to store the      foreign SNF at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation. This idea is      unacceptable given the current state of affairs at that      facility. The current environmental problems associated with      the storage of nuclear waste at the Hanford site have      resulted in clean up costs near $50 billion. In addition,      current budget pressures will make it difficult for DOE to      meet its legally enforceable clean up schedule. Additional      waste management responsibilities could further hamper the      Department's efforts at the site.       In summary we would appreciate DOE limiting further      consideration of this proposal to military ports and adequate      storage facilities.       Thank you for your consideration. We look forward to your      response.           Sincerely,     Patty Murray.     Jim McDermott.     Norm Dicks.                               ____________________
