 Madam Speaker, it is a great privilege this evening to rise in support of H.R. 1553, the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act of 2008, and to thank my beloved colleague from Ohio, from our Buckeye State, Deborah Pryce, a loving mother and a very, very able Congresswoman, for taking her grief and helping place it here, and in memory of her beautiful daughter, taking that struggle forward for the sake of the future of our country.  I suppose one could say, ``for every season there is a purpose,'' and Caroline's season forever will be spring; and that what you lived together you shared with the country. And the personal became political in the best sense so that we could make it better for those who will come after us. And after all, is that not what we are here to do?
