Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Ms. McCarthy).  Ms. McCARTHY of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the National Recording Preservation Act of 2000, known affectionately as the Grammy bill. As a member of the Congressional Arts Caucus and the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences who produced the Grammys, I am a firm believer in the power of recorded music.  The preservation of our audio history is critical to sustain our cultural past for future generations. The Thomas-Hoyer bill, which I am proud to cosponsor, would establish a national recording registry in the Library of Congress to preserve recordings that are culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant to us as Americans.  Many of these recordings are in jeopardy because they were originally created on a type of media such as wax cylinders, Depression-era disks, or wire recordings, that have not endured the passage of time well, or require special apparatus to play that is rare or no longer exists at all.                              {time}  1445  It would be a tragedy to lose important compositions or recitations of our Nation's history when we have the ability to save them.  An example near and dear to my heart is the compilation of works by Kansas City jazz great, Bennie Moten. Bennie and his band created the famous Kansas City swing style of jazz that later made Count Basie a star. Recording between 1923 and 1932, Bennie Moten's music is archived on 78 RPM records which require special equipment to play. If these precious musical works are not preserved, Bennie Moten's innovative sound that provided a foundation for other great artists will be lost forever.  Mr. Speaker, it is not just music that would be robbed from us if we do not pass this critical legislation. Events from bygone eras have been recorded in sound as well as on paper. These recordings humanize the events we read about in textbooks and transport us to an understanding of our past more comprehensive than any history volume. During World War II, the Office of War Information recorded their broadcasts on disks that are in desperate need of preservation. These irreplaceable recordings include news about the war, music performances by war-era artists and speeches asserting our ideals and motives.  Another treasure in jeopardy is the archives of the National Public Radio. NPR offers review and information about current events, as well as topical discussions. Unfortunately, these records are on tape which absorb moisture from the air. In order to save these historical sound documents for our children, the tape must be baked and recopied. Without this bill, these historical broadcasts will be lost.  Mr. Speaker, the Grammy bill accomplishes a crucial task; safeguarding precious historical commemorations for generations to come. We all concede this protection is in place for our revered paper documents, such as the Declaration of Independence. It is time to bestow that same honor and respect on their audio counterparts.  I commend the sponsors for their leadership, and urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4846.  Mr. Speaker, I include the following for the Record.
