Dodd, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Kerry, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Bumpers, Mr. Wellstone, Mr. Jeffords, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Wyden, and Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                            S. Con. Res. 128       Whereas the United States and Mexico have a long history of      close relations and share many economic and security      interests;       Whereas the democratic and prosperous Mexico is in the      interest of the United States;       Whereas the United States is providing assistance and      licensing exports of military equipment to Mexican security      forces for counter-narcotics purposes;       Whereas the Department of State has documented human rights      violations by Mexican security forces and paramilitary      groups;       Whereas the conflict in Chiapas, Mexico has resulted in the      deaths and disappearance of innocent civilians;       Whereas the lack of progress in implementing a preliminary      peace agreement signed in 1996 and the presence of tens of      thousands of Mexican soldiers, as well as paramilitary and      other groups, have contributed to increased political tension      and violence in Chiapas and the absence of basic human rights      protections;       Whereas the persistence of political tension and violence      has exacerbated the impoverished conditions of indigenous      people in Chiapas;       Whereas thousands of indigenous people in Chiapas have fled      their homes as a result of the violence and are living in      deplorable conditions;       Whereas despite President Zedillo's calls for negotiations      and repeated visits to chiapas, efforts to negotiate a      peaceful resolution of the conflict have been unsuccessful      and the National Mediation Commission was dissolved after the      resignation of its President, Bishop Samuel Ruiz, due to the      lack of progress in the peace process; and       Whereas the summary expulsions of United States citizens      and human rights monitors from Mexico raise concerns about      the commitment of the Government of Mexico to freedom of      movement, association and expression. Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that the      Secretary of State should--       (1) take effective measures to ensure that United States      assistance and exports of equipment to Mexican security      forces--       (A) are used primarily for counter-narcotics purposes; and       (B) do not contribute to human rights violations;       (2) encourage the Government of Mexico to reduce political      tension and violence in Chiapas by disarming paramilitary      groups and decreasing its military presence there;       (3) commend the Government of Mexico for inviting the      United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to visit      Mexico to discuss the Chiapas conflict;       (4) encourage the Government of Mexico and the Zapatista      National Liberation Army to take steps to create conditions      for good faith negotiations that address the social, economic      and political causes of the conflict to achieve a peaceful      and lasting resolution of the conflict, and to vigorously      pursue such negotiations;       (5) support efforts to provide relief assistance to      displaced persons in Chiapas and adequate monitoring of such      assistance; and       (6) seek a commitment from the Government of Mexico to      respect the rights of United States citizens and human rights      monitors in Mexico in accordance with Mexican law and      international law.
