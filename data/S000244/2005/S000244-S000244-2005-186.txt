 Once again, there has been erroneous information presented to the House. The conference report on the delayed notification search warrant limits initial delayed notification to only 30 days unless the facts justify a later date. It permits extensions of up to 90 days unless the facts justify a later date and only upon the showing of need. And it has new reporting requirements on the use of delayed notification warrants.  Now, the original PATRIOT Act did not have these time limits. The delayed notification was determined it could be for a long period of time by a magistrate judge, a judicial officer, not by law enforcement, but by a judicial officer in determining when the notification would take place.  What I just described in the conference report is new language. It is limitations on how long a magistrate judge, a judicial officer, can delay notification of the warrants. You vote against this bill and you kill this bill, those limitations go down with the bill.  Madam Speaker, I yield 2\1/2\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Daniel E. Lungren).  (
