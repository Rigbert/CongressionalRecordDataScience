  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, 5 years and 9 days after 9/11 our system of aviation security is not yet done. In fact, today, a USA Today headline: ``Crisis Seen in Luggage Screening.'' We still do not have inline, integrated state-of-the-art baggage screening in the largest majority of U.S. airports. People would be appalled if they saw what went on behind the scenes that is supposedly providing for security.  But the Bush administration has said consistently for 5 years, we cannot afford to make flying safe and to screen cargo and baggage; we cannot afford it.  If they just would forgo the tax cuts for 1 year for wealthy investors, exempting their dividend taxes from a normal rate of taxation, we could put this equipment in every airport in America. But guess what? Those rich people do not care. They are flying on the private jets and the Bush people are flying on their military flights, so they do not really care about the American public and their security.  But this is a crisis and we cannot afford to continue to ignore what we need to do, what we need to invest to make the American flying public safe.  This administration must change direction or we must change the leadership in Congress.                          ____________________
