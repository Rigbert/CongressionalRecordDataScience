President, the fact is we have never had a hearing on this particular bill, S. 2271, not in the U.S. Senate. The fact is we do not have a report on this bill. S. 2271 was rushed to us and stuck on the calendar. It was just introduced last week. And without one second of hearings on this bill, without one word of a report, we Senators are asked to push forward and vote on it.  I am concerned that this bill radically changes a system which resolves thousands of land use decisions each week in thousands of American communities and cities. The zoning system in this country is working well. It is helping mayors, like Mayor Giuliani in New York, clean up their communities. Yet, as Mayor Giuliani said, the efforts he has made to clean up crime and clean up porno shops and clean up a lot of other problems in New York City, could be swept aside by this legislation.  I could show you stacks of letters from local citizens in Vermont, in Pennsylvania, in North Carolina, and in many other States who are up in arms about a provision of the 1996 Telecommunications Act that overrides local and State decisions involving cellular transmission towers. That provision, and this bill, were the subject of a recent article in Governing Magazine that was aptly titled, ``The National Zoning Nanny.''  Do we really want to federalize these local decisions by booting them into Federal court?  This bill is unwise, it is unsound, and it is unwarranted. We ought to be standing up here and defending our mayors, Governors, and our attorneys general, our towns and cities, and others in our States who understand the unintended consequences of this bill. We ought to stand up and say the people of Wyoming, Vermont, Utah, West Virginia, Rhode Island, North Carolina, Missouri, Alabama, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, North Dakota, Indiana, and Washington State, as the distinguished Senator from Washington State, Mrs. Murray said, know best how to make their decisions. And these people do not need the U.S. Senate to suddenly give them some new unfunded mandate and to make them liable for lawyers fees. We ought to respect the ability of the States to make decisions about how they run their communities, to make a decision of what is going to be built next to their schools or their churches or what kind of digging will go on next to the aquifers in their towns. All of these things could be quickly put before federal courts if we were to pass this bill.  Mr. President, in one minute, we are going to be voting. I hope we will vote not to proceed with this bill. We have never had a hearing on it. We never had a report on it. This issue is not ripe.  Mr. President, I yield any time I may have.                             cloture motion
