Speaker, I rise today in honor of the University of Wisconsin-Whitewater's Warhawks, who won the Division III Football National Championship on December 20, 2013. The Warhawks, led by quarterback Matt Behrendt and Head Coach Lance Leipold, displayed a tremendous amount of grit, determination, skill, and athleticism throughout their undefeated season.  In a battle of two of the best Division III programs, Wisconsin-Whitewater beat Mount Union in convincing fashion, 52-14. The win marked the fifth national title for the Warhawks and their first since 2011. The Warhawks have now won 20 straight postseason games dating back to the 2008 season.  The success of UW Whitewater football has made the residents of Wisconsin proud and I salute the entire team: Jake Kumerow, Mickey Morgan, Tyler Huber, Marcus McLin, Zach Howard, Josh Williams, Ryan Givens, Nick McCullough, Steve Morris, Coleton Hrgich, Joe Worth, Chris Nelson, Justin Howard, Lake Bachar, Shiloh Weber, Jack Deichl Jr., Matt Behrendt, Tommy Coughlin, Zack Gehant, Ryan Storto, Shawn Shillcox, Dylan Morang, Andrew Keister, Joe Paulus, Chris Treptow, Booker Ross, Jordan Ratliffe, Bennett Young, Zach Mutton, JD Marconi, Dennis Moore, Nick Patterson, Aaron Williamson, Colin Buck, Robert Johnson, Brady Grayvold, Jordan Strasburg, Jordan Gruettner, Spencer Jacque, Zach Schober, Eric Kindler, Ryan Winske, Brandon Bebow, Cole Klotz, Bryan Spakowicz, Kyle Christensen, Justin Dischler, Kyle Wismer, Zach Nellis, Ricky Valadez, Paul Foster, Ben Threloff, Ryan Cortez, Jesse DeLorme, Yuri Pogosyan, Matthew Hoppe, Spencer Shier, Jamison Cook, Conner Peters, Eli Sloneker, Eric Trautman, Tim Regan, Harry Green, Austin Jones, Jordan Edgerson, Nick Froland, Nick Feliciano, Andrew Keel, Griffin Schaefer, Tyler Janczak, Johnny Wiederholt, Pat Suffield, Evan Kurkowski, Lucas Skibba, Joe Matuschka, Pat Costello, Weston Wegener, Nick Ryczek, Tony Koepnick, Cole Van Schyndel, Brent Campbell, Zach Koch, Andrew Fuller, Chris Davis, Collin Nolen, Brian Washington, Tommy Miller, Logan Solano, Derric Junakin, Andrew Mulshine, Mykael Bratchett, Kevon Clunis, Brandon Tamsett, John Flood, Marshall Rutherford, Ryan Kranz, Loussaint Minett, and Zach Franz.
