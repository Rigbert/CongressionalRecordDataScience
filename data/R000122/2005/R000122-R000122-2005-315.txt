I phrase it slightly differently, but I reach the same conclusion.  If gun dealers--who now have the threat of a civil suit if there has been negligence--are so cavalier in their attitude about guns, selling them to criminals, to straw purchasers, what happens when they are fully immunized or virtually immunized from any type of liability? What happens when they know that no family is going to come in and say, My son or daughter died because of your negligence, and we are going to see if we can take you to court and get something back--we will never get the child back--but something back.  What about the surviving spouse or children who need something to maintain the quality of their life because they have lost their breadwinner?  There is the case of Conrad Johnson, killed by one of the DC snipers. Those cases would be barred by this legislation.  It is not that the individuals, families, and the survivors are denied their day in court, but any incentive to be responsible, to be scrupulous, to look harder to determine whether that person is buying the weapon at the direction of another, as a straw purchaser, is virtually eliminated. The consequences are going to be much worse. These dealers will be more flagrant, more blatant, less restrained. It is hard to see how they could be more blatant than they are today.
