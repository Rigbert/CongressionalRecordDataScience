 President, at around lunchtime, the Senate voted on Senator Thune's alternative to the Democratic leadership's extender bill. Senator Thune's amendment took the exact opposite approach to the Democratic leadership's substitute. It cuts taxes by $26 billion by extending current law. It cut spending by over $100 billion, and reduced the deficit by $68 billion. Those are Congressional Budget Office, CBO, and Joint Committee on Taxation estimates.  According to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, the current version of the Democratic leadership's extenders substitute would increase direct spending by about $105 billion through 2020 and raise revenues by about $50 billion over that period, resulting in a net deficit increase of about $55 billion for the 2010-2020 period.  The contrast couldn't be clearer. The Republican Conference, along with one member of the Senate Democratic Caucus, voted to change the bottom-line fiscal effects of the Democratic leadership's extender substitute. The Thune amendment would reduce the deficit by $13 billion more than the amount the Democratic leadership's extender substitute would add to the deficit. Senator Thune's amendment reached this better fiscal result by restraining Federal spending.  All but one of the Democratic Caucus who were present, 57 Senators, voted against Senator Thune's amendment.  The junior Senator from Florida, one of the 41 Senators who voted for Senator Thune's amendment, came to the Senate floor to highlight the differences between the Democratic Caucus and the Republican Conference in the approach to this extender bill.  The junior Senator from Michigan also made some comments on the current fiscal problems. She made her arguments in response to comments from the junior Senator from Florida. Last year, at about this time, there was a lot of revision or perhaps editing of recent budget history. I expect more of it from some on the other side.  The President signaled as much in an interview with George Stephanopoulos a few months ago. I agree with the President that there's a lot of revisionism in the debate.  The revisionist history basically boils down to two conclusions:  1. That all of the ``good'' fiscal history of the 1990s was derived from a partisan tax increase bill of 1993; and  2. That all of the ``bad'' fiscal history of this decade to date is attributable to the bipartisan tax relief plans.  Not surprisingly, nearly all of the revisionists who spoke generally oppose tax relief and support tax increases. The same crew generally support spending increases and oppose spending cuts.  In the debate so far, many on this side have pointed out some key, undeniable facts. The stimulus bill passed by the Senate, with interest included, increases the deficit by over $1 trillion. The stimulus bill was a heavy stew of spending increases and refundable tax credits, seasoned with small pieces of tax relief. The bill passed by the Senate had new temporary spending, that,if made permanent, will burden future budget deficits by over $3 trillion. That is not Chuck Grassley speaking. It is the official Congressional scorekeeper, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO.  All of this occurred in an environment where the automatic economic stabilizers thankfully kicked in to help the most unfortunate in America with unemployment insurance, food stamps and other benefits.  That antirecessionary spending, together with lower tax receipts, and the TARP activities has set a fiscal table of a deficit of $1.4 trillion for the fiscal year that ended several months ago. That is the highest deficit, as a percentage of the economy, in post-World War II history.  Not a pretty fiscal picture. And it is going to get a lot uglier with the budget put forward by the President this year. It's the same result under the budget crafted last year by the Democratic leadership. So, for the folks who see this bill as an opportunity to ``recover'' America with government taking a larger share of the economy over the long-term, I say congratulations. You have recovered America with a vast expansion of government and the American people have a lot of red ink to look forward to.  Members who voted for the budget and the fiscal policy envisioned in it put us on the path to a bigger role for the government. But supporters of that fiscal policy need to own up to the fiscal course they are charting.  That's where the revisionist history comes from. From the perspective of those on our side, it's seems to be a strategy to divert, through a twisted blame game, from the facts before us. How is the history revisionist? Let's take each conclusion one-by-one.  The first conclusion is that all of the ``good'' fiscal history was derived from the 1993 tax increase. To test that assertion, all you have to do is take a look at data from the Clinton administration.  The much-ballyhooed partisan tax increase of 1993 accounts for 13 percent of the deficit reduction in the 1990s. Thirteen percent. That 13 percent figure was calculated by the Clinton administration's Office of Management and Budget, OMB.  The biggest source of deficit reduction, 35 percent, came from a reduction in defense spending. Of course, that fiscal benefit originated from President Reagan's stare-down of the communist regime in Russia. The same folks on that side who opposed President Reagan's defense build-up take credit for the fiscal benefit of the ``peace dividend.''  The next biggest source of deficit reduction, 32 percent, came from other revenue. Basically, this was the fiscal benefit from pro-growth policies, like the bipartisan capital gains tax cut in 1997, and the free-trade agreements President Clinton, with Republican votes, established.  The savings from the policies I have pointed out translated to interest savings. Interest savings accounts for 15 percent of the deficit reduction.  Now, for all the chest-thumping about the 1990s, the chest thumpers, who push for big social spending, didn't bring much to the deficit reduction table in the 1990s. Their contribution was 5 percent.  What's more the fiscal revisionist historians in this body tend to forget who the players were. They are correct that there was a Democratic President in the White House. But they conveniently forget that Republicans controlled the Congress for the period where the deficit came down and turned to surplus. They tend to forget they fought the principle of a balanced budget that was the centerpiece of Republican fiscal policy.  Do my friends on the Democratic side remember the government shutdown of late 1995? Remember what that was about? It was about a plan to balance the budget. Republicans paid a political price for forcing the issue, but, in 1997, President Clinton agreed. Recall as well all through the 1990s what the year-end battles were about.  On one side, congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration pushed for more spending. On the other side, congressional Republicans were pushing for tax relief. In the end, both sides compromised. That is the real fiscal history of the 1990s.  Let's turn to the other conclusion of the revisionist fiscal historians. That conclusion is that, in this decade, all fiscal problems are attributable to the widespread tax relief enacted in 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2006.  In 2001, President Bush came into office. He inherited an economy that was careening downhill. Investment started to go flat in 2000. The tech-fueled stock market bubble was bursting. Then came the economic shocks of the 9-11 terrorist attacks.  Add in the corporate scandals to that economic environment.  And it is true, as fiscal year 2001 came to a close, the projected surplus turned to a deficit.  In just the right time, the 2001 tax relief plan started to kick in. As the tax relief hit full force in 2003, the deficits grew smaller. This pattern continued up through 2007.  If my comments were meant to be partisan shots, I could say this favorable fiscal path from 2003 to 2007 was the only period, aside from 6 months in 2001, where Republicans controlled the White House and the Congress. But, unlike the fiscal history revisionists, I am not trying to make any partisan points, I am just trying to get to the fiscal facts.  There is also data that compares the tax receipts for 4 years after the much-ballyhooed 1993 tax increase and the 4-year period after the 2003 tax cuts.  In 1993, the Clinton tax increase brought in more revenue as compared to the 2003 tax cut. That trend reversed as both policies moved along. Over the first few years, the extra revenue went up over time relative to the flat line of the 1993 tax increase.  So, let's get the fiscal history right.  The progrowth tax and trade policies of the 1990's along with the ``peace dividend'' had a lot more to do with the deficit reduction in the 1990s than the 1993 tax increase. In this decade, deficits went down after the tax relief plans were put in full effect.  No economist I am aware of would link the bursting of the housing bubble with the bipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 and 2003. Likewise, I know of no economic research that concludes that the bipartisan tax relief of 2001 and 2003 caused the financial meltdown of September and October 2008.  As I said, from the period of 2003 through 2007, after the bipartisan tax relief program was in full effect, the general pattern was this: revenues went up and deficits went down.  That is the past. We need to make sure we understand it. But what is most important is the future. People in our States send us here to deal with future policy.  They don't send us here to flog one another, like partisan cartoon cut-out characters, over past policies. They don't send us here to endlessly point fingers of blame. The substitute before us takes us in the direction of more deficits and debt. The Thune amendment, which was rejected by most of the Democratic Caucus, would have put us on a path in the opposite fiscal direction. My friends on the other side fool no one if they pretend that the fiscal choices made by the Democratic Leadership and the President over the last year have nothing to do with this rapidly rising debt.  President Obama rightly focused us on the future with his eloquence during the campaign. I would like to paraphrase a quote from the President's nomination acceptance speech:       We need a President who can face the threats of the future,      not grasping at the ideas of the past.  President Obama was right.  We need a President, and I would add Congressmen and Senators, who can face the threats of the future. Grasping at ideas of the past or playing the partisan blame game will not deal with the threats to our fiscal future.  It is not too late to correct the excesses of the stimulus bill or the bloated appropriations bills that will come. The Senate missed an opportunity, with a partisan rejection of Senator Thune's alternative.  Senator McCaskill's and Sessions' amendment, which calls for a time out on the exponentially rising levels of appropriations spending, is a good start. The President called on the Democratic leadership to do something similar. That is what the American people want and need. There is a way to reach a real bipartisan compromise, not just picking off a few Senators that frequently vote with the Democrats.                          ____________________
