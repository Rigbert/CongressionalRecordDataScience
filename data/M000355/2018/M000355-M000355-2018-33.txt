 President, I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of the senior Senator from Texas, all postcloture time be considered expired and the Senate vote on the Maguire nomination; that if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; and that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action with no intervening action or debate.
