 President, I rise today to honor the extraordinary career accomplishments of one of the Commonwealth's most talented and devoted medical professionals. Dr. Richard Stoltzfus, who has provided thousands of Kentuckians with his medical expertise as an internal medicine physician at the Daniel Boone Clinic in Harlan, KY, will retire at the end of April after 35 years of dedicated service.  Although born and raised in Pennsylvania, Dr. Stoltzfus always knew life held something different in the cards for him. After completing his medical degree at Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia, practicing internal medicine in Darby, PA, completing his residency training at Mercy Catholic Medical Center in Philadelphia, and volunteering at Hospital Grande Riviere du Nord in Haiti for 6 years, Dr. Stoltzfus decided to pursue his goal of providing medical care to residents in rural towns where he believed it was needed most. This belief is what led him to Harlan, KY, where he began work for the Daniel Boone Clinic in August 1976. Along with being a practicing physician, he also served as medical director of the Mountain Heritage Hospice since its beginning in 1980 to 2000, and was chief of medical staff at the Harlan Appalachian Regional Healthcare Hospital during his 35-year tenure.  Dr. Stoltzfus's long career shows his passion for helping others not only by ridding them of illness, but also by promoting overall wellness and health. His definition of health is not just the absence of disease, but the presence of physical, social, emotional and spiritual well being. Dr. Stoltzfus forms lasting bonds with his patients because they can see how much he truly cares.  Dr. Stoltzfus has said that the years he has spent in Harlan County have been the best years of his life. This may be true, but it is also safe to say that the contributions of dedicated and special people such as him are what make communities like it such wonderful and hospitable places to both work and live. I send my best wishes to Dr. Stoltzfus and his wife as they move on to the next phase of life: Dr. Stoltzfus has said they plan to move to Virginia to be closer to their children. I am sure their children will be glad to have more of their father around--just as I am sure the whole family is very proud of him and his life of accomplishment. I offer my sincerest congratulations to Dr. Stoltzfus on an exceptional career.  Mr. President, the Harlan Daily Enterprise recently published an article honoring the career of Dr. Stoltzfus. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Harlan Daily Enterprise, Feb. 26, 2011]            Daniel Boone Clinic Physician To Retire in April                           (By Nola Sizemore)       After 35 years of service as an internal medicine physician      at the Daniel Boone Clinic, Dr. Richard Stoltzfus will retire      at the end of April.       ``I'd like Harlan County people to know how much I      appreciate them making the last 35 years living and working      here in Harlan County the best years of my life,'' said      Stoltzfus. ``I know I've been able to serve people here and,      in turn, I have been blessed by people here in many ways by      the show of affection and appreciation my wife and I have      received.''       Stoltzfus said after he finished his residency training in      Philadelphia, Pa. he wanted to practice medicine in a place      where he felt there was a real medical need--not in an urban      area, but a rural area. He said he learned about a job      opening in Harlan County from a friend, Dr. J.D. Miller, who      was a physician at the Cloverfork Clinic during that time.       ``I met Dr. Miller in Haiti where I was a volunteer for six      years prior to coming to Harlan,'' said Stoltzfus. ``I      applied for the position and began work at the Daniel Boone      Clinic in August, 1976.''       Along with being a practicing physician at the Daniel Boone      Clinic, Stoltzfus has also served as medical director of      Hospice since its beginning. He said in the last few years he      had worked as assistant medical director.       Stoltzfus also served as chief of medical staff at the      Harlan ARH Hospital during his tenure.       ``Hospice is a wonderful organization, and I really believe      in it,'' said Stoltzfus. ``A lot of people placed in Hospice      have a certain life expectancy and most of the time they      exceed that. I believe it's because of the care they receive      from the wonderful staff.''       Stoltzfus said one of his guiding principals, while      practicing medicine in Harlan County, had been promoting      wellness. He said the definition of health is not just the      absence of disease, but it's the presence of physical,      social, emotional and spiritual well being.       ``I can cure a person of pneumonia, but that person can      still be sick,'' said Stoltzfus. ``I may refer them to      pastors or counselors or help them work on relationships--to      promote a wholesome life. I believe in spending time with      patients. I've always seen myself on an equal playing field      with my patients. As a physician, of course, I have knowledge      to share, but I involved my patients in decision making.''       Stoltzfus said there were many points in the last 35 years      of living in Harlan County, and two that stood out in memory      were his trip to Washington D.C. with the Harlan Boys Choir      when they sang at the inauguration of President George Bush.      He said he was proud to be a part of those representing      Harlan County to the world.       ``My family was flooded in 1977,'' said Stoltzfus. ``We      lived in Rio Vista and had four feet of water in our house. I      remember I had a patient, who had just had a heart attack,      that wanted to help me and my wife clean the mud from our      home. He wasn't physically able to help, so he sent his wife      to help us--that's what Harlan County people do--care about      their neighbors. The whole community supported us during that      time. Things like that touch your heart. The way the people      of Harlan County watch out for each other has always touched      me. I love the small town atmosphere evident here in Harlan      County.''       Stoltzfus said after his retirement, he and his wife would      be relocating to Virginia to be near their two children. He      said he planned to always keep in touch with his friends here      in Harlan County.       ``My coworkers are like family to me,'' said Stoltzfus.      ``Harlan County is a wonderful place to raise families. It      has values of community and caring which I think some      communities have lost. Harlan has been put down by a lot of      people; but I've always been proud of Harlan because of what      they have to offer here. Our children are well educated and      very prepared for their future. I'm very proud of our      educators here in the county and the job they're doing.      Harlan has a lot to offer and I'd recommend it to everyone.      I'm going to miss living and working here.''                          ____________________
