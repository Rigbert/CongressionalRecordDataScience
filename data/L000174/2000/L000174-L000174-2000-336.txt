President, throughout the dispute over Elian Gonzalez, I have argued that he should be reunited with his father Juan Miguel, I have made this argument because I believe that children belong with their parents, barring evidence of unfitness. I also made this argument because I was concerned about how American parents are being treated internationally.  At the Judiciary Committee hearing held on the Elian Gonzalez case on March 1, I also urged that we consider the potential impact of that case on those of U.S. parents fighting to gain custody of their children in other countries. In fact, at that hearing I made sure to invite a U.S. parent who has struggled for years just for the right to see his children in Japan, and who believes, as do other American parents in similar circumstances, that to preserve American credibility we must practice what we preach and reunite Elian Gonzalez and his father.  I worked for months on such a case of an American child who was taken abroad by an estranged parent. Had it not been for the active intervention of the Government of Egypt, the child would not have been reunited with his American mother. Reuniting Elian and his father was the best thing for Elian and also the best way to advance American interests--and the interests of American parents whose children have been taken abroad without their consent.  At the March 1 hearing, I quoted Mary Ryan, the Assistant Secretary of State for Consular Affairs, who had testified in the federal court case regarding Elian Gonzalez that a failure to enforce the INS' decision that Elian Gonzalez should be reunited with his father would ``be inconsistent with the principles we advocate on behalf of the United States and could have potentially lasting negative implications for left-behind parents in the United States and for U.S. citizen children taken to foreign countries.''  I believe that the American government should stand behind that principle and seek to bring children and their parents back together. I am proud that the government has reunited Elian and his father, and I think the pictures of the two of them together have proven beyond a doubt that this was the right result.  But I am deeply concerned that the energy and effectiveness that our government showed in reuniting Elian and his father does not always seem to apply to its attempts to reunite American children and their parents. Indeed, recent articles in the Washington Post indicate that our State Department should take a far more active role in helping American parents who--in violation of international law--are being deprived of custody of their children.  The Washington Post tells the story of Joseph Cooke, a New York man whose then-wife took their two young children to Germany and, without Mr. Cooke's consent, turned the children over to the state because she felt unable to care for them. For a year and a half, Mr. Cooke was unable to find out what had happened to his children, as his wife refused even to tell him where they were. When he finally was able to locate them, he sought custody of them in both American and German courts. Although he obtained a custody order from an American court, which under the Hague Convention is binding upon Germany since the children had resided in the United States for all of their young lives, the German courts have refused to grant him custody. Instead, they have ruled that the children should stay with their foster parents, in part because during the drawn-out German legal process, the children learned German, went to German schools, and grew attached to their foster parents. The court felt that reuniting these children with their father would result in ``severe psychological loss.''  The State Department's reaction to this case hardly befits the importance of the issue involved. Despite Germany's obligations under the Hague Convention, a State Department spokeswoman told the Washington Post, ``We're not the courts. It's up to the courts to make those kinds of decisions.'' The very point of the Hague Convention is to provide countries with a diplomatic opportunity to question the rulings of courts outside the country were the children habitually reside. The Convention is rendered meaningless if our State Department is not willing to act as a strong advocate for American parents. As the Post reported, only 80 out of the 369 children--22 percent--who were the subject of Hague applications from American parents from 1990 to 1998 have come back to the United States, and that number includes those children who were voluntarily returned. Meanwhile, U.S. courts have returned 90 percent of children who were the subject of Hague applications in other countries.  In other words, while America obeys its treaty obligations, it has failed to enforce our own treaty rights. This is not a minor problem, either. The State Department says that it has 1,148 open international custody cases, and there are surely far more cases that have not been reported to the government. The State Department should be doing everything within its power to help American parents. I implore our government to pay more attention to this issue, and I ask our allies to abide by their own duties under the Hague Convention.  I ask unanimous consent to enter an editorial on this matter from today's Washington Post into the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, May 9, 2000]                            Stolen Children       When Congress was considering legislation that would have      kept Elian Gonzalez in this country, State Department      officials argued that such a precedent could disrupt their      efforts to intervene in cases where American parents have had      children abducted abroad. A sound argument, with one big      problem: It turns out that in many of the 1,100 open cases in      which American parents are fighting to get their children      back from recalcitrant court systems in other countries, the      State Department isn't making much effort on the parents'      behalf. The heartwrenching story of Joseph Cooke and his      children, told Sunday in this newspaper by Post reporters      Cindy Loose and William Drozdiak, highlights an unusually      egregious problem with German-American custody battles in      particular: In at least 30 cases, advocates say, German      judges have flouted basic tenets of the 1980 Hague treaty on      international abductions, to which their country is a      signatory, and kept children from parents who had      overwhelming claims to them. But the Cooke story also reveals      an almost incomprehensibly lackadaisical U.S. Government      response to the     human tragedies that arise when a parent cannot get his or      her rights enforced.       The Hague Convention calls for quick resolution of custody      disputes in the country where a child ``habitually resides.''      The law lacks teeth: An official at the U.S. Embassy in      Germany told a Post reporter that he viewed the Hague      Convention as ``a voluntary compliance sort of thing.'' Up      the ladder, it's the same: U.S. ambassadors fail to raise      individual cases or to make diplomatic noise over these      cases. German officials say they cannot intervene in the      court system. German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer,      meeting with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright this week,      echoed that view when the secretary raised the Cooke case--     though Mr. Fischer said he was touched by the Cookes'      ``personal tragedy.''       American reluctance to apply diplomatic pressure makes no      more sense than German excuses about ``interfering'' in the      judiciary. Public and private pressure through diplomatic      channels on behalf of sundered families can indeed have an      effect; so could legislation to require judges to be trained      in the applicable laws. When an ally such as Germany flouts      good conduct in this regard, the issue should rise to the top      of the diplomatic agenda, not be shunted aside.                          ____________________
