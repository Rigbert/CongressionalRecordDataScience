 I hope that the passage of this bill will help to put this country on her way back to a balanced budget. Included in the bill is the appropriation for funding for the National Bankruptcy Review Commission. This Commission was established pursuant to enactment of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 which both the House and Senate passed unanimously. I wish to ask my distinguished colleague from Alabama to clarify a few issues regarding that Commission, since he managed the authorizing legislation last session. First, is it not correct that pursuant to section 608 of the act, the 2-year period for submitting its report should be based on the date on which the first meeting is held.
