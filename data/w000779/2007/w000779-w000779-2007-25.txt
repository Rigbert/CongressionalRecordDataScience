President, I am going to wrap up very briefly, and I know the Senator from Alabama was waiting, but the Senator from North Dakota wanted to do a very brief unanimous consent request, and I think that is acceptable to all Senators.  I thank the Senator from Iowa for his assistance. What the Senator from Iowa essentially described, by way of bringing together people such as wheat growers and corn growers and conservation groups and the Wildlife Federation, the League of Conservation Voters--this is the future of modern agriculture: bringing all these folks together so we can take steps that will ensure that farmers grow their incomes. We want farmers to prosper on the land. We want to make sure their kids have a future in agriculture. To do it, we are going to have to adopt, as the Senator from Iowa has pointed out, an approach that encourages more sustainable agriculture.  We think this is a winner for farmers' income. We think this is good for the environment. We think it is going to promote conservation.  The Senator from Georgia has left the Senate floor, but it is my intent, with the Senator from Iowa, to work closely today and over the next day or so to make an agreement that will be acceptable all around. I think we are capable of doing it. I thank the Senator from Iowa, once again, for his support and that of his staff on some other issues as well--the illegal logging question, where the chairman has been so helpful.  I yield the floor.                   Modification to Amendment No. 3695
