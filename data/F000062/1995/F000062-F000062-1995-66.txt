  Mr. President, I rise to support the motion to commit to the Judiciary Committee, and I do that as the only woman in the U.S. Senate on the Judiciary Committee. This is a matter which basically affects women, and I think it really is appropriate to have the hearings that have been requested and to come to grips with some of the problems that are inherent in this legislation.  I would like to give you my major reasons for suggesting that hearings in the Judiciary Committee are appropriate.  I believe that the language in this bill is unduly vague. It is not based on medical terminology. The bill holds a doctor criminally liable for a procedure that is defined not in medical terms but in a description devised by legislators. I think we need to come to grips with that and find out exactly which procedures would be impacted by this legislation.  Second, Roe versus Wade already provides for States to legislate in the third trimester. And, in fact, 41 States do already have statutes on the books which govern abortions in the third trimester. There are also very strong writings and beliefs that this bill would violate the Constitution. I think that is worthy of a hearing.  Finally, there is a very real human dilemma in this. Unfortunately, the genetic code which carries out God's creation is sometime's tragically faulty. And this produces heartbreaking circumstances in which children have developed in the fetus without brains, children have developed with the brain outside of the skull, children develop without eyes or ears, whose stomachs are hollow, and the materials having to do with intestines and bladder are created outside of the physical structure of the individual.  When we consider the nature of these heartbreaking pregnancies, these very dire circumstances, we must also consider the life and health of the mother. So I believe very strongly that this is the correct action to take, to have these hearings and to report this bill back to this body within a specified period of time.  Let me just very quickly speak to certain issues. In 1973, in Roe versus Wade, the Supreme Court established a trimester system to govern abortions. In that system, in the first 12 to 15 weeks of a pregnancy, when 95.5 percent of all abortions occur, and the procedure is medically the safest, the Government may not, under Roe, place an undue burden on a woman's right to an abortion.  In the second trimester, when the procedure in some situations poses a greater health risk, States may regulate abortion, but only to protect the health of the mother. This might mean, for example, requiring that an abortion be performed in a hospital or performed by a licensed physician.  In the later stages of pregnancy, at the point the fetus becomes viable and is able to live independently from the mother, Roe recognizes the State's strong interest in protecting potential human life. On that basis, States are allowed to prohibit abortions, except in cases where the abortion is necessary to protect the life or the health of the woman. I repeat, the life or the health of the woman.  Contrary to the many myths put forward by opponents, abortion in the latest stages of pregnancy is extremely rare and performed almost exclusively under the most tragic of circumstances--to protect the life or health of a woman who very much wanted that pregnancy, or in the case of a severe and fatally deformed fetus.  As I said, 41 States have enacted laws restricting abortions in the later stages of pregnancy. Even when such abortions have been restricted, States have, in nearly every case, made exceptions to protect the life and the health of the mother.  States such as Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and Utah--all these States, and many more, have recognized the crucial need to consider risks to a woman's health, in addition to risks to a woman's life, in balancing the important considerations of both the fetus and the mother. To do otherwise would be to fail to accord consideration to the safety and well-being of our Nation's women. To do otherwise would be callous, and cruel.  Certain States have chosen to remain silent on the issue--most likely because these abortions are so rare and considered so tragic, that new laws are not necessary to interfere with what many believe is a medical decision between a woman and her doctor.         THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT BE STEPPING IN HERE  There are several compelling reasons why the Federal Government should not step in and interfere in this medical decision between a doctor and a patient.  First, there is no need to. Except in the rarest of cases, abortions late in the pregnancy simply do not occur, and when they do, as I have said, it is due to the most tragic of circumstances. Only one-half of 1 percent of all abortions are performed after the 20th week of pregnancy. Fewer than four one-hundredths of 1 percent (.04) occur in the third trimester, and nearly all of these are performed due to severe fetal abnormalities or grave risks to the health or life of the pregnant woman.  Many of the people pushing this legislation profess to believe in States' rights, and keeping government off our backs. Why, then, do they suddenly think Big Brother should step in when the issue is abortion? Roe versus Wade gave States the authority to regulate and even ban abortion after viability. Why, then, is there a compelling need for the Federal Government to interfere?  Lets be candid. Although this Congress has seen a host of back-door efforts to restrict women's access to abortions, this legislation represents a direct, and blatant, challenge to Roe versus Wade. Proponents of this measure openly admit that this is a strategic milestone in the road toward making abortion illegal in this country. If this measure passes and is enacted into law it will be a significant victory for the antichoice forces.                       THIS IS A MEDICAL DECISION  Finally and most importantly, the reason politicians should stay out of this is because this is a medical decision, not a political one. It is important to remember that in the heartbreaking cases where medical intervention in pregnancy is warranted--these were wanted pregnancies. The decision to have an abortion for these women and their families was one that they desperately tried to avoid. And the Federal Government has no business making that decision any harder on these families. Take the case of Viki Wilson:  Viki Wilson is a nurse who lives in Fresno, CA, with her husband, Bill, an emergency room physician, and their two children, Jon and Kaitlyn. Viki and Bill very much wanted more children and she became pregnant in August 1993 with a baby girl.  After what seemed to be a normal, healthy pregnancy filled with baby showers, a freshly painted nursery, and family members touching Viki's stomach to feel the baby kick, Viki received the worst imaginable news: her beautiful baby girl had a fatal deformity, known as encephalocoeles--a condition where the brain forms outside the skull and is always, unconditionally, fatal.  Viki and Bill would have done anything on Earth to save their baby girl, whom they named Abigail. But she had no chance of survival.  Viki was warned that, if she continued the pregnancy, she risked rupturing her uterus, or causing a massive infection that would leave her unable to have more children. After consulting with their physicians, Viki and Bill decided that the safest thing to do was to abort the pregnancy.  An abortion at this late stage of pregnancy is not easy, and Viki's doctor recommended a procedure known as intact dilation and evacuation. In layperson's terms, it means attempting to induce cervical dilation artificially and removing the fetus intact. In cases such as Viki's, the deformed head of the fetus could not fit through the cervix, and fluid had to be extracted in order to complete the delivery safely.  This abortion procedure saved Viki Wilson's health and perhaps her life. It is the same procedure that opponents of abortion have called a ``partial birth abortion,'' in order to mislead people into believing that a live and healthy fetus is being disposed of. Nothing could be further from the truth.  After Viki Wilson's story was published, I received a letter from a constituent of mine who had been through a similar tragedy. She wrote:       My husband and I lost our baby on March 10, 1995. Our baby      was diagnosed with a herniated diaphragm . . . preventing its      heart and lungs from growing normally. My husband and I had      to make the most devastating decision of our lives during my      19th week of pregnancy. This baby was our first child, and we      had so much love and excitement for its birth. The doctors      gave us two choices: terminate the pregnancy, or continue the      pregnancy with surgery in utero, understanding that [the      baby] would only live for a few weeks under life support      after birth . . . My health was at risk if I carried to term      and my baby would not live for even one month on this earth.  This woman needed the same procedure that Viki Wilson had, the same procedure that this bill would outlaw.  And a woman named Karen Ham became critically ill with diabetes during her second trimester and had to be flown 450 miles to a clinic in Colorado for an abortion necessary to save her life. When she arrived, she was in shock and about to go into cardiac failure.                         THE NEED FOR HEARINGS  This body is attempting to legislate a complicated medical decision without even so much as an adequate public hearing on the matter. I listened to Senator Smith on the floor some months ago. It was the first time I had seen photos depicted on C-SPAN full screen. With all due respects, I believe that his presentation was one-sided and fully misleading. If this legislation is to go forward, it is essential that the Judiciary Committee hold hearings on the bill, as this bill would create criminal liability for doctors who perform this late-term procedure.  We need to hear from the experts--the doctors and other health professionals, and from the parents who have been through this procedure.  There are many health risks that women can face during pregnancy, risks that could worsen during pregnancy, requiring a late-term abortion: heart disease, cancer, diabetes, just to name a few. These risks cannot be dismissed as we consider legislation that would ban what may be the only medically safe option to terminate a pregnancy.        S. 939 REPRESENTS A DIRECT CHALLENGE TO ROE VERSUS WADE  Every Senator in this Chamber should make no mistake about what this bill is: This bill is a direct challenge to Roe versus Wade.  Roe versus Wade firmly established that, after viability, abortion may be banned as long as an exemption is provided in cases where the woman's life or health is at risk. This provision was explicitly reaffirmed by the Court in Planned Parenthood versus Casey.  This bill is unconstitutional on its face because it allows for no exception in the case where the banned procedure may be necessary to protect a woman's health. Even further, the bill holds the doctor criminally liable unless he or she can prove that the banned procedure was the only one that would have saved a woman's life. The doctor must go to court to prove this. This places an undue burden on access to late-term abortions to save a woman's life under Roe versus Wade.  The Smith bill also ignores the viability line established in Roe and reaffirmed in Casey. The bill would criminalize use of a particular abortion procedure, virtually without exception, even before fetal viability. This again constitutes an undue burden--prohibiting a procedure that for some women would be the safest in light of their medical condition.   The proponents of this bill know quite well the challenges to Roe this legislation presents. That is their intent. The magnitude of this bill is enormous for the long-term preservation of safe and legal abortion in this country. It will have an immediate and direct effect on the lives of women facing tragic and health-threatening circumstances. This bill needs to be considered thoroughly before it is brought to the floor for a vote.  I urge my colleagues to vote for the motion to commit S. 939 to the Senate Judiciary Committee for hearings.  I would like to enter into the Record a letter written to the American Medical Association by a San Francisco physician, David Grimes.
