I recall at the time this report came out--and we all remember the blacked-out pages--the country of Saudi Arabia sent over emissaries to say--and I don't know how serious they were about this--would you release this.  My question to the Senator is: Insofar as the majority of hijackers at the time of September 11 were from Saudi Arabia, and insofar as we know from press accounts--not classified material but press accounts--that a lot of funding of al-Qaida came from Saudi Arabia and may still be coming from Saudi Arabia, don't you think it would be helpful to know if Saudi Arabia is mentioned in this blacked-out part and to what extent, considering the fact that they apparently have turned a blind eye to some of the terrorists who are striking at the United States?
