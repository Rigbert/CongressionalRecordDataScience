 President, I am offering today private relief legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and his wife, Maria del Refugio Plascencia, Mexican nationals living in San Bruno, CA.  I have decided to offer legislation on their behalf because I believe that, without it, this hardworking couple and their four United States citizen children would endure an immense and unfair hardship. Indeed, without this legislation, this family may not remain a family for much longer.  In the seventeen years that the Plascencias have been here, they have worked to adjust their status through the appropriate legal channels, only to have their efforts thwarted by inattentive legal counsel.  Repeatedly, the Plascencia's lawyer refused to return their calls or otherwise communicate with them in any way, thereby leaving them in the dark. He also failed to forward crucial immigration documents, or even notify the Plascencias that he had them. Because of the poor representation they received, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia only became aware that they had been ordered to leave the country fifteen days prior to their deportation. Although the family was stunned and devastated by this discovery, they acted quickly to fire their attorney for gross incompetence, secure competent counsel, and file the appropriate paperwork to delay their deportation to determine if any other legal action could be taken.  For several reasons, it would be tragic for this family to be removed from the United States.  First, since arriving in the United States in 1988, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia have proven themselves to be a responsible and civic-minded couple who share our American values of hard work, dedication to family and devotion to community.  Second, Mr. Plascencia has been gainfully employed at Vince's Shellfish for the past 13 years, where his dedication and willingness to learn have propelled him from part-time work to a managerial position. He now oversees the market's entire packing operation and several employees. The President of Vince's Shellfish, in one of the several dozen letters I have received in support of Mr. Plascencia, referred to him as ``a valuable and respected employee'' who ``handles himself in a very professional manner'' and serves as ``a role model'' to other employees. Others who have written to me praising Mr. Plascencia's job performance have referred to him as ``gifted,'' ``trusted,'' ``honest'' and ``reliable.''  Third, like her husband, Mrs. Plascencia has distinguished herself as a medical assistant at a Kaiser Permanente hospital in the Bay Area. Not satisfied with working as a maid at a local hotel, Mrs. Plascencia went to school, earned her high school equivalency degree, improved her skills and became a medical assistant.  For four years, Mrs. Plascencia was working in Kaiser Permanente's Oncology Department, where she attended to cancer patients. Her colleagues, many of whom have written to me in support of her, commend her ``unending enthusiasm'' and have described her work as ``responsible,'' ``efficient,'' and ``compassionate.'' In fact, Kaiser Permanente's Director of Internal Medicine, Nurse Rose Carino, wrote to say that Mrs. Plascencia is ``an asset to the community and exemplifies the virtues we Americans extol: hardworking, devoted to her family, trustworthy and loyal, [and] involved in her community. She and her family are a solid example of the type of immigrant that America should welcome wholeheartedly.'' Nurse Carino went on to write that Mrs. Plascencia is ``an excellent employee and role model for her colleagues. She works in a very demanding unit, Oncology, and is valued and depended on by the physicians she works with.'' The physicians themselves confirm this. For example, Dr. Laurie Weisberg, the Chief of Oncology at Kaiser Permanente, writes that Mrs. Plascencia ``is truly an asset to our unit and is one of the main reasons that it functions effectively.''  Together, Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia have used their professional successes to realize many of the goals dreamed of by all Americans. They saved up and bought a home. They own a car. They have good health care benefits and they each have begun saving for retirement. They want to send their children to college and give them an even better life.  This private relief bill is important because it would preserve these achievements and ensure that Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia will be able to make substantive contributions to the community in the future. It is important, also, because of the positive impact it will have on the couple's children, each of whom is a United States citizen and each of whom is well on their way to becoming productive members of the Bay Area community.  Christina, 13, is the Plascencia's oldest child, and an honor student with a 3.0 grade-point average at Parkside Intermediate School in San Bruno.  Erika, 9, and Alfredo, Jr., 7, are enrolled at Belle Air Elementary, where they have worked hard at their studies and received praise and good grades from their teachers. In fact, last year, the principal of Erika's school recognized her as the ``Most Artistic'' student in her class. Recently, Erika's teacher, Mrs. Nascon, remarked on a report card, ``Erika is a bright spot in my classroom.''  The Plascencia's youngest child is 2-year-old Daisy.  Removing Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia from the United States would be most tragic for their children. Children who were born in the United States and who through no fault of their own have been thrust into a situation that has the potential to alter their lives dramatically.  It would be especially tragic for the Plascencia's older children--Christina, Erika and Alfredo--to have to leave the United States. They are old enough to understand that they are leaving their schools, their teachers, their friends and their home. They would leave everything that is familiar to them. Their parents would find themselves in Mexico without a job and without a house. The children would have to acclimate to a different culture, language and way of life.  The only other option would be for Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia to leave their children here with relatives. This separation is a choice which no parents should have to make.  Many of the words I have used to describe Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia are not my own. They are the words of the Americans who live and work with the Plascencias day in and day out and who find them to embody the American spirit. I have sponsored this private relief bill, and ask my colleagues to support it, because I believe that this is a spirit that we must nurture wherever we can find it. Forcing the Plascencias to leave the United States would extinguish that spirit.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the private relief bill and the numerous letters of support my office has received from members of the San Bruno community be the printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1041       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Vince's Shellfish Co., Inc.,                                  San Bruno, CA, January 12, 2005.     Sen. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Dianne Feinstein: I am writing on behalf of      Maria and Alfredo Plascencia from San Bruno, California.      Alfredo has worked for me at Vince's Shellfish Co. Inc. for      the past 13 years. Alfredo is well respected here at Vinces.      Alfredo is a very reliable, dependable individual who has      worked his way up and is now a foreman who is in charge of      our packing department. Alfredo is responsible for 10      employees at this time.       On a personal basis, Alfredo is a fine father. He is trying      desperately to keep his family together. It has been a 15-     year struggle for Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia to create a better      life in America for their four U.S. born children. If Mr. and      Mrs. Plascencia were to face deportation it would be      devastating for his four children.       At this time I support the private bill that is to be      presented before the Senate at the end of this month. The      Plascencia family will greatly benefit from its passing.           Sincerely,                                           Christopher N. Svedisc,     President.                                  ____                                                    The Permanente                                          Medical Group, Inc.,                       South San Francisco, CA., January 13, 2005.     Re Alfredo Plascencia Lopez and Maria del Refugio Plascencia     Sen. Dianne Feinstein,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator: We are writing to you in representation of      the Oncology department staff at Kaiser Permanente So. San      Francisco. We are shocked to hear the events regarding Maria      and Alfredo's United States residency status and we are      convinced that it could not be due to any omissions on their      part. We have the pleasure and good fortune of working with      Maria for over four years and she has always distinguished      herself for her intelligence, and good judgment. She is truly      an asset to our unit and is one of the main reasons that it      functions effectively and to the betterment of our patients.      This letter is a plea to ask you to reconsider the      deportation of this young couple. Their four children, who      are all United States citizens, do not need to suffer this      ordeal, which seems to be a horrible nightmare. They deserve      to stay in America, as these are the kind of citizens that we      should welcome with open arms. Maria and Alfredo save and      spend their money wisely. They have been able to save enough      to buy a home for their family in our community. We can't      even imagine their loss, as well as ours, if Maria and      Alfredo are required to leave the United States. They both      love our country and they support it with their heart and      soul.       Maria seems to have an unending energy and enthusiasm      volunteering numerous hours at her church, the community, as      well as working full time in a fast paced medical      environment, caring for her four children and attending      college to continue her education to become a registered      nurse. Maria and Alfredo are raising four exceptional      children who are excelling in school and extracurricular      activities. It would cause an immeasurable hardship on these      children if their parents are not allowed to stay in the      United States. Therefore, we ask you please allow them to      stay so that their children can continue with their education      and their lives. The effect on their children would be      emotionally and mentally severe and it would seem unfair to      all to allow this situation to happen to people who deserve      to be in this country.       We will like for our plea to be heard by the members of the      Senate and for them to consider the acceptance of the private      bill on behalf of this family. Please consider the high      regard that Maria and Alfredo have earned with their fellow      workers when making the determination regarding of their      residency status.

Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing in behalf of the      Plascencia Family. I have known this family for over ten      years as the Principal of Belle Air Elementary School. I have      the utmost respect for the parents and their family values.      The children are wonderful. They are well taken care of and      are well adjusted. I am so worried that if they are separated      from their parents the affect of the separation will cause      reprievable damage to their well being. I have personally      counseled the children during the drama of the possible      deportment of their parents. I saw the deep sadness and worry      that the stress caused. I know that parents wanted a better      life for their children and have worked very hard to      actualize that. To take the parents and or move this family      would be tragic. There are so many undeserving people who      will stay in the United States that should leave and be sent      back to their countries. But this family is not one. They are      a picture of the American dream. They work hard, support      their family, church and community. Their children have grown      to be proud American citizens. The oldest daughter Christy is      an honor student and a cheerleader at Parkside Middle School      and a graduate of Belle Air. Christy's brother and sister,      Alfredo and Erica, are both on our school's student council.      They too, are very bright students.       Please do not let an injustice of deportment happen to this      family. Please assist them and keep them a family unit. We      have so many children hurt and scared already in the world.      Please do not add these children and this family to the      numbers. This family and these children are what help keep      American values and traditions alive. I came from an      immigrant family and have made it my mission to give back to      others by working in education and that is why I am      personally writing this letter because I know what family,      hard work, and love can do to produce productive adults and      citizens.       Please find it in your heart, to help this family.       If you need to speak with me personally feel free to      contact me.            Sincerely,                                                Angela M.

We would like      to make you aware of a few facts and information that may      have possible bearing on Mr. and Mrs. Placencia's situation.       They have both been productive and valued members, of long      standing, of our community and in our church.       Maria and Alfredo have been active members of All Souls      Parish since 1997, Where they are currently serving as      counselor of Mensajeros de Cristo. They have shown high moral      standard through the years.       They are well thought of and respected by the congregation.       Please take this information into consideration when      evaluating their status of Staying in this country.       Should you need any additional information, please do not      hesitate to contact us.

Senator Dianne Feinstein,     San Francisco, CA.       Hon. Senator Feinstein: We are writing to you regarding,      Alfredo and Maria Plascencia, citizens of the City of San      Bruno, who are about to be deported in the very near future.       Mr. and Mrs. Plascencia, in the sixteen years they have      resided in this country and     raised their children, have proven to be hard working and      law-abiding people trying to provide a better place for their      family. While we are certainly aware of the laws of this      country we believe that this is a time when we should do      everything possible to allow legal residency so this family      can stay in this country.       We urge you to afford the Plascencia family whatever      consideration possible.           Sincerely yours,     Larry Franzela,       Mayor.     Jim Ruane,       Vice Mayor.

Sen. Diane Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       The purpose of this letter is to present my observations on      Alfredo Placencia Lopez and Maria Placencia's character and      work ethic. I first came to know them in our Church when they      came to worship on a Sunday. This happened around January      1998.       And so far, the last 7 years both Alfredo and Maria have      been two of our outstanding parishioners at St. Bruno's      Church. They come to Sunday Mass and worship, and have been      involved in many ministries and services here in our Church      at St. Bruno's. Alfredo has been especially a minister of      hospitality, always welcoming people to church and      participation in the life of the community, helping to      provide a spirit of acceptance and concern among our people      and providing bread and refreshments for some gatherings.      Alfredo has also reached out to the homeless for whom we have      a shelter in our Parish and especially providing them with      food. Maria has been especially involved as a teacher,      faithfully giving to our children the fundamentals of our      Faith, of the Gospel and of a Christian moral life. She has      founded a Children's Choir and leads them with our Special      Music for Sunday worship. They have four children all of whom      have been baptized at St. Bruno's Church and come to our      School of Religion and our Church.       Alfredo and Maria have been most generous with their time,      their talents and their money, sharing all these with the      members of our Church Community. They have also frequently      donated food to the Church and to the Pastor. I have found      them to be really good Christian people, most generous,      considerate, kind, honest and reliable. If they would have to      leave the United States, it will be most difficult for them      and for their children who have been growing in a Christian      environment and are doing so well; it would be a tremendous      loss. We too here in our Church would find it difficult      without them. For they are a great asset to this country and      to our Church and to many people.       We appreciate whatever you can do for them to help them get      their legal papers of residence in the United States.       Thank you very much.           Sincerely yours,                                                       Rene Gomez,     Pastor of St. Bruno's Church.                                  ____                                                San Bruno, CA,                                                 January 13, 2005.     Re Alfredo Placencia Lopez and/or Maria Del Refugio          Placencia.       To Whom It May Concern: My name is Elisa Alvarez. Alfredo      and Maria Placencia and Family are my neighbors and friends,      I have known them since 1999. They live on 3rd Ave. and I      live on 4th. Since I have known them I saw that they are a      very close and spiritual family. I enjoyed their company      because they have been a great example of how a close family      they are and how spiritual they are. They are great parents      and they love and are very close with the rest of their      family. They always go every where together as a family, you      never see them without each other. They always get together      with the rest of their relatives they are very close family.      They invited me one night to a prayer group and even offered      to pick me up and take me and bring me home when I was going      through some hard times. This experience was so moving, and      it help me and my whole life changed from that day on. I have      became very spiritual thanks to the Alfredo and Maria. I met      them at St. Bruno's Church. They always do voluntary work at      the church they both do so much for our parish and are always      willing to help anyone who needs it.       If Alfredo and Maria are separated from their children and      family it will be very hard for their children to be with out      their parents or I know if they all go to Mexico it will be      very hard for this family to survive there. I hope you can      help them by not separating this family, they are hard      workers and I'm sure they would never be a burden for this      country. This is a very nice young family, you don't see      families like this one these days. I hope everything can be      done so Alfredo and Maria can get their permanent residency      and their lives can get back to normal and . they don't have      to suffer from this bad roller coaster.       Thank you for your attention to this letter.           Sincerely,     Elisa Alvarez.                          ____________________
