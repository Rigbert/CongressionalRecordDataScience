Speaker, this motion to recommit was dropped on us just a few minutes ago, and we have had a very hasty analysis. And it really is the Trojan horse. If this Trojan horse is allowed to come into the bill by amendment, there are going to be three things that will happen.  First of all, it would require the States, every State that has gambling in any form, to go to the Federal Attorney General to regulate gambling within the State's own borders. And this really is a poison bill, because it would mean that the States' support of this bill would disappear. Forty-nine out of the 50 State attorneys general support this bill, and they are gone if this motion to recommit is passed.  The gentleman from Michigan says that we ought to protect kids. We do protect kids in this bill. And the language that is contained in his motion to recommit is unnecessary because section 1084(c) of the bill does provide age and location requirements. That is ample protection, and it is enforceable protection.  Finally, the motion to recommit is confusing because it requires residency requirements. Now, the bill has location requirements on where the Internet site is. It does not get to the residency requirements of the people who are using the Internet. So there is an entirely different definition, an entirely different thing that will be almost impossible to verify.  I now yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).
