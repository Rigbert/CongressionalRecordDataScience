I am really listening carefully to what Congressman Tonko and Congressman Higgins have been saying this evening and thinking about what's going on in Ohio, the northern band of Ohio, from Toledo through Cleveland, and the importance of manufacturing and thinking about how hard our businesses and our workers have to compete in a very unlevel global playing field. And I've seen this directly in the automotive industry, where to this day one of the reasons that our automotive industry had difficulty and why it required the Nation to not let it fail and to pay back what was borrowed was because we are in competition with state-managed economies.  For example, I'm a member of the China Commission. And several economists testified before our committee a few years ago that what you really have in operation is market Leninism. I said, Describe to me what you're seeing. Because I've had companies in my district that have business deals in China that have lost billions of dollars. They have paid for goods that have never been received. Now, in a transparent legal system like our own, that could never happen. You have a court system. You have a way of getting your money back. But when you're dealing with a state-managed economy under a market Leninist approach, you have powerful political people pulling the strings that isn't truly a free market.  And so whether you have a closed market in Japan that's still largely closed to automotive products or you have a state-managed economy as in China, then you ask our automotive producers or any company to compete in that kind of environment, you end up harming our domestic production. And one of the reasons we are so elated that our automotive industry is recovering, you see it all over our region, the power of industry to lift people into the middle class and beyond. You can see it everywhere: in suppliers, in restaurants, in theaters, and places where people are going. Even grocery stores, frankly, where people are able to buy more because of the recovery of this powerful, powerful industry.  And I just want to end with one image, which is really hard to capture in words, but one of our companies in Cleveland has the only 50,000-ton press in the United States of America--Alcoa. It is seven stories in magnitude. I feel very privileged as a Representative to have been invited into the company to see this literally mammoth, magnificent machine be able to take parts and form them for industry as well as our defense systems. And it's seven stories high. Three layers on three stories at the bottom just dealing with the hydraulics.  The engineering and the brain power it takes to manufacture high-end goods is incredible. We are so proud of that company and other companies that are able to make it in America, despite all of the unfair global playing fields on which they are asked to play. And we see the components going into the automotive industry, into our defense systems. And we thank the corporate leadership and the workers, those who work very, very hard jobs that help us build the strongest country in the world.  So I just had to say that tonight because you get as excited as I do about actually making things and seeing this genius that takes ideas and engineers them into products that affect all of us and allows America to be the strongest Republic in the world. So I wanted to place that on the record. And thank you for giving me the time to do it.                              {time}  2100
