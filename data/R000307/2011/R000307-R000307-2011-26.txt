President, I would like to bring to the attention of my colleagues a milestone that has been reached by an important cooperative association responsible for the marketing and distribution of dairy products from 450 California family-owned dairies.  Challenge opened for business under the name of Challenge Cream & Butter Association 100 years ago with four employees and a wagon. That first day, Challenge sold 12 pounds of butter. Today, Challenge Butter is the largest butter brand in the West, and Challenge Dairy is the leading dairy foodservice provider in California, with eight distribution centers spanning the State in Lodi, San Leandro, Monterey, Fresno, Santa Maria, Ventura, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Challenge directly employs over 175 hard-working California citizens and has aided thousands of California dairy farmers in their success over the years. Today, more than 450 dairies are part of Challenge's cooperative, putting tens of millions of dollars into California's economy annually.  Challenge's success is made up of dedicated California dairy farmers and employees who have ensured the quality of all products produced from each of its creameries. Early on, dairymen realized marketing was and remains to be key in successfully spreading the word about the quality of their products, which was why Challenge was conceived.  The benefits of farmer cooperation were so effective that the status of every single dairyman was materially improved, just from their existence. A leader in quality improvement, Challenge established the standards all other dairy organizations followed. Thus, Challenge has figuratively held a protective umbrella over farm endeavors, for the good of the farmers and the Nation, for more than a century.  By refusing to sell any item that didn't meet the highest standards, Challenge built a reputation for quality. That reputation has grown as Challenge led the way in the dairy industry with product and manufacturing innovations such as the aluminum butter churn, the first successful metal butter churn in the world.  Now a wholly owned subsidiary of California Dairies, Inc. CDI, California's largest dairy provider and the second largest in the country, Challenge has grown to represent more than 450 dairy farmers and markets nearly half of CDI's butter supply. CDI has six manufacturing facilities that are located throughout the central valley and directly employs over 740 people.  Challenge has operated through two World Wars and the Great Depression in addition to a number of other obstacles. Through it all, the company adapted and persevered to continue fulfilling the people's need for quality dairy products and support the dairy farmers behind producing products. We believe Challenge embodies the determination and the spirit of the people of California.                          ____________________
