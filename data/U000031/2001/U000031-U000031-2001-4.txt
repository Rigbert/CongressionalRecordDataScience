Speaker, I am very pleased that you have called up for our consideration this evening H.R. 717, the Muscular Dystrophy Community Assistance, Research, and Education Amendments of 2001. I am an original cosponsor of this legislation designed to substantially strengthen support at the national Institutes of Health for research on Duchenne and several other types of muscular dystrophy, coordinate that research across federal agencies, and translate discoveries in the lab into improved patient care.  I have seen the human face of Duchenne muscular dystrophy and the toll that it takes on children and families. Some time ago, I had the opportunity to visit with Don and Joyce Carpenter of Kalamazoo, Michigan, and their courageous son Ben, who suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy. From them I learned that Duchenne muscular dystrophy is the most common and the most catastrophic form of genetic childhood disease. Sadly, it generally kills its victims in their late teens or early 20s.  For decades, the only drug treatment known to somewhat alter the course of the disease is the use of steroids--whose serious side effects are well known. We've simply got to do better. We have to find a way to prevent this devastating disorder in the first place--perhaps through the promise of gene therapy. And until we learn how to prevent it, we've got to learn how to treat it more effectively.  This legislation has strong bipartisan support. It has 310 cosponsors and was unanimously approved by both by the Health Subcommittee and the full Energy and Commerce Committee.  I call on my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. What we are doing here this evening is giving hope to Don and Joyce and Ben Carpenter and many others who suffer from Duchenne and other devastating forms of muscular dystrophy in this nation and across the world. We can work miracles when we really try.
