How about that, Mr. Speaker?  In terms of the deficit, I know your side is very concerned about the deficit. My side is very concerned about the deficit, and I certainly am very concerned about the deficit, as the gentleman knows. I have worked in a lot of ways to try to bring this down.  One of my propositions is that we need to pay for things. Whether we spend money or reduce revenues, we need to offset that.  Does the gentleman know whether there is any intention to offset that so we do not exacerbate, make the deficit worse?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I know you are concerned with the deficit. I am very concerned, especially with this administration adding more debt than all the other Presidents combined. That is why we are trying to spur the economy.  I firmly believe that if government takes less, that is more in the hands ofthe public, and they are able to spend, and more revenue will come in, and history has shown that.  So I firmly believe that our actions taking place will actually bring greater revenue, greater job creation, and help lower the deficit.
