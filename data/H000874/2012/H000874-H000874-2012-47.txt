 I know the gentleman indicated that you didn't include one. I think you did include the farm bill. Could you tell me what you think of the status of the farm bill? Again, we have an issue where the farm bill passed 64-35 in the Senate; 16 Republicans voted for it. And very frankly, the farm bill in this House passed out of your committee 35-11 on a bipartisan vote. That's not been brought to the floor.  Could the gentleman tell me what he thinks is going to happen to the farm bill?
