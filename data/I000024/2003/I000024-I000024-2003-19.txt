President, I would like to congratulate one of Oklahoma's finest soldiers, LTC Michael E. Hogan, who is retiring after a distinguished career of over 20 years of exceptionally meritorious conduct in the United States Army. Lieutenant Colonel Hogan was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant, Field Artillery, after graduating from the United States Military Academy. His first assignment was as a Fire Support Team Chief, HHB, 2d Battalion, 6th Infantry Division, Fort Ord, CA. Demonstrating keen expertise and artillery skills, he moved through various positions in the unit, including Firing Battery Fire Direction Officer, Executive Officer, and Battalion Fire Direction Officer. After developing and mastering the required skills as an Artilleryman through an assignment in Camp Casey, Korea, Lieutenant Colonel Hogan was moved to Fort Sill, OK, where he assumed a role on the faculty of the Field Artillery School.  In 1989, Lieutenant Colonel Hogan served as the Battery Commander for Bravo Battery, 2d Battalion, with 105mm Howitzers, for almost 2 years. Because of his expertise in artillery systems, he was moved to a position as a test officer with the U.S. Army Operational Test and Evaluation Center. After further refining his skills in artillery systems while performing as a test team chief, Lieutenant Colonel Hogan was moved to a position as an executive officer with the 6th FA Battalion, Fort Sill, OK. In 1997, while in the position on the Corps Artillery Staff, Lieutenant Colonel Hogan was deployed to Haiti where he served 6 months as the Joint Task Force Chief of Staff. Upon his return to Fort Sill, he was installed as the executive officer for the 212th Field Artillery Brigade. After serving in this position for approximately 1 year, Lieutenant Colonel Hogan was sent to the Pentagon as a representative of the regimental staff of the Field Artillery Center, with duty in the Office of the Chief of Legislative Liaison.  Lieutenant Colonel Hogan directly applied special talents and expertise as a Hardware Congressional Liaison Officer in the Office of the Secretary of the Army, Legislative Liaison Programs Division from March 2000 through February 2004. Lieutenant Colonel Hogan maintained a constant liaison with professional staff members of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees on critical issues relating to army procurement programs such as the Crusader Field Artillery System, Stryker, and the Army's top priority, the Future Combat System.  Throughout these assignments, Lieutenant Colonel Hogan has provided outstanding leadership, advice, and sound professional judgment on significant issues that affected both the Army and Congress. His actions and counsel were invaluable to Army leaders and Members of Congress as they considered the impact of important issues. Lieutenant Colonel Hogan's dedication to accomplishing the Army's legislative liaison mission has been extraordinary. He is truly an outstanding officer who displays superb professional leadership skills and is totally dedicated to mission accomplishment in the highest traditions of military service. I am proud to call him a constituent, and wish him well in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
