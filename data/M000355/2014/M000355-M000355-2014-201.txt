 President, this past Saturday, April 5, I was extremely pleased and honored to be a part of the awarding of the Purple Heart Medal to a brave soldier Kentucky is proud to call one of its own. SGT Jesse T. Wethington of Liberty, KY, received his Purple Heart for wounds suffered while serving our country in Iraq. I want to share the honor and majesty of this event with my colleagues and so therefore ask unanimous consent that the full text of my remarks at the ceremony to award SGT Jesse T. Wethington his Purple Heart, as well as the text of the proclamation for the Purple Heart be printed in the Record following my remarks.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Senator McConnell's Remarks at Awarding of Purple Heart to Sergeant                    Jesse T. Wethington, April 5, 2014       Thank you for that kind introduction. Thank you, General      Dolan, for the invocation. It is my great honor to be here      for the presentation of the Purple Heart Medal to Sergeant      Jesse T. Wethington of Liberty, Kentucky, for wounds received      in action while in service to our country in Iraq. It is an      honor that is long overdue.       Because we are here to recognize the service of a brave      soldier, it is fitting to be at VFW Post 1170. I want to      thank our hosts, led by VFW Post Commander Dwight Riggle. I      also want to thank VFW State Commander Joe Schnitterbaum and      VFW leaders Brian Duffy and Carl Kaelin for all they have      done in support of America's veterans.       It's a pleasure to have Chris Smrt and the Kentucky chapter      of the Military Order of the Purple Heart here today to      welcome Sergeant Wethington into their ranks. Chris and the      Military Order of the Purple Heart, like the VFW, are strong      advocates for our veterans.       And on this day when we're honoring a Kentucky Guardsman,      it's wonderful to see so many Kentucky Guard soldiers and      airmen here today, including our outstanding Adjutant      General, Ed Tonini.       Finally, I'd like to welcome the folks who came here from      Jesse's hometown of Liberty, including Jesse's wife, Ashley;      his daughter, Hannah; his mother, Gayle; Jesse's brother,      Chris, and Chris's wife, Dorothy; Jesse's mother-in-law, Mrs.      Hope Metz; and Liberty VFW Post Commander and former State      VFW Commander Claude Wyatt. Welcome to VFW Post 1170.       The original Purple Heart, also known as the Badge of      Military Merit, was established by George Washington himself,      and as such, the Purple Heart is the oldest existing military      award that is still given to servicemembers.       I think the commander of the Continental Army and our first      president can speak better than I to the courage and bravery      which this award represents. In July of 1776, at the outbreak      of the War for Independence, General Washington wrote in his      own hand the weight of the task that had befallen him and his      army. He said:       ``The fate of unborn millions will now depend, under God,      on the courage and conduct of this Army . . . we have      therefore to resolve to conquer or die. . . . Let us      therefore rely upon the goodness of the cause, and the aid of      the Supreme Being, in whose hands victory is, to animate and      encourage us to great and noble actions. The eyes of all our      countrymen are now upon us.''       That same patriotism--that same Spirit of '76--which was      embodied by the leader of the Revolutionary Army lives on      today in those in uniform such as Jesse. Perhaps that is      inevitable in Jesse's case, given that he hails from a place      called Liberty, a town founded by Revolutionary War veterans      in 1806.       Although warfare has changed dramatically since the      Revolutionary Era, the valor of our warfighters, such as      Jesse, remains the same. That valor would have been instantly      recognizable to George Washington.       It is the same valor that propelled Americans to victory      against the mighty British Empire. The same valor that      propelled Americans to die for other men's freedoms in the      Civil War. The same valor we remember in the Greatest      Generation, men and women who sacrificed halfway around the      globe to save democracy. The same valor displayed in Cold War      conflicts in Korea and Vietnam.       Sergeant Wethington's service is simply the latest chapter      in a long and unbroken line of heroism and sacrifice, a line      that is as old as our country.       The story of Jesse Wethington, the soldier from Liberty, is      like that of those who served in the Revolutionary War--it is      the story of a volunteer. Jesse could have chosen any number      of paths, paths that would not have involved protecting ``the      fate of unborn millions,'' paths that would not have placed      him in imminent danger.       Instead, Jesse volunteered to serve in the Kentucky Army      National Guard. He volunteered to go on the road in a Humvee      that would be targeted by the enemy in Iraq. He volunteered      to sit in the gunner's turret. And even after his injury in      combat, Jesse volunteered again to sit right back in that      gunner's turret through the end of his tour of duty.       Jesse was mobilized with Battery B, First Battalion, 623rd      Field Artillery of the Kentucky Army National Guard in late      2004, and he deployed to Iraq in January 2005. He served as a      communications specialist and worked in the tactical      operations center at the forward operating base.       In his communications role, Jesse had a view of his entire      unit's activities. He saw the gun trucks and Humvees that      deployed every day, and how often they were targeted by the      enemy's IEDs. He saw good men, friends of his, injured. He      saw the deaths of three soldiers in his unit, Kentuckians      all.       Knowing these things, knowing all the risks involved, Jesse      still volunteered. And when a spot opened up in a gun truck,      Jesse stepped forward and said, ``Send me.'' Jesse      volunteered yet again to serve as a gunner. He encountered      several IEDs on the road, but always came away uninjured.      Until the fateful day of September 30, 2005.       On that day, Jesse's Humvee was moving slowly through      congested traffic as part of a convoy. It stopped, and Jesse      stood up in the gunner's hatch to direct traffic. Suddenly,      an IED struck the right side of the truck with devastating      force. The impact from the blast was so great it sent      shrapnel hurdling through the back window, just missing      Jesse's right leg and embedding itself into a storage bin      within the Humvee.       Jesse suffered injury to his throat and the back of his      head. After the explosion, he could not hear, and his vision      and thoughts were blurred. Yet, amazingly, he continued his      mission. Upon returning to the base, Jesse received medical      care, and after a few days of light duty returned to the      gunner's turret. He finished out his tour of duty through the      end of the year and returned from Iraq in January 2006.       Unfortunately, Jesse's departure from the battlefield      didn't end his struggles. He suffered traumatic brain injury,      hearing loss, and post-traumatic stress disorder, and he is      continually confronted by the effects of his injuries.       Through all these difficulties, I know Jesse's greatest      source of strength and support is his family, especially,      Ashley and Hannah.       Coincidentally, the very same day Jesse found out he would      be receiving this Purple Heart, he and Ashley also discovered      they would be having a baby boy. It is entirely fitting that      news of both events arrived on the same day, given Jesse's      valor in defending the ``fate of unborn millions.''       Before the presentation of the Purple Heart Medal, I want      to note that there is another hero in this story. It's      Jesse's friend and fellow soldier, retired Staff Sergeant      Glen Phillips, who we heard from earlier this morning.       It was Staff Sergeant Phillips who gathered the facts in      order for Jesse to receive his Purple Heart today. Glen, who      is also from Liberty, has helped look out for Jesse and many      other veterans over the years.       When Jesse told Glen he didn't think anyone would care that      he had yet to receive his Purple Heart, this is what Glen had      to say: ``Jesse, I care, the VA cares, the U.S. Army cares,      and people you don't even know care across this great land.''       I couldn't agree more. I think the witnesses here today for      this solemn occasion are proof positive that Kentucky does      indeed care and cares deeply about you, Jesse, and your      bravery in uniform. And we are grateful for all you have done      and continue to do to make us proud.       And I believe that many people who are not present today--     including, one day, your son--will see how you served in Iraq      with dignity and honor, will see that you continue to carry      yourself with dignity and honor here at home, and will see      the Purple Heart proclamation of your heroism. And they too      will be moved by your service and your sacrifice.       The presentation of this Purple Heart Medal is just a small      recognition of the wealth of respect you deserve for your      service to our country. Your service in protecting all of us.      And your service to the values that make America the greatest      nation on earth--values expressed by General Washington and      the men who founded a place called Liberty more than two      centuries ago.       Now, the solemn moment we're gathered here today for has      arrived. Sergeant Jesse T. Wethington, Ashley, and Hannah--     please join me for the reading of the proclamation and the      presentation of the Purple Heart Medal.
