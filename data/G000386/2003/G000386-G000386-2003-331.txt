 1, the prescription drug benefit bill. We currently have approximately 33 amendments pending to the bill and several Senators have expressed interest in offering additional amendments during tomorrow's session. Under the order there will be two stacked votes beginning at 11 a.m. in relation to two of these amendments. In addition, there will be a vote in relation to the Dodd amendment following the policy luncheon recess. Therefore, I inform my colleagues that rollcall votes are expected to occur throughout the day tomorrow.  For the remainder of the week, the Senate continues consideration of the prescription drug benefits bill. The leader has stated on several occasions that the Senate will complete action on this historic legislation prior to adjourning for the July 4th recess. Therefore, Members should expect rollcall votes throughout the days and into the evenings throughout this entire week. Senators are asked to make the necessary scheduling arrangements.                          ____________________
