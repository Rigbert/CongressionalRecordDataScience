 President, I admire the Senator but she is fundamentally wrong on the law. But I do not want to debate that.  Let me just say this. If the Senators are saying that they, in fact, are not going to move to vote on this right away, then there is not a problem. I am willing to yield the floor and go ahead and see if we can negotiate this.  But if we are going to vote, if I yield the floor and we are about to vote on this issue, then I am going to speak on the issue. I do not want to speak on the issue. I would rather try to resolve it.  Would the Senator from Oklahoma or the Senator from Texas be kind enough to tell the Senator from Delaware what the plan is, relative to moving on this amendment as is, in terms of the timeframe?
