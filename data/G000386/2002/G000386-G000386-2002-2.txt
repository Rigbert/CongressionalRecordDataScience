 President, I concur with that assessment. We know that there is a growing demand for ombudsman services and too few ombudsmen and volunteers to regularly visit all of the nursing homes and assisted living facilities. And we know that training and resources care essential. The Center provides individualized support to State and local ombudsmen on specific, complicated long-term care questions and provides training at state and regional conferences. The need to expand these supportive services is growing rapidly.
