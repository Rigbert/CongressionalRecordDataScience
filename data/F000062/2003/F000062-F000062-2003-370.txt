 President, on behalf of Senator Boxer and myself, I rise today to introduce the Calfed Bay-Delta Authorization Act. This bill, an $880 million authorization, is a 33 percent match for state and local dollars over the next 4 years to address California's water needs through a balanced program.  Last year's bill passed the Energy and Natural Resources Committee by a vote of 18-5, and since that time I have worked with Republicans, most notably Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, to come up with an even stronger bill.  The result: the legislation we introduced today is greatly improved from last year's bill--it is smaller, the authorizations are more specific, and it does a better job of ensuring that the CALFED program be implemented in a balanced manner. Let me describe how the bill is improved:  First, many Senators from other States were afraid CALFED was going to use up the Bureau of Reclamation's entire budget. To meet these concerns, we have cut the authorization level, ultimately to $880 million over four years. We also limited the Federal cost-share to one-third.  Second, some Republican Senators were afraid that environmental projects not needing authorization would sail smoothly ahead, while storage projects lacking Congressional approval would languish. To meet this concern, we required balanced implementation. The Secretary of the Interior must certify annually that the CALFED program is progressing in a balanced manner toward achieving all of its different components.  Third, other Republican Senators were concerned that they had no good handle on the Federal funding of the many different agencies involved in CALFED. We meet this concern by requiring the Office of Management and Budget, OMB, to prepare a cross-cut budget showing the Federal funding of each of the different agencies. We also prepared a specific list of the projects to be funded and how much each one would receive.  In my view, these changes make the bill stronger and more likely to pass both the Senate and the House. Just as importantly, the bill continues to provide the funding necessary to implement the key elements of the CALFED program. In fact, the pieces of the legislation work together to solve our water needs:  One need is water storage. I don't believe we can meet all of our future water needs without increased water storage that is environmentally benign, that if off stream and that provides flexibility in the system for us to increase water supply, improve water quality, and enhance ecosystem restoration.  We must be able to take water in wet years and store it for use in dry years. The bill provides $102 million for planning and feasibility studies for water storage projects--and an additional $77 million for conveyance.  Next is ecological restoration. This means improving fish passages, restoring streams, rivers and habitats and improving water quality. The bill provides $100 million for ecological restoration.  The bill authorizes $153 million for water conservation and recycling, including $84 million for desalination and water recycling projects, leveraging substantial additional water supplies for California with relatively little Federal investment.  The bill would also improve water quality for drinking through investment in treatment technology demonstration projects and water quality improvements in the San Francisco Bay Delta, the San Joaquin Valley, and other parts of the State.  I would also like to emphasize that the bill includes a grants program for local and regional communities throughout California, including the northern part of the State. The bill authorizes up to $95 million for local California communities to develop plans and projects to improve their water situation. This State-wide grants program is an example of how the bill will benefit all Californians. The bill also includes $50 million for watershed planning and assistance.  The bill also includes other important provisions on levee stability, with $70 million, ensuring CALFED has strong supporting science, with $50 million, and $25 million for program management, oversight, and coordination. There is also $75 million for the environmental water account, which purchases available water for environmental and other purposes.  The bill also includes balance and cross-cut budget reporting requirements.  Through the CALFED process, we have discovered that, as Californians, we have many common water interests. For example, if we both conserve water and build new environmentally responsible off-stream storage, then we havefound two ways to increase the supply of water for everyone's use. And if we make intelligent investments in ecological restoration, we can continue to use water for growing our economy while benefitting our environment at the same time.  CALFED emerged after years of negotiations between Californians of different backgrounds who care about water. This bill proposes specific projects for each of CALFED's basic parts--and it appropriately defines the Federal role so that other states know that California is taking full responsibility for its own situation.  It is my strong belief that the Western energy crisis is a forerunner to what California will soon experience with water. Just consider the following: California has a population of over 35 million people, which is expected to grow to 50 million in twenty years, yet our water system infrastructure was built when the State had only 16 million people.  California is the sixth largest economy in the world. It is the number one agricultural producing State in the Nation. It is the leading producer of agriculture products, such as dairy, wine, grapes, strawberries, almonds, lettuce and tomatoes--the list goes on and on.  California's trade, manufacturing, and service sectors are substantial contributors to the American economy. Clearly, these sectors would be put at risk if there is not an adequate supply of water.  California has more endangered species than any State except Hawaii, as well as the largest population.  To make matters worse, a recent study by the Scripps Institute of Oceanography predicts that global warming could reduce the West's water suppy by an much as 30 percent by 2050.  Clearly, California's water needs are tremendous; meanwhile, the last major infrastructure improvement in the state occurred in the 1970s. We need to prepare for the future and we need to do so in an environmentally sensitive way. If there is one lesson to learn from California's damaging energy crisis, it is that time to address a crisis is not while it is happening, but beforehand.  California is struggling to build more power plants, while also doing everything possible to reduce demand through increased efficiency and conservation. But because this started so late, we have encountered some serious problems in the past two years, which is why it is even more important that we fix our water problem before it, too, reaches a crisis stage.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1097       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
