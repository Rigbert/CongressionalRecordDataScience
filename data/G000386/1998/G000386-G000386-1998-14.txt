 President, the issue of private contracting in the Medicare program is very important to my constituents in Iowa. I have received hundreds of letters asking Congress to repeal the provisions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 requiring physicians who enter into a private contract with beneficiaries to opt out of the Medicare program for two years. Seniors in my state believe it is not the role of the federal government to interfere with relationship with their physician. They want to have as many choices and options as possible. I want to make sure their freedom is protected. That is why I want to thank the majority leader, Senator Lott, and the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Senator Roth, for recognizing the importance of this issue to our nation's seniors and for agreeing to address this problem next Congress. I want to offer my support to help with these efforts as a cosponsor of Senator Kyl's legislation and as the Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging and senior member of the Senate Finance Committee.
