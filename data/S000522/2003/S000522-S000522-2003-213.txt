Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of this legislation, H.R. 1298, a truly historic piece of legislation authored by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos). The compassion, tenacity and vision of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) has always been inspirational to so many of us, but on this piece of legislation Chairman Hyde's leadership was extraordinary. In astoniship speed, Mr. Hyde has now shepherded through the House and Senate a bill that will soon be signed by President Bush that is absolutely landmark in that it will help save the lives of millions and mitigate suffering in the lives of many more. Many particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, who are suffering from this disease, will be aided by this bill.  The number of deaths due to the AIDS epidemic is horrifying. It is estimated that 25 million people have died from AIDS thus far, and another 30 million are infected, and approximately 8,500 people die every day. Thankfully, we are acting swiftly; and the sooner this legislation and the appropriations that will follow are passed, we can mitigate some of this disaster. Because if we do not, there will be as many as 80 million deaths by 2010, and 40 million AIDS orphans can be expected.  Mr. Speaker, statistics about specific countries and age groups are also staggering. In Botswana, for example, nearly 40 percent of the adult population is infected. In Africa, there are 3 million children under the age of 15 living with HIV-AIDS.  Mr. Speaker, today in sub-Saharan Africa it is estimated that only 50,000 out of 4 million people in need of drug treatment are receiving it. This legislation puts us on track to get that very important drug treatment to these individuals.  This is an outstanding piece of legislation. Again, on behalf of all of us, we thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde) for his tremendous leadership, courage and compassion.
