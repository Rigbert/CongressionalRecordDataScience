Speaker, I associate myself with the remarks of the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson) and to say it is important to remind ourselves why Medicare was first set up. The gentleman talked about actuarial soundness.  We have Medicare because the private market will not serve this segment of American society. That is why Lyndon Johnson worked so hard after 50 years of Democratic effort to enact Medicare in this Congress. To say to seniors you can go out in a private HMO Medicare, we will call it Medicare but it is really not Medicare because it is not guaranteed, all of the HMOs dealing with Medicare in my region have collapsed.  They are not going to be there. It is just like physicians trying to take assignment. How many physicians do not take assignment even today? Do we think that without Medicare we are going to be able to serve this population? We have to have the strength of group buying and of the Medicare program nationally for this drug benefit or, indeed, for all seniors across this country to be helped.  I want to thank these fine Members of Congress, but Americans first, who are here tonight, to be voices for those who expect us to do the job for 40 million people who cannot be in this Chamber tonight; and I am proud to be here a few minutes before midnight with the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone), the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Larson), and the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Brown), who understand the Johnson-Roosevelt legacy and refused to cower before this radical right wing which has taken control of this Chamber.
