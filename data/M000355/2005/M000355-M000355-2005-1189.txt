 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Louis Edward Fister, a Kentuckian who was committed not only to his family and friends, but to his country and his religion as well. Known to many simply as ``Spanky,'' Mr. Fister was a permanent deacon in the Roman Catholic Church, a calling he served for 20 years. He was also an influential realtor and sales representative in the Lexington area. Mr. Fister passed away April 30, 2005, at the age of 66.  Spanky got his nickname as a child because he reminded people of Spanky from ``The Little Rascals.'' Perhaps the name stuck because Spanky made it his goal to create ``gangs of people,'' especially during his ministerial work. One of Spanky's greatest joys was serving as a chaplain for Eastern State Hospital where he ministered to the patients and offered prayer services. He also witnessed marriage vows, baptisms, and assisted with funerals in Lexington and the surrounding area as a deacon at St. Paul Catholic Church in Lexington.  Born in Jackson, TN, on January 3, 1939, Mr. Fister moved to Kentucky when he was about 4 years old and lived the rest of his life in the Commonwealth. He graduated from Lexington Catholic High School in 1956. Following graduation, he joined the U.S. Army and served until 1958. He then studied business at the University of Kentucky and later attended Thomas More College in preparation for the diaconate. He earned a BA degree in organizational management from Midway College, graduating with Summa Cum Laude honors in 1998.  Mr. Fister was a member of the Lexington Board of Realtors and worked for Smith Realty Group before his passing. He was also an independent sales representative for Unishippers. A civic-oriented individual, Mr. Fister was president of the Jaycees and had been active in the Knights of Columbus.  Mr. Fister is survived by his wife of 45 years, Nancy Jo Hostetter, and his five children, all of Lexington; his four siblings; eight grandchildren; and two sisters-in-law.  Today I ask my colleagues to join me in expressing our sympathy to the family and friends of the late Louis Edward ``Spanky'' Fister. He will be missed.                          ____________________[Pages S6220-S6221]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]               TRIBUTE TO LOUIS EDWARD ``SPANKY'' FISTER  Mr. McCONNELL.
