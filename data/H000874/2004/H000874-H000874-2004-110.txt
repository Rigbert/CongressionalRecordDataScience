Speaker, I yield to my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), the majority leader, for the purposes of informing us of next week's schedule.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished whip, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Monday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of these measures will be sent to Members' offices by the end of the week. Any votes on these measures will be rolled until after 6:30 p.m.  On Tuesday and the balance of the week, we expect to consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules. We also plan to consider several bills under a rule: the fiscal year 2005 District of Columbia appropriations bill; H.R. 4837, the fiscal year 2005 Military Construction appropriations bill; H.R. 4842, the U.S.-Morocco Free Trade Agreement; H.R. 3574, the Stock Option Accounting Reform Act; and H.R. 3313, the Marriage Protection Act.  Finally, I would like to note that we are expecting a very busy week heading into the August recess. Members should expect to work some late nights and possibly into Friday evening as we resolve these important pieces of legislation.  I thank the gentleman for yielding, and will be happy to answer any questions he may have.
