 President, on a different matter, as the Senate continues debating President Obama's deal with Iran today, I think it is appropriate to consider a quote from the President himself. Here is what he said:       I believe Congress owes the American people a final up-or-     down vote. We need courage. You know, in the end, this debate      is about far more than politics.  When it comes to the Iran deal, you would have to say the President is right. After all, do Senators think it is right for the world's leading sponsor of terror to be able to maintain an American-recognized nuclear program? Do Senators think it is right that this deal would effectively subsidize Hezbollah, Hamas, and Bashar al-Assad by channeling literally billions of dollars to their benefactors in Tehran? Do Senators approve of a deal that would leave Iran with an enrichment capability just as the Iranian leadership is again calling for Israel's destruction and praying for ours as well? It is hard to see how Senators could agree with these things.  Many Democratic colleagues, including the top Democrats on the Foreign Affairs Committees in both Houses of Congress who are among the most familiar with the President's deal with Iran, have already come out in opposition. A strong bipartisan majority of the House of Representatives voted to reject the deal. A strong bipartisan majority of the Senate would vote to reject it as well, if only Democratic Senators would stop blocking the American people from even having a final vote on one of the most consequential foreign policy issues of our time.  Democratic Senators will have a chance to vote on behalf of their constituents later today. Perhaps they will consider the President's words I quoted earlier. It is from a 2010 speech about ObamaCare. If the President was so insistent on ``courage'' and a ``final up-or-down vote'' back then on ObamaCare, how can he justify blocking a vote now on an issue of such immense magnitude as the Iran deal? It is part of a larger retreat to campaigning instead of engaging on this important issue, ad hominem attacks instead of serious debate, campaign one-liners instead of intellectual arguments, and simply ignoring reality when it becomes inconvenient. That is why you see the President claiming ``strong support of lawmakers and citizens'' for his Iran deal.  Well, here is what the Washington Post's Fact Checker had to say about that:       Any way you slice it, it is difficult to support the claim      that there is ``strong support'' for the Iran deal among      lawmakers and citizens. This is clearly a case of winning      ugly, in the face of minority support among lawmakers and      increasing opposition among American citizens.       The White House certainly did better than many analysts      expected, since enough Democrats supported the agreement to      prevent a final Senate vote on the merits. And Obama avoided      a veto fight. But that's different than having ``strong      support'' for the deal.  That is the Washington Post Fact Checker.  So if Democrats share the President's determination to ``win ugly'' on this important issue, then they have sufficient numbers to do that, apparently, but I would remind my colleagues of something. This debate should not be about a President who will leave office in 16 months. It should be about where our country will be in 16 years.  Consider this advice from an editorial that appeared in Bloomberg last month:       Tactics aside, it would be far better to win this fight      fairly. The pact is not a treaty: A future President and      Congress might overturn it, arguing that it was sealed      without proper consideration. And history often looks with      disgust at causes built on fear, especially if they go awry.  This is an important moment for the Democratic Party, but more importantly it is an important moment for our country. Let's stand up for the people we represent. Let's allow them to vote on what is one of the most consequential foreign policy issues of our age.                          ____________________
