 Marshall London. Dr. London was one of the most prominent citizens in Burlington, VT. A deeply beloved physician, he was also a lifelong progressive and a liberal.  A native of Vermont, he attended the University of Vermont, where in 1948 he served as the campus organizer for the Progressive Party nominee for President, Henry Wallace. He served as a flight surgeon in the US Air Force from 1961-1963. In the late 1960s, Marshall London and his family volunteered in support of Caesar Chavez's United Farm workers. He provided medical services to migrant workers in Delano, CA.  In 1970 he returned to his native Burlington with his wife and children. A lifelong supporter of universal health care, Dr. London was committed to serving the underserved and the elderly. Not only did he make house calls, but in addition to his medical bag he regularly carried plumbing and electrical tools to make home repairs for his patients. In the early 1990s, Dr. London, as President of the Jewish Community Council of Burlington, worked to resettle emigres from the former Soviet Union.  He never severed his ties to the UVM Medical School, where he continued to serve as a mentor and teacher at the Fletcher Allen Hospital, even after he retired in 1997.  In a time when corporate values have spread beyond business to such areas as education and health care, Marshall London serves an enduring example that there are other values which can guide human life. He was a caring physician, one who always charted his course by paying attention to those most in need, and always depending on an exemplary social conscience. He was dedicated to his family. And he did not restrict his life to work. Dr. London was an alto saxophone player in the Vermont Catamount Band and Burlington City Band. He was also an avid tennis player and skier. Like so many Vermonters--and he was a fifth-generation Vermonter--he was also a loyal Red Sox fan.  Dr. Marshall will be missed, though the example of his life and values will endure.  I ask that Dr. London's obituary be printed in the Record.  The obituary follows:                   [From the Burlington Free Press,                              Dec. 13, 2012]                           Marshall G. London       Burlington.--Marshall G. London, a fifth generation      Burlingtonian, beloved family man and dedicated local      physician who made house calls an integral part of his      practice, died at home on Dec. 12, 2012. He was 83.       The grandson of a founding member of Burlington's first      synagogue, Ahavath Gerim, Marshall was a featured participant      in the recent Vermont Public Television documentary ``Little      Jerusalem.''       He took pride in his local roots and Jewish heritage, and      had an enduring passion for Jewish history, and a strong      commitment to Israel.       He was born and raised in Burlington's Old North End. He      graduated in 1951 from the University of Vermont, where he      was president of the Tau Epsilon Phi Fraternity. Always      staunchly liberal in his politics, Marshall was a campus      organizer of the 1948 presidential campaign for Progressive      Party candidate Henry Wallace.       He and Susanne (Sue) Abrams were married in 1953 and had      six children.       Marshall began his medical career with an internship at the      Mary Fletcher Hospital, followed by a residency at Mount Zion      Hospital in San Francisco, Calif. Subsequently, he served as      a flight surgeon in the U.S. Air Force in South Carolina.      From 1961 to 1963, he completed a rheumatology fellowship at      the Manchester Royal Infirmary in England, which included      clinic visits across Europe. With children in tow, the      London's camped in their VW bus from Lapland to Italy.       After returning to Burlington from England, they moved to      California, where Marshall joined a private practice in Los      Gatos. During this time, he volunteered in support of Cesar      Chavez's United Farm Workers, providing medical service to      migrant workers in Delano, Calif. In 1970, Marshall and his      family again returned to Burlington, where he opened a      private practice on Orchard Terrace.       A lifelong advocate of universal healthcare, he was      committed to providing for the underserved and the elderly,      and he volunteered as a mentor and teacher at the medical      school for many years. He made house calls equipped with his      medical bag, and sometimes with plumbing or electrical tools      to assist with all manner of repairs.       He retired in 1997, but continued, even in recent months,      attending Grand Rounds at the hospital and visiting former      patients in their homes.       An alto saxophone player in the Vermont Catamount Band and      Burlington City Band, he was also an avid tennis player,      skier, and loyal Red Sox fan.       He and Sue traveled frequently, visiting Israel and often      tent-camping in Newfoundland and Labrador. They made many      friends in their travels, and their 19th-century home bustles      year-round with family and friends old and new.       Like his parents and grandparents before him, Marshall was      a devoted member of the Ohavi Zedek Synagogue for many years.      He later joined Chabad of Vermont, where, closer to the      traditional roots of his grandfathers, he found new spiritual      and intellectual inspiration.       He is survived by his wife, Susanne; children, Rebecca and      Aaron Goldberg of Burlington, Saul and Georgette London of      Highland Park, N.J., Sara London and Dean Albarelli of      Northampton, Mass., Naomi London of Burlington, Daniel and      Andrea London of Evanston, Ill., and Rachel London and Matt      Bohner of Brooklyn, N.Y.; foster daughter, Linda and Jim      Nyema-Davies of Greensboro, N.C.; grandchildren and great-     grandchildren, Dinah and Joshua; Jesse and Emily; Tamar and      Isaac; Ilana and Jonny, and children, Maya, Nitzan and Yoav;      Tova and Shmuel and daughters, Bracha and Tehila; Amalia and      David, and son, Ruby; Ziva and Daniel, and son, Avromy; Jack,      Matan, Yonah, Liora, Cooper and Cali.                          ____________________
