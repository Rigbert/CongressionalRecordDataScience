Every single one of the nominees we will be voting on this week has been nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy. This means that the nonpartisan Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts has designated them as emergency vacancies due to high caseloads. We continue to seek consent from Republicans to vote on much needed judges to our Federal judiciary, and yet they continue to refuse. Republicans have objected to moving to a vote on every single judicial nominee this year. I can only hope that they will eventually come to see the error of their ways.  Before proceeding with the qualifications of these judicial nominees, I would again like to clarify and address some questions regarding the nomination of David Barron. Mr. Barron has been nominated to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. There have been press accounts that have inaccurately stated what the administration has made available for Senators to review relevant to this nomination. As I said last week, the administration has made available unredacted copies of any memo issued by Mr. Barron regarding the potential use of lethal force against Anwar Al-Awlaki. This week, the administration has made clear that this material included all written legal advice by Mr. Barron regarding potential use of lethal force against U.S. citizens in counterterrorism operations. Senators therefore have had the opportunity to conduct their due diligence before voting on this nomination.  In an Internet post titled ``Why Civil Libertarians and Drone Critics Should Support David Barron,'' Georgetown Law Professor David Cole--one of the foremost critics of the administration over its failure to publicly disclose legal material addressing the use of lethal force against U.S. citizens--has stated:       It is a mistake to conflate the issues of the appointment      of David Barron and disclosure of the memos. Barron is a      highly qualified lawyer who I know personally to be      thoughtful, considerate, open-minded, and brilliant. His      confirmation would put in place a judge who will be      absolutely vigilant in his protection of civil liberties and      his insistence that executive power be constrained by the      rule of law. That long-term value should not be sacrificed      because of a short-term battle over memos that every Senator      already has the opportunity to review.  Professor Cole is right. I have personally pressed the administration for greater transparency on these matters as well, but that is a separate debate and we should not be waging it at the expense of harming our Federal judiciary and denying the American people an individual who will make a first-rate judge. Not only is this tactic unwise, but it also does not help advance the cause of those who are seeking public disclosure of the memos. As Professor Cole has further explained:       [H]olding up Barron's nomination is unlikely to expedite      disclosure of the memos. It will only undermine the      confirmation of someone who would make an excellent judge.      The Administration has been ordered (unanimously) to release      the memo, and will in short order either comply with that      order or seek further review. Barron has no control over that      decision, and should not be held hostage to it . . .       I am second to none in my support for transparency. And I      will continue to fight for that value on its own terms. But      it is a huge mistake to let our legitimate concerns about      transparency get in the way of the confirmation of a judge      who will faithfully protect our liberties and hold government      accountable--especially when the Senate already has been      given access to all the information they need to exercise      their ``advise and consent'' role.  I agree completely with Professor Cole, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the full posting after my remarks.  I would further ask unanimous consent to include a joint op-ed in the Boston Globe by Harvard Law professors Charles Fried and Laurence Tribe--two legal luminaries who often disagree in their views on the Constitution and other legal issues. As the two of them have written:       The nation badly needs the best possible judges--men and      women of integrity, intelligence, judicial temperament,      respect for the rule of law, and an understanding of the role      of judges within our legal system. Barron understands and      exemplifies those values. He should be released from the      destructive tangle in which he has become quite undeservedly      enmeshed and placed on the First Circuit Court of Appeals      where he can serve our nation with great distinction.  We should proceed to Mr. Barron's nomination and confirm him so he can get to work on behalf of the American people. Delays are simply depriving the Federal judiciary and all Americans of a tremendous public servant.  This week, we will proceed to vote to end filibusters on the following seven nominations:  Judge Gregg Costa has been nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Texas.

Judge Soto has the support of his Republican home State Senators, Senator McCain and Senator Flake. The Judiciary Committee reported him favorably to the full Senate by voice vote on February 27, 2014.  All of these nominees have the experience, judgment, and legal acumen to be terrific judges in our Federal courts. I thank the majority leader for filing cloture petitions, and I hope all Senators will join me to end these filibusters so that these nominees can get working on behalf of the American people.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             [May 12, 2014]  Why Civil Libertarians and Drone Critics Should Support David Barron                            (By David Cole)       Sen. Rand Paul has an op-ed in the New York Times today      opposing the nomination of David J. Barron to the U.S. Court      of Appeals for the First Circuit until the memos Barron wrote      concerning the legality of the targeted killing of US citizen      Anwar Al-Awlaki are publically released. The ACLU has also      urged that Barron's nomination be delayed until Senators are      allowed to read all targeted killing memos written by Barron.      I have been as much a critic of the drones program as Sen.      Paul, and have written often about my critiques of both the      apparent scope of the program and the lack of transparency      surrounding it. (See here, here & here). I continue to      support transparency. But it would be a terrible mistake to      hold up David Barron's nomination over this issue.       First, and most importantly, it is a mistake to conflate      the issues of the appointment of David Barron and disclosure      of the memos. Barron is a highly qualified lawyer who I know      personally to be thoughtful, considerate, open-minded, and      brilliant. His confirmation would put in place a judge who      will be absolutely vigilant in his protection of civil      liberties and his insistence that executive power be      constrained by the rule of law. That long-term value should      not be sacrificed because of a short-term battle over memos      that every Senator already has the opportunity to review.       There can be no doubt that Barron would be an excellent      independent judge, and would faithfully exercise his      authority to protect Americans' rights and to keep government      honest and constrained. As former judge and now Stanford Law      Professor Michael McConnell has noted, Barron ``has supported      efforts to adopt laws to enable judicial review of executive      actions that might otherwise escape judicial review because      of lack of standing, and has written powerfully about the      need for constitutional limits on executive excesses.''      Indeed, as head of the Office of Legal Counsel in 2009,      Barron himself withdrew five OLC memos written during the      prior administration to authorize controversial interrogation      techniques such as waterboarding. And fellow Harvard Law      Professor John F. Manning, a conservative who clerked for      Judge Robert Bork and Justice Antonin Scalia, has accurately      described Barron as ``undeniably brilliant'' and ``an      unusually talented and careful lawyer'' who will ``understand      and faithfully carry out the duties of a circuit judge.''       Second, the administration has in fact made available to      all Senators any and all memos Barron wrote concerning the      targeting of al-Awlaki--the core of the issue Sen. Paul is      concerned about. So if Sen. Paul and any other Senator want      to review Barron's reasoning in full, they are free to do so.      Moreover, the administration also made available to the      Senate, and ultimately to the public, a ``White Paper'' said      to be drawn from the Barron memo (though written long after      he left office). Thus, no Senator need be in the dark about      the Administration's reasoning, and the public also has a      pretty good idea as well.       Indeed, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit      recently ruled that a redacted version of the al-Awlaki memo      can and should be disclosed, largely because much of its      reasoning had already been made public in the White Paper.      Thus, while I fully support the public disclosure of the      memo, redacted to protect sources and methods, every Senator      already has full access to the memo, and therefore can make      an informed judgment on advice and consent. And the public      also has a good sense of what it says.       Notably, Senators Ron Wyden, Mark Udall, and Martin      Heinrich, all members of the Intelligence Committee, wrote a      letter to Attorney General Eric Holder in November 2013,      after reviewing the memo on the killing of al-Awlaki, and      stating their view the killing was ``a legitimate use of the      authority granted to the President.'' They went on to urge      the administration to be more forthcoming about the legal      limits on the use of force against U.S. persons in other      cases, beyond what the memo apparently had sanctioned, but      did not question the legality of the action authorized.       Sen. Paul's op-ed notes that the Office of Legal Counsel      may have written more than one memo on targeted killing,      which is quite possible. But the administration has disclosed      to the Senators the full, unredacted versions of any memo      authorizing the killing of Americans, the issue Sen. Paul      raises in his op-ed.       Finally, holding up Barron's nomination is unlikely to      expedite disclosure of the memos. It will only undermine the      confirmation of someone who would make an excellent judge.      The Administration has been ordered (unanimously) to release      the memo, and will in short order either comply with that      order or seek further review. Barron has no control over that      decision, and should not be held hostage to it.       I am second to none in my support for transparency. And I      will continue to fight for that value on its own terms. But      it is a huge mistake to let our legitimate concerns about      transparency get in the way of the confirmation of a judge      who will faithfully protect our liberties and hold government      accountable--especially when the Senate already has been      given access to all the information they need to exercise      their ``advise and consent'' role. As a civil libertarian and      drone critic, I have no hesitation in saying that David      Barron should be confirmed.                                  ____                 [From the Boston Globe, May 13, 2014]       David Barron Should Be Confirmed to U.S. Court of Appeals                (By Charles Fried and Laurence H. Tribe)       Although the two of us frequently approach legal questions      from different perspectives, and just as often disagree about      the best answers to those questions, we share a respect for      our Constitution and a reverence for the judicial process.      That's why, in spite of our disagreements, we agree that      Harvard Law School professor David Barron is exceptionally      well-qualified to hold a seat on the US Court of Appeals for      the First Circuit and that the Senate should promptly confirm      him.       No one can reasonably question Barron's intelligence, the      high quality of his scholarship, his judicial temperament,      his deep respect for the rule of law, or his personal      integrity and devotion to public service. Barron (who is      married to Juliette Kayyem, a Democratic gubernatorial      candidate and former Globe columnist) is a brilliant lawyer      who will make an excellent judge.       Though some conservatives oppose his embrace of what they      call ``progressive constitutionalism,'' and some civil      libertarians worry about the secrecy of memoranda he signed      as head of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel      regarding the legality of using lethal force against a      specific US citizen who was an operational leader of an enemy      force, neither of these concerns justifies delaying a vote,      or denying Barron a seat on the First Circuit.       Any description of Barron as ``an unabashed proponent of      judicial activism'' is a caricature that demonstrates a lack      of familiarity with serious debate over constitutional      issues. What is clear to us is that Barron would decide cases      based solely on the relevant sources of legal authority,      including binding precedent, and that his political views      would in no way distort his legal judgment. We will have      reached a tragic turning point if people are disqualified      from holding judicial office when they have thought deeply      about the issues and expressed their views in public.       There is nothing in Barron's record, or in our many years      of personal interactions with him, that would lead us to      believe that he is anything other than a straight shooter,      thoroughly committed to applying rules of law dispassionately      and unflinchingly, and without political consideration.      That's what judges should and must do, whatever their      philosophical bent.       Beyond the fight over judicial philosophy, Barron's      nomination has encountered resistance because of his      authorship of opinions in the Office of Legal Counsel      surrounding the legality of using lethal force against Anwar      al-Awlaki, a US citizen who was killed by a drone strike in      Yemen in 2011. Some have argued that the Senate should not      vote to confirm Barron until its members review the OLC      memos, but that point is now moot because the White House has      made unredacted versions available to every senator. Others      have argued that the Senate should not vote until a redacted      version of the principal Awlaki memo is made public, as a      court of appeals recently held it must be. That is an issue      subject to ongoing litigation and of no relevance to Barron's      nomination. He left public service four years ago and has      nothing to do with administration policies on the release of      sensitive information. In any event, it is likely that the      memos will be released in short order: Either the      administration will not appeal the court's ruling, or the      ruling will be upheld on appeal. Without doubt,     holding up Barron's nomination will not expedite the release      of any memo.       We agree it is entirely appropriate for Congress to      consider carefully the legal framework for drone strikes,      although we may reach different conclusions on that score.      But it would inflict grave harm on the confirmation process      and on our ability to recruit the best persons to the federal      judiciary if Barron's nomination to the First Circuit were      allowed to become collateral damage in this debate. The      pertinent question cannot be whether any senator agrees or      disagrees with any particular use of force or with whether      the administration should or should not release documents.      Barron didn't order the strikes or design the legal framework      for their authorization. Indeed we do not know whether he      personally agrees with that policy, the wisdom and morality      of which it was not his job to assess. And he has not      advocated, much less ordered, the withholding of any      documents. His job as acting head of the Office of Legal      Counsel was to provide thorough, accurate, and unvarnished      legal opinions to the president and other executive      officials, based on the traditional legal authorities of      text, history, and precedent. We have every reason to believe      that is precisely what he did, and there is absolutely no      evidence to the contrary.       The nation badly needs the best possible judges--men and      women of integrity, intelligence, judicial temperament,      respect for the rule of law, and an understanding of the role      of judges within our legal system. Barron understands and      exemplifies those values. He should be released from the      destructive tangle in which he has become quite undeservedly      enmeshed and placed on the First Circuit Court of Appeals,      where he can serve our nation with great distinction.                          ____________________
