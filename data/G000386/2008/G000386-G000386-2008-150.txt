 Dr. Hassett's analysis accounts for spending increases for the global war on terror and related matters that were anticipated at the end of the Clinton administration. The analysis shows that other Government spending is trending $400 billion above where it otherwise would be.  In essence, the Republican leader's offered offset categories are future undefined spending budget room that did not materialize until the conference report on the budget was adopted a few weeks ago. Keep in mind that this new undefined future spending sits on top of a baseline that is, as Dr. Hassett's analysis shows, $400 billion higher than the trendline from the Clinton administration.  If the majority leader does not engage us on this deficit-neutral offer, then he is putting taxpayers in his State at risk for the loss of several deductions they used on tax returns for last year. Included are the sales tax deduction, college tuition deduction, and teachers' classroom expense deduction.  The latest IRS statistics of income data on the number of families and individuals claiming these benefits for the States of Nevada, Kentucky, and Iowa will appear in the Record after my discussion.  The tradeoff is clear. Deal with these tax benefits which affect taxpayers now. Offset them with undefined extra spending accounts for appropriations bills that will not be written until several years down the road under the present budget. All that can be accomplished without adding a penny to the Federal deficit.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the IRS statistics of income data to which I earlier referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: TABLE OF EXAMPLES OF NUMBERS OF TAX FILERS AFFECTED BY INACTION ON TAX                                EXTENDERS------------------------------------------------------------------------                                           Nevada    Kentucky     Iowa------------------------------------------------------------------------Sales Tax Deduction                        327,532     54,602     50,163College Tuition Deduction                   32,800     45,713     48,895Teachers Classroom Expense Deduction        22,789     39,735     35,238------------------------------------------------------------------------Source: IRS Statistics of Income (2004 tax year).
