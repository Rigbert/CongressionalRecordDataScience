 President, in addition, they have facilities in six other States also contributing to those States' rural economies, such as Defiance, OH, Jonesboro, AR, Arcola, IL, Aurora, NE, and Watertown, SD--places where good jobs and hard work that is not flashy and does not make the scandal page of the big city newspapers are valued in those towns as important places of employment and contribute to the economy, places where people invest in the local economy and contribute as good citizens to community improvement and betterment.  They used to call these kinds of folks the ``pillars of the community,'' in old-fashioned terms. But in today's economy, these are folks devoted to American values and small town America. They may sell their products all over the United States. They also sell their products--would you believe it--all over the world. But you know what, they manufacture those products right there in that small community of Sheffield, IA. As a family farmer, the Sukups have been successful because they make a great product, and this is one of their products.  I wish to move on to another little Iowa town, somewhat larger than Sheffield, the town of Shenandoah. That is where Lloyd Inc. is located. Shenandoah is a community of almost 5,000 people--4,944 to be precise. Our colleague Senator Ensign is the lone practitioner of animal medicine in the Senate. He might be familiar with the products that Lloyd Inc. in Shenandoah, IA, puts out.  It, too, is not a flashy company. They started making animal dietary mixes in 1958, and now they are a significant provider of veterinary drugs. The chart depicts one of Lloyd Inc.'s products. These are different animals. I am not going to go into too much detail about them.  Eugene Lloyd is a doctor of veterinary medicine. He is the CEO of the company. Dr. Lloyd has told me the company has never let go of any employees due to poor business cycles.  Lloyd Inc. employs well over 90 well-educated people in this community of Shenandoah in southwest Iowa. The company has also provided generous health care and retirement plans to their employees, and as I said, in rural America, those benefits are very important.  Finally, both the company and Dr. Lloyd and his family have given generously throughout the years to educational scholarships, unrestricted grants to Dr. Lloyd's and his wife's alma mater, and provided financial and product support to address disasters, both locally and internationally.  Unfortunately, even after vigilant estate planning, these two families, the Lloyd and the Sukup family-owned companies will be facing a very large combined estate tax bill. That bill could total tens of millions of dollars between the two companies. That is tens of millions of dollars that will leave the State of Iowa. These companies might face a fire sale, and so often in this circumstance a company is sold to someone with no interest or no desire to maintain the current location or contributions to the community.  There are two companies, two towns, six counties, four families, and hundreds of employees, and all will be hurt if we do not do something about the death tax. Businesses will be sold, locations will be shut down, real people will lose good jobs. The State of Iowa will lose tens of millions of dollars of hard capital invested for over 90 years between these two companies. I barely even mentioned how much salary, retirement plans, and charitable contributions they have made to those little Iowa communities.  The multinational or foreign companies will come calling. They will be circling these home-grown businesses. Trust me, they will. We have seen it before. Perhaps they will be accompanied by sharpie hedge-fund types from big cities, such as New York, Boston or Chicago. They will go to places such as Sheffield and Shenandoah, but they will not go there to live. When they arrive we will have no one else to blame but us, right here in the Congress, for letting these family-owned companies committed to the community go away.  The punitive death tax policy passionately pushed by my liberal friends will have greased the skids. It will have killed the local roots of these successful small town businesses. All of us from rural America are trying to battle what is called out-migration. If we leave the death tax in place in its punitive form, in 2011 it will take away jobs, businesses, and people out of rural America. That is why I care about this death tax debate: because of real people in real Iowa communities invested in expanding in those rural counties.  It is strange, in New York City, how many multimillionaires live in any one block in Manhattan. But those so-called multimillionaires seem a little different when you check out the Iowa corn crop or you sit together at church or at a grandson's baseball game. They are, as the popular book says, ``The Millionaire Next Door.'' They are the pillars who help hold up all those 99 counties that I visit every year.  I know these are not the kinds of stories that make the front pages of our big city newspapers. When family businesses are sold and shut down or move out of the State or even move out of the United States, it certainly makes the front pages of the newspapers that I really care about. So when you hear about the number of estates affected, keep in mind to some extent that statistic is only a snapshot. The estate tax return is filed by the representative of a dead person. Those statistics so often dwelled on by many of the proponents of the death tax do not capture the full picture. The statistic is only a look at the dead person who owned the business or farm. It does not take into account the dead person's family, the dead person's employees, the dead person's neighbors. All of those folks are affected if the death tax burdens that family's business or farm and causes it to move on to some other owner and maybe out of the community.  There seems to be a strategy by the bicameral Democratic leadership to slow-walk a resolution of this vexing problem. The slow-walk strategy will leave the American people with the current law, and that current law is $1 million compared to the zero today or what we could have as a compromise between the House and Senate: $3.5 million on the one hand, $5 million on the other.  The junior Senator from Vermont as always is passionate and transparent about what he thinks and believes. He has said we should retain current law. His position is that $253 billion in revenue gained from current law is better spent by those of us in Washington, no doubt spent on what the junior Senator believes are valuable programs, probably some programs that I support.  Should his view prevail, however, we will see the essence of the economic policy of the Democratic leadership over the past 18 months. It will be another income redistribution policy. The President defined it a couple of years ago. It will be a program designed to ``spread the wealth around.'' More taxes for those who have saved and sacrificed during life, more spending on those who are demanding ever more generous tax-funded subsidies. That is basically what redistribution is all about. It is about folks in this city of Washington ``spreading the wealth around.''  I have heard rumors and read press reports that indicate that various Senators have a lot of company in the House and Senate Democratic caucuses. For instance, maybe the position taken by the Senator from Vermont might have that support. But those who share his view or views like that have not been as transparent as the junior Senator from Vermont, who is very transparent. You know exactly where he stands, and that is an honorable position for any Senator to take. I say that even though I disagree with him some.  The number of quiet supporters of the junior Senator from Vermont may be high enough to prevent the Democratic leadership from allowing a clean vote on a bipartisan compromise. I believe that bipartisan compromise is one of a $5 million exemption and a 35-percent tax rate compared to the $3.5 million and 45 percent tax rate in the House of Representatives.  The American people need to hear some data about how current law will apply when it goes to that million-dollar exemption. They need to know where the revenue will come from. So we always go, around this Senate, to the Joint Committee on Taxation. That is a nonpartisan official congressional scorekeeper on the issue of taxes--and all taxes. We need to also know about the number of affected estates.  Under current law it will be at least--can you believe it--at least 10 times higher than what it would be under the Lincoln-Kyl bipartisan compromise that I just described, the compromise that would cap the death tax rate at 35 percent. It would also provide that unified credit equivalent amount of about $5 million.  So here is that data from that nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation that you see right here. We are going to talk about current law, which is the tax law that is right now going to take effect in 2011 if we do not do anything. That is going to arrive in just a little over 6 months.  Under current law, 44,000 estates will be taxable. Under the Lincoln-Kyl compromise, 4,000 estates would be taxable. You can see here, for the year 2011, Lincoln-Kyl, 4,000; current law, with a $1 million exemption, 44,400 estates. That is quite a big difference.  It means that current law, the path on which we seem to be slow-walking, means 10 times the number of estates will be hit by the tax. The Lincoln-Kyl compromise means that only the top 10 percent, the wealthiest estates, will be hit by the death tax.  If you project that out, as this chart does, 8 years of current law over the 10 years, you will find that roughly 616,000 estates will be taxed over that period, and under the Lincoln-Kyl compromise, roughly 54,000 estates would be taxable over that period of time.  To give everyone a bit of perspective, I wish to share some Iowa farm data. It is from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Under current law, in a bit over 6 months, with the $1 million exemption that is on the law now taking place, the line between a taxable farm and nontaxable farm will be that $1 million.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that there were 92,800 farms covering 86 percent of Iowa in 2007. In 2007, the average Iowa farm was 331 acres. According to a survey conducted by Iowa State University in 2009, the average acre was worth $3,371. That means that a farm the size of the 2007 Iowa average, at average 2009 prices in Iowa, is going to be worth $1,446,801. In 2007, there were 19,302 Iowa farms with 500 or more acres worth at least $2.1 million at average 2009 prices. Now, keep in mind that farmers sometimes carry debt. That would reduce the value of the farm. But, on the other hand, farmers have other farm-related assets, such as the farm machinery to operate it, that are not included in the figures I just cited.  This data shows that the current-law estate tax could hit many Iowa farmers. For those folks working the lands, this is an unwelcome certainty. As I indicated earlier, the tax is an impediment to passing on the family business--in this case, the family farm. Current-law death taxes, quietly supported by, apparently, many Members on the other side--and that is that $1 million figure--will act as an incentive to break down many family farms and small businesses. These family farms and small businesses form the economic backbone of their hard-working heartland communities.  What amazes me is the zeal by some to use tax policy to inflict this kind of damage on family farms and small businesses such as the two I pointed out in Shenandoah, IA, and Sheffield, IA. All of this is somehow supposed to fund an ever-expanding set of Federal benefits to many who do not pay any income tax. The signal sent is that those who work hard, save, and want to pass something on to their family exist solely to fund these bloated Federal programs. So why work hard? Why save? Why not work less? Why not go into debt and live beyond your means? In the end, the government levels everyone out at death by, as the President said, ``spreading the wealth around.''  I have not touched on the damage being inflicted now by our inaction on estate tax reform. At every townhall, I hear from folks--in fact, I just finished a half hour monthly television program I do back in the State of Iowa. And one of the callers called in: When are you going to do something about the estate tax? Kind of embarrassing to tell him. I told him to watch my speech that I was going to give just as soon as the program is over. So here I am. But everybody at my townhalls--I hear from folks who ask these kinds of questions. They ask: What is the law going to be? Will it be retroactive? When will the Congress address this action? Why delay?  Recently, I received a letter that was signed by 750 Iowa attorneys asking for a resolution of this issue. At a time when families are dealing with the emotional and financial stress of the death of a family member, why do we add this additional confusion and anxiety for the family or for a counselor who cannot even advise his clients on what they should do in planning an estate?  I am afraid I do not have a good answer for these folks, just as a few minutes ago on my television program I did not have an answer for that person who called in from Pocahontas, IA, wanting to know what we are going to do about this. But we do need to get an answer. Hopefully, it is one that will be bipartisan, such as Lincoln-Kyl, and limits the reach of the death tax to at least the top 10 percent of the wealthiest estates. At the very least, we owe the American people an open and intellectually honest debate and votes up or down on a very fair policy.  Resolving the estate tax nightmare with real reform is time-sensitive tax legislation business. It is nowhere on the Senate's radar screen. As I point to this checklist once again that I bring to the Senate almost every day, I urge my friends in the Democratic leadership to put it on the Senate's radar screen.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
