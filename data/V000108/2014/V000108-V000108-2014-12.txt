The committee has a tradition of protecting whistleblowers. In fact, we have accepted, during consideration of the bill, an amendment to do so 2 days ago.  I think most Members probably have encountered an individual who has come into their office and said: I would like to provide you with information that, hopefully, would make our government more efficient and better, but I don't want to get into trouble.  That is who you have in mind. I appreciate that very much and rise in support of it.
