 President, I would like to agree with the points made by my colleagues. The timber tax provisions are critically important to Washington and other States that rely on timber jobs, and the provisions must be extended promptly. I have discussed this matter with the chairman of the Finance Committee, and he has assured me that he will work to extend the provisions early next year.
