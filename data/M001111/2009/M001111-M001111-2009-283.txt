 President, the Senate just adopted an amendment that ensures that the government contracts are competitively awarded. The amendment Senator Coburn is now offering will undo everything we just did to assure that all businesses--small business, minority-owned businesses, women-owned businesses, businesses owned by service-disabled veterans--will be eligible to bid on these contracts.  I urge the Senate to vote no.
