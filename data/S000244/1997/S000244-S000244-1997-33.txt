 Mr. McDADE. May I say, Mr. Chairman, to my friend, the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Sensenbrenner], that the gentleman is correct, that the intent of this section is to encourage and foster more competition in the future awards of M contracts for the Department of Energy laboratories.  Furthermore, there is no intention to prohibit or discourage the Department from awarding M contracts for research and development on a competitive basis.  Finally, the gentleman has my assurances that the subcommittee will work with the Committee on Science to craft language that could be submitted to the conference that would address his concerns.
