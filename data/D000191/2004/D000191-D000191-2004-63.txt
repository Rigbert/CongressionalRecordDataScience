I would not want to mention any individual Senators.  So the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission then suddenly said, oh, no, there is something wrong here. It is a little bit weird that prices are up to 100 times normal. And they reimposed the price caps, which we had during the Clinton administration.  Now we have the tapes of the Enron Corporation, and Ken Lay says he did nothing wrong. The tapes are incredible. The marketers talk about shutting off plants to drive up prices. They talk about gouging Grandma Milly. They talk about getting rid of the Clinton administration, price caps are gone, and Ken Lay is going to run things in this country, and, by God, they are going to make a lot of money. And they did for a while at tremendous pain and cost to the Western United States, all while the Bush administration looked the other way.  Pat Wood of Texas is still in charge of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Bush administration is continuing to push for more deregulation. They think the only thing that Enron did wrong and the only thing wrong with deregulation is that Enron got caught, because they were having a wonderful time making a bunch of money.  Now it comes that Ken Lay of Texas is the largest single, individual, lifetime contributor to George Bush of Texas, the President of the United States, and he has contributed over his life $139,500 to President Bush. His company contributed $625,000 to President Bush.  I would call upon the President to return these ill-gotten gains, the money that Ken Lay stole from Grandma Milly and others in the Western United States, and to show that he understands and has compassion. He could contribute the money to low-income energy funds in the Western United States to help Grandma Milly, who was taken to the cleaners by Ken Lay of Texas, of Enron, Mr. Bush's best friend, ``Ken Boy'' Lay.                          ____________________
