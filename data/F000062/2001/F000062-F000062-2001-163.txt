 President, I rise today to recognize the achievements of students from Stockdale High School for winning an honorable mention in the We the People..The Citizen and the Constitution national competition. These outstanding students from Bakersfield, CA competed against 49 other classes from across the country and demonstrated a vast knowledge of the U.S. Constitution and American democracy. Their accomplishments are areflection of their hard work and preparation for this prestigious event.  On April 21-23, 2001, hundreds of young people ascended on our Nation's Capital to participate in the We the People national finals. This exciting competition is administered by the Center for the Civic Education to educate students on the history and principles of American constitutional government. Reaching more than 26 million students nationwide, We the People introduces elementary, middle, and high school students to the intricacies of our government and encourages them to contribute actively to the political process throughout their lives.  I can think of no better way to ensure that this country has competent citizens and future leaders than to encourage more of our Nation's youth to participate in programs such as this one. I am particularly proud of the accomplishments of the Stockdale High School class and encourage these students to be ever vigilant in their future endeavors to learn about and foster our democracy.                          ____________________
