 The gentleman misstates what I said. I said discussion regarding a public option when I had talked to nobody on your side who was for a public option.  It seems pointless, from my perspective, to talk to somebody about how a public option ought to be configured if, as you have just stated, you're not for a public option. Therefore, a discussion about a public option does in fact to me seem pointless.  Furthermore, let me say this: The gentleman was here when we--I believe you were here--when we adopted the current part D of the Medicare program. The gentleman will recall in that bill you provided for a public option. You provided for a public option to provide competition and availability of a health care prescription-drug coverage. Now, you provided it in the event that there was no private sector, or at least not more than one, available in any one segment of our society.  So I tell the gentleman, in your own bill--that I think you supported; I don't know that off the top of my head--but my presumption is you supported it or certainly the overwhelming majority of your party supported with very few Democratic votes, and that provided for an option of a public option.
