  Mr. President, several weeks ago, I informed the citizens of Vermont that I would be voting against the confirmation of Judge Mukasey to be Attorney General, and tonight I am going to, in fact, be casting a ``no'' vote.  Mr. President, there are several reasons I will vote no on Judge Mukasey. First, like many of my colleagues, I was deeply disturbed by his response to the question of waterboarding. He apparently does not know whether waterboarding is torture. Well, millions of Americans know waterboarding is torture. People all over the world know waterboarding is torture. The Geneva Conventions are quite clear about waterboarding being torture. And, frankly, I don't think it is too much to ask for us to have an Attorney General who knows waterboarding is torture. That is one reason I am voting against Judge Mukasey, but there is a second reason, and perhaps maybe an even more important reason.  For the last 6 years, it is clear that we have had a President who does not understand what the Constitution of the United States is about. What this President believes, essentially, is that he can do anything he wants, at any time, against anybody in the name of fighting terrorism. And he happens to believe the war on terrorism is unending. It is going to go on indefinitely. I think it is very important that we have an Attorney General who can explain the Constitution to a President who clearly does not understand it. Unfortunately, Mr. Mukasey is not that person.  In the last 6 years under President Bush, we have seen the National Security Agency start a program which allows wiretapping without first obtaining a court order, to my mind, in violation of the Constitution. We have seen personal records that have been extensively mined for data. How many millions? Who knows? Nobody in the Senate really knows. We don't have access to that information. It is massive amounts of data mining, in clear violation of the privacy rights and the laws of America under this President.  We have seen the phenomenon of extraordinary rendition, which has shifted detainees to prisons in countries abroad which allow torture. We have seen the firing and the politicization of the Office of the U.S. Attorney. We have seen detainees of the United States being denied the oldest right in the Western legal system--the right to habeas corpus. We are running a prison camp in Guantanamo where prisoners have minimal legal rights, which is an international embarrassment for us as we struggle against international terrorism. And we have seen many other assaults by this President on our constitutional rights and on the laws of this country.  We have a President who clearly does not understand the separation of powers; that the Congress of the United States is an equal branch of our Government; that the Judiciary is an equal branch of our Government; that the executive branch does not have all of the power.  A little while ago I was on a statewide TV program in Vermont. Somebody called in and they said: When is Congress going to begin to stand up to this President?  That is a good question, and I didn't have a good answer. But what I can tell you, the time is long overdue for us to begin to stand up to this President, who thinks he can veto virtually every piece of legislation we send him, who ignores the Constitution of this country--I think it is time we begin to stand up.  I have heard some of my colleagues say, if we reject Mr. Mukasey, the President is not going to send us another nominee. That is the right of the President of the United States. But we have our rights as well. We have the right to demand an Attorney Generalwho supports, strongly, the Constitution and is prepared to tell the President when he is acting against our Constitution. That is our right. It is about time we began to defend our right.  I can't blame the President for taking over the rights of Congress, if Congress is not prepared to stand up and fight back. I think that time is long overdue.  Mr. President, if you do not want to send us another nominee, that is your right. We have our rights as well. I will be voting against Mr. Mukasey. I hope my colleagues do as well.  In conclusion, I ask unanimous consent that letters of opposition and concern from the American Civil Liberties Union, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and Common Cause be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               American Civil Liberties Union,                                 Washington, DC, November 5, 2007.     Re Nomination of Michael Mukasey for Attorney General     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Specter: The American Civil      Liberties Union strongly urges you to oppose moving the      nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey for Attorney General out      of the Judiciary Committee unless he states that      waterboarding and other extreme interrogation tactics are      torture, within the meaning of federal law, and commits to      the full enforcement of federal laws against torture and      abuse. This commitment is important for two reasons: (1) to      ensure that the federal government stops, and does not      resume, the use of torture and abuse in interrogations; and      (2) to have the next attorney general committed to      investigating and, if appropriate, prosecuting persons who      authorized or committed torture or abuse.       Mukasey's unwillingness to answer questions on whether      waterboarding and similar practices are torture undermines      the rule of law and threatens the security of Americans. In      response to questions from members of the Judiciary      Committee, Mukasey not only refused to state whether      waterboarding is torture when authorized by or committed by      the federal government, but he also refused to say whether it      is illegal for foreign countries to commit acts such as      waterboarding, electric shocks, beatings, head slaps, and      induced hypothermia on Americans.       Federal law is clear that waterboarding and all other forms      of torture and abuse are illegal. The Anti-Torture Act      criminalizes the use of torture; the War Crimes Act      criminalizes the use of torture and abuse against detainees      protected by the Geneva Conventions (which includes alleged      Taliban and al-Qaeda detainees); the McCain Amendment of the      Detainee Treatment Act reaffirms the prohibition in the U.S.-     ratified Convention Against Torture against the use of      torture and cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment; the      U.S.-ratified Convention Against Torture prohibits all      torture and cruel, inhumane, and degrading treatment, and      general criminal laws such as federal statutes criminalize      conduct such as assaults by or against Americans in federal      facilities. These laws reflect American values, all in      statutes or treaties enacted or ratified under presidents      ranging from Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush.       However, Mukasey refuses to answer the straightforward      question of whether waterboarding is torture, and thereby      illegal. In a four-page response to ten members of the      Committee, Mukasey describes how he would decide the question      of whether waterboarding is torture, but he states the      question is ``hypothetical'' and that ``the actual facts and      circumstances are critical.'' The actual facts and      circumstances of waterboarding are brutal, but fairly simple.      Several senators described to Mukasey all of the elements of      waterboarding, as practiced over the centuries by      dictatorships, rogue nations, and war criminals--and as      prosecuted by the United States against war criminals.      Mukasey has the law, including the Anti-Torture Act and the      War Crimes Act, and all of the facts before him. After      decades as a Federal prosecutor and Federal judge, Mukasey      certainly has the capacity to answer the question of whether      waterboarding is torture.       In addition to undermining American values, Mukasey's      unwillingness to answer the question on whether waterboarding      is torture could threaten the security of Americans overseas.      In a little-noticed question-and-answer, Senator Kennedy      asked Mukasey, ``Do you think it would be lawful for another      country to subject an American to waterboarding, induced      hypothermia or heat stress, standing naked, the use of dogs,      beatings, including head slaps, or electric shocks?'' Mukasey      responded with his stock response that he cannot answer      hypotheticals, and that ``the actual facts and circumstances      are critical.'' This response was to a question on whether it      was illegal for a foreign country to shock, beat, and      waterboard an American citizen. The response provides no      assurance to American servicemen and servicewomen and      American intelligence personnel that the United States will      demand protection for them against foreign torturers.       This line of questioning is not hypothetical. The use of      waterboarding and other forms of torture was reportedly      discussed and approved based on discussions that occurred at      the highest levels of government, including participation by      aides to the President and Vice President. The result was      authorization of specific forms of torture and abuse, and a      permissive climate that fostered even more torture and abuse.      Federal Government documents obtained by the ACLU through our      Freedom of Information Act litigation and reports of the      International Committee of the Red Cross documented torture      or abuse against U.S.-held detainees, including acts such as      soaking a prisoner's hand in alcohol and setting it on fire,      administering electric shocks, subjecting prisoners to      repeated sexual abuse and assault, including sodomy with a      bottle, raping a juvenile prisoner, kicking and beating      prisoners in the head and groin, putting lit cigarettes      inside a prisoner's ear, force-feeding a baseball to a      prisoner, chaining a prisoner hands-to-feet in a fetal      position for 24 hours without food or water or access to a      toilet, and breaking a prisoner's shoulders.       Mukasey's equivocal responses to these questions on      waterboarding and other forms of torture and abuse reveal a      more fundamental and troubling problem with his views on the      scope of executive power--not only on torture--but on      government spying as well. Under the theory of executive      power Mukasey espoused, any restrictions on government spying      that Congress passes may be meaningless, since Mukasey      believes the president has power to engage in domestic      wiretapping without a warrant and outside the law. If an      Attorney General, whose mission is to enforce the law,      believes the President has the power to disregard the law,      our constitutional balance of powers is in peril.       A forthright answer to a question about torture is so      fundamental to restoring the rule of law that the Judiciary      Committee should not move Mukasey's nomination out of      committee unless he states that waterboarding and other      extreme interrogation tactics are torture. American values      and American security both depend on his answer.       Thank you for your attention to this matter, and please do      not hesitate to call us if you have any questions regarding      this issue.           Very truly yours,     Caroline Fredrickson,                                                         Director.     Christopher E. Ander,     Legislative Counsel.                                  ____                                               Washington, DC,                                                 November 5, 2007.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: On behalf      of the undersigned organizations, we write to express our      opposition to the confirmation of Judge Michael B. Mukasey to      the office of Attorney General. At his hearing and in his      responses to written questions, Judge Mukasey refused to      condemn waterboarding as torture, endorsed broad assertions      of executive authority, and failed to make firm commitments      to the enforcement of civil rights. For these reasons, we are      compelled to oppose his nomination.       What is urgently needed in our next Attorney General is an      unequivocal commitment to thoughtfully and independently      uphold the rule of law. However, on human and civil rights      issues, it is difficult to distinguish Judge Mukasey's views      from the controversial views of this Administration. It seems      certain that, after his careful avoidance of making      commitments that might be antithetical to the      Administration's interests, Judge Mukasey is either unwilling      to exercise the independence we need in our next Attorney      General on critical issues, or his views align perfectly with      those of the President.       On the issue of interrogation techniques, Judge Mukasey      acknowledged that the law holds that torture is unlawful, but      declined to state whether waterboarding is torture.      Waterboarding, a technique defined as the use of a wet towel      to induce the misperception of drowning, has been declared      unlawful by all four current Judge Advocate Generals of our      armed services. Judge Mukasey's condemnation of this      technique as ``repugnant,'' while true, is inconsequential;      what counts is his legal opinion of whether the practice is      torture. In spite of the fact that waterboarding is widely      classified by military officials and human rights experts as      unlawful torture, Judge Mukasey refused to answer this      question directly.       Judge Mukasey further endorsed a view of executive      authority that greatly expands the power of the President at      the expense of the other branches of government. Judge      Mukasey suggested he would allow the President to engage in      warrantless surveillance of persons in the United States in      violation of congressional laws. Indeed, he outlined a view      of the Constitution that privileged the view of the executive      branch over that of Congress on matters of constitutional      interpretation, making it possible for the President to      disregard the laws of Congress based on the President's      constitutional judgment.     In fact, under this view, the President's failure to enforce      a congressionally-enacted law would prevent the courts from      ever having an opportunity to weigh in, making the      President the final arbiter of constitutionality of our      laws.       Finally, with respect to questions regarding how he would      improve civil rights enforcement, Judge Mukasey offered      platitudes, but no firm commitments. Civil and voting rights      enforcement have been low priorities within the Department of      Justice, making it especially important that the next      Attorney General have a thorough understanding of our civil      rights laws and be committed to the vigorous and unbiased      enforcement of those laws. Judge Mukasey failed to offer      solutions to the extremely low number of cases brought by the      Civil Rights Division on behalf of women and minorities in      employment discrimination cases. On an issue as central to      the civil rights community as voting rights, Judge Mukasey      would not commit to the straightforward proposition that a      voter identification requirement that disproportionately      impacts minorities could violate Section 2 of the Voting      Rights Act. His responses to questions concerning civil and      voting rights enforcement evidenced little understanding of      the problems that currently plague the Civil Rights Division.       Nowhere is the Senate's constitutional role in reviewing a      presidential cabinet nominee more important than in the case      of a prospective Attorney General. Judge Mukasey has failed      to deliver on the expectation that he would be willing to      challenge this Administration's widely condemned human and      civil rights policies. As a result, there is serious doubt      about his suitability for the position of Attorney General      and about the impact his tenure would have on civil and human      rights in this country and elsewhere. Thus, we must urge you      to not confirm Judge Mukasey.       Thank you for your consideration.

Senator Patrick Leahy,     Chair, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Common Cause believes that it would be      a serious mistake for the Senate Judiciary Committee to      confirm Judge Michael Mukasey's nomination as attorney      general to replace Alberto Gonzales.       In his nomination hearings before the Senate Judiciary      Committee, Judge Mukasey provided evasive answers to critical      questions about whether ``waterboarding'' is torture,      feigning ignorance of the well-known procedure and dodging      the question when it was defined for him.       An attorney general's first job is to protect the rule of      law, not to protect a President. We have just seen the damage      caused when an attorney general places partisan loyalty above      law. The country cannot withstand more of such disregard for      the rule of law.       As the Committee knows--and now the American public knows      too well--waterboarding has been an infamous form of torture      dating back as far as the Spanish Inquisition. The United      States has both prosecuted waterboarding as a war crime when      used against our soldiers and court marshaled a U.S. military      officer who used it against our enemies, George Washington      University Professor Jonathan Turley wrote last week.       Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) stated that in conversations      with Judge Mukasey as late as Friday, Judge Mukasey assured      him that Congress could pass a law banning waterboarding and      other forms of torture and the President would have      absolutely no authority to ignore such a law. But, under the      Geneva Convention, adopted by the United States as law, it is      already against the law to use waterboarding.       Judge Mukasey's disingenuous responses about torture shows      a contempt for Congress and a disturbing willingness to turn      his back on the law when the alternative--acknowledging      illegal torture--could have troubling implications for the      President who nominated him.       This is unacceptable from a nominee to America's top law      enforcement position. And it is equally unacceptable for the      United States Congress to turn its back on its constitutional      duty.       Judge Mukasey's non-answers on torture do not stand alone.      We are equally concerned about his equivocations on the      President's power to conduct a secret program of warrantless      wiretapping, despite laws duly enacted by Congress and      protections afforded to all Americans by the Constitution.       It is the hope of the nation that a new attorney general      will be a fresh start for the Justice Department that      Gonzales tarnished through his partisanship and left in      tatters. That hope cannot be served by a nominee who begins      by dissembling over what the law is in order to protect the      Administration and the Justice Department from possible      unpleasant ramifications even before he has been confirmed.      It is difficult to see how such a nominee could repair the      integrity and reputation of the Justice Department, heighten      sagging morale or stem the exodus of career professionals      fleeing that agency.       Common Cause believes this is one of the most urgent issues      of our day: a President who usurps greater and greater powers      without regard for the law or Constitution, and a Congress      that stands idly by and lets it happen. Common Cause took a      stand when the actions of President Nixon threatened to      unravel America's democracy, and we take the same stand now.       The American people are watching what you do this week. The      whole world is watching. We need you to demand respect for      the rule of law, the Constitution, and the role of the United      States as a reliable world partner dedicated to international      justice. It is up to you to restore voters' confidence in the      vitality of America's democracy. And it is up to you to      safeguard our troops abroad, who become more vulnerable to      torture when we condone it.       Common Cause urges you to stand firm and vote against the      confirmation of Judge Mukasey as our next attorney general.      We urge you to turn the tide on abuse of executive power and      show America that they can depend on you to defend the      Constitution and the rule of law.           Sincerely,                                                        Bob Edgar,                                                President and CEO.
