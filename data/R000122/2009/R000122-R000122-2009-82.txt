But I think at this moment, what we want to see is this bill move forward to conference. I would love to work with the chairman and the ranking member on this issue. Also, I would expect that if these pilot projects for this year are fully evaluated, that next year, we take another hard and close look, if we cannot resolve it in conference, on the use of these funds for pilot programs.  Finally, again, we are fortunate because of the work of Senators Dorgan and Senator Bennett that we have a significant amount of weatherization money through the Recovery Act. But, again, I think we should have to insist that we maintain a good base fund, and I would hope we could do that going forward.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1     Hon. Daniel Inouye,     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations, Hart          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Byron Dorgan,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, U.S.          Senate Committee on Appropriations, Hart Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Inouye and Chairman Dorgan: The National      Association for State Community Services Programs (NASCSP)      represents the state administrators of the Weatherization      Assistance Program and the National Community Action      Foundation (NCAF) represents the local Community Action      Agencies that deliver the program's services. We are very      concerned about the language in the FY 2010 Committee Report,      which allocates $70 million for alternative and vaguely      specified uses to be determined by the Department of Energy.      Those funds could be used to weatherize nearly 11,000 low-     income homes. The disappointing appropriations level of $200      million itself is only 80% of President Obama's Request.      After the funding earmarked for alternative uses is taken      away from state allocations, just $130 million would remain      for the core program. This is the lowest program allocation      since 1998.       This diversion of funds from the core program suggests the      Committee lacks confidence in the burgeoning expansion of      Weatherization service delivery. We believe such fears are      not supported by the facts as laid out in the multi-year      plans recently approved for state Program growth under the      American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Many      states even plan to complete ARRA-funded work before the end      of PY 2010 and are counting on the `regular', appropriated      funds to prevent the collapse of the program and moderate the      loss of its workforce.       Further, we question the value of both of the alternative,      federally-run projects to be funded. One tests insulation in      older homes. Older homes already make up the vast majority of      housing stock weatherized today. Additionally, insulation is      just one component of a comprehensive weatherization project.      The intent of the program may be to test new insulation      materials developed by a manufacturer; in that case, a      dedicated program is unnecessary because the core program      provides a path for incorporating new technologies and      materials. Appendix A to Title 10, Part 440, Direct Final      Rule--Federal Register, June 22, 2006, specifies how test      results on materials are submitted to DOE technical review      and then placed on the approved list. However, if the project      is intended to test batt insulation manufacturers' suggestion      of an insulation-only program rather than a systematic      approach to the house as a system of space conditioning      systems and baseload usage, there are better ways. One would      be the long-delayed program evaluation of a sample of      thousands of homes where some will have received only      insulation. Another is to use the evaluations performed on      similar experiments conducted by utility DSM programs and to      incorporate the results into WAP practices.       The second pilot program, funds ``partnerships between the      Department and traditional and/or nontraditional      weatherization providers'' to increase private leveraged      funding. In other words the program is intended to act      without the states or local agencies that would, in the end,      need to test and adopt innovations. It is apparently to be a      new, direct federal Weatherization program with new delivery      agencies which would circumvent the statutory requirement to      use the experienced local network providers. It is not      necessary to earmark funding for leveraging activities, as      the statute allows substantial investment in activities to      leverage private funding; the millions won by Weatherizers in      utility rate-payer programs attest to the efficacy and      frequency of states' investments in innovative private      partnerships.       The Committee Report also suggests there should be a new      private funding match requirement for federal funds which is      not reflected in the re-authorization bill recently reported      by the Energy Committee. We question the practicality of this      requirement and believe hearings on the proposal's impact      would be appropriate.       Thank you for considering our concerns regarding this      matter.           Sincerely,     Timothy R. Warfield,       Executive Director, National Association for State      Community Service Programs.     David Bradley,       Executive Director, National Community Action Foundation.
