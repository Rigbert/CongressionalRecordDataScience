Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2302. This legislation will extend the program under which alien doctors can avoid having to return home for 2 years by agreeing to practice in medically underserved areas here in America.  Aliens who participate in medical residencies in the United States on a ``J'' visa program visa must generally leave the United States after the completion of their residencies to reside abroad for 2 years. The intent behind the policy is to encourage American-trained foreign doctors to return home to improve health conditions that advance the medical profession in their native countries.  In 1994, Congress created a waiver of the 2-year foreign residence requirement. State departments of public health may request a waiver for foreign doctors who commit to practicing medicine for no less than 3 years in geographic areas designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services as having a shortage of health care professionals. The number of foreign doctors who can receive the waiver is limited to 30 per State each year. The waiver has proven to be an important means of ensuring quality medical care in areas of the United States with physician shortages.  S. 2302 is substantially similar to H.R. 4453, a bill introduced by the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran) that this body passed by voice vote on October 6. It will extend the waiver program to June 2006. It will also allow each State to place five of the doctors it sponsors each year in areas not designated by HHS as physician shortage areas. The bill continues the practice of allowing foreign doctors receiving waivers to receive H-1B visas regardless of the annual H-1B visa quota. Finally, the bill clarifies that doctors receiving waivers can practice specialty medicine. However, when a doctor works in a specialty, there must exist a shortage of health care professionals able to provide services in that specialty to the patients he or she will serve.  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, this time I will insert into the Record an exchange of jurisdictional letters between the chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton), and myself.                                    U.S. House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                Washington, DC, November 16, 2004.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. House of          Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner: This week the House is      scheduled to consider S. 2302 under suspension of the rules.       S. 2302, as passed by the Senate, contains language, which      provides for exemptions to section 214(l)(1)(D) of the      Immigration and Nationality Act, involving the Secretary of      Health and Human Services. As you know, Rule X of the Rules      of the House of Representatives gives the Committee on Energy      and Commerce jurisdiction over public health.       I recognize your desire to bring this legislation before      the House in an expeditious manner. Accordingly, I will not      exercise my Committee's right to a referral. By agreeing to      waive its consideration of the bill, however, the Energy and      Commerce Committee does not waive its jurisdiction over S.      2302. In addition, the Energy and Commerce Committee reserves      its right to seek conferees on any provisions of the bill      that are within its jurisdiction during any House-Senate      conference that may be convened on this legislation. I ask      for your commitment to support any request by the Energy and      Commerce Committee for conferees on S. 2302 or similar      legislation.       I request that you include this letter and your response in      the Record during consideration of the bill. Thank you for      your attention to these matters.           Sincerely,                                                       Joe Barton,     Chairman.                                  ____                                    U.S. House of Representatives,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                Washington, DC, November 17, 2004.     Hon. Joe Barton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Barton: Thank you for your letter regarding      S. 2302, a bill to improve access to physicians in medically      underserved areas. Subsection 1(d) of the bill reduces the      number of slots assigned to underserved areas that are      designated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. To      the extent they affect duties of the Secretary, these      provisions fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the      Committee on Energy and Commerce. I appreciate your      willingness to forgo consideration of the bill, and I      acknowledge that by agreeing to waive its consideration of      the bill, the Committee on Energy and Commerce does not waive      its jurisdiction over these provisions.       I will include a copy of your letter and this response in      the Congressional Record during consideration of S. 2032 on      the House floor.       Thank you for your assistance in this matter.           Sincerely,                                      F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,                                                         Chairman.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
