I know she led the fight in her home State of North Carolina before she came here to the Senate.  I wish to ask the Senator from North Carolina, is it not true we passed a law a few years ago to protect military families from being exploited by these same lenders, arguing that, here we are, investing all this money in training and preparing men and women to serve in our military, and then they are ensnared by these payday loan operations, they find themselves at their wit's end, they cannot make their payments, they are facing bankruptcy, and many of them had to take leave or be discharged from the military because of these miserable payday loan operations? Is it not true we passed a law protecting military families from this kind of predatory lending a few years ago?
