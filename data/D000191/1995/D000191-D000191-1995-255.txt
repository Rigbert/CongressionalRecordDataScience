  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, a school principal in my district told me of children lined up at the door of one of our neighborhood schools on a Monday morning, not because they were so anxious to learn, but because they were hungry. Their school breakfast was to be their first hot meal since school lunch on Friday, 2\1/2\ days without a hot meal.  Those hungry kids are just going to have to go a little bit longer if the Republican cuts in the Nutrition Programs and the School Lunch Programs go through. They tell us it is just the administrative costs, they just want to eliminate the Federal bureaucrats to the cook in the local school, that would be 4 percent of the costs. Their cuts are seven times the administrative costs.  Mr. Speaker, just a little decrease or increase in the price of food? More eligible hungry kids? The Republicans have an answer for that: Give them smaller portions, that is the Republican plan. Two centuries ago Marie Antoinette said ``Let them eat cake.'' Today's Gingrich revolutionaries say ``Let them eat block grants.''                          ____________________
