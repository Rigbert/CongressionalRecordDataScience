 But from your side of the aisle, starting in 2004, all I heard was there was too much choice, too much choice, too many plans.  So I do not know for sure if you and your party know where you are coming from, whether choice is OK, how much choice is OK. Maybe you are leading us down the line where we are going to end up, if you get too much Government interference, we will not have choice.
