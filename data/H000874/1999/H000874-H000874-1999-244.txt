 Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this resolution. Our young men and women in the Armed Forces are carrying out their duties with courage and professionalism, and they deserve our praise and our complete support.  In my view, however, it is not enough to support our military in carrying out the mission given to them. I rise, as well, Mr. Speaker, to support the very mission itself. The mission is to save lives, to stabilize a region, to save lives that certainly would be lost if we again delayed taking this decisive action. The reports about what Serbian forces were doing in Kosovo in the last few days are clearly horrendous, the separation of men from women and children, the reported mass execution of the former and desperate flight of the latter.  The mission is also asserting U.S. leadership when Europe needs that leadership. Our allies are with us and they need us. Like it or not, Europe cannot and does not do it alone. It is in our national interest to avoid even the perception of a vacuum in our leadership capabilities. That could lead to challenges which we cannot foresee now, which we cannot predict, but clearly which would likely put our military men and women at even greater risk if allowed to happen.  Mr. Speaker, everyone says that we cannot be the world's policeman and I agree. But when there is a need for action and when that action can so clearly be effective and when the military can use its resources to minimize the risks involved, then we should act. Tyrants around the world cannot and must not have the false impression of knowing that we will not go after them because we cannot go after everyone. The fact that we could respond should give them pause.  Mr. Speaker, I have been one on this floor who in years past have said in Bosnia that we should have acted. In my opinion had we in Europe acted sooner, thousands, yes, tens of thousands of lives may have been saved.  I support the troops. I support the mission.
