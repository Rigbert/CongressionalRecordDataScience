 President, I am pleased to join Senator Baucus in cosponsoring the Investment Competitiveness Act of 1996, legislation that will correct a provision in the Internal Revenue Code that currently makes it difficult to sell mutual funds outside the United States.  I believe Congress has an obligation to implement public policies that encourage investments in U.S. companies. These investments are essential to raising capital, initiating research and development, expanding our Nation's economy and ultimately improving our international competitiveness.  Our current Tax Code deters foreign investors from investing in U.S. mutual funds by treating interest income and short-term capital gain as a dividend that is subject to a 30-percent withholding tax. On the other hand, a foreign investor can invest in other foreign funds or directly in U.S. securities without paying this tax.  Mr. President, the U.S. mutual fund industry has grown significantly over the past 6-years. Since 1990, U.S. mutual fund assets have grown from $1 trillion to more than $3 trillion. This rapid growth has occurred despite the fact that foreign investment in U.S. funds has stayed roughly the same.  Rather than dissuading foreign investment, we should be encouraging foreign investment in U.S. funds and companies. Quite simply, American companies are put at a disadvantage by a Tax Code that encourages foreign investors to invest in other countries and other companies.  More importantly, our Tax Code forces U.S. mutual fund companies to set up subsidiary funds overseas in order to reach the world marketplace. For instance, the Frank Russell Co. in Tacoma, WA, is a highly successful and innovative mutual fund company that employs more than 1,000 people. Unfortunately, in order to serve the world market, the company has been forced to move its expertise and some jobs overseas. In doing so, foreign investors can avoid the U.S. withholding tax.  Mr. President, it makes no sense to continue a tax policy that both encourages our companies to move jobs overseas and hampers our ability to attract foreign investment and raise capital in the United States.  I am pleased to be working with Senators Baucus and Gorton on this important legislation, and I am hopeful Congress can act quickly on this legislation.                          ____________________
