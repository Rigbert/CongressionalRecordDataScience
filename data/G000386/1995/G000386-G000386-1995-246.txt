  The Pentagon will promise reform, pledge self-policing, and get right back to writing bad checks.  This is what worries me, Mr. President.  Some of my colleagues would like to give the Pentagon some extra money, so the Pentagon bureaucrats can write more bad checks.  This is the very problem I spoke about on the floor last Friday.  Last Friday I came to the floor to express concern about a new policy being pushed by the Comptroller at the Department of Defense [DOD], Mr. John Hamre.  Mr. Hamre is proposing to write off billions of dollars of unmatchable disbursements.  Unmatchable disbursements are payments which he claims cannot be linked to supporting documentation.  In my mind, Mr. President, the plan would set a dangerous precedent and underscores the continuing lack of effective internal financial controls at the Pentagon.  My speech last Friday merely expressed concerns and raised questions about the new policy.  Well, at the conclusion of my statement, my friend from Arizona, Senator McCain, and my friend from Maine, Senator Cohen, launched an unwarranted attack on what I had said.  I feel as though their criticism was misdirected. It misinterpreted and mischaracterized what I had said.  Unfortunately, I was participating in the Canada-United States Interparliamentary Group meeting in Canada and had to run to catch an airplane.  I was unable to respond to their critical remarks on Friday.  I would like to do that now.  Mr. President, I would now like to clarify for Senator Cohen's understanding of what I actually said about the IRS. Had his recollection of what I said been clear, he would have known that he and I are in total agreement on the management flaws at IRS.  Senator Cohen seemed to think that I was holding up the IRS as some kind of model accounting bureau for Pentagon bureaucrats to copy.  That was not my point at all. Nothing could be further from the truth.  In fact, I am as frequent a critic of the way the IRS manages the peoples' money as he is.  What I was suggesting in my comments was that the plan to write off billions of dollars of unmatchable disbursements would be an insult to the taxpayers.  This is what I said:       This money was taken out of the pockets of hard working      American taxpayers, and the Pentagon bureaucrats say it is      just too much trouble to find out how their money was spent.       Could you imagine how the IRS would treat a citizen who      claimed to have no documentation for $100,000 of income? The      IRS would say: We know you got the money. You pay the tax.      Period. End of discussion.       We should hold the Pentagon bureaucrats to the same      standard that the IRS holds the taxpayers to. The DOD should      have to play by the same rules imposed on the taxpayers.       We should tell the Pentagon bureaucrats: We know you      received $10 billion in appropriations. Now, how did you      spend it? No extra money until we get the answer.  Mr. President, this is the point I was trying to make.  The IRS is relentless and thorough in collecting tax money from the people.  I want the Pentagon bureaucrats to be just as relentless and just as thorough in controlling and accounting for the expenditure of the peoples' money as the IRS is in collecting it.  I would now like to turn to Senator McCain's remarks.  I take strong exception to what was said by the Senator from Arizona.  Mr. McCain suggested that I ``enjoy savaging'' the Pentagon for shortcomings and deficiencies but never offer ``viable solutions.'' First of all, I do not remember ever making a critique of DOD's management without offering a solution, contrary to my friend's flippant remark.  On Friday, I made two very specific recommendations for handling the new policy.  I would like to restate those two recommendations. I said:       We in the Congress should not approve this plan until two      stringent conditions are met:       Number 1: Those responsible must be held accountable for      what has happened; Heads must roll.       Number 2: A new DOD policy should be put in place that      specifies: Effective January 1, 1996, all DOD disbursements      must be matched with obligations and supporting accounting      records before a payment is made.  Mr. President, as I said on Friday, these two recommendations will help to strengthen and reinforce section 8137 of the fiscal year 1995 DOD Appropriations Act--Public Law 103-335. Senator Stevens acknowledged my proposed solution in a hearing on this issue May 23 before his Defense Subcommittee.  Section 8137 was a carefully crafted piece of legislation designed to correct the unmatched disbursement problem at the Pentagon.  It was a phased approach I developed in close cooperation with the DOD Comptroller, Mr. Hamre.  Section 8137 specifies that by July 1, 1995, a disbursement in excess of $5 million must be matched with appropriate accounting documents before the payment is made.  Then, under the law, the mandatory matching threshold is lowered to $1 million on October 1, 1995.  My amendment was adopted by the Senate on August 11, 1994.  The next day I received a warm, handwritten thank you note from Mr. Hamre. I would like to read it. I quote:       I would like to thank you for sponsoring the amendment      requiring DOD to match disbursements with accounting records      prior to actual disbursement of funds. I especially      appreciate your willingness to work with me to adopt your      amendment to ensure we could implement it in the least      disruptive manner. You will be very proud of the long-term      benefit it will produce in our business practices.  Mr. President, to my friend from Arizona, I say: I have been working hard to fix this problem. I do not claim to have the answer but I am searching for it.  And the recommendations I made on Friday are the logical next step to the phased approach contained in section 8137 of the law.  They would lower the threshold to zero, effective January 1, 1996.  Let me also say to my friend from Arizona that my recommendations are fully consistent with current DOD policy.  To back up that point, I would like to quote from Mr. Hamre's letter of May 5, 1995, to Senator Glenn where the plan to write off unmatchable disbursements was first revealed to the public.  I quote from the Hamre letter: ``We have adopted a policy that we will not disburse funds until we pre-match them to the accounting records.''  That is recommendation No. 2 in Friday's speech.  Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arizona that I have been working diligently to fix the problem.  I have already helped to develop one viable solution and am working on another.  Right now, I am working with the Comptroller General, Chuck Bowsher, to find a more comprehensive solution to the Pentagon's accounting problems.  Mr. President, sometimes in the heat of debate, our arguments and proposed solutions fall on deaf ears.  I would caution my friend from Arizona to listen to the arguments before blindly dismissing them.  Unless that is done, the credibility of one's opposition is lost.  Mr. President, I would like to add one new idea to the discussion.  I do not believe the use of the word ``writeoff'' accurately describes what DOD is proposing to do.  Normally, the word ``writeoff'' is used to describe a procedure for canceling from accounts a legitimate business loss.  What Mr. Hamre is proposing to do is write off billions of dollars of unauthorized payments. [[Page S7632]]   A payment that cannot be linked to supporting documentation is an unauthorized payment. It may not be legitimate.  Without documentation, we do not know how the money was used.  That is my concern, Mr. President.  Mr. President, Pentagon bureaucrats have an unblemished record of mismanaging the peoples' money.  Now, is it smart to give a bureaucratic institution like the Pentagon that cannot control and account for the use of public money more public money--as some of my colleagues propose?  DOD should not get any extra money until it cleans up the books.  More money is not the answer. Better management is.                            ____________________
