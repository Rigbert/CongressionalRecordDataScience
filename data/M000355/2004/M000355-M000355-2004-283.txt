 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 709, S. 2826, the District of Columbia appropriations bill; that the bill be read a third time; that the Appropriations Committee then be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 4850, the House-passed DC appropriations bill, and the Senate proceed to its consideration.  I further ask unanimous consent that all after the enacting clause of H.R. 4850 be stricken; the text of S. 2826 be inserted in lieu thereof; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on behalf of the Senate.  Finally, I ask unanimous consent that S. 2826 then be returned to the calendar.
