Speaker, in America, we expect no one to be above the law. But, what happens if someone is super rich and breaks the law?  Today, I rise to place on the Record a demand that the President-elect's Cabinet nominee for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos of Michigan, immediately pay fines she owes to the State of Ohio.  These obligations total $5.3 million, just as Congresswoman Joyce Beatty stated in her opening statement, and also Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, who will speak subsequent to my own remarks. This is an enormous amount of money owed to the State of Ohio in unpaid fines and levied late penalties for Ms. DeVos' political organization for campaign finance violations in Ohio. They broke Ohio law. These are the largest fines ever levied in Ohio history, dating back to 2008. Essentially, the political organization Ms. DeVos led violated Ohio's election laws.  Betsy DeVos of Michigan was in charge of the political action committee known as All Children Matter, based in Virginia. During her chairwomanship, she broke Ohio's election laws which impose spending donation limits of $10,000 per candidate. She, in fact, violated those limits by funneling national PAC money, over $870,000 of it, to Ohio's State candidates--incidentally, all Republican candidates.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record these names and the amounts of money they received.
