 President, let me say briefly, the majority leader has it entirely right, we are in the process of discussing a consent agreement under which the Webb amendment would be voted upon and the alternative, which will be offered by Senator Lindsey Graham, who will be over to speak shortly.  Hopefully, we will be able to work that out and begin to make progress on the bill.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
