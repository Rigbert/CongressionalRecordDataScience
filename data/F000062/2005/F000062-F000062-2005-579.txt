 President, Today I rise to commemorate the 46th Anniversary of the Tibetan Uprising of 1959.  It is my sincere hope that both the Chinese government and the Tibetan leaders might use this opportunity to reflect on the importance of pursuing a viable, long-term solution that provides the Tibetan people the right to enjoy religious, cultural, and social autonomy as part of the People's Republic of China.  This anniversary marks a sad, but important day in the history of the Tibetan people.  In 1951, two years after the People's Liberation Army first entered Tibet, Chinese government representatives and Tibetan leaders signed what has been called the 17 Point Agreement.  This agreement, among other things, included the promise of Tibetan religious, cultural, and social autonomy, and preserved the institution of the Dalai Lama.  Sadly, the Chinese government failed to uphold these promises and attempted to force ``revolutionary socialist reforms'' upon the Tibet people and leadership. This ultimately culminated in the 1959 Lhasa Uprising which saw tens of thousands of Tibetans killed and forced the Dalai Lama and many others to flee to India.  Today human rights abuses continue against Tibetans wishing to practice their religion or promote their unique cultural and historical identity. Hundreds have been imprisoned in Tibet, and tens of thousands more have had to flee their homeland.  Nevertheless, the Dalai Lama remains steadfast in his desire to find a long-lasting and viable solution that will provide freedom and autonomy for the Tibetan people without pursuing independence.  In a speech today to mark this 46th anniversary, he stated:       We remain fully committed to the Middle Way Approach of not      seeking independence for Tibet and are willing to remain      within the People's Republic of China.  He also praised the economic progress and development that has taken place in Tibet over the past 40 years, including the new railroad link that will begin operation this year.  I have personally worked for well over two decades to try and bring both the Chinese government and Tibetan leadership together in a spirit of cooperation and dialogue to overcome the differences that have impeded progress on a solution for Tibet. And after many conversations with the Dalai Lama, I am fully convinced that he is sincere in his promise not to pursue a separate path for Tibet.  To that end, several times over the years I have carried messages from the Dalai Lama to Beijing and communicated regularly with Jiang Zemin and other Chinese officials on the importance of establishing dialogue on the Tibet issue.  I have also been pleased to see that discussions between the Dalai Lama's envoys and Chinese officials have resumed and that a third round of meetings took place last September in Beijing.  It is my hope that both sides will build upon these meetings and that President Hu, with his knowledge and understanding of the Tibetan people, will come to appreciate the international goodwill that would be fostered by his willingness to meet with the Dalai Lama and pursue a reasonable solution to the Tibet issue.  Despite the slow pace of progress over the years, I remain confident that if the Chinese leadership will only sit down with the Dalai Lama and listen openly to his views, that a sustainable solution providing for the preservation of the distinctive identity, religious and cultural heritage for the Tibetan people can be found.                          ____________________[Page S2480]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    THE TIBETAN DAY OF COMMEMORATION
