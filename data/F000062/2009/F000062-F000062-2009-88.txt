 The fact is, we would lose opportunities to conserve valuable lands because within national parks there are inholdings, and inholdings, when they become available--these are private properties that people own--the Federal Government buys them and adds to the public land. Let me name a few: In Georgia, I am told the Chattahoochee National Recreation Area would be involved; in many States, Civil War battlefield sites; in Ohio, the Cuyahoga Valley National Park; in the State of Washington, Mount Rainier, Olympic, and San Juan National Parks; in Texas, Big Thicket National Preserve; in Indiana, the Hoosier National Forest; in Utah, Dixie National Forest; in South Dakota, the Black Hills National Forest.  The point I wish to make is, on occasion, there are families who have large land holdings, and these are valuable, pristine land holdings. Their first preference might be to have the Federal Government buy these lands to hold them for the future and to conserve the lands. If the Federal Government can't do that, the lands go on the market, generally, for the highest and best use. With some of our prized and treasured possessions, that is not the way to go.  I will oppose this amendment. I am sure it will be in line for a vote.
