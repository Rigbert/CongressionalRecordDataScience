Speaker, a good friend is retiring in Michigan and I wanted to share a letter that the Michigan delegation sent to John Lobbia, CEO of Detroit Edison Company.     Mr. John E. Lobbia     Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, The Detroit Edison          Company, 2000 2nd Avenue, Detroit, Michigan       Dear Mr. Lobbia. On behalf of the entire Michigan      Congressional Delegation, it is a great honor for us to wish      you a long, healthy, and happy retirement. Congratulations on      the completion of an outstanding career.       Under your guidance, Detroit Edison has emerged as a      national leader, known for its quality, competitiveness, and      innovation. More than two million Michigan homes and      businesses count on Detroit Edison for their energy needs.      Your success at meeting those demands has helped to power      Michigan through its economic renaissance and emerge as one      of the nation's most successful states.       But we recognize that many of the milestones of your career      occurred outside Detroit Edison. Your unwavering support for      a number of civic and community organizations has left an      indelible mark on our state. Clearly, your caring and support      of our community runs deep--the mark of a true leader.       Again, congratulations on your many years of service to      Detroit Edison and to Michigan. With respect and admiration      we remain,           Very truly yours,     Fred Upton,       Member of Congress.     John Dingell,       Member of Congress.                                 ____________________
