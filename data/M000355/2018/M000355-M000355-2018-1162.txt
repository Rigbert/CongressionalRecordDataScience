 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 10 a.m., Thursday, June 7; further, that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and morning business be closed. I further ask that following leader remarks, the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of the Marcus nomination, under the previous order, with the time until 12:30 p.m. equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; finally, that at 12:30 p.m., all debate time on the nomination be expired and the Senate vote on confirmation of the Marcus nomination with no intervening action or debate.
