 President, I would like to pay tribute to a politician whose record refutes every negative interpretation of that word and whose life personifies the true meaning of the words ``public service.'' In Everett, WA, Liz McLaughlin--affectionately known as Ms. Liz--has announced she will retire this year after nearly a decade on the Snohomish County Council and a lifetime of citizen activism--although the latter will no doubt continue.  Liz was appointed to the Snohomish County Council in 1986, and it is no surprise that in her first special election and two subsequent reelections to this office, she never had a challenger. She was unbeatable because citizens knew and trusted her.  Liz started to meet community needs many years ago by working in the Family Life Program at Everett Community College, showing early promise of her future accomplishments and leadership in children's and family issues. In 1979 she went to work for Congressman Al Swift where, as the full-time representative of the Congressman, she worked closely with people and federal agencies, as well as local and government projects which affected the whole community. And the people who met Liz throughout those years attest to the fact that beyond her official and professional duties there was always the warm, personal, and caring quality that made her a true public servant.  After election to the county council, Liz focused on legislation which would affect families' and children's lives. She is proudest of her work in human services and was instrumental in establishing innovative programs like Dispute Resolution Centers; Family Support Centers; the Public Housing Trust Fund, which sets aside city and county funds for low-income seniors and people with special needs; and the North Sound Regional Support Network, a five-county association bringing mental health dollars to the local community to keep consumers close to their families. Legislation she authored was passed state-wide to provide a permanent funding source for family and dispute resolution centers.  As might be expected, she chairs the county council's health and human services committee, and also serves on the public works utilities committee. She is vice president of the Washington State Association of Counties Western Region, serves on the WSAC legislative steering committee, the Snohomish County Housing Trust Fund Advisory Board, the Board of Health, and the National Association of Counties Education and Labor Committee.  In addition to her council boards, she has served as board president for Everett Community College Foundation. Board member for Providence General Medical Center, and co-chair of the Human Services Council Partnership Forum. She has served as a director or member of numerous social service organizations and committees.  The daughter of Swedish immigrants, Liz was born and raised in Monroe, WA, and has lived in Everett for 45 years. Liz and her husband, Don, who is retired from Weyerhauser, have two grown sons and two grandchildren. Liz's announcement of retirement was met with expressions of regret and loss from her colleagues and constituents, but they understand that she deserves more private time with her own family and, I am sure, some new challenges.  I believe Liz chose politics as a way to accomplish community good on a larger scale than was possible as a lone caring individual. A strong believer in the two party system, she has long been active in her own Democratic Party, but always respected and was respected by her friends in the Republican Party. She did not lose her civility nor her sensitivity to other points of view. And she never forgot her personal responsibility to her constituents. A fellow councilwoman, Karen Miller, says: ``She always looked at how what we did would affect people in their day-to-day living.''  Ms. Liz, I salute you. In these days of intense cynicism about politics and politicians, your career stands out as a shining example of what a politician can accomplish and can be. You provide a model, in your motivation and in your performance, for all who seek to be entrusted with the public trust.                          ____________________
