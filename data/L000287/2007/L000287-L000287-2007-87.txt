Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may consume.  I rise in support of H.R. 1906. No one, but no one will pay more taxes under the bill. It merely ensures that multi-millionaires don't add to our tax gap.  The bill changes in a very minor way estimated tax payments made by wealthy individuals with incomes of more than $5 million a year. It makes a technical timing change to tax payments made by these individuals. They do not pay more taxes. H.R. 1906 is critical to the pay-as-you-go pledge of this Congress.  I am pleased to have supported H.R. 1905, the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2007. For 207 years, Washington, D.C. residents have paid Federal taxes, and for 207 years they have had not a voting representative in the United States Congress.  The right to vote is precious. It is sacred. It is the cornerstone of our democracy.  Americans sacrificed everything for this right. They were harassed, beaten, jailed and even killed for the right to vote.  Not so long ago, many of my friends, many of my colleagues lost their lives. There are many more faceless, nameless heroes who suffered and sacrificed for this basic right.  How can we preach this principle around the world and not practice it here in our Nation's Capital? It is the foundation of our democracy.  So I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1906.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
