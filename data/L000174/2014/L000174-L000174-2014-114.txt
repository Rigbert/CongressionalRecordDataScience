President, today, we will vote to end the filibuster againstthe nomination of Pamela Harris to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. She is a highly accomplished lawyer with excellent legal credentials and has the strong support of her home State Senators, Senator Mikulski and Senator Cardin. Her nomination received the American Bar Association's highest rating of unanimously ``well qualified''.  Pam Harris is currently a visiting professor at my alma mater, Georgetown University Law Center. In her diverse career she has served in the Office of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice, as a partner in private practice, as a professor at University of Pennsylvania Law School, and the executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown. After graduating from Yale Law School, she served as a law clerk to Judge Harry Edwards on the DC Circuit and Justice John Paul Stevens on the U.S. Supreme Court. She is beyond qualified--an experienced appellate practitioner with background in both criminal and civil litigation and a command of the law that rivals that of any lawyer in the United States.  Some partisans have tried to misrepresent her past statements in order to caricature her. This account of her record is simply unrecognizable to those individuals who actually know Pam Harris and who know that as a judge she would be committed to the rule of law. Many lawyers who have practiced with Pam Harris have written in support of her nomination, including many prominent Republicans who are respected in the legal community.  One letter, signed by more than 80 of her professional peers, including Gregory Garre, the former U.S. Solicitor General for President George W. Bush, reads, ``We are lawyers from diverse backgrounds and varying affiliations, but we are united in our admiration for Pam's skills as a lawyer and our respect for her integrity, her intellect, her judgment, and her fair-mindedness.''  Another letter of support from a number of current and former partners at O'Melveny and Myers LLP, including A.B. Culvahouse, who served as White House Counsel during the Reagan administration, and Walter Dellinger, who served as Assistant Attorney General of the Office of Legal Counsel and Acting U.S. Solicitor General during the Clinton administration, reads, ``Although we may not all share Pam's views on a range of legal and political issues, we are united in the belief that Pam possesses the intellect, fair-mindedness, humility, and fundamental decency to make an excellent federal judge.''  I ask that these and other letters of support received for Pam Harris' nomination be printed in the Record.  When asked about her judicial philosophy at her nomination hearing she testified that ``the role of a judge is to decide cases through impartial application of law and precedent. It is a limited role . . . they decide the concrete disputes in front of them with attention to particular facts, attention to the arguments of the parties and their briefs, and by applying law and precedent to those facts.''  Both her testimony and the letters of bipartisan support for her nomination demonstrate that Pam Harris has a clear understanding of the role of a judge and make clear her commitment to follow Supreme Court precedent and to uphold the Constitution. I believe Pam Harris will be an outstanding judge, and she has my full support. I urge all Senators to vote to end this filibuster and confirm Pam Harris to serve on the Fourth Circuit.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    June 20, 2014.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We write      in strong support of the nomination of Pamela A. Harris to      the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and      urge prompt consideration and confirmation of her nomination.       As her classmates in the Yale Law School Class of 1990, we      have known Pam for more than 25 years. We all believe that      Pam would be a tremendous asset to the appellate bench.       In law school, Pam stood out for her keen intellect, her      grasp of legal issues, her intellectual curiosity, her      integrity and her fair-mindedness. Because of those      qualities, Pam was often able to forge bonds and build      consensus among classmates with very different views.       Many of us have kept in touch with Pam since law school and      are familiar with her outstanding legal career. Pam's breadth      of experience makes her exceptionally well-suited to serve as      a judge on the federal appeals court. After law school, Pam      clerked for two distinguished jurists, Judge Harry. T.      Edwards of the United States Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia Circuit, and Justice John Paul Stevens      of the United States Supreme Court. Since then, Pam has      served in the United States Department of Justice,      represented businesses and other clients in private practice,      taught such subjects as constitutional law and appellate      practice as a law professor, and served on the boards of      directors of both national and local legal and educational      organizations.       Of particular relevance to the Court of Appeals, Pam is a      recognized national expert in appellate advocacy, having      served as Executive Director of the Georgetown Law Center's      Supreme Court Institute and Co-Director of Harvard Law      School's Supreme Court and Appellate Practice Clinic.       Pam has devoted a significant portion of her career to pro      bono work. She has represented numerous nonprofit and public      interest organizations as well as individuals. Pam served as      Co-Chair of the Amicus Committee of the National Association      of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and she established a pro bono      program at the law firm O'Melveny & Myers, focusing on      Maryland cases, where she handled cases herself and      supervised and mentored junior lawyers. Pam has mentored law      students and junior lawyers throughout her career. She      received a prestigious legal teaching award at the University      of Pennsylvania Law School and has been recognized as a      popular and highly respected professor at Penn, Georgetown      and Harvard Law Schools. Pam grew up in Bethesda, Maryland,      and graduated at the top of her class from Walt Whitman High      School there. For the last 15 years, Pam and her family have      lived in Potomac, Maryland, just a few miles away from her      childhood home. Pam is as invested in her community as she is      in appellate practice, serving in roles that range from      membership on the Board of Trustees at the Norwood School to      ``cookie mom'' for her daughter's Girl Scout troop.       We believe Pam to be exceptionally well-qualified and well-     suited to serve on the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. We      urge the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate to promptly      review and confirm Pamela Harris for a position on that      Court.       Please do not hesitate to contact any of us if you have any      questions.           Sincerely,     (Signed by 82 Individuals)                                  ____                                  National Women's Law Center,                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2014.     Re Nomination of Pamela Harris to the United States Court of          Appeals for the Fourth Circuit     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,          Washington, DC.     Senator Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Grassley: on behalf of the National      Women's Law Center (the ``Center''), an organization that has      worked since 1972 to advance and protect women's legal      rights, we write in strong support of the nomination of      Pamela Harris to the United States Court of Appeals for the      Fourth Circuit.       Ms. Harris is exceedingly well-qualified to serve on this      important court. She graduated from Yale College and Yale Law      School. She clerked for Judge Harry T. Edwards on the United      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit,      and for Associate Justice John Paul Stevens on the United      States Supreme Court. Following her clerkships, Ms. Harris      served as an Attorney-Advisor in the Office of Legal Counsel      at the United States Department of Justice for two years      before joining the faculty at the University of Pennsylvania      Law School, where she received the Harvey Levin Memorial      Teaching Award in 1998. Ms. Harris then joined the law firm      of O'Melveny & Myers LLP as counsel, becoming a partner in      2005. During her ten years with O'Melveny & Myers, Ms. Harris      served as the Co-Director of the Harvard Law School Supreme      Court and Appellate Practice Clinic, and taught at Georgetown      University Law Center as a visiting professor. In 2009, she      left O'Melveny & Myers and joined the Georgetown University      Law Center as the Executive Director of the Supreme Court      Institute. In 2010, she became the Principal Deputy to the      Assistant Attorney General in the Office of Legal Policy at      the United States Department of Justice. She rejoined the      Georgetown faculty as a visiting professor of law in 2012.       Ms. Harris' legal career reflects excellence, a dedication      to public service, and the best contributions of the legal      profession to the public interest. During her career, Ms.      Harris has appeared in over 100 federal appellate cases, and      argued before the Supreme Court. This record reflects her      considerable experience, and the brilliant advocacy for which      she is properly renowned. In addition to honing her skills as      an exceptionally talented litigator in the private sector,      Ms.     Harris has spent a good part of her career in government      service and in teaching aspiring lawyers. Further, Ms. Harris      has shown her dedication to the public interest and to      improving the administration of justice throughout her      career. While at O'Melveny & Myers, she had a robust pro bono      practice and established a cooperative program between      O'Melveny and the Maryland Office of the Public Defender,      through which the firm represents indigent criminal      defendants appealing their convictions in state court. She      also has worked to improve the quality of appellate advocacy      as co-director of Harvard Law School's appellate advocacy      clinic and as Director of Georgetown's Supreme Court      Institute. In that latter capacity, she led the work of the      Institute, which provides pro bono assistance preparing      advocates for oral argument before the Supreme Court on a      first-come, first-served basis, to elevate the quality of      arguments heard by the Justices. In addition to her      contributions to the legal profession in private practice,      public service, and academia, Ms. Harris has served on the      boards of directors of several nonprofit organizations,      including the Norwood School in Potomac, Maryland. Ms.      Harris' many accomplishments are reflected by the unanimous      ``Well-Qualified'' rating she received from the ABA Standing      Committee on the Federal Judiciary.       The Center has had several opportunities to work with Ms.      Harris. In particular, Ms. Harris served as co-counsel with      the Center in representing Mr. Roderick Jackson before the      Supreme Court in 2005, in Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Ed.,      544 U.S. 167 (2005). Mr. Jackson was a teacher and girls'      basketball coach in Birmingham, Alabama. He described      practice and game conditions for the girls' team that were      inferior to those provided to the boys' team, and complained      to school administrators. He was fired as a coach after doing      so, costing him his coaching salary and full retirement. Ms.      Harris was part of the legal team that litigated his case      before the Supreme Court, successfully arguing that Title IX      provided a cause of action for retaliation for those seeking      to secure compliance with the law. Working with Ms. Harris in      Jackson allows us to personally attest to her outstanding      legal skills, judgment, and analytical thinking, as well as      to her excellent temperament and collegiality.       Ms. Harris' litigation experience, commitment to improving      the administration of justice, and dedication to the public      interest make her exceedingly well-suited for the position to      which she has been nominated. In addition, Ms. Harris'      confirmation would increase the diversity on the Fourth      Circuit, making her only the sixth female judge to ever sit      on this court. For all of these reasons, the Center offers      its strong support of Pamela A. Harris to the United States      Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit and urges you to      support her nomination. If you have questions or if we can be      of assistance, please contact us at (202) 588-5180.           Sincerely,     Nancy Duff Campbell,       Co-President.     Marcia D. Greenberger,       Co-President.                                  ____                                                    June 27, 2014.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: I write in      strong support of Pamela Harris's nomination to the United      States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.       I served as the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and      Secretary of The Hertz Corporation from 1998 to 2007.      Although it may seem surprising that a car and equipment      rental company would face issues with a constitutional      dimension, that did indeed occasionally happen. When it did,      I turned to Ms. Harris for advice and assistance. The views      expressed in this letter regarding her qualifications to      serve as a judge are informed by my interactions with her      while at Hertz; I hasten to add that those views are my own      and do not represent the views of my former employer, for      which I cannot speak.       In my dealings with Ms. Harris, I found her to be highly      intelligent, quick to grasp issues, creative in her approach      to problems, fair in her judgments, and direct in her advice.      When discussing legal matters, she was incisive, objective      and principled; it surely helped that she knew the law so      well and could speak with authority on the subjects at hand,      without a hint of defensiveness or dogmatism. She also was an      excellent writer, whose work exhibited the same clarity,      honesty and force that she showed in conversation. (She was,      moreover, able to write quickly and with little need for      revision; she seems to be one of those people who gets things      right the first time.) In short, Ms. Harris was a model of      professionalism as a practicing lawyer--someone who      engendered trust and respect. I note that all those qualities      are also vital for a judge, and especially for a judge on a      court as important as the Fourth Circuit.       Ms. Harris's academic achievements, meanwhile, speak for      themselves. After graduating from Yale Law School, she served      as a law clerk for Judge Harry T. Edwards on the D.C. Circuit      and for Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court. Ms.      Harris has also taught at Harvard Law School, the University      of Pennsylvania School of Law, and at the Georgetown      University Law Center, where she was the Executive Director      of the Supreme Court Institute, a unique and respected      project dedicated to improving advocacy before the Supreme      Court.       In sum, I believe that Ms. Harris is an ideal candidate for      an appellate court judge. As her academic credentials      demonstrate, she has a first-rate intellect. Equally      important, she is a mature and able lawyer with significant      experience in practice, no small part of which consisted of      high-quality advocacy for business enterprises. Beyond that,      she conveys a sense of fundamental decency, without which her      intellectual abilities and professional skills would be for      naught. I have no doubt that she would bring to the important      judicial seat for which she has been nominated the same      qualities that have made her an excellent lawyer, and that      she would instill confidence in all litigants that their      cases would be decided carefully and fairly. I urge you to      confirm her nomination.           Respectfully submitted,     Harold E. Rolfe.                                  ____                                         The leadership Conference                                     on Civil and Human Rights                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2014.   Confirm Pamela Harris to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth                                 Circuit       Dear Senator: On behalf of The Leadership Conference on      Civil and Human Rights, we write to express our strong      support for the confirmation of Pamela Ann Harris to serve on      the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. At every      stage in her career, Pamela Harris has distinguished herself      through her outstanding intellectual credentials, her      independence of thought, and her strong respect for the rule      of law, establishing herself beyond question as qualified and      ready to serve on the court. In addition, she has      demonstrated an unwavering integrity and an outstanding      commitment to public service. We urge you to vote yes on      cloture and yes to confirm her.       The Leadership Conference believes Pamela Harris will be an      impartial, thoughtful, and highly-respected addition to the      court. She graduated summa cum laude from Yale College in      1985 and received her J.D. from Yale Law School in 1990.      After law school, she was a law clerk for Judge Harry T.      Edwards of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.      She spent one year as an associate at Shea & Gardner (now      Goodwin Proctor LLP) before clerking for Justice John Paul      Stevens of the Supreme Court. From 2010-2012, she served at      the Department of Justice as Principal Deputy Assistant      Attorney General in the Office of Legal Policy.       Ms. Harris has devoted her career largely to academia and      public service, excelling in both. She has demonstrated a      commitment to improving the fair administration of justice      and educating new lawyers. In 1996, she joined the faculty of      the University Of Pennsylvania Law School, where she taught      courses in criminal procedure and received the Harvey Levin      Memorial Teaching Award in 1998. At O'Melveny & Myers LLP,      where she was counsel, Harris specialized in appellate and      Supreme Court litigation and was named partner in 2005.      During her ten years in private practice, Harris has become a      renowned Supreme Court and appellate advocate, appearing in      approximately 100 federal appellate cases. In addition,      Harris established a cooperative program between O'Melveny      and the Maryland Office of Public Defender, through which the      firm provides pro bono representation to indigent criminal      defendants appealing their convictions in state court.       Notably, Harris has used her uniquely broad experience as      an appellate litigator to prepare the next generation of      legal advocates and improve the judiciary. She was a visiting      professor at Georgetown University Law Center and executive      director of the law school's Supreme Court Institute. As      executive director, she managed and participated in a moot      court program that prepares advocates for oral argument      before the Supreme Court. During her tenure, she worked with      lawyers representing a multitude of interests. For example      she assisted both the offices of state attorneys general and      lawyers for criminal defendants; helped to improve arguments      by lawyers bringing civil rights actions and those defending      against civil rights actions; and worked with attorneys      representing both plaintiffs and defendant corporations. She      has also served as lecturer and co-director of the Supreme      Court and Appellate Practice Clinic at Harvard Law School.       The Leadership Conference believes that Pamela Harris is an      extraordinarily gifted nominee, with the ability to make      objective decisions on the multifaceted and prominent cases      that will surely come before the court. Her impeccable      credentials have garnered her the support of a diverse group      of attorneys in the legal community and people across the      political spectrum. Harris' rich diversity of experience      makes her an excellent choice for the U.S. Court of Appeals      for the Fourth Circuit, and we urge you to vote yes on      cloture and yes to confirm her.       Thank you for your time and consideration. If you have any      questions, please feel free to contact Nancy Zirkin,      Executive Vice President, at [email protected] or (202)      466-2880, or Sakira Cook, Counsel, at [email protected] or      (202) 263-2894.           Sincerely.     Wade Henderson,       President & CEO.     Nancy Zirkin,       Executive Vice President.                                       ____                                     Constitutional Accountability                                                       Center,                                   Washington, D.C., July 8, 2014.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Grassley: We are      writing on behalf of Constitutional Accountability Center, a      think tank, law firm, and action center dedicated to the      Constitution's text and history, to urge that Pamela Harris      be reported favorably out of Committee and confirmed promptly      to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.       Pam is one of the country's leading appellate advocates,      and her exceptional qualifications to serve as a federal      judge are well known to us, as Pam has been a member of CAC's      Board of Directors since 2012. After growing up in Maryland,      Pam graduated summa cum laude from Yale College and received      her J.D. from Yale Law School. She then held two prestigious      clerkships, first for Judge Harry Edwards on the D.C. Circuit      and then for Justice John Paul Stevens on the Supreme Court.      Following her clerkships, Pam's distinguished legal career      has included broad experience in private practice, government      service, and teaching. Among other things, Pam has served as      the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Office      of Legal Policy at the Department of Justice and practiced as      a partner at O'Melveny & Myers, where she focused on Supreme      Court and appellate litigation. Throughout her career, Pam      has dedicated herself to improving the quality of appellate      advocacy before our courts, believing that the courts are      best served when the advocates on both sides of a case      present the strongest possible arguments.       Pam is currently a Visiting Professor at Georgetown      University Law Center, where, in addition to teaching the      next generation of lawyers, she has also served as the      Executive Director of the Supreme Court Institute, working to      prepare counsel for oral argument before our Nation's highest      court. The Institute's ``moot court'' services are provided      without charge, as a public service, on a first-come, first-     served basis (the Institute will generally ``moot'' only one      side of a case), and without regard to the nature of the      case, the parties, the arguments being made, or the      affiliation or identity of the lawyers. The expert assistance      offered by Pam and her colleagues at the Institute to improve      advocacy before the Supreme Court is so helpful and sought-     after that the first call a lawyer often makes after learning      that the Court has agreed to review her client's case is to      the Institute, to reserve its moot court services before her      opponent does.       Pam's intellect, temperament, integrity, and the breadth of      her professional experience make her extremely well-qualified      to serve on the Fourth Circuit. This conclusion is      underscored by the ABA's rating of Pam as ``unanimously well      qualified,'' as well as by the diversity of voices supporting      Pam's confirmation. Those who have written to this Committee      to express their support include Greg Garre, who served as      Solicitor General in the George W. Bush Administration, Seth      Waxman, who held the same position during the Clinton      Administration, A.B. Culvahouse, White House Counsel for      President Reagan, and Walter Dellinger, Acting United States      Solicitor General during the Clinton Administration. Indeed,      the letter signed by Mr. Culvahouse, Mr. Dellinger, and other      ``current and former partners in the Washington, D.C. office      of O'Melveny & Myers''--lawyers who have practiced with Pam      and know her best--exemplifies the high praise she has      received. These attorneys have written:       [E]ach of us practiced law with Pam and has witnessed      firsthand her outstanding legal talent. Moreover, as former      colleagues with Pam, we can attest to her collegiality,      temperament, and judgment. We are confident that she      possesses the professional and personal qualifications to be      an excellent judge. . . .       [T]he signatories of this letter span the political and      jurisprudential spectrum. Some of us have served in      Republican Administrations or worked for Republican Senators,      while others have served in Democratic Administrations or      worked for Democratic Senators. Some of us are members of the      Federalist Society, while others are members of the American      Constitution Society. . . . Although we may not all share      Pam's views on a range of legal and political issues, we are      united in the belief that Pam possesses the intellect, fair-     mindedness, humility, and fundamental decency to make an      excellent federal judge.       In her testimony before this Committee on June 24, Pam      demonstrated that she understands clearly the difference      between the roles she has played in her career as an advocate      representing clients and as an academic and an expert      commentator on the courts, and the new role she would take on      if confirmed as a judge. In particular, pointing among other      things to her work ``running the Supreme Court Institute on      an entirely nonpartisan basis,'' Pam testified that ``I have      never let any personal views I have, political views I may      have, affect the discharge of my professional      responsibilities. And I would not do that if I were confirmed      as a judge.''       In sum, Pam Harris clearly has the qualifications,      experience, intellect and temperament to serve with great      distinction on the Fourth Circuit. We urge every Senator to      support her confirmation.           Respectfully,     Douglas T. Kendall,       President.     Judith E. Schaeffer,       Vice President.  With that, I would yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Baldwin). The Senator from Iowa.
