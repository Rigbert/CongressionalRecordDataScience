Speaker, as a constructive suggestion, I notice that the gentleman has scheduled--and I want to thank him for his communication with our office so that we could work together on trying to get the schedule together--we have four working weeks in June. As you know, essentially, the Appropriations Committee tries to get its work done by the end of May in terms of its bills--they don't get all of them done by the end of May--so we can start moving them to the floor.  I congratulate the gentleman for putting sufficient time in so that we can do that in June and July, so that all the bills, hopefully--the objective, I would suggest, ought to be to have all of the 12 appropriation bills sent to the Senate prior to the August break. I thank him for his schedule on that.  Originally, March 31 was, as I understood, the CR date, but that is somewhat flexible now, I understand. Can the gentleman tell me what date he expects the CR to expire on?  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned earlier, the Appropriations Committee is continuing to work on the CR, and that would be including the length of time. The gentleman is correct that March was the date we were looking at. I believe that date will change. But as soon as discussions have ended and we are able to post, it will include the date of the length of the CR.
