  Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that the article in Thursday's Washington Post, dated September 20, by David Ignatius, entitled ``Shaky Allies in Anbar'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                         Shaky Allies in Anbar                          (By David Ignatius)       The Bush administration has been so enthusiastic in touting      its new alliance with Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar province      that it's easy to overlook two basic questions: Why did it      take so long to reach an accommodation with the Sunnis? And      is Anbar really a good model for stabilizing the rest of      Iraq?       First, the what-took-so-long issue: The fact is, Sunni      tribal leaders have been queuing up for four years to try to      make the kind of alliances that have finally taken root in      Anbar. For most of that time, these overtures were rebuffed      by U.S. officials who, not inaccurately, regarded the Sunni      sheiks as local warlords.       This disdain for potential allies was a mistake, but so is      the recent sugarcoating of the tribal leaders. They are tough      Bedouin chiefs, sometimes litt1e more than smugglers and      gangsters. The United States should make tactical alliances      with them, but we shouldn't have stars in our eyes. The      tendency to overidealize our allies has been a consistent      mistake.       Like other journalists who follow Iraq, I began talking      with Sunni tribal leaders in 2003. Most of the meetings were      in Amman, Jordan, arranged with help from former Jordanian      government officials who had perfected the art of paying the      sheiks. One contact was a member of the Kharbit clan, which      had long maintained friendly (albeit secret) relations with      the Jordanians and the Americans. The Kharbits were eager for      an alliance, even after a U.S. bombing raid killed one of      their leaders, Malik Kharbit, in April 2003. But U.S.      officials were disdainful.       During a visit to Fallujah in September 2003, I met an      aging leader of the Bu Issa Tribe named Sheik Khamis. He      didn't want secret American payoffs--they would get him      killed, he said. He wanted money to rebuild schools and roads      and to provide jobs for members of his tribe. U.S. officials      made fitful efforts to help but nothing serious enough to      check the insurgency in Fallujah. Back then, you recall, the      Bush administration was playing down any talk of an      insurgency.       A Sunni tribal leader who pushed bravely for an alliance      with the Americans was Talal al-Gaaod, a leader of one of the      branches of the Dulaim tribe. Looking back through my notes,      I can reconstruct a series of his efforts that were      mishandled by senior U.S. officials: In August 2004, he      helped arrange a meeting in Amman between Marine commanders      from Anbar and tribal leaders there who wanted to assemble a      local militia. Senior U.S. officials learned of the      unauthorized dialogue and shut it down.       Gaaod tried again in November 2004, organizing a tribal      summit in Amman with the blessing of the Jordanian      government. Again, the official U.S. response was chilly; the      U.S. military launched its second assau1t on Fallujah that      month, and the summit had to be canceled. In the spring of      2005, the tireless Gaaod began framing plans for what he     called a ``Desert Protection Force,'' a kind of tribal      militia that would fight al-Qaeda in Anbar. The proposal was      gutted by U.S. officials in Baghdad who derided it as      ``warlordism.''       A despondent Gaaod e-mailed me in July 2005: ``Believe me,      there is no need to waste anymore one penny of the American      taxpayers' money and no more one drop of blood of the      American boys.'' His despair roused the new American      ambassador to Baghdad, Zalmay Khalilzad, who began meeting      with Gaaod and other Iraqi Sunnis in Amman in hopes of      brokering a deal with the insurgents. Gaaod died of heart      failure in March 2006.       What fina1ly happened in Anbar was that Sunni tribal      leaders--tough guys who have guns and know how to use them--     began standing up to the al-Qaeda thugs who were marrying      their women and blocking their smuggling routes. The initial      American response in mid-2006, I'm told, was ho-hum. More      warlords. But Green Zone officials began to realize this was      the real deal, and a virtuous cycle began. The tragedy is      that it could have happened much earlier.       The American plan now, apparently, is to extend the Anbar      model and create ``bottom-up'' solutions throughout Iraq. For      example, I'm told that U.S. commanders met recently with the      Shiite political organization known as the Supreme Islamic      Iraqi Council and gave a green light for its Badr      Organization militia to control security in Nasiriyah and      some other areas in southern Iraq and thereby check the power      of Moqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army. We're interposing ourselves      here in an intra-Shiite battle we barely understand.       These local deals may make sense as short-term methods for      stabilizing the country. But we shouldn't confuse these      tactical alliances with nation-building. Over time, they will      break Iraq apart rather than pull it together. Work with      tribal and militia leaders, but don't forget who they are.
