Mr. Speaker,   I rise today to say to my Republican colleagues, it is time to deliver on your promises.  You said you would cut taxes, balance the budget, and leave Social Security and defense intact. Now tell us: How will you do it?  To date the Republicans have raided the Medicare trust fund to pay for their tax cuts for the rich. Their tax bill takes $27 billion away from the Medicare trust fund and from our Nation's senior citizens.  In 1993 and again in 1994, the President and the Democrats took action to make the Medicare Program stronger. And, we did it over the loud protests of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  I say to my Republican colleagues, don't take health care from our senior citizens to pay for tax cuts for the rich. That is not Medicare reform. And our senior citizens will not be fooled.                          ____________________
