The Senator worked through the Governmental Affairs Committee on a bill. There were long hearings and markups, and they brought it to the floor, and now for 6 weeks we have been on it. This is the fifth time we are going to try to bring debate to a close and a final vote.  I say to my colleague from Connecticut, if the Senate Republicans reject this effort to end the debate, I frankly think we ought to harken back to the Cub fans back in Chicago, who said: It is time to wait until next year.
