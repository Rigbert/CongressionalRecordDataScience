 The debt limit, Mr. Leader, do you expect we will have an opportunity to have a full and open debate on this matter?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield further, I am sure the gentleman is aware that the House has already passed an increase in the statutory debt limit. It is my understanding that the other body has a unanimous consent agreement to consider the House bill, along with a series of amendments.  Frankly, hopefully the Senate would not pass any of those amendments and pick up the House bill and pass it sometime next week and send it to the President.
