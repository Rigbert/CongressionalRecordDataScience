President, I would like to take a moment to commend Vermont's Rutland High School Band that performed Saturday, January 20, 2001, at the Inauguration of our Nation's 43rd President. The Rutland High Band represented our State with dignity and pride, celebrating one of our country's finest traditions, the peaceful transfer of power from one administration to the next. Their outstanding performance made me proud to be a Vermonter.  Hours of practice and preparation shone through during their two hour and fifteen minute performance. Ninety-two talented students made up this extraordinary band.  Students woke up on Inauguration Day at 4 a.m. in order to arrive at the Pentagon for an early morning security check, then played on a stage at the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and Sixth Street, both before and after the President's swearing-in ceremony. Their dedication to excellence set an example for all of us.  The band was directed by Marc Whitman, who is a motivated and worthy leader of his students. Under his supervision, the Rutland High School Band was a true asset to the Inauguration festivities. I congratulate each and every band member and their musical directors on a superb job on January 20. All Vermonters are proud of them.  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record an excerpt from an article about the band that appeared in the Rutland Daily Herald on January 22.  The article follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, Jan. 22, 2001]                      Hail (and Rain) to the Chief                          (By Kevin O'Connor)       Ask anyone in the Rutland High School band: Playing at      George W. Bush's inaugural Saturday left its mark.       Make that watermark.       ``To see the bands, the floats, the protestors and the      signs was significant, and then to be a part of that      experience was something in itself,'' saxophonist Charles      Romeo said. ``We made our place in history and being in the      rain makes it better--it's a better story to tell.''       The 18-year-old senior was one of 92 students who soaked up      the chance to represent Vermont at inaugural ceremonies this      past weekend in Washington, DC.       Rutland High first played for a president when John F.      Kennedy took office in 1961--a moment frozen in time by a      blizzard of snow and 22-degree winds.       Forty years later, the band again took the inaugural by      storm.       How wet did it get?       ``Very, very wet,'' French horn player Devon Balfour said      in a phone interview after the band returned to its hotel      late Saturday night. ``We were all drenched, but I don't      think it mattered to many of us, because it was so      exciting.''       Students were set to wake Saturday as early as 4 p.m. so      they could reach a Pentagon security check by 6:30 a.m., and      play on a stage at the corner of Pennsylvania Avenue and      Sixth Street before and after the president's swearing-in.       But the weather almost washed out their plans. Inaugural      organizers didn't commit to outdoor ceremonies until late      Friday, leaving the band, its two music teachers and 10      parent chaperons wondering for hours.       ``I didn't even consider it as an option,'' band director      Marc Whitman said of cancellation, ``but the kids would have      gotten their chance to swim in the hotel pool all day.''       Band members didn't march in the inaugural parade like      their predecessors, but instead performed for some of the      thousands of spectators around the U.S. Capitol from 10:30 to      11:30 a.m. and 12:45 to 2 p.m.                          ____________________
