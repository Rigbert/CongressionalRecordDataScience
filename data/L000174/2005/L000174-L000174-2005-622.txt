President, I recommend all the Republicans and Democrats listen to the speech given by the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania. I said to him earlier this morning if it were he and I who were allowed to work this out, we could work it out probably in less than an hour. I said the same thing to the President and to our two leaders.  Hopefully everyone understands the significance of this debate and what the Republican leader, the majority leader is doing. He has decided to trigger the nuclear option. That is what it is. This nuclear option is something any Senate majority could have done any time over the past 50 years. It boils down to the Republican Senate leader declaring the Senate rules governing filibusters are out of order.  The nonpartisan Senate Parliamentarian has indicated that would violate the Senate rules. It would. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has studied this and concluded it is unprecedented. Why? Because it amounts to breaking the rules.  We are talking about judging whether nominees will be fair and impartial judges who will follow the law and the majority is willing to break the rules to do that. When you have a slim majority and are willing to use parliamentary brute force, if you want to break the rules, you can. It does not make it right. It makes it wrong, but you can do it.  The American people ought to recognize this for what it is, an abuse of power to advance a power grab. It is an effort by the White House and the Republican Senate majority to undercut the checks and balances of the Senate. They intend to use majority power to override the rights of the minority.  Actually, it is not an isolated effort. It is part of a sustained effort by this administration and partisan operatives in the Congress to consolidate power in one branch, the executive branch, and ignore our constitutional history of three separate branches acting as checks and balances on each other. It is an effort at one-party rule. It undercuts the rights of the minority in the Senate, it undermines the role of the Senate as a check on the executive, and it leads to a Republican rubberstamp on a less independent judiciary.  The constitutional protections of the American people are at stake in this debate, not just someone's political future, the constitutional protections of the American people. At stake are the protections provided for the American people by the judicial branch against overreaching by the political branches; by the Senate against an aggressive executive branch, and by the minority against the tyranny of the majority.  As this debate begins, I urge the American people to be involved because it is their rights that are at stake. It is the independence, fairness, and nonpartisan protection of the judiciary that protects their rights that is being threatened. It is a constitutional check that the Senate was intended by the Founders to keep the executive from acting like a king, that is being threatened by curtailing the rights of the minority.  This is an exercise in breaking the rules to change the rules. Note that as this debate begins, it begins in accordance with the Senate rules, including rule XXII, the longstanding rule the Republican majority intends to override by the end of this process by parliamentary brute force.  The Senate is now being threatened with a fundamental change through a self-inflicted wound. ``Master of the Senate'' author Robert Caro recalled an important chapter in the Senate and the Nation's history. Consider this and contrast it with what is happening here today.  When Senator Lyndon Johnson of Texas left the Senate, he was the most powerful majority leader in the history of this country. When he was elected Vice President with President Kennedy and he was preparing to leave the Senate, he told his protege and successor, Senate Mansfield of Montana, that he, Johnson, would keep attending the Democratic luncheons and help his successor as majority leader in running the Senate. Senator Mansfield said no, Vice President Johnson was no longer a Member of the Senate, but an officer of the executive branch and by means of that office was accorded the privilege of presiding over the Senate.  What a contrast Senator Mike Mansfield's respect for the separation of powers and checks and balances is from those in power today. I say that as one who was privileged to serve here with Senator Mansfield.  Instead, this White House took an active role in naming the present Senate leadership and this White House regularly sends Vice President Cheney andKarl Rove to Republican caucus luncheons to give the Republican majority its marching orders. What a difference from the days of Mike Mansfield and Lyndon Johnson.  The current Republican majority leader, who is my friend, announced that he intends to leave the Senate next year. He made no secret of his intent to run for the Republican nomination for President. With that in mind, he is apparently prepared to become the first majority leader in the history of the Senate whose legacy would be a significantly weakened Senate. Every other majority leader has left the Senate stronger than it was or at least as strong as it was, as a check and balance against an executive. This would be the first time it would be left weaker.  Many, unfortunately, on the other side--many but not all--are apparently ready to sacrifice the Senate's role in our constitutional system of checks and balances. It is my hope that our system of checks and balances will be preserved with a handful of Republican Senators voting their conscience and standing up to the White House and its pressure. I know the zealotry of the narrow special interest leaders who are demanding this mutilation of the Senate's character. I am one of many who have been the target of their brutal and spurious personal attacks.  My hope is that a number of the fine women and men of both parties with whom I am privileged to serve as a custodian of our Nation's liberties will act in the finest traditions of the Senate. One of their number has come to this floor in recent days to remind all Senators of senatorial profiles in courage. Sadly, it is that courage that will be necessary to avert the overreaching power grab now underway.  There have been other recent threats to our system of government. Republican partisans in the House, in a standoff with President Clinton, shut down the Government in 1995. A few years later, they impeached a popularly-elected President for the first time in our history. Fortunately, the Senate stood up and functioned as it was intended during that trial and rejected those efforts. I was privileged to be one of those who worked with both sides to make sure that trial ended the way it did.  In 2000, a divided nation saw an election decided by the successful litigation of the Republican Party and the intervention of a narrow activist decision of the Supreme Court to stop vote counting in Florida. Then we witnessed Senator Jeffords virtually driven out of the Republican caucus. We have seen an aggressive executive branch that has been aided by a compliant congressional majority.  If the Senate's role in our system of coequal branches of the Federal Government is to be honored, it is going to take Republican Senators joining others in standing up for the American people's rights, the independence of the judiciary, the rules of the Senate, and the rights of the minority.  During the last several days, we have seen the Democratic leader make offer after offer to head off this showdown. We have heard stirring speeches from Senator Byrd, Senator Inouye, Senator Kennedy, Senator Biden, Senator Baucus, Senator Murray, Senator Boxer, Senator Feinstein, and others, who have come to this floor to set the record straight. But this is a setting in which Democratic Senators alone will not be able to rescue the Senate and our system of checks and balances from the breaking of the Senate rules being planned. If the rights of the minority are to be preserved, if the Senate is to be preserved as the greatest of parliamentary bodies, it will take at least six Republicans standing up for fairness and for checks and balances.  Now I know from my own conversations that a number of Republican Senators know in their hearts this nuclear option is the wrong way to go. I know Republican Senators, with whom I have had the privilege to serve for anywhere from 2 years to more than 30 years, know better. I hope more than six of them will withstand the political pressures being brought upon them and do the right thing and the honorable thing, and that they will put the Senate first, the Constitution first, but especially the American people first. History and those who follow us will carefully scrutinize these moments and these votes. Those voting to protect the rights of the minority will be on the right side of history.  Like the senior Senator from Pennsylvania, I remember President Kennedy's publication of ``Profiles in Courage.'' Along with so many Americans, I remember reading about those Senators who stood up to their party to vote against the conviction of President Andrew Johnson. More recently, I witnessed the strength it took for my friend, Senator Mark Hatfield, a distinguished Republican, to cast a vote of conscience against amending the Constitution. He did it under intense and unfair pressures. I believe we are now seeing the current Senate leadership taking the Senate to another precipice. It will take the votes of independent and conscientious Republican Senators, such as Senator Hatfield, to prevent the fall.  The Framers of the Constitution warned against the dangers of factionalism undermining our structural separation of powers. Some in the Senate have been willing to sacrifice the historic role of the Senate as a check on the President in the area of nominations.  Under pressure from the White House, over the last 2 years we saw the former Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee lead Senate Republicans in breaking with longstanding precedent, in breaking the rules, even committee rule IV, which was put in there at the request of Republicans to protect minorities. But when the Republicans took the majority, they violated the rules, longstanding precedent and Senate tradition. With the Senate and the White House under control of the same political party, we have witnesses committee rules broken or misinterpreted away. The broken committee rules and precedent include the way that home-state Senators were treated, the way hearings were scheduled, the way the committee questionnaire was unilaterally altered, and the way the Judiciary Committee's own historic protection of the minority by rule IV was repeatedly violated. In the last Congress, the Republican majority of the Judiciary Committee destroyed virtually every custom and courtesy that used to help create and enforce cooperation and civility in the confirmation process. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a recent article from the Wall Street Journal noting some of these developments.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 3, 2005]              War Over Judges is No Longer a Subtle Fight       Washington.--Just 10 years ago, a Senate minority had      several avenues for affecting a president's judicial      nominations, from closed-door maneuvers within the Judiciary      Committee to quiet negotiations with the White House.       Now there is only one sure way, and it isn't quiet at all:      the filibuster.       The gradual disappearance of other levers of influence is      an often overlooked cause of the battle over judicial      nominations that is raging in Washington. Both parties have      played a part, with the result that the Senate stands on the      brink of a governmental crisis.       Some analysts say the consequences could be deep and      lasting. Republicans are threatening to choose the ``nuclear      option'' of using Senate rules to bar judicial filibusters.      In the short term, Democrats have threatened to bottle up      Republican legislative priorities. But over the long term,      some analysts say, the ban could dilute the Senate's power      and smooth the way for judicial choices reflecting the      dominant ideological blocs within the party holding the White      House.       The filibuster once was a seldom-used threat that forced      competing political camps to compromise--``the shotgun behind      the door,'' says Charles Geyh, a law professor at Indiana      University. If it is disarmed, he adds, ``The long-term      impact is pretty scary. These devices have been stabilizing      influences on the process for a long time.''       The chipping away at minority influence began in the 1970s      when Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, then      chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, attempted to      dilute the ability of a senator to employ a common tactic for      blocking unwelcome nominations. It was called the ``blue      slip''--named for the color of the paper used by the chairman      to inform senators not on the committee that the White House      had submitted a judicial nominee from their states.       A senator could object by checking off his or her      disapproval or by refusing to return the blue slip to the      chairman. For decades, opposition from a home-state senator      was enough to kill a nomination. As a result, the blue slip      was most commonly employed as a     lever for forcing negotiations with the White House.       As President Jimmy Carter sought to put his stamp on the      federal bench in the late 1970s, Mr. Kennedy proposed a new      blue-slip policy. It allowed the Judiciary chairman to      override a home-state senator's objection if he concluded      that opposition was based on race or sex. The Massachusetts      liberal met only mixed success, however, as other senators      continued to respect the traditional blue-slip process.       Two decades later, with Republicans in charge of the      Judiciary Committee, they began using their clout to exercise      what Democrats called a ``shadow filibuster'' by simply      refusing to give about 60 of President Bill Clinton's      judicial candidates a hearing or vote on the Senate floor.       Republicans argue that the White House shared blame for      some of the delays, saying some nominees hadn't undergone      background checks when they were forwarded to the committee.      But Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky recently      conceded on the Senate floor that the Democrats have ``a      legitimate complaint'' about how the Clinton appointees were      treated.       In 2003, Republican Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch of Utah      changed the practice further. He proceeded with hearings on      Bush judicial nominees even if they were vigorously opposed      by senators from the nominee's home state.       That change reduced the need for the White House to      negotiate with the Senate. The result was diminished      consultation between the president and the minority within      the chamber, a practice that started with President George      Washington, and extended through the Clinton administration.      Mr. Clinton consulted with Mr. Hatch even on his two U.S.      Supreme Court nominees, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen      Breyer.       In the last Congress, five judicial nominees had blue-slip      problems, including four receiving negative recommendations      from both of Michigan's Democratic senators. Even so, all      five of them were approved by the committee on party-line      votes and advanced to the full Senate, according to committee      records. Democrats blocked final votes on all of them.       Before the current stalemate, the filibuster had been used      effectively against a judicial nominee just once. In 1968, a      minority coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats      blocked President Lyndon B. Johnson's attempt to elevate      Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas, a supporter of civil rights      and the Great Society programs, to the chief justice's chair.      After a cloture vote to end the filibuster failed, 45-43, Mr.      Fortas asked the president to withdraw his name.       Republicans today discount the significance of that vote,      arguing it wasn't clear Mr. Fortas would have been approved      by the full Senate if the filibuster had been overcome. By      contrast, there is little doubt that President George W.      Bush's contested nominees could attract a majority in the      chamber, where Republicans hold 55 seats.       Yet even in that 1968 debate, some senators recognized the      possibility that the Fortas stalemate would echo in future      debates. ``If we, for the first time in our history, permit a      Supreme Court nomination to be lost in a fog of a      filibuster,'' cautioned Democratic Sen. Philip Hart of      Michigan, ``I think we would be setting a precedent which      would come back to haunt our successors.''       After the Fortas battle, senators gradually began reaching      for the filibuster weapon. According to a 2003 analysis by      the Congressional Research Service, the Senate held 17 votes      to halt filibusters on judicial nominees between 1969 and      2002, although many were intended to force negotiations on      legislation or judicial candidates rather than defeating the      nominees.       None of the filibusters succeeded until the Democrats      managed to block 10 of Mr. Bush's first-term appellate-court      nominees. After his re-election, Mr. Bush resubmitted the      names of seven of those candidates. Those are the nominees in      contention today.
