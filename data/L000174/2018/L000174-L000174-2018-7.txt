President, Senator Nelson is the only Member of this body to see the Earth from space. Perhaps that is why he has been a champion of our environment, our climate, clean air and water, both here in the United States, and for the entire planet.  Senator Nelson has said that seeing our little planet suspended in the infinity of space imparted him ``with a profound sense of obligation to become a better steward for our planet Earth.'' He has never shirked that obligation. Whether urgently warning about the dangers of a quickly warming planet or about the importance of conserving wildlife and our natural spaces, Senator Nelson has long understood that the health of our children and grandchildren depends on our responsible stewardship of our planet today. What is more, Senator Nelson understands that confronting climate change is notonly good for the planet but crucial for his constituents. Florida has already begun to feel the effects of extreme weather made worse by warmer temperatures, and Senator Nelson's work on the issue reflects his deep commitment to Floridians.  In addition to his global outlook, Senator Nelson has shown his willingness and ability to accomplish small changes that can have big benefits for his constituents. In the aftermath of horrific shootings in Florida, he didn't just offer condolences to the victims; he got to work to call attention to gun violence, and he issued calls to action. He partnered with me to introduce legislation that would give law enforcement agencies the tools they need to modernize efforts to combat gun violence. The small technical fix in this legislation--allowing the ATF to digitize its records--would make a world of difference to police trying to solve crimes across the country. I wish his calls to action, like so many of ours, were heard by Congress.  Senator Nelson has devoted his career to public service, and his role in elected office started back in the Florida House of Representatives in 1972. Since then, he has faithfully represented the State of Florida, and we have been fortunate to have him here in the Senate. I am sad to see him go, and the Nation will miss his strong voice on environmental issues. I wish Senator Nelson and his wife, Grace, the best.                          ____________________
