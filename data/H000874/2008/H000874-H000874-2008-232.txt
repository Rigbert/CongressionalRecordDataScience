I said angst, but I understand your feelings. My point is that I understand while you have been making motions to adjourn and making your points, you've made it every time you've stood up, I have made the point that I remember voting on omnibus appropriation bills numerous times, 4 months, 5 months after the appropriations process should have been concluded, long after the year began, which were omnibus bills which we could not change. So we understood that that was, we didn't think, fair.  We understood that we sat here for an hour and 45 minutes while we were winning a vote, and no vote ever changed during an hour and 45 minutes, and the vote was not closed down until, in fact, you changed votes on your side and we lost. We understood that. We didn't like that. We thought that was unfair. I didn't think it was against the rules. I've said that. But I thought it was unfair.  All I am saying to my friend, the minority leader, and to my friends on the minority side, that what just occurred is not an acceptable, in our opinion--my opinion, forget about our opinion, I haven't talked to anybody else--in my opinion, way for us to operate the House. The motions, yes, but simply changing votes for the purpose of delay could take an hour, could take 2 hours depending upon how many times people wanted to change.  Mr. Gingrich, we don't hold to it, we understand that, but he said 15 minutes plus 2. I have said that before and some people cheered. Fifteen minutes plus 2, or 5 minutes plus 2 if it's a 5-minute vote, is what we have set as the norm and the comity and the fairness to individuals to exercise their deliberative judgment.
