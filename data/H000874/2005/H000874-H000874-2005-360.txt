Speaker, I take this time for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come.  I yield to my friend, the majority leader.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my friend yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Monday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of the day. Any votes called on these measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Tuesday and the balance of the week, the House will consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules, as well as several measures under a rule: H.R. 525, the Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2005; H.R. 5, the HEALTH Act of 2005; and H.R. 22, the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act. In addition, we expect to consider H.R. 3045, the Dominican Republic-Central American Free Trade Agreement sometime later in the week.  Finally, I would like to note that we are expecting a very busy week heading into the August recess. Members should expect to work some late nights as we resolve these important pieces of legislation.
