 President, last night I had the honor of speaking at a bourbon event hosted by the Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship and the Kentucky Distillers' Association here in Washington, DC. This event was for Kentuckians and by Kentuckians and featured the so-called ``Bourbon Barrel of Compromise'' that had been delivered from Ashland, the Henry Clay Estate in Lexington, KY. I would ask that my remarks at that event last night be entered into the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             [Feb. 3, 2015]              Leader McConnell's Remarks at Bourbon Event       Thank you, Robert [Clay, co-chairman of the Henry Clay      Center for Statesmanship].       It's a pleasure to be here to celebrate the spirit of      Kentucky--literally. Tonight we honor two of Kentucky's most      important gifts to the nation: the drink that is Bourbon      whiskey and the revered statesman Henry Clay. I'm glad to be      here to talk about both.       There are a lot of good Henry Clay stories, but let me      share one of my favorites--a story that demonstrates Clay's      sense of humor and quick wit.       On one occasion, a long-winded colleague of Clay's,      Alexander Smyth of Virginia, was giving a speech. He turned      to Clay in mid-speech and said disdainfully, ``You, sir,      speak for the present generation; but I speak for      posterity.''       Without batting an eye, Clay retorted, ``Yes, and you seem      resolved to speak until the arrival of your audience.''       Taking that wisdom to heart, I will be brief.       I want to thank the Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship and      the Kentucky Distillers' Association for hosting this grand      event--not only tonight's affair, but shipping a barrel of      Bourbon whiskey from Henry Clay's estate in Ashland to      Washington, DC, just as the Great Compromiser reportedly      often did some two centuries ago.       The history of Bourbon whiskey and the legend of Henry Clay      have long been intertwined. It is said that whenever Clay      went to Washington, he carried a barrel with him, to      ``lubricate the wheels of government.''       Clay is also credited with writing the first historical      recipe for the mint julep and introducing it to the public in      this very hotel.       He recorded in his diary his own method for making the      cocktail. Clay called for ``mellow bourbon, aged in oaken      barrels'' and also instructed that ``the mint leaves, fresh      and tender, should be pressed against a coin-silver goblet      with the back of a silver spoon.''       The historical record also shows that Clay used Bourbon as      an aid to legislating. One observer from that era recalls      witnessing Clay and fellow Senate great John Calhoun sipping      whiskey in the Old Senate Chamber.       Together they would drain their glasses behind the vice      president's chair--and Clay, with good humor, would say to      Calhoun, ``Well, Mr. Senator, I will admit that you have had      the better of me today; but I'll be your match tomorrow.''       Legend also holds that Clay's oratorical skills were often      enhanced by his consumption of Kentucky's favorite beverage.      Some have said that it is the lime in the water used to make      Kentucky Bourbon that lends both Bourbon whiskey and Clay's      oratory their special flare.       Whatever it may be that gives Bourbon whiskey its unique      taste, Kentucky is proud to be the birthplace of Bourbon.       The drink itself is named for Bourbon County, where the      product first emerged. Kentucky produces 95 percent of the      world's Bourbon supply, and Kentucky's iconic Bourbon brands      ship more than 30 million gallons of the spirit to 126      countries, making Bourbon the largest export category among      all United States distilled spirits.       Bourbon also gives much back to Kentucky. It is a vital      part of the state's tourism and economy. Many a visitor to      the Commonwealth has traced the famous Kentucky Bourbon      Trail. And the industry is responsible for nearly 10,000 jobs      in our state.       And both Bourbon and Clay have one thing in common: They      excel at bringing people together in a spirit of compromise.       I'd like to think that this Kentucky spirit of compromise      lives on in the Senate today. With the new Senate of the      114th Congress, it's great to see some real debate on the      floor of the Senate once again.       It's been great to see both sides able to offer amendments      once more.       I know many of the Democratic Senators are glad to be able      to give more of a voice to their constituents too. I believe      they welcome our vision of a Senate where we're doing some      real legislating.       A more open Senate presents more opportunities for      legislators with serious ideas to make a mark on the      legislative process. It can give members of both parties a      real stake in the outcome. And it helps lead, I hope, to      greater bipartisan accomplishments down the road.       Just because we have a Republican Congress and a Democrat      in the White House     doesn't mean we can't deliver for the American people. On the      contrary--divided government has frequently been a time to      get big things done. That's something Henry Clay would have      well understood and appreciated.       Because principled compromise across party lines was very      familiar to Henry Clay.       Three times in the early years of the American Republic,      the split between North and South threatened to tear the      country apart. And three times before the Civil War finally      began, Henry Clay kept the nation together, through      compromise and negotiation.       Were it not for his leadership, America as we know it may      not exist today.       The Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship rightly keeps his      spirit of compromise alive today through its education      programs for high school and college students. The Center      teaches Kentucky's future leaders about Henry Clay and the      art of meaningful dialogue and discourse.       It makes me proud as a Kentuckian to see Henry Clay's      legacy live on, whether it is through the Clay Center,      through the U.S. Senate, or through all of us here today.       It makes me proud as a Kentuckian to see the imprint the      Bluegrass State has made on the history of this country. Not      only Clay, but famous Kentuckians like Abraham Lincoln. John      Sherman Cooper. Alben Barkley. And the recently departed      Wendell Ford.       And it makes me proud as a Kentuckian to see how many other      Kentucky traditions have made a lasting imprint on our      country. Not least of which is the Run for the Roses on the      first Saturday of every May.       So thank you for allowing me to be here tonight. And thank      you for taking the spirit of Kentucky with you wherever you      go.       Good night.                          ____________________
