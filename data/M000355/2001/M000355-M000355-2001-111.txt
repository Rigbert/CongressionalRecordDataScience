 REID. I am happy to yield for a question without losing my right to the floor.  Mr. McCONNELL. I do not seek to have the Senator lose his right to the floor, but just to make certain the Senator understands my amendment neither promotes nor condones corporal punishment. I don't know what second-degree amendment the Senator plans to offer. If he would be willing to discuss it prior to sending it forward, it may be we could agree to it. As I will make clear when I regain the floor after the Senator finishes speaking, my amendment has nothing to do with corporal punishment. I am sorry the Senator from Nevada may have interpreted it otherwise. I think I can make it clear to his satisfaction that it is wholly unrelated to that subject. And I might well be interested in supporting the second-degree if I can take a look at it.  The purpose of this amendment is to leave that matter strictly up to the States. The Federal Government would not either support or oppose corporal punishment.
