President, the sluggish national economy and the rising cost of housing is a one-two punch that is keeping affordable housing out of the reach of too many Vermont families. It is important that during these times of economic hardship we do more--not less--to help struggling families make ends meet. I am pleased that today, after months of delay, the Senate is set to act on final passage of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, H.R. 3221, a responsible bill to strengthen our economy, restore confidence in our financial markets, and provide urgently needed relief to American families who are struggling to make ends meet.  Under the Bush administration's watch, unregulated mortgage originators were given financial incentives to sell risky, unaffordable, subprime mortgages to vulnerable borrowers. As these adjustable rate mortgages reset to higher rates, the number of families unable to afford their payments and threatened with foreclosure is skyrocketing.  Foreclosures have climbed in my home State of Vermont and, while subprime mortgages are not the largest driver, the mortgage foreclosure crisis will still have severe costs for homeowners, not only in direct costs but in its effect on home values and declining property taxes. According to the State of Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance, Securities and Health Care Administration, for the first quarter of 2008, well over 400 new foreclosures have been filed in Vermont, which is a 30-percent increase over those filed in last year's first quarter. If the current trend holds, Vermont is facing about 1600 this year.  Several urgent housing-related issues have become prominent already this year.
