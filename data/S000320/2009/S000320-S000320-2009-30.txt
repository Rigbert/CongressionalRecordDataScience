 President, I rise today to support and thank the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the Senator from Hawaii, for his amendment to strike the Guantanamo Bay funding in the supplemental bill before us.  Last week in the Appropriations Committee which he chairs, I raised this issue at the markup with the intent to strike the funding for the Department of Justice. At the behest of the chairman and ranking member, I did not offer the amendment which I intended to offer today.  This supplemental, as reported out of the Appropriations Committee, fulfilled the Department of Justice request originally for $30 million to fund the President's reckless campaign promise to shut down the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and determine the fate of the 241 terrorists being held there.  I also believe that funding for the Department of Justice to carry out the President's Executive order is just the beginning of efforts to begin the investigations of U.S. officials who interrogated terrorists who killed or attempted to kill American citizens.  In a Department of Justice hearing before the Appropriations Subcommittee on May 7, I asked the Attorney General if he knew about or sanctioned any of the renditions that occurred when he served as the Deputy Attorney General during the Clinton administration. He said he did, but could not provide specifics and would get back to the committee with a response. We are still waiting for that response. Yesterday, in following up with that, I sent a letter to the Attorney General following up on many of the unanswered questions left after the hearing.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed at this point in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2009.     Hon. Eric Holder,     Attorney General, Department of Justice,     Washington, DC.       Dear Attorney General Holder: I am writing to follow up on      some of the issues raised during your hearing before the      Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice,      Science, and Related Agencies on May 7, 2009. Below are a      number of questions posed during the hearing, as well as some      additional questions I have relating to a potential criminal      investigation of U.S. officials who drafted the legal      opinions upon which the CIA based its interrogation program,      and who actually participated in the interrogation of      detainees. Also included are questions relating to the      disposition of Guantanamo Bay detainees. Your immediate      response would be greatly appreciated.       1. During your tenure as the Deputy Attorney General of the      United States, 1997 to 2001, did you know that President      Clinton approved of and actively engaged in the practice      known as rendition? Did you or anyone in the Department of      Justice express a legal opinion on, participate in, or      approve any rendition? What actions did you take to ensure      any such rendition complied with United States or      international law? What actions did you take to ensure that      any interrogations of any such individuals rendered by the      United States were conducted by the receiving country in a      manner consistent with United States or international law?      Did you or anyone on your behalf ever determine whether any      useful intelligence was obtained from any such individuals      rendered by or on behalf of the United States? Did you or      anyone on your behalf ever attempt to determine how that      information was obtained and whether any such individuals      rendered by or on behalf the United States was subjected to      any treatment that would violate United States or      international laws?       2. In an exchange with Senator Alexander during the hearing      you mentioned an Office of Professional Responsibility (OPR)      inquiry into the work of the attorneys who prepared the      Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) memoranda regarding      interrogation. It has been reported that the OPR report      criticizes the competence of the authors of the memoranda.       a. Has the OPR. prior to this review. ever reviewed legal      opinions drafted by the OLC? If so, please explain in detail,      including whether any such review involved intelligence      matters or the President's war powers?       b. Presuming the OPR reviewed the legal opinions of the OLC      regarding the CIA's interrogation program, please describe,      in detail, the standards of review applicable to any such OPR      review. Also, provide a copy of any standards of conduct or      any other Department of Justice policy guidance regarding the      conduct of attorneys used by the OPR in its reviews. What      conclusions did OPR reach in any such review?       c. How many attorneys currently work in the Office of      Professional Responsibility? Do any of them have expertise in      constitutional law, intelligence matters, treaty compliance,      and/or separation of powers? If so, please provide detailed      information regarding each attorney's individual expertise in      these areas. Is the OPR seeking outside guidance in any of      these areas? If so, please provide specific information on      these individuals or sources.       d. Did any of the personnel in the OPR work on cases or      policies arising from our government's response to the 9/11      attacks? If so, please provide the names of these      individuals.       3. Attorney General Mukasey and Deputy Attorney General      Filip were presented with a draft of an OPR report near the      end of the Bush Administration. This was after more than four      years of investigation and thousands of dollars in taxpayer      funds being expended. Press reports have suggested that      Mukasey and Filip rejected the idea that OLC attorneys should      be subject to sanctions.       a. Please explain why you have decided to overrule Attorney      General Mukasey's decision. Also, please provide the      Committee with all instances, if any, where an incoming      Attorney General has reversed the decision of his or her      predecessor regarding a recommendation by the OPR.       b. News reports suggest that the OPR will criticize the      Bybee memorandum that argues that the anti-torture statute      cannot interfere with the President's constitutional      authorities. Did the OPR ever investigate the opinions of the      Clinton Justice Department to determine if it claimed that      the President's constitutional authorities would allow him to      act in violation of Acts of Congress? If not, why not? If so,      please provide those opinions.       c. Does the OPR report address whether the interrogation      methods used actually produced useful intelligence? If not,      why not? If so, please list all U.S. Government personnel      interviewed by the OPR to make such a determination.       4. The provision of accurate legal advice regarding the      conduct of intelligence operations will necessarily entail      the consideration of not only many types of activities, but      also very difficult legal issues. On many occasions,      reasonable attorneys may disagree on whether such activities      are consistent with or violate United States or international      law. The investigation, and possible sanctioning, of      attorneys for the provision of legal advice in areas of law      that are less than clear will absolutely have a chilling      effect on their ability to provide accurate legal opinions.      Faced with sanctions, attorneys will undoubtedly choose to      stay well within the law. Intelligence operations will then      he unnecessarily limited falling well short of what the      Congress and the President may be prepared to sanction. With      this in mind, won't risk aversion driven by chilled legal      advice recreate the bureaucratic attitude that contributed to      our inability to detect and stop the 9/11 attacks?       5. Do you believe the President has the legal authority to      bring terrorists, former     terrorists or anyone who has received terrorist training into      the United States and release them into our communities? If      so, please provide a copy of that authority?       6. In your testimony before the Committee you stated that      with ``regard to the release decisions that we will make, we      will look at these cases on an individualized basis and make      determinations as to where they can appropriately be      placed.'' What are the criteria on which you will base a      decision to place an individual currently being held in      Guantanamo in the United States? Please be more specific than      the general guidance given in the President's Executive      Order.       Thank you for your immediate attention to these matters.           Sincerely,                                                   Richard Shelby.
