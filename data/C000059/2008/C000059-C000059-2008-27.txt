Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Larry Parrish is one of these individuals. On July 24, 2008, a retirement dinner will be held in honor of Larry's 16 years of service as the county executive officer for Riverside County.  As the county executive officer, Larry manages county finances and operations, consistent with the policies established by the Board of Supervisors. In January 1995, supervisors centralized Mr. Parrish's managerial role by expanding his oversight of the many and diverse services provided to the county's 1.4 million residents. Under Larry's leadership, county departments have charted an aggressive course to meet the board's vision of targeting scarce resources to sustain high-priority services despite State reductions to local funding.  Mr. Parrish's 32-year career in county government includes key positions with both local and statewide focus. His experience as a county executive spans nearly 15 years, having served in this capacity in both Santa Barbara and Orange Counties. Prior to coming to Riverside County, he also spent 2 years as a Sacramento-based legislative advocate. Mr. Parrish entered county government in the probation field, rising to become chief probation officer for the counties of Santa Cruz and Santa Barbara.  For 8 years, Mr. Parrish served as a school board member of Santa Cruz City Schools. He was an instructor at Cabrillo Junior College in Santa Cruz County and a lecturer at the U.C. Irvine Graduate School of Management. He has also served as a Finance Corporation Board Member for the California State Association of Counties. Larry received a B.A. in sociology from Northwest Nazarene College, Nampa, Idaho.  In 1996, the University of California at Riverside named Mr. Parrish Public Management Leader of the Year. Mr. Parrish and his wife, Kathie, currently reside in Rancho Mirage, California. He has two grown children, one granddaughter and one grandson.  Larry's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Riverside, California. I am proud to call Larry a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires.                          ____________________
