President, with the advent of the digital age, we had great hopes that the possibility of distributing music, films, books, and software on the Internet would bring us an unprecedented variety of content online with ever-increasing ease. Unfortunately, those hopes have not yet been realized. The very ease of duplication and distribution that is the hallmark of digital content has meant that piracy of that content is just as easy. The very real--and often realized--threat that creative works will simply be duplicated and distributed freely online has restricted, rather than enhanced, the amount and variety of creative works one can receive over the Internet. Part of combating piracy includes offering a legal alternative to it. Another important part is enforcing the rights of copyright owners. SenatorHatch and I have been working with artists, authors, and software developers to create an environment in which copyright is protected, so that we can all enjoy American creativity, and so that copyright owners can be paid for their work.  In the coming months we will be discussing numerous responses to this problem. One critically important part of the attack on this problem will be to bring the resources and expertise of the United States Attorneys' Offices to bear on wholesale copyright infringers. For too long these attorneys have been hindered in their pursuit of pirates, by the fact that they were limited to bringing criminal charges with high burdens of proof. In the world of copyright, a criminal charge is unusually difficult to prove because the defendant must have known that his conduct was illegal and he must have willfully engaged in the conduct anyway. For this reason prosecutors can rarely justify bringing criminal charges, and copyright owners have been left alone to fend for themselves, defending their rights only where they can afford to do so. In a world in which a computer and an Internet connection are all the tools you need to engage in massive piracy, this was an intolerable predicament.  Some steps have already been taken. The Allen-Leahy amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, on Combating Piracy of U.S. Intellectual Property in Foreign Countries, provided $2.5 million for the Department of State to assist foreign countries in combating piracy of U.S. copyrighted works. By providing equipment and training to law enforcement officers, it will help those countries that are not members of OECD, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, to enforce intellectual property protections.  Senator Hatch and I are investigating another needed response to this problem that would give the Attorney General the authority to bring a civil action against copyright infringers. This authority would not supplant either the criminal provisions of the Copyright Act, or the remedies available to the copyright owner in a private suit. Rather, it would allow the Government to bring its resources to bear on this immense problem, and to ensure that more creative works are made available online, that those works are more affordable, and that the people who work to bring them to us are paid for their efforts.  We hope to introduce a bill on this matter soon, and we look forward to continuing our efforts to bring our country's law enforcement tools into the 21st century, just as our technologies have advanced.                          ____________________
