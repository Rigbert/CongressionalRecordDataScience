As he says, I have expressed a concern with respect to that issue. However, having said that, I am not going to anticipate at this point in time what the Budget Committee is going to do. Clearly the Budget Committee is having hearings and the Budget Committee will be, some weeks from now, marking up a budget and bringing it to the floor.  As you know, we are very committed on this side of the aisle to PAYGO, paying our bills and trying to reduce our deficit. Clearly we have added very substantially to the deficit because of the economic crisis that confronts us, but we still feel a great responsibility to move ahead on making sure that we move towards reducing that deficit in the long term.  Clearly the President has proposed from our perspective one of the most honest budgets that we have received in the sense that it includes costs of the war, it includes costs for adjusting the alternative minimum tax, it includes the costs within its budget contemplation of fixing the doctors payments for Medicare. So in all those ways and more, this budget sets forth a responsible alternative for us to pursue. In addition, as the gentleman knows, it provides for the continuation of a tax cut for 95 percent of American families and individuals. So we think those are all very important proposals. We know that the Budget Committee will be considering that.  As the gentleman knows, both your side of the aisle and my side of the aisle will be discussing and debating that and we will be adopting a budget. I do not want to at this point in time anticipate each and every item that they may or may not include in that budget, however.
