 President, there is no particular need to prolong this debate. I want to make a couple observations.  It has been suggested that because Republican candidates accepted taxpayer funds to run for President, that is somehow an endorsement. It is noteworthy that President Reagan alwayschecked ``no'' proudly on his tax return on the notion of using taxpayer funding for Presidential elections.
