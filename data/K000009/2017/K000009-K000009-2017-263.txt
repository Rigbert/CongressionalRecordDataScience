Speaker, I rise today in memory of Reverend Paul Kwiatkowski, who passed away in early December.  Rev. Kwiatkowski was known throughout Northwest Ohio for his intellect, humor, knowledge, and empathy. Ordained a priest at St. Peter Basilica in Rome in 1964, Father Kwiatkowski has dedicated his entire life to serving the people in parishes at Our Lady of Lourdes, Holy Spirit Seminary, St. James, Immaculate Conception, and St. Hedwig in Toledo, as well as St. Mary Parish in Bluffton and St. Joseph Parish in Maumee. St. Hedwig is notable as Father Kwiatkowski's great-grandfather was one of the original bricklayers of the church in 1891. He was incredibly dedicated to the parishes and the communities he served, a truth highlighted in Rev. Kwiatkowski's presence as a violinist with the Perrysburg Symphony for 45 years.  As many parents do, Rev. Kwiatkowski's parents, Ted and Evelyn, knew he was musically inclined from a young age. Few parents experience the joy of knowing their child is also inclined to serve others. When neighborhood children gathered to play, Rev. Kwiatkowski often pretended to be their priest. His dream was realized when he enrolled in seminary studies at St. Meinrad Seminary in Indiana and the Pontifical North American College in Rome.  His devotion to people and his community led him to accept a teaching position at his alma mater, Central Catholic High School, after his retirement. Father Kwiatkowski's parishioners, students, family and friends, were buoyed by the joy and fellowship he brought into their lives each and every day. For many who knew him, the first words to describe the Reverend would be ``fun'' and ``compassionate.'' A man with a bright, infectious spirit, Father Kwiatkowski will be dearly missed. He was an institution unto himself in Northwest Ohio, and will long be remembered as such.  In every parish community he served, Father Paul left a neighborhood and his church property in an improved condition. Buildings were restored, streets paved, festivals established, church celebrations enhanced. He was gifted and kind.  As a fellow Polish-American, I will remember his participation every Memorial Day at the Veterans' Mass at Mt. Carmel Cemetery in Toledo. He arranged for an organ to be brought on site, he played the violin as his vestments blew in the soft spring breeze, he distributed communion to the gathered worshippers who were dressed so royally for the solemn occasion. Fr. Paul made each occasion beautiful and worthy of the people he served. He was an extraordinary diocese priest who cared and shepherded his flock with great love.                          ____________________
