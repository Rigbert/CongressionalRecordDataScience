Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment. This amendment was offered in the committee. It was defeated 24 to 11. I believe it is a deal killer. It was designed to block export volumes by giving the President limited authority to place a volume cap on exports. The export ban requires 1.6 million barrels of oil produced today be shipped to the West Coast. This again is a cap, it is a requirement, it will affect the California production area, it will not give us the jobs. This is opposed, frankly, by the administration. As the gentleman from Louisiana says, I agree with this administration, but the previous administration also said the same thing: This again interferes with the marketplace.  It is my belief that it will not do everything we want it to do if we adopt the amendment, so I strongly oppose the amendment, and urge ``no'' on the amendment.
