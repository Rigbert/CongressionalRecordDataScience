 President, I would like to take a moment today to recognize Dr. Alfonso Batres with the Department of Veterans Affairs for his dedicated service to our Nation's veterans. Dr. Batres is a Vietnam veteran who now serves as the chief officer for Readjustment Counseling Service, where he has devoted his career to building a national network of community-based vet centers. At these vet centers, veterans can obtain counseling, job assistance, and medical referrals, in addition to other services.  Dr. Batres was recently awarded a 2011 Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medal from the Partnership for Public Service. The award, also known as a ``Sammy,'' is awarded annually to exceptional Federal employees. Specifically, Dr. Batres was awarded the 2011 Career Achievement Medal, which recognizes a Federal employee for significant accomplishments throughout a lifetime of achievement in public service.  Under Dr. Batres' leadership, the number of vet centers across the country has dramatically expanded from 200 to 300 in an effort to meet the growing needs of hundreds of thousands of combat veterans and their families. In addition, Dr. Batres created and launched 50 mobile vet centers, greatly improving the access to services available to veterans. Dr. Batres also developed the Combat Call Center, a national call-in service where combat veterans can call in to talk to another combat veteran regarding any readjustment issues they may be facing.  Dr. Batres is an especially deserving recipient of the Career Achievement Medal as he has led the Vet Center Program to provide services to a record level of veterans and their family members. As a result of Dr. Batres' efforts, over 191,000 veterans and their family members visited vet centers nearly 1.3 million times in the year 2010 alone.  Vet centers have proven so successful due to the unique services they provide, which seek to treat the whole person. At vet centers, combat veterans can receive counseling from other combat veterans who truly understand the struggles veterans face. In 2010, approximately 80 percent of vet center staff members were veterans, 60 percent were combat veterans, and approximately one third of all Vet Center staff had served in Iraq or Afghanistan.  In addition, vet centers are located in convenient locations within communities that possess a large population of underserved veterans. The programs are constantly adapting to meet the evolving needs of veterans and have strict protections in place in order to ensure maximum privacy for veterans. This is a truly revolutionary method of delivering services and Dr. Batres' vision, along with his natural propensity to foster young talent, have proven invaluable in its success.  Dr. Batres' selfless service on behalf of our Nation's veterans has greatly improved the lives of many, and I am so pleased to see his achievements recognized.                          ____________________
