Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to a gentleman who has given long and faithful service to the trade union movement in Toledo. Dean Chase recently retired as president of the Toledo Area UAW-CAP Council. Dean had served the CAP Council as its president since 1981, and he has spent most of his adult life dedicated to improving the lives of working men and women. Dean was also president of UAW Local 11 at the City Auto Stamping Plant for 20 years.  Born in Toledo, Dean Chase, has lived in our community all his life. He attended Cherry School, Scott High School, and the University of Toledo. Married to Betty Lamb in 1950, Dean will have time to enjoy his two grandchildren and three great grandchildren in his retirement. Dean's outstanding leadership in his union and his community have made Toledo a better place to live and work.  Let this special tribute express our sincerest appreciation and best wishes to Dean Chase.                          ____________________
