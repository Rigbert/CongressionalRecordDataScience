 President, I am pleased to join Senator Grassley in re-introducing the Protecting Kids from Candy-Flavored Drugs Act of 2015, formerly known as the Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act.  For years, law enforcement has seen drug dealers flavor and market their illegal drugs to entice minors, using techniques like combining drugs with chocolate and fruit flavors, and even packaging them to look like actual candy and soda. This bill would address this serious and dangerous problem by providing stronger penalties when drug dealers alter controlled substances by combining them with beverages or candy products, marketing or packaging them to resemble legitimate products, or flavoring or coloring them, all with the intent to sell the drugs to minors.  Recent reports by law enforcement and by the media demonstrate the need for this legislation. Last year, a captain in the Drugs and Vice Division of an Oregon police department told my office that he ``routinely encounter[s]'' ecstasy; it is ``often found packaged with cartoon characters on the labeling[,] shaped in pacifier form[,] or with the outline of various animals stamped [on the] drug when in pill form.'' He continued that `` `[c]andy' bracelets of MDMA [ecstasy] are also common. Various unique colors of pills are also frequently encountered with the clear intent to market and make the drug appealing to the young.''  Also last year, a narcotics team member in an Oregon sheriff's office told my office that he frequently encounters gummy bears laced with Xanex. The ``only customers are juveniles,'' according to the officer. He noted that if a youth gets hooked, he will become a regular customer.  Law enforcement has made several notable busts of large productions of candied or flavored drugs. In January 2013, the Drug Enforcement Administration seized THC-laden soft drinks, cookies, brownies, and candy from two phony medical marijuana dispensaries in my home state of California. These dispensaries grossed an estimated $3.5 million annually. The names of the products seized show how the purveyors of these drugs marketed them under names that resembled popular soda and candy products: bottles were labeled ``7 High,'' ``Dr. Feelgood,'' and ``Laughing Lemonade''; cookies and brownies had such names as ``White Chip Hash Brownie'' and ``Reese's Crumbled Hash Brownie; and candy was named ``Jolly Stones THC Medicated Hard Candies'' and ``Stone Candy.''  Around Halloween 2013, police seized more than 40 pounds of THC-laced candy from a campus apartment at West Chester University, outside of Philadelphia. This candy was vividly colored, in a virtual rainbow assortment--pink, yellow, orange, blue, and red. When college students are peddling these drugs, it is not hard to see how minors can become targets of the operation.  Many recent incidents involve methamphetamine, a drug whose users face a ``very high'' risk of ``developing psychotic symptoms--hallucinations and delusions,'' according to a recent Harvard Medical School publication. A 2007 article in USA Today entitled ``DEA: Flavored meth use on the rise'' stated that ``[r]eports of candy-flavored methamphetamine are emerging around the nation, stirring concern among police and abuse prevention experts that drug dealers are marketing the drug to younger people.'' In March of 2012, police in Chicago warned parents about a drug that ``looks and smells like candy,'' called ``strawberry quick'' or ``strawberry meth.'' Because of the drug's similarity to candy, police urged parents to tell their children not to take candy from anyone, not even a classmate.  Regrettably, this is a problem that has persisted for many years, with drug dealers trying various methods to lure kids to try many dangerous drugs. The dealers' logic is simple: the best way to create a life-long customer is to hook that person when he or she is young. According to an Indiana sheriff quoted in a 2007 article entitled ``Fruity meth aimed at kids,'' flavoring a drug like methamphetamine makes it ``more attractive to teens, because it takes away meth's normally bitter taste, and some dealers will tell potential users this meth is safer, and has less side effects.''  That is why the practice of flavoring or coloring drugs to entice youth is so dangerous. It deceives the young customer into believing that he or she is not actually ingesting drugs, or at least not ingesting drugs that are as potent as non-flavored drugs. One in three teens already believes there is ``only a slight or no risk in trying [methamphetamine],'' according to the 2007 National Meth Use & Attitudes Survey. When you flavor methamphetamine or market it as candy or soda, the number of teens who believe that the drug is not harmful is surely higher.  The size and sophistication of some of these operations is particularly alarming. In March of 2006, DEA discovered large-scale marijuana cultivation and production facilities in Emeryville and Oakland, CA. Thousands of marijuana plants, and hundreds of marijuana-related soda, candy, and other products were seized from the drug dealers' facilities. The products were designed and packaged to look like legitimate products, including an item called ``Munchy Way'' candy bars.  Similarly, in March of 2008, Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, agents seized cocaine near Modesto, CA, that was valued at $272,400; a significant quantity had been flavored like cinnamon, coconut, lemon, or strawberry. After that raid, one DEA agent stated that ``[a]ttempting to lure new, younger customers to a dangerous drug by adding candy `flavors' is an unconscionable marketing technique.''  I completely agree. That is why we need to act now to stop those who alterdrugs to make them more appealing to youth.  Under current Federal law, there is no enhanced penalty for a person who alters a controlled substance to make the drug more appealing to youth. Someone who alters a controlled substance in ways prohibited by the legislation we are introducing today would be subject to an additional penalty of up to 10 years, in addition to the penalty for the underlying offense. If someone is convicted of a second offense that is prohibited by the act, that person would face an additional penalty of up to 20 years. Furthermore, a prosecutor who does not charge the separate crime of candying or flavoring a drug may still seek an enhancement at sentencing, under this bill.  This bill sends a strong and clear message to drug dealers--if you flavor or candy up your drugs to try to entice our children, there will be a very heavy price to pay. It will help stop drug dealers from engaging in these activities, and punish them appropriately if they don't.  I am pleased that many of the leading national law enforcement and anti-drug organizations support this bill: the Fraternal Order of Police, the National District Attorneys Association, the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and the National High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area, HIDTA, Directors' Association have all endorsed this legislation. The individuals that these organizations represent are on the front lines working to keep these drugs out of our communities.  The Senate passed a similar version of this legislation by unanimous consent in the 111th Congress, but it was not considered in the House. The time is now for Congress to finish this work, and enact this bill into law.  I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator Grassley in supporting this bill.                                 ______                                       By
