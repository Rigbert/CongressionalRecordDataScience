President, Brunswick Naval Air Station, which is in my own home State of Maine, is a facility of great importance to our Nation's military. While I could reflect today upon the bravery and tenacity of the P-3 Orion pilots at Brunswick who have supported the global war on terrorism, today I share with my colleagues the significant benefits and strategic advantages that Brunswick Naval Air Station offers our efforts in the areas of homeland defense and maritime interdiction operations. As we look toward the future, and develop new tools to address future threats, we must ensure that these tools are located in facilities where their advanced capabilities can be fully utilized. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that a white paper, authored by Ralph Dean, one of Brunswick's great advocates, entitled Homeland Defense and Maritime Interdiction Operations, be printed in the Congressional Record. The white paper provides significant insight on the great advantages that Brunswick Naval Air Station offers.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Homeland Defense and Maritime Interdiction Operations       In the business of homeland defense (as in real estate),      location is the key. Imagine a naval search for a single,      relatively small merchant ship, which intelligence sources      have revealed has a hold full of weaponized chemicals. Its      destination is a major coastal city. After tense hours of      searching, a maritime patrol aircraft locates two possible      suspect vessels out of hundreds in one of the world's busiest      maritime areas. The aircraft directs two fast naval frigates      to the vicinity of the targets. The frigates and their      onboard helicopters intercept and challenge the target      vessels. One vessel submits to search and is determined to be      harmless. The other however, resists interception and      boarding. Finally, helicopter-borne special operations      commandoes descend upon the vessel, board and secure the ship      and its potentially deadly cargo.       This scenario actually occurred in the western      Mediterranean Sea last month. The weapons of mass destruction      seized were simulated; the entire sequence of events part of      a successful exercise of Maritime Interdiction Operations      conducted by forces of four NATO nations.       Maritime interdiction capability is a hot item right now      for defense planners, a particularly important focus of a      larger effort known as the Proliferation Security Initiative      (PSI). PSI is being advanced by 15 core member nations,      brought together at the request of President Bush last year      to develop cooperative diplomatic, military, and intelligence      means to stop ships which may be carrying weapons of mass      destruction (WMD). Many of the maritime interdiction precepts      under PSI are evolving from a multinational ``game''      conducted last September at the Naval War College in Newport,      Rhode Island, and refining these concepts and procedures is      clearly a high priority for the nations involved. Japan      recently hosted the latest multinational PSI exercise, the      twelfth in the short time since the Initiative began.       As the Mediterranean exercise and others showed, Maritime      Patrol Aircraft (MPA) are a critical, almost always essential      part of successful maritime interdiction. Whether conducting      a broad-area search, refining a datum provided by other      (including national) sensors, or vectoring surface, rotary-     wing or     special-warfare assets to a target, MPA are a key link in the      chain from initial intelligence to intercept. MPA are of      particular value in crowded shipping lanes, in areas of poor      weather or visibility. No other platform is as versatile in      this mission area, one as old and enduring as naval aviation      itself. But land-based aircraft need bases to fly from--bases      which optimize their speed, range, and turnaround capability      on missions protecting the nation's most vital areas. The      seaborne WMD threat has become primary. Maritime interdiction      platforms and infrastructure must be top concerns for naval      strategists and planners.       Fortunately help is on the way, again from patrol aviation.      The Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) promises a      substantial increase in capability for commanders responsible      for maritime interdiction. Based on the Boeing 737-800, the      MMA will bring increased speed, range, and reliability      compared to the current workhorse MPA, the P-3C Orion. MMA      sensors for interdiction missions will include a new electro-     optical and infrared spectrum sensor, moving target      indicators, an enhanced inverse synthetic aperture /      synthetic aperture radar, and a new signals intelligence      suite. Perhaps best of all, MMA will control and exploit the      capabilities of the Broad-Area Maritime Surveillance (BAMS)      Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.       The aircraft themselves will certainly be fantastic, but      land-based planes are only as good as the base they operate      from, and the future homes for MMA/BAMS have not yet been      identified. Conventional wisdom has it that the transition      from the P-3 force to one of fewer than half as many MMA will      inevitably result in a reduction in the number of maritime      patrol aircraft bases in the U.S. This assumption may be      incorrect, since optimum basing for maritime interdiction      assets is as important as the assets themselves. Bases must      be located to provide rapid response to all coastal areas,      particularly those containing major population centers and      port facilities. They must be versatile, able to support not      just MPA, but rotary wing units and special warfare forces      with easy access, unencumbered space and facilities for      joint, coordinated training, and self-protection and security      from intrusion or attack. Maritime interdiction is a team      game, and collocation of the assets for training and      operations is essential.       The current MPA force laydown includes P-3 bases at Kaneohe      Bay in Hawaii, Jacksonville, Florida, Brunswick, Maine, and      Whidbey Island in Washington State. A robust P-3 capability      is maintained for fleet support and other missions at the      North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego. These last four      bases, at the ``corners'' of the continental U.S. are      perfectly situated for maritime interdiction of WMD threats.      From these sites, MMA response time to any point on the coast      will be less than two hours, and all major sea lanes of      approach can be covered within the 1200--1500 nautical mile      operational range of the aircraft.       All four sites have their advantages, and all are essential      to that coverage. For example, the Naval Air Station in      Brunswick, Maine has remarkable potential as a joint forces      maritime interdiction center under the PSI initiative: The      only remaining fully capable active-duty military airfield in      the northeastern U.S. and near its coastal cities--a region      of over 48 million people; immediately adjacent to all major      sea lanes in the North Atlantic; more than 63,000 square      miles of unencumbered airspace for training and exercise      missions; versatile and extensive modern facilities      (including a new hangar designed specifically for MMA and      BAMS) and land with no encroachment issues; an established      all-weather training area available for Special Forces and      other units; completely secured perimeter and outstanding      force protection layout and capability; and easy access by      all forms of transportation.       The ports and shipping lanes to the northeastern region of      the United States deserve the protection which can only be      provided by maritime interdiction forces operating from a      base within that region. Obviously transatlantic shipping is      critical to our nation's economy, but as west coast ports      operate at capacity, more and more operators are redirecting      their shipments from Asia directly to the northeast. These      shippers prefer to have their cargo spend the additional 7 to      10 days at sea rather than accept delays at west coast ports      and during rail transport across the continent. Container      traffic to New York alone has risen 65% in the last five      years, the fastest rate of growth in over 50 years. All of      the enormous volume of shipping to the region must be      monitored, and if necessary interdicted whenever it may pose      a threat.       The Defense Department's Base Closure and Realignment      Commission (BRAC) will in 2005 identify military      infrastructure for permanent elimination. The BRAC process      must carefully factor in future requirements for maritime      interdiction as they are just now being developed under the      PSI. Caution is indicated--the nation cannot afford to close      irreplaceable military facilities just as new concepts and      capabilities are being developed to address a burgeoning      threat. Maritime interdiction of weapons of mass destruction      headed for our shores is zero-defect work, and the selection      of bases for that effort must be equally judicious and      effective. Location is an enduring essential--we must keep      open our bases ``at the corners.''                          ____________________
