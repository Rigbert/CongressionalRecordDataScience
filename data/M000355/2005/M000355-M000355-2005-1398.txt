 We will continue the amending process, and the chairman and ranking member will work through amendments as they are offered throughout the day. Rollcall votes are expected in relation to those amendments. On behalf of the majority leader, I encourage Senators who wish to offer amendments to the bill to contact the bill managers as soon as possible.  In addition to the highway bill, we will also act on a budget reconciliation conference report, should it become available. The Senate may also act on any nominations available for floor consideration.  Just moments ago, I filed two cloture motions with respect to two Cabinet-level nominations. These votes will occur on Friday of this week, unless some other agreement is reached prior to that time. Therefore, Senators should expect a busy day tomorrow and Friday, with rollcall votes possible throughout as we complete our work prior to the recess.                          ____________________[Page S4435]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
