  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation, the Drain the Swamp Act. My bill would make violations of President-elect Trump's recently announced revolving door lobby ban punishable by law. He said that he will bar political appointees from lobbying for 5 years after they serve in his administration and permanently from lobbying for foreign governments.  Unfortunately, his proposal lacks any enforcement mechanism. I want this to be more than a press release. I want to help him in this effort. Just look at the Office of Special Trade Representative. Why is our trade policy so bad? Because those people worked for industry and then come back to work for the government and go work for industry and promote their own interests. That goes on in many agencies.  This would be a good thing for America.  So I would extend the existing penalties which apply to very few people over a shorter period of time with penalties up to $50,000 and 1 year in jail to cover all of the 3,648 executive branch political appointees.  I am introducing it today knowing it is the end of the Congress, but I am going to provide it to the Trump transition team in the hope that they will endorse this bill, which I will introduceon the first day of the next Congress and hope to have President-elect Trump's support to keep the law behind his promise.                          ____________________
