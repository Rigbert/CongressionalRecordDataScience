 President, I, too, want to thank the appropriations chair, as well as the ranking member, Senator Byrd, who have been very helpful in this process, and in particular to thank the Senator from Florida, Senator Mack, for a job well done.  We have not agreed on every part, but he has been wonderful to work with and I appreciate his willingness to step down and go through this with me. I thank him, and Jim English, who worked with me.  I appreciate the opportunity to work with you on my first bill, Senator.                          ____________________
