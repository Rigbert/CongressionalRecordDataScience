 There are a lot of reasons we're in this pickle we are today. But let's just remember one. George Bush elected 2000; Dick Cheney's secret meetings with the oil and gas industry. They formulated an energy policy. That energy policy was adopted by the Republican House, the Republican Senate, and signed by the Republican President. That was in 2005. Many of us said it was shortsighted, it would make us more dependent upon imported oil, and it has.  When George Bush was elected, 52 percent of our oil was imported. Today it's 58 percent. Many of us said it would drive up the price. It has. When George Bush was elected, it was $1.46 a gallon. Today it's $4.39 a gallon in my district.  So they're saying now suddenly, Whoa. It's the Democrats' fault. No. We're living under the failures of the Republican oil industry energy policy. There's actually 164,968,695 reasons why we're living under that. That's the amount of money the Republican Party has received from the oil industry in the last 18 years, $164 million in political contributions. Now, that's a pretty big motivation.  There's another thing going on here. Since George Bush took office, the profits of the oil industry have been $511 billion in this country. That's $511 billion out of Americans' pockets and into the oil industry's pockets. They made more money under 7 years of George Bush than they made in the entire quarter century preceding his presidency. Yeah. There's something a little bit rotten here.  They talk about drilling offshore and all of that stuff. Well, let's talk about short-term relief.  There's three ways to get short-term relief. One is release our oil. Release our oil. We have paid to put oil in the Strategic Reserve for emergencies. This is an emergency. It's been done three times: 1991, the price went down 33 percent; 2000, it went down 18 percent; 2005, it went down 9 percent.                              {time}  1230  That would give relief today at the pump, and there's another thing that we could do, but they're against this, too.  The gentleman from Texas talked about, oh, they want to file a complaint against OPEC. Well, you know, we probably do, but George Bush isn't going to do that, that's for sure. Here's George Bush holding hands with King Faisal of Saudi Arabia when he was over there begging them to increase production.  OPEC's production, with a doubling in the price of oil, is down 2\1/2\ percent. They have colluded to drive up the price of oil and limit the supply, and we have a legal option, which the President refuses to use. He refuses to file a complaint in the World Trade Organization for a clear violation of the rules of the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, article 11, by the OPEC countries.
