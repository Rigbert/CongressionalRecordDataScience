 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, first, I appreciate the gentleman's concerns. I might also add, the gentleman should never have to apologize for a delay, but as the gentleman knows, the Committee on Ways and Means worked on this bill and marked it up last week in open process and within the rules of their committee and the House and many of the provisions that were added to the Military Tax Fairness bill were added, in many cases, by voice vote and unanimous votes. Some were controversial, but the committee acted in good faith and marked up the bill and there was full participation by every Member on that committee.  Unfortunately, as the bill headed towards the floor, as the gentleman knows, there were concerns raised by our Members and as well as the gentleman's Members, and we felt compelled that we needed to address those concerns before we actually bring it to the floor, and that is what we are going to try to do in the next several days, and hopefully, we will get a bill that everybody can vote for.
