Speaker, I rise today to support an effort by the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman), one of the most distinguished Members of this House. He has called for full disclosure of the massive unbid $7 billion contract, that is 7,000 millions of dollars, that Halliburton Corporation has just received from the Department of Defense for the reconstruction of the demolished nation of Iraq. The emergency no-bid contract for Halliburton, again not competitively bid, is supposed to fight oil fires.  Vice President Dick Cheney just happened to head up Halliburton Corporation after he left the first Bush administration and before rejoining this Bush administration. Reports indicate he currently receives $180,000 per year in payments from Halliburton Corporation in the form of deferred compensation.  The company apparently will be able to expand this no-bid $7 billion contract, first, to operate the oil fields themselves and, second, to distribute the oil to which our Nation is so hopelessly addicted.  In a letter to Lieutenant General Robert Flowers, commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman) said he did not mean to suggest that the Corps has intentionally misled anyone about Halliburton's contract. However, the gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman) is concerned, as all of us should be, about the reluctance of the Bush administration to provide complete information about the Halliburton contract and other contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq.  The gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman) questioned how the long-term contracts for Halliburton could be reconciled with the administration's stated intent to give the Iraqi people control of the oil in Iraq.  The gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman) said, ``Only now, over 5 weeks after the contract was first disclosed, are Members of Congress and the public learning that Halliburton Corporation may be asked to pump and distribute Iraqi oil under contract.''  The gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman) repeated the Corps' statement that the contract could be worth up to $7 billion for up to 2 years. Mr. Speaker, as the United States begins the long and expensive process of rebuilding in the wreckage of Iraq, perhaps we should reflect on the process of massive unbid contracts, using taxpayer dollars, to the company that was formerly headed by the Vice President. If the press were awake in America, they would pursue this story to the very ends of the Earth.  If the Congress were more responsible in fulfilling its responsibility as a co-equal branch of government to our taxpayers, we would have hearings into this connection. If the death of Vince Foster is worthy of congressional investigations, then certainly unbid billions of dollars of contracts to Halliburton and others close to this administration deserve at least the same level of scrutiny.  This Member of Congress intends to offer a bill to assure competitive bidding in any contracts related to rebuilding in Iraq or Afghanistan. It is amazing that I even have to do this, and it will be interesting to see who opposes me.  The Atlanta Journal Constitution said in a recent editorial that the secret Halliburton deal endangers U.S. credibility. The Constitution questioned why a Halliburton subsidiary was the only company invited to bid on the Iraqi contract, why the contract was kept secret from the public until 2 weeks after it was signed this March, and why the true scope of the contract was not disclosed until last week. All are legitimate questions, particularly in a Nation that is trying to inculcate the rule of law and transparency as part of the nation-building process in Iraq.  The Journal Constitution also raised questions about a previous contract between the Halliburton subsidiary and the U.S. Army during Mr. Cheney's reign at Halliburton. The GAO determined in 1997 that Halliburton charged the Army more than $85 per sheet of plywood for building projects in Bosnia. A follow-up report in 2000 said the subsidiary's crews were being paid to clean offices as often as four times a day, and the company receives more than $2 billion for work being done in the Balkans.  Even if the Halliburton subsidiary were the only company capable of doing work in Iraq, which most oil industry people contradict, then why all the secrecy about the no-bid contract?  Mr. Speaker, Reuters News Service reported Halliburton has disclosed that it made approximately $2.4 million in improper payments to Nigeria, another oil regime getting favorable tax treatment.  The gentleman from California (Mr. Waxman) should be commended for his dogged pursuit of the truth. The American public should wish him well.                          ____________________
