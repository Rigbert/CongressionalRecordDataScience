 As you have read, we are discussing how to process the supplemental. As I indicated to you, it is my intention that we will pass the supplemental prior to Memorial Day. By that, I mean in sufficient time so the Senate can do so as well so we can pass it finally.  That is my hope and my intention. We are still working on the components of the supplemental, and very frankly, it has not yet been finally decided as to how that might be processed. Obviously, at times in the past it has been added to other legislation. In other times, it has been passed as a free-standing bill. Committee consideration, obviously, is part of the regular order, if we go that way, but there are other ways to go. We want to facilitate the passage of it as quickly as possible.
