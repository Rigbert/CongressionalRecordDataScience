 President, as cosponsor of the Freedom Act, I would like to add my voice to those who have spoken in its support.  But first I would like to thank Senator Snowe for her dedication and hard work in support of the many small business owners across her state and across the country who would benefit from this legislation.  As we all know, America's job creators are suffocating under regulations and redtape.  The administration doesn't seem to realize that all its interference has a human cost.  Businesses want to create jobs and help communities recover, but they can't.  Whether it is new financial requirements, health care mandates, energy mandates, onerous new fees, burdensome tax filing requirements, or threats of higher taxes, businesses today are faced with so many new rules and requirements from Washington that they can hardly see straight.  The Freedom Act says enough is enough.  This regulatory reform amendment would help give small businesses much-needed relief from the Federal government and its one-size-fits-all approach.  Specifically, it would modernize the Regulatory Flexibility Act to require that from now on, Federal agencies conduct a comprehensive and careful analysis of the potential impacts--both direct and indirect--of regulations on small businesses. It would make sure that the voices of small business owners are heard in government agencies that frankly don't seem to be listening to them.  This amendment has broad support from the small business community.  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Businesses have issued strong letters of support.  At a time when nearly 14 million Americans are looking for work, this is exactly the kind of legislation that would help America's job creators.  When I ask business owners what they want us to do to help them create jobs, they usually have a simple five-word response: get out of the way. That is what we are doing with this legislation.  And the only people who could possibly oppose it are those who think the needs of bureaucrats in Washington are more important than the needs of job creators everywhere else.  I thank Senator Snowe and Senator Coburn for their strong advocacy on behalf of small businesses.  I intend to vote for this important amendment. I urge my colleagues to do the same.                           Amendment No. 390
