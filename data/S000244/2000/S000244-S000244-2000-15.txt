Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 4271) to establish and expand programs relating to science, mathematics, engineering, and technology education, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 4271       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``National Science Education      Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) As concluded in the report of the Committee on Science      of the House of Representatives, ``Unlocking Our Future      Toward a New National Science Policy'', which was adopted by      the House of Representatives, the United States must maintain      and improve its preeminent position in science and technology      in order to advance human understanding of the universe and      all it contains, and to improve the lives, health, and      freedoms of all people.       (2) It is estimated that more than half of the economic      growth of the United States today results directly from      research and development in science and technology. The most      fundamental research is responsible for investigating our      perceived universe, to extend our observations to the outer      limits of what our minds and methods can achieve,     and to seek answers to questions that have never been asked      before. Applied research continues the process by applying      the answers from basic science to the problems faced by      individuals, organizations, and governments in the everyday      activities that make our lives more livable. The scientific-     technological sector of our economy, which has driven our      recent economic boom and led the United States to the longest      period of prosperity in history, is fueled by the work and      discoveries of the scientific community.       (3) The effectiveness of the United States in maintaining      this economic growth will be largely determined by the      intellectual capital of the United States. Education is      critical to developing this resource.       (4) The education program of the United States needs to      provide for 3 different kinds of intellectual capital. First,      it needs scientists, mathematicians, and engineers to      continue the research and development that are central to the      economic growth of the United States. Second, it needs      technologically proficient workers who are comfortable and      capable dealing with the demands of a science-based, high-     technology workplace. Last, it needs scientifically literate      voters and consumers to make intelligent decisions about      public policy.       (5) Student performance on the recent Third International      Mathematics and Science Study highlights the shortcomings of      current K-12 science and mathematics education in the United      States, particularly when compared to other countries. We      must expect more from our Nation's educators and students if      we are to build on the accomplishments of previous      generations. New methods of teaching science, mathematics,      engineering, and technology are required, as well as better      curricula and improved training of teachers.       (6) Science is more than a collection of facts, theories,      and results. It is a process of inquiry built upon      observations and data that leads to a way of knowing and      explaining in logically derived concepts and theories.      Mathematics is more than procedures to be memorized. It is a      field that requires reasoning, understanding, and making      connections in order to solve problems. Engineering is more      than just designing and building. It is the process of making      compromises to optimize design and assessing risks so that      designs and products best solve a given problem. Technology      is more than using computer applications, the Internet, and      programming. Technology is the innovation, change, or      modification of the natural environment, based on scientific,      mathematical, and engineering principles.       (7) Students should learn science primarily by doing      science. Science education ought to reflect the scientific      process and be object-oriented, experiment-centered, and      concept-based. Students should learn mathematics with      understanding that numeric systems have intrinsic properties      that can represent objects and systems in real life, and can      be applied in solving problems. Engineering education should      reflect the realities of real world design, and should      involve hands-on projects and require students to make trade-     offs based upon evidence. Students should learn technology as      both a tool to solve other problems and as a process by which      people adapt the natural world to suit their own purposes.      Computers represent a particularly useful form of technology,      enabling students and teachers to acquire data, model      systems, visualize phenomena, communicate and organize      information, and collaborate with others in powerful new      ways. A background in the basics of information technology is      essential for success in the modern workplace and the modern      world.       (8) Children are naturally curious and inquisitive. To      successfully tap into these innate qualities, education in      science, mathematics, engineering, and technology must begin      at an early age and continue throughout the entire school      experience.       (9) Teachers provide the essential connection between      students and the content they are learning. Prospective      teachers need to be identified and recruited by presenting to      them a career that is respected by their peers, is      financially and intellectually rewarding, contains sufficient      opportunities for advancement, and has continuing access to      professional development.       (10) Teachers need to have incentives to remain in the      classroom and improve their practice, and training of      teachers is essential if the results are to be good. Teachers      need to be knowledgeable of their content area, of their      curriculum, of up-to-date research in teaching and learning,      and of techniques that can be used to connect that      information to their students in their classroom.     SEC. 3. ASSURANCE OF CONTINUED LOCAL CONTROL.       Nothing in this Act may be construed to authorize any      department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States      to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over the      curriculum, program of instruction, administration, or      personnel of any educational institution or school system.

(e) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized      to be appropriated for the National Science Foundation to      carry out this section $5,000,000 for each of fiscal years      2001 through 2003.     SEC. 12. EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY UTILIZATION EXTENSION                    ASSISTANCE.       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to improve the      utilization of educational technologies in elementary and      secondary education by creating an educational technology      extension service based at undergraduate institutions of      higher education.       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:       (1) Extension services such as the Manufacturing Extension      Partnership and the Agricultural Extension Service have      proven to be effective public/private partnerships to      integrate new technologies and to improve utilization of      existing technologies by small to medium sized manufacturers      and the United States agricultural community.       (2) Undergraduate institutions of higher education working      with nonprofit organizations and State and Federal agencies      can tailor educational technology extension programs to meet      specific local and regional requirements.       (3) Undergraduate institutions of higher education, often      with the assistance of the National Science Foundation, have      for the past 20 years been integrating educational      technologies into their curricula, and as such they can draw      upon their own experiences to advise elementary and secondary      school educators on ways to integrate a variety of      educational technologies into the educational process.       (4) Many elementary and secondary school systems,      particularly in rural and traditionally underserved areas,      lack general information on the most effective methods to      integrate their existing technology infrastructure, as well      as new educational technology, into the educational process      and curriculum.       (5) Most Federal and State educational technology programs      have focused on acquiring educational technologies with less      emphasis on the utilization of those technologies in the      classroom and the training and infrastructural requirements      needed to efficiently support those types of technologies. As      a result, in many instances, the full potential of      educational technology has not been realized.       (6) Our global economy is increasingly reliant on a      workforce not only comfortable with technology, but also able      to integrate rapid technological changes into the production      process. As such, in order to remain competitive in a global      economy, it is imperative that we maintain a work-ready labor      force.       (7) According to ``Teacher Quality: A Report on the      Preparation and Qualifications of Public School Teachers'',      prepared by the Department of Education, only one in five      teachers felt they were well prepared to work in a modern      classroom.       (8) The most common form of professional development for      teachers continues to be workshops that typically last no      more than one day and have little relevance to teachers' work      in the classroom.       (9) A 1998 national survey completed by the Department of      Education found that only 19 percent of teachers had been      formally mentored by another teacher, and that 70 percent of      these teachers felt that this collaboration was very helpful      to their teaching.       (c) Program Authorized.--       (1) General authority.--The Director of the National      Science Foundation, in cooperation with the Secretary of      Education and the Director of the National Institute of      Standards and Technology, is authorized to provide assistance      for the creation and support of regional centers for the      utilization of educational technologies (hereinafter in this      section referred to as ``ETU Centers'').       (2) Functions of centers.--       (A) Establishment.--ETU Centers may be established at any      institution of higher education, but such centers may include      the participation of nonprofit entities, organizations, or      groups thereof.       (B) Objectives of centers.--The objective of the ETU      Centers is to enhance the utilization of educational      technologies in elementary and secondary education through--       (i) advising elementary and secondary school      administrators, school boards, and teachers on the adoption      and utilization of new educational technologies and the      utility of local schools' existing educational technology      assets and infrastructure;       (ii) participation of individuals from the private sector,      universities, State and local governments, and other Federal      agencies;       (iii) active dissemination of technical and management      information about the use of educational technologies; and       (iv) utilization, where appropriate, of the expertise and      capabilities that exist in Federal laboratories and Federal      agencies.       (C) Activities of centers.--The activities of the ETU      Centers shall include the following:       (i) The active transfer and dissemination of research      findings and ETU Center expertise to local school      authorities, including school administrators, school boards,      and teachers.       (ii) The training of teachers in the integration of local      schools existing educational technology infrastructure into      their instructional design.       (iii) The training and advising of teachers,      administrators, and school board members in the acquisition,      utilization, and support of educational technologies.
