Speaker, I feel constrained to respond in light of the fact that our manager is not here. When you lose 17-1, not showing up is probably the best advice. But I want to say to my brother Oxley, he and I are fraternity brothers and good friends. He is the manager of the Republican team. This was his first year as the manager. I hope it is not a preface of what is to come, because if it is, we on this side of the aisle are in a lot of trouble. But it was a good time. We played at one of the beautiful stadiums in America, in Bowie, Maryland, in my district.  On behalf of the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Sabo), our manager and all the players on both sides, I want to congratulate all of those who were responsible for raising over $100,000. That is the purpose of the game, to raise dollars for young people, for organizations in the city and in this community, to enhance the lives of children.  And some very old people feeling much older today than they felt the day before played last night so that much younger people, probably much better athletes, will have opportunities that they might not otherwise have.  I want to congratulate both Manager Oxley and Manager Sabo for their leadership.                          ____________________
