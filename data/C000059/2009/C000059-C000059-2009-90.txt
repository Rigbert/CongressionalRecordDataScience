Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated military community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. The Distinguished Flying Cross Society (DFCS) is such a group and I wholeheartedly support their efforts to build a National Distinguished Flying Cross Memorial at the March Field Air Museum (MFAM). This monument will ``perpetuate the memory of those persons who have been and those who will receive the Distinguished Flying Cross.''  I am honored to represent Air Force Village West (AFVW), a ``Continuing Care Retirement community'' (CCRC) that is home to and also provides medical care for over 680 retired military officers, their wives and widows. All the Services are represented among the residents: Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard, Public Health Service and NOAA.Eighty residents of the Village, who were flyers in their active duty days, organized the Inland Empire Chapter of the Distinguished Flying Cross Society which is the primary sponsor of the memorial. These members were awarded this prestigious medal under the Act which provided the award ``to any person while serving in any capacity with the Air Corps of the Army of the United States, including the National Guard and the Organized Reserves, or with the United States Navy since the 6th day of April 1917 has distinguished, or who, after the approval of this Act, distinguishes himself by heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in aerial flight.'' Among recipients are the 1st recipient of the medal Captain Charles L. Lindbergh, former President George H. W. Bush, former South Dakota Governor Joe Foss, Brig Gen. Jimmy Doolittle and the founder/organizer of the Air Force Village West retirement home, General Curtis Le May.  The memorial is a cooperative effort between the Air Force Village West Chapter, the March Field Air Museum, and the new DFCS Chapter. MFAM is located at March Air Reserve Base (MARB) which hosts the C-17As of the 792nd Air Mobility Wing (AMW) in addition to KC-135s, and C-130s. The Air National Guard also has a detachment of F-16s. The Memorial will be available to thousands of visitors each year and while viewing the static display at MFAM, visitors will be frequently treated to an operational air unit providing support to our troops in Iraq. Every year, MFAM has a front row seat to the MARB air show, which frequently features the Air Force Thunderbirds. It is a fitting place to honor the many aviators who have distinguished themselves by deeds performed in aerial flight. The monument will be topped by a model of the Loening OA-1A amphibian aircraft, which was flown on the Pan-American Goodwill Flight of 1926. The ten aviators who flew this mission were the first recipients of the Distinguished Flying Certificate from President Calvin Coolidge.  Madam Speaker, it is truly an honor to represent Air Force Village West, the Distinguished Flying Cross Society and to lend my support to the efforts to build a National Distinguished Flying Cross Memorial at the March Field Air Museum.                          ____________________
