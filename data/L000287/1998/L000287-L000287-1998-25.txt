Mr. Speaker, the scientific evidence is clear. Needle transfer programs can reduce HIV infection and save lives. Needle exchange programs do not increase drug use.  Last week, the Secretary of HHS announced that Federal funds would not, I repeat, would not fund needle exchange programs. Local governments can decide whether or not they want to fund these programs.  AIDS is a devastating disease. It is a devastating sickness. It is heartbreaking to know someone who is suffering with AIDS. Half of the new AIDS infections come from injection of drugs. We must do everything in our power, must use every resource at our command to reduce the spread of AIDS. We must fund research, we must provide health care, and we must let local governments make their own decisions.  If local governments choose to fund needle exchange programs, programs that reduce the spread of AIDS, we should not stand in their way. Leave it up to the City of Atlanta, to the City of New York, to the City of Birmingham to decide. Leave it to the doctors and the scientists. Leave it to the women and men of medicine. This is a matter of public health.  I, for one, will not stand in the way of local governments who want to save lives and reduce the spread of AIDS. Stop playing politics with the lives of our people who are living and suffering with HIV and AIDS.  I urge my colleagues vote no on this bill.
