 President, on this side of the aisle we have cleared this request, so there are no longer any problems over here. I know the senior Senator from West Virginia was hoping to work out some language on the mandatory spending provision. The chairman and the ranking member, I believe, are prepared to allow a vote on Senator Byrd's amendment, and that vote has been incorporated into this request. Therefore, I hope we can get this consent request worked out in the next day or so.  This bill is absolutely vital in that it provides for biomedical countermeasure research and development. We need to move forward on this bill. We really encourage the other side to understand the seriousness of this legislation, the importance of moving it forward.                          ____________________
