President, the Senate, with its long hours and demanding schedule is not generally known for the long tenure of its Members' staff. Proctor Jones is an exception to that rule. Proctor has served the Senate for more than 35 years. He has spent 27 of those years working for the Committee on Appropriations, outlasting seven committee chairmen. Nobody knows the ins and outs of the appropriations process, better than Proctor Jones.  The energy and water appropriations bill just won't be the same without Senator Johnston leading the Democratic members of the subcommittee and Proctor behind the scenes crafting the bill. It is not a coincidence that the energy and water appropriations bill is usually one of the first to be passed by Congress. Proctor's experience on appropriations, combined with Senator Johnston's bargaining skill made them a formidable pair. They will be sorely missed on the Appropriations Committee. I commend Proctor on his long and dedicated service to the Senate and wish him the best of luck.                          ____________________
