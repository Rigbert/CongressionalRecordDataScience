Chairman, do not make any mistake about this. The Weiner amendment will gut NASA. Do not make any mistake. This amendment will transfer the preeminence that we presently have in space to India and others and China especially.  As my friend, Mr. Feeney, from Florida was saying, China is investing significant amounts of dollars in their program, and their program is not a civil space program.  Our country's economy and success is because we prevailed in doing hard things. That is why we have the technology and the ability to do the computers, the cell phones, the satellites, that NASA helped create.  Do not vote for this amendment. It is the wrong thing to do. Vote down the Weiner amendment.
