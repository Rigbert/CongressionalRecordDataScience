President, I rise today in support of the resolution with my colleague, Senator Lamar Alexander, designating November, 2004, as American Music Month.  Of all the creative and artistic contributions our Nation has offered to the world in its short history, our music is perhaps the most definitively American aspect of our culture.  America's vast and profound repertoire of music expresses our country's vital cultural and social identities and empowers us to preserve our past and pursue our future; it transforms our wondrous and harsh experiences into potent messages that freely declare democratic choice and freedom of expression; it inspires social justice, enlivens collective action, and reflects our Nation's dynamic social movements.  Senator Alexander and I ask our colleagues to join with us in recognizing American musical heritage as an expression of this country's democratic freedoms and indomitable spirit.  Several prominent music organizations and their members have been celebrating American Music Month in November for many years.
