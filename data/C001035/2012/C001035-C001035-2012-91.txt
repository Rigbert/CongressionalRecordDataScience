President, I want to echo the thanks to everyone who was involved in formulating this very extensive unanimous consent agreement. We have been working extremely hard the last couple of days to make sure we were being fair to all Members on a bill on which there are diverse opinions, on an issue that is so important and that is how do we save an essential American institution, the U.S. Postal Service.  I too want to thank our two leaders, Senator Reid and Senator McConnell, and my dear friend and chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Lieberman, as well as our staffs and our floor staff who have put in so many hours.  I want to reiterate that Senator Lieberman and I will be available to negotiate--our staffs will as well--and to debate these issues. We will be available over the weekend and tomorrow, and then on Monday to begin the debate on the amendments. But, again, I want to thank everyone involved. I think this is how the Senate should operate. It took a lot of work to get here, but no one gave up. Everyone kept working away.  I believe we have come up with a very fair agreement to allow us to proceed on a bill of great significance. I want to thank everyone involved.  I yield the floor.
