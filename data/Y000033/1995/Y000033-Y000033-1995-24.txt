Mr. Speaker, as I watch my California colleagues come to the floor, I do hope that they will recognize the greatest compliment we can give to Mr. Edwards is to make this short. I support H.R. 1253, introduced by the distinguished gentleman and our former colleague from California, Norm Mineta.  H.R. 1253 is a simple, noncontroversial bill that renames the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge after former Congressman Don Edwards.  Don Edwards served in the House of Representatives with distinction for 32 years. During that time, he was successful in convincing the Congress to authorize the San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge, to expand its boundaries, and to appropriate the necessary funds to acquire the more than 22,000 acres that now comprise this unit.  The San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge is the largest urban   refuge in the United States. It contains a number of valuable wetlands, supports hundreds of thousands of shorebirds, and the refuge is visited by more than 250,000 people each year.  It is appropriate to rename this refuge after Don Edwards in recognition of his work and lifelong commitment to this effort. I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 1253.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
