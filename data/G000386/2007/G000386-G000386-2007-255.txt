 We are doing things of a substantive nature. We are doing things for which there is a process to make sure that the term ``technical'' is abided by. That process that worked so perfectly is ignored. So if the committee process will not be respected, we have to do things to make sure that it is. In the future, we will need to protect the committee and the conference process, and we will need to do some preconferencing agreements as we ought to have learned from now what is the majority, the Democrats, when they were in the minority, that they got Republicans to agree to. It seems to me that is legitimate. It may not be exactly the way it ought to work, but it is something we have to do to make sure these things don't happen again.  I yield the floor.
