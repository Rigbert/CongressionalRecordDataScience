Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I would like to join the chairman of the committee in commending the work of Clif Morehead. This is an extraordinarily valuable program for the Federal Government, these exchange programs. They give the Members of various different agencies a perspective on how the Congress operates, and other agencies, but how this process works.  Clif Morehead is an extraordinary young man who has contributed a great deal to the quality of our work during the past frankly 24 months, first working in my office, where he was an invaluable asset, and then in the committee office, as well.  I want to join the chairman in commending Clif Morehead. He is an extraordinary asset of the Secret Service, and has been an outstanding asset of ours. I join with the gentleman from Arizona (Chairman Kolbe) in wishing him the very best as he returns to his position as an agent in the United States Secret Service, where I know he will continue to prove to be a valuable asset to our country.
