I must, however, say the information he has is different from the information I have on the conference.  On the FAA, for instance, there was a meeting on July 24 in which there was no paper, no markup notes, no chairman's mark, no suggested bill, and that was the last meeting, to which the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), the ranking Democrat, who, as you well know, worked hand in glove with Mr. Shuster and with the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) over the years on those committees, simply did not participate. I agree with you, Mr. Leader, on that.  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will yield, that is consistent with what I said, in that formal conferences were held on that bill.                              {time}  0030  In fact, the major contentious issue that we debated this week on that bill was dealt with in the conference, as I am informed, as an amendment. So there was discussion and debate on the conference report.  What I was referring to was the process which was kind of an unusual process in its own right, of recommitting to a conference, making adjustments to the bill, and bringing it right back. Even with that and all of the discussion that has been going on about this bill, both in formal meetings and informal meetings, frankly, a formal conference should have been held before we brought that conference report to the floor.
