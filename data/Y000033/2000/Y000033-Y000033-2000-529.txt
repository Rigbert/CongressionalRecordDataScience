Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Ronald Reagan Recognition Act of 2000.  Recent news reports indicate that the Interior Department is moving toward a complete moratorium on future memorials in the area known as the Mall in Washington, DC.  Mr. Speaker, we can argue the merits of that proposal, but one thing is clear: Under Article IV of the U.S. Constitution, Congress, not the Interior Department, has the authority to dispose of federal lands. A decision this important, about how, whether, and where American heros are memorialized on federal lands, should be made by, and in consultation with, Congress.  One other thing is very clear: One such American hero, who is deserving of recognition among our great American statesmen, is Ronald Wilson Reagan, 40th President of the United States.  Although President Reagan is, thankfully, still very much alive, he is not well. The scourges of Alzheimer's disease have greatly diminished his once tremendous mind. I am sure all my colleagues join me in wishing President and Mrs. Reagan long lives and good health. But tomorrow is promised to no one.  We must not stand idly by and wait while the Interior Department eliminates the possibility of a future memorial to President Reagan, robbing future generations of Americans of the opportunity to recognize the tremendous contributions of this great American, and to do so in the midst of the other great Presidents and heros memorialized on the Mall.  We must not stand by and deprive this generation of Americans of the opportunity to honor President Reagan themselves, in this small way.  Mr. Speaker, the Washington Mall is the family album of the American people. It is where their heros are remembered, and where great accomplishments are celebrated. President Reagan is deserving of both honors.  Ronald Reagan is an American hero deserving of recognition by this and future generations of Americans and visitors to the Mall from around the world.  Future visitors to a Ronald Reagan Memorial on the Mall should be reminded that as President, Ronald Reagan initiated policies that won the cold war, protected and restored freedom and Democracy around the globe, lowered taxes on American citizens, tamed the economic threats of inflation and economic stagnation, and ushered in an unprecedented era of peace and prosperity across the nation, and his contributions merit permanent memorialization.  Future visitors to a Ronald Reagan Memorial on the Mall should be reminded that the legacies of President Reagan include restoring faith in our system of Democracy and capitalism, returning pride in being an American, and renewing the honor and decency of the American Presidency, and are deserving of national recognition.  Future visitors to a Ronald Reagan Memorial on the Mall should be reminded that the contributions of former President Reagan, and his status as a pre-eminent twentieth-century American statesman and one of the greatest American Presidents, merit and require a permanent memorialization alongside the other great American leaders memorialized on the Mall in Washington, DC.  To accomplish these goals, this bill requires the Secretary of the Interior to identify appropriate lands within the area designated as section 1 of the Mall in Washington, DC, as the location of a future memorial to former President Reagan, requires identification of a suitable location, and selection of a suitable design, authorizes raising private-sector donations for such a memorial, and creates a commission to assist in these activities.  Money spent on the memorial would be raised from private sector donors. A commission would be created to oversee the process. And a suitable site on the Mall would be selected, and marked as the ``Future Site of the Ronald Reagan Memorial.''  By statute, the memorial to President Reagan on the Mall will still not occur until 25 years after his death--hopefully long, long in the future. But we must begin the process now, while it is still possible.  Remembering that the policies of President Reagan are responsible for the peace and prosperity we now enjoy is especially fitting now, while some national political figures are running around the country trying to take credit for the results. I find it a little like the rooster taking credit for the sunrise.  The many benefits of Ronald Reagan's policies of limited government, lower taxes, and a strong national defense are still very evident today. Those policies are why this nation is in the good shape we're in today.  The fact that some people seem to have forgotten this is the strongest argument yet to begin the steps toward creating this memorial.  I can think of no greater tribute, and no more fitting tribute, to a man who has done so much for his nation.  Quite frankly, Mr. Speaker, it is the least we can do.                          ____________________
