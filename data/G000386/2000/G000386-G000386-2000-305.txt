 President, today I am introducing a private relief bill on behalf a constituent of mine, Jose Pinales.  His family and friends call him Lupe, and a private relief bill is his only hope to avoid being separated from the people and the country he loves. Lupe was brought to the United States sixteen years ago, when he was two years old, by his uncle, Miguel Landeros. Mr. Landeros, now a U.S. citizen, never formally adopted Lupe. Not until recently did Lupe learn that he was not a U.S. citizen, when he tried to enlist in the United States Marines, to serve what he believed was his country.  The United States is the only country Lupe knows. It's the country he loves, and wishes to serve. Lupe grew up reciting the pledge of allegiance to the United States along with the rest of the children in his class at Jefferson Elementary School. He is now a Senior at Fort Madison High School in Iowa, and works part-time as he prepares to graduate this spring. This young man has almost completed a milestone in his life and has a dream of joining the United States Marines upon graduation. It wasn't until Lupe sought to fulfill this dream did he learn that not only was he not a U.S. citizen, but he was in possible danger of being forced to go to Mexico, a country where the people and customs are foreign to him. He doesn't even speak the language.  Faced with Lupe's plight, the generous people of Fort Madison have rallied together asking for our support in passing a private relief bill for him. My office has been inundated with letters and petitions from citizens imploring us to allow Lupe to fulfill his dream and serve our great nation and not be forced to a country he doesn't know.  Lupe is a fine example of what an American citizen should be. His love and respect for his country are to be admired and rewarded. So, I ask you to join me and the citizens of Iowa, and allow Jose to serve his country by supporting this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
