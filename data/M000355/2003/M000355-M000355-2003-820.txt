 President, I will take very little time.  To underscore where we are on the Burma sanctions issue, I tried to get this bill cleared for this morning for an hour equally divided and a rollcall vote, but there was an objection on the other side with the suggestion that we modify the bill to have the sanctions end in 1 year. Of course, that is exactly the wrong message to send to the military junta in Burma. That is not acceptable to this side.
