President, I rise in support of the nomination of William Cohen to be Secretary of Defense. After watching the Armed Services Committee hearings on his nomination I am not sure whether the Senate is voting in confirmation or coronation of my friend from Maine.  I can certainly understand how the committee provided such overwhelming support for this nomination. I have enjoyed working with Bill Cohen on a wide range of issues. He and I have served together on the Intelligence Committee and we have traveled together on arms control delegations. I am gratified by the support he has lent to efforts I have brought before the Senate to limit the export and use of land mines. He has that unique New England philosophy, increasingly rare these days, of working in a bipartisan fashion to build support for legislative initiatives for the good of the country. There will be a void in the Senate without him but the nation is fortunate to have his leadership on defense issues.  There are two distinct qualities about Bill Cohen that I am confidentwill serve him well as Secretary of Defense. As all of us who have had the honor to serve with him know, Bill Cohen is his own individual. He is not afraid to stand up for what he believes is best for the Nation. He also possesses one of the most formidable intellects that I have worked with in my 22 years in the Senate. I know that these qualities will serve him well as he guides the Department of Defense and advises the President in the coming years.
