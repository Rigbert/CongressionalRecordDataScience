Chairman, I yield myself 8 minutes.  First, Mr. Chairman, let me start by thanking the chairman, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe), for not only his comments but, more importantly, for his chairmanship of this committee, which he chairs in a very responsible and fair manner. Unfortunately, I think too often, Mr. Chairman, the American public gets the impression that all we do is come here and yell and scream at one another and try to make political points. Clearly, while that happens, and it happens perhaps too frequently, we do have the opportunity of working together constructively, and it is a great privilege for me to work with the gentleman from Arizona, constructively on fashioning this bill.
