President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on Rules and Administration be directed to prepare a revised edition of the Standing Rules of the Senate and that such Standing Rules be printed as a Senate document. I further ask unanimous consent that beyond the usual number, 2,500 additional copies of this document be printed for the use of the Committee on Rules and Administration.
