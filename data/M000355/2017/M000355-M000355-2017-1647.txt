 President, today I wish to remember the life of the longest serving county sheriff in the history of Kentucky, Pike County Sheriff Charles Edward Keesee. After more than 40 years of hard work, ``Fuzzy,'' as he was affectionately known, passed away at the age of 89.  A veteran of the Second World War, Fuzzy became a lasting icon in Pike County. Deputy Judge/Executive Brian Morris said ``You can't serve for more than four decades and not personally touch every household in Pike County.'' He was a compassionate public servant, a dedicated law enforcement officer, and a good man. The community will surely remember Fuzzy's impact and miss him deeply.  Elaine and I send our condolences to Sheriff Keesee's wife, Easter, his brother, Alben, and his sister, Nancy Jo.                          ____________________
