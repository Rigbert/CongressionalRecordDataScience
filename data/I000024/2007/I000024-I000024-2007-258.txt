President, I once again today introduced S. 1269, the ENFORCE Act, because this body has failed to move forward with sound immigration legislation. My bill is a strong step in the right direction to help solve our growing problem of illegal immigration.  I did this already. I did this last year. We had a chance to talk about it, but we never were able to get this up to a vote. I do want to keep this subject moving because people are not talking about this anymore. This bill focuses on securing our borders and empowering our citizens and law enforcement officers to fight the all-time high flood of illegal immigrants. There are around a million illegal aliens infiltrating our borders each year. It also addresses some of the lesser known but equally destructive exploitations of our Nation by some of these illegal immigrants.  I wish to be clear, for some reason--I am not sure why--- I have been honored over the years to speak at nationalization ceremonies. It is one of the emotional things a person can go through. When you see people coming into this country and doing it the waythey are supposed to, they learn the history. Those who have gone through the legal process know more about the history of America than the average person you run into on the street. I am very strongly in favor of legal immigration.  In 1997, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform stated that ``measured, legal immigration has led to create one of the world's greatest multiethnic nations.'' I agree with that statement. I also agree with their statement that when immigrants become ``Americanized,'' they help cultivate a shared commitment to ``liberty, democracy, and equal opportunity'' in our Nation. That is legal immigration. I agree with that.  However, I am quoting now from Roy Beck, executive director of Numbers USA. He stated:       A presence of 8 to 11 million illegal aliens--  I think the figure is now approximately 12 million--       in this country is a sign that this country has lost      control of its borders and the ability to determine who is a      member of this national community. And a country that has      lost that ability increasingly loses its ability to determine      the rules of its society--environmental protections, labor      protection, health protections, safety protections.  Further quoting:       In fact, a country that cannot keep illegal immigration to      a low level quickly ceases to be a real country, or a real      community. Rather than being self-governed, such a country      begins to have its destiny largely determined by citizens of      other countries who manage to move in illegally.  With that being said, I cannot and I will not stand idly by and watch our great Nation collapse under the pressures of uncontrolled illegal immigration. This is a crisis, one that must be addressed aggressively. While I would not belabor the point, I will chronicle some of illegal immigration's specific threats to our Nation's vitality and how this bill will address them.  First and foremost, the issue of border security must be addressed. My bill would help ramp up border security by providing a way for civilians and retired law enforcement officers to assist the Border Patrol in stopping illegal border crossings. Keep in mind, if you are a retired Federal law enforcement officer, they have a mandatory retirement age of 57. There are many of these who would work for expenses. What we are advocating is a three-tiered system where you have the Border Patrol who are skilled the way they are today but have them fortified by this army of retired law enforcement officers and then bring in the third tier which are those which we have watched in the past that have been very effective in adding to the numbers on the border.  It is already working. It is very similar to the National Border Neighborhood Watch. I know in my State of Oklahoma it has been a very effective program. It is more eyes to watch and more talent to arrest, when necessary. A more obscure issue that also warrants reform is the legal status of what has become known as anchor babies.  To better their odds of remaining in the United States, illegal immigrants have taken advantage of a constitutional provision granting automatic citizenship to anyone born on U.S. soil. Unfortunately, by providing citizenship to these ``anchor babies,'' as they are known, our Nation rewards the illegal entry of their parents and facilities the further exploitation of our borders and national resources.  This trend has contributed to the alarming fact that the illegal immigrant population is growing faster than the birthrate of American citizens. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, based on numbers from the National Center of Health Statistics, in 2002, there were about 8.4 million illegal aliens, which represented about 3.3 percent of the total U.S. population. That same year, there were about 383,000 babies born to illegal aliens, which represents about 9.5 percent of all U.S. births in 2002.  This problem continues to grow exponentially and serves as a strong incentive for more aliens to illegally cross into our country in hopes of shortcutting citizenship requirements. Language included in the ENFORCE Act will put an end to this much exploited practice.  Another ``supposed'' obligation we face is the education of illegal aliens. Some States, such as my State of Oklahoma, allow the illegal aliens the advantage of receiving in-State tuition at our State colleges and universities. I believe it is inexcusable to give away State-subsidized educations to those who do not pay taxes. This act will address this problem by making it unlawful for illegal aliens to receive this particular handout.  The ENFORCE Act includes several provisions to halt illegal immigrants' continued exploitation of our tax laws and our Social Security benefits. One of the greatest problems in this area is illegal immigrants' abuse of the individual tax identification number. That is the ITIN program.  Currently, it so closely resembles the Social Security number that many illegal immigrants are able to use it in place of a Social Security card to bypass our tax laws or receive wrongly awarded benefits. The ENFORCE Act will require a change in the physical appearance of this particular document so its identity can no longer be mistaken for that of a Social Security number, and it will also prohibit that document from being used for identification purposes.  Additionally, my bill will require Social Security numbers to expire as soon as a person's permission to be in the United States expires. So it would expire at the same time that permission expires.  It will prohibit illegal immigrants who gain legal status from collecting Social Security benefits for the time they worked illegally in the country.  Finally, the legality of day-labor centers is a topic that must be addressed by any comprehensive immigration reform package. These day-labor centers exist within illegal immigration-friendly ``sanctuary sites'' and not just in San Francisco. Day-labor centers are State-designated and funded sites where illegal aliens congregate and wait for employers to pick them up for a day of illegal work.  One such site was approved in 2005 in Fairfax County, VA, to be paid for by taxpayer dollars. Sanctuary cities such as these enable and encourage unlawful activity by both illegal aliens and the employers who hire them. The ENFORCE Act will outlaw the creation of those particular centers.  Illegal immigrants continue to cause a myriad of problems for our country and for law-abiding citizens such as you and me. Illegal immigrants not only drain our economy through their exploitation of public services and resources, but we must not forget the national security threat posed by would-be terrorists who have entered our country illegally or remain here unlawfully by overstaying their visas.  The Center for Immigration Study says:       Even though illegal aliens make little use of welfare, from      which they are generally barred, the costs of illegal      immigration in terms of government expenditures for      education, criminal justice, and emergency medical care are      significant. Illegal immigration is straining our economy,      jeopardizing our security, and burdening our education and      health care systems.  So this ENFORCE Act will provide solid tools to eliminate illegal immigration and strongly enforce the existing U.S. immigration laws. The seriousness of this crisis warrants that Americans of all political stripes come together to address this problem.  One thing that is not included in this legislation that I think should be included in any kind of reform--and some of my colleagues can remember I had on the floor of the Senate the legislation making English the official language of the United States--and it is interesting that some 88 percent of the American people want this, and some 70 percent of the Hispanic population want this also. It is also interesting that there are 50 countries around the world that have English as their official language, including Ghana in West Africa and some other countries, and yet we do not have it for ourselves. But that is going to be handled separately at a different time.  History shows us that declaring ``immigration bankruptcy'' does not work. We saw that in the amnesty of 1986. Simply granting citizenship to immigrants who are currently in our country illegally is not the answer. We have to enhance our border security, hold those accountable who encourage illegal immigration, and ensure that those who violate our laws by entering our country illegally do not remain here and are not easily welcomed back.  So I am introducing that legislation, and I am going to be bringing it up at the appropriate time.                                 ______                                       By
