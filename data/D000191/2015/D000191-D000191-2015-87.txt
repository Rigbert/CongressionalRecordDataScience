 The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 minutes.  There was no objection.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, I congratulate the gentleman on his amendment. I think that this will help provide us with more factual knowledge in terms of looking at any future changes as might relate to these sorts of buses and also will provide useful information to consumers. I think it is very well thought out, and I congratulate the gentleman. I urge support of the amendment.  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.
