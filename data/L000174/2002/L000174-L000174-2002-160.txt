President, I ask unanimous consent that following my statement on July 30, 2002, on the nomination of D. Brooks Smith, located on pages S7553-S7558, that three letters be printed in the Record. The letters are: resolution from the City Council of Philadelphia; Monroe Freedman, Professor of Legal Ethics, Hofstra University and; Stephen Gillers, Vice Dean and Professor of Law, New York University.  There being no objection, the letters was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Resolution       Whereas, The nomination of Pennsylvania district court      Judge D. Brooks Smith to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals      in Philadelphia was voted out of the U.S. Senate Judiciary      Committee on May 23, 2002 by a 12-7; and       Whereas, Judge Smith's nomination is opposed by a wide      range of public interest organizations. Among the      organizations that have formally expressed opposition to      Smith's appeals court nomination are People For the American      Way, Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, NAACP, Alliance      for Justice, National Organization for Women, Community      Rights Council, National Women's Law Center, NARAL,      Earthjustice, ADA Watch Action Fund, National Partnership for      Women & Families, Planned Parenthood, Defenders of Wildlife,      National Employment Law Association, Committee for Judicial      Independence, NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund,      Disability Rights and Education Defense Fund, Feminist      Majority, Friends of the Earth, Bazelon Center for Mental      Health Law, National Disabled Students Union, and the      National Council of Jewish Women; and       Whereas, Judge Smith's membership in a discriminatory club,      his failure for ten years--in violation of governing ethical      standards--to resign from the club despite his commitment to      do so during his district court confirmation hearing, and the      contradictory explanations he has offered for his actions all      raise serious issues about Smith's judgment, willingness to      follow rules, and candor; and       Whereas, Ethical questions have been raised regarding a      highly publicized bank fraud case involving millions of      dollars of public school money. Judge Smith continued to      preside over and issue orders in the case, even though the      fraud claims implicated a bank at which his wife was an      employee and in which he had substantial financial interests.      Several years later, he took on a related case, recusing      himself only after he was requested to do so by one of the      attorneys in the case, revealing only his wife's involvement      and not his own financial interest. On March 14, 2002, after      reviewing the facts and the arguments by Smith and his      defenders, noted legal ethics professor Monroe Freedman wrote      to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Smith committed      ``repeated and egregious violations of judicial ethics'' and      that Smith had been ``disingenuous before this Committee in      defending his unethical conduct.'' Professor Freedman      concluded that as a result, Smith is ``not fit to serve as a      Federal Circuit Judge''; and       Whereas, Since his appointment in 1989, Judge Smith has      been reversed by the court of appeals to which he has been      nominated 51 times. This is a larger number of reversals than      any of the judges approved and rejected by the Senate      Judiciary Committee during this Congress for appellate court      posts, including Judge Charles Pickering. More important than      the number of these reversals, however, is their nature. Many      of these reversals concern civil and individual rights, and      reflect a disturbing lack of sensitivity towards such rights      and a failure to follow clearly established rules of law and      appellate court decisions; and       Whereas, A number of Smith's reversals have concerned      discrimination or other claims by employees. For example, in      Wicker v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 142 F.3d 690 (3rd Cir.),      cert. denied, 525 U.S. 1012 (1998), the court of appeals      unanimously reversed Smith's decision to dismiss a suit by      Conrail employees who claimed that years of on-the-job      exposure to toxic chemicals was making them sick. Smith had      concluded that their lawsuit was barred because they had      signed a waiver as part of a settlement of unrelated injury      claims against the railroad. The appellate court ruled that      Smith's ruling was contrary to the Supreme Court's      interpretation of federal law; and       Whereas, The Third Circuit unanimously reversed Smith's      decision in Ackerman v. Warnaco, 55 F.3d 117 (3rd Cir. 1995),      in which he upheld a company's unilateral denial of severance      benefits to more than 150 employees after they were laid off;      and       Whereas, In Colgan v. Fisher Scientific Co., 935 F.2d 1407      (3rd Cir.), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 941 (1991), the appellate      court unanimously reversed Smith for granting summary      judgment against an age discrimination claim as untimely by      ruling that the statute of limitations began to run not when      the employee was terminated, but instead when he simply      received a negative performance review; and       Whereas, In Schafer v. Board of Public Educ. of the School      Dist. of Pittsburgh, Pa., 903 F.2d 243, 250 (3rd Cir. 1990),      the Third Circuit unanimously reversed Smith for dismissing a      claim that a school district's family leave policy improperly      allowed only women, not men, to take unpaid leave for      ``childbearing'' as well as childbirth. Based     on such decisions, the National Employment Lawyers      Association has opposed Smith's confirmation, explaining that      his record displays ``an attitude inimical to employee and      individual civil rights''; and       Whereas, In other reversals involving individuals or other      plaintiffs against government or corporations, the Third      Circuit has specifically criticized Smith for abusing his      discretion or failing to follow the law. For example, in      Urrutia v. Harrisburg County Police Dept., 91 F.3d 451, 456-     457 (3rd Cir. 1996), the appellate court found that Smith had      ``abused his discretion'' in refusing to allow a prisoner to      amend a complaint contending that he had been repeatedly      stabbed while handcuffed and in the custody of police      officers who looked on while failing to take any action; and       Whereas, In Metzgar v. Playskool, 30 F.3d 459, 462 (3rd      Cir. 1994), three Reagan appointees reversed Smith for      dismissing a claim involving death by asphyxiation of a 15-     month-old child who had choked on a toy, noting that they      were ``troubled by the district court's summary judgment      disposition'' of his parents' claims; and       Whereas, In In re Chambers Development Company, 148 F.3d      214, 223-225 (3rd Cir. 1998), concerning a claim against a      county utility authority, the Third Circuit took the      extraordinary step of issuing a writ of mandamus--an unusual      direct command to a judge to rule a certain way--against      Judge Smith, who had ``ignored both the letter and spirit of      our mandate'' in a prior ruling in the case. As the court of      appeals explained, this was a ``drastic remedy'' that is      utilized only ``in response to an act amounting to a judicial      usurpation of power''; and       Whereas, Judge Smith has also been criticized for rulings      not later reversed on appeal. For example, the Washington      Post expressed concern about his decision in United States v.      Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, 902 F. Supp. 565 (W.D. Pa.      1995), aff'd, 96 F.3d 1436 (3rd Cir. 1996), in which the      federal government had sued the state over allegedly      substandard conditions in a facility for persons with mental      disabilities. As the Post put it, although ``care was, in      Judge Smith's words, `frequently not optimal'--maggots were      found in one resident's ear, ants on others' bodies--the      judge found these to be `isolated incidents' '' and concluded      there was no constitutional violation. In another case,      Quirin v. City of Pittsburgh, 801 F. Supp. 1486 (W.D. Pa.      1992), the National Employment Lawyers Association (NELA)      found that Smith had improperly applied the ``aggressive''      standard of ``strict scrutiny,'' which is reserved for claims      of racial, ethnic, and religious discrimination, to strike      down an affirmative action policy designed to remedy past      discrimination against women. As NELA concluded, such rulings      ``show a disturbing pattern of disregard and hostility for      the rights of minorities and protected classes,'' now      therefore,       Be it resolved by the City Council of Philadelphia, That we      hereby strongly urge the United States Senate to reject the      nomination of Judge D. Brooks Smith to the Third Circuit      Court of Appeals.       Further Resolved, That we hereby urge Pennsylvania Senators      Specter and Santorum to withdraw their support for the      confirmation of Judge D. Brooks Smith to the Third Circuit      Court of Appeals.       Be it further resolved, That a copy of this resolution be      sent to all members of the United States Senate as evidence      of the grave concern by this legislative body.                                  ____                                              New York University,                                                School of Law,                                       New York, NY, May 17, 2002.     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feingold: I am replying to your May 9, 2002      request for my views on three issues surrounding the      nomination of Federal District Judge D. Brooks Smith to a      seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third      Circuit. I assume familiarity with your letter and with the      facts, many of which have been discussed in testimony and      correspondence the Committee has received. I do not know      Judge Smith and have no interest one way or the other in      whether Judge Smith is confirmed. I take my facts mainly from      Judge Smith's testimony or his written submissions and partly      from other materials you have sent me and which I cite below.      The facts do not seem to be in dispute.       Briefly, my qualifications for giving my opinion on your      questions are: I am vice-dean and professor of law at New      York University School of Law, where I have taught since      1978. Regulation of Lawyers (``legal ethics'') is my primary      area of teaching and research and writing. I have taught this      course for a quarter century here and as a visitor at other      law schools. I have a leading casebook in the area, first      published in 1984 and now in its 6th edition. Legal ethics      includes the ethical responsibilities of judges and a chapter      of my book is devoted to those issues. I have published in      the area in law journals and written extensively on the      subject for the popular and legal press. I speak widely on      legal ethics before bar groups, at judicial conferences, at      law firms, and at corporate law departments.       In summary, my conclusions are:       A. If Spruce Creek Red and Gun Club is in fact a purely      social club, and not a venue in which business or      professional interests are pursued, then Canon 2(C) of the      Code of Conduct for United States Judges would not forbid a      federal judge to be a member of the club. On this assumption,      the answers to the first two questions under Part A of      your letter are ``yes'' (the club is exempt from the      prohibition against membership in an organization that      invidiously discriminates) and ``no'' (Judge Smith did not      violate the Code by maintaining membership for 11 years).      My answer to your third question is that Judge Smith had      no obligation to seek an opinion from the Advisory      Committee on the propriety of his membership in the club.      Judge Smith had the responsibility to make sure that the      club was and remained a purely social club and that his      membership was therefore allowed.       B. A federal judge who is invited to a privately funded      judicial education seminar, with expenses paid, has on      obligation to identify the source of funding to ensure that      acceptance of the gift is proper. This duty is not eliminated      because the sponsor of the seminar is a law school or other      educational institution that would not itself require the      judge to refuse the invitation. Funding for the seminar may      come from a person or entity whose generosity the judge      should not accept but whose contribution does not appear on      the face of the invitation. Consequently, Judge Smith should      have inquired of the sponsor of private judicial seminars he      attended to learn the source of funding and establish that      there was no impropriety in accepting the invitation under      the circumstances.       C. Your third inquiry, concerning the timing of Judge      Smith's recusal decisions in SEC v. Black and U.S. v. Black,      is quite complicated. In sum, I conclude that Judge Smith      should have revealed his and his wife's investment in Mid-     State Bank or in Keystone Financial, Inc., its holding      company (hereafter, collectively ``Mid-State''), not later      than October 27, 1997. Having failed to do so, he should have      made this disclosure on October 31, when he did recuse      himself. Failing to do so then, he should have done so as      soon as he knew of Mid-State's financial exposure for Black's      frauds so that counsel could, if advised, seek to vacate      Judge Smith's rulings based on a violation of the judicial      disqualification statute. Whether Judge Smith should have      recused himself on October 27 given what he says he knew at      the time is a more difficult question, which I address below.      However, I conclude that Judge Smith should have recused      himself on October 27 based on what he could have known and      should have discovered on that day. Judge Smith should have      recused himself form United States v. Smith as soon as it was      assigned to him.                   the spruce creek rod and gun club       Judge Smith promised more than he had to at his 1988      confirmation hearings. The Code of Conduct for United States      Judges did not then forbid membership in purely private clubs      that had no business or professional purpose. Although the      Code was thereafter strengthened, following on amendments to      the ABA Model Code of Judicial Conduct in 1992, even as      strengthen the Code does not forbid membership in Spruce      Creek. This assumes, however, that the club has no business      or professional purpose or function. Of course, the      opportunity for club members to meet in informal, social      situations, to get to know each other in that way, can      itself be seen as professionally or commercially      advantageous, but that alone does not make the club's      discrimination ``invidious.'' Defining the line between      clubs that may exclude women (or men, for that matter) and      those that may not because they have a business or      professional dimension is not always easy. But there is a      line and it is rooted in constitutional jurisprudence.       I am assuming that club members sponsor no events or      meetings that could be characterized as business-related or      profession-related. If my assumptions are wrong, however, if      the club is not strictly social, then my conclusion will      change. I understand that the Committee has received      information that the club did allow its members to host      business or professional meetings. If it did, it would not be      purely private as I have been using that term, and its      discrimination against membership for women would then be      ``invidious'' within the meaning of the Code's prohibition.      This would be true even if women were allowed to attend some      or all business or professional meetings hosted by the club's      male members. Since the propriety of Judge Smith's membership      depended on the club maintaining a purely social purpose, he      had the responsibility of assuming that it has and retained      this status.       Judge Smith suggests that he reexamined his obligations      under the Code of Conduct in 1992, when it was revised, and      concluded that his 1988 promise obligated him to do more than      the Code required him to do. As I wrote, the post 1988      amendments actually strengthened the prohibition against      membership in discriminatory clubs, but even as strengthened,      Spruce Creek does not, on the assumptions made, qualify as a      club that ``practices invidious discrimination on the basis      of . . . sex'' within the meaning of Canon 2(C).       Two other comments on this issue: First, while Judge Smith      could have asked the Advisory Committee to give him an      opinion on whether the club's discriminatory policy was      ``invidious,'' I know of no rule imposing a duty to do so.      Second, I realize that Judge Smith made a promise to the      Committee in 1988 and then seems to have concluded that     he had promised more than the Code required. Whether and to      what extent the Committee should be influenced by Judge      Smith's failure to keep his promise notwithstanding this      later conclusion, or by the Judge's failure to inform the      Committee that he did not intend to keep his promise because      of this conclusion, is not properly a question for me.                      judicial education seminars       As you know, expense-paid seminars for judges has been a      challenging issue. The gap between judges' reactions to      criticism of these events and the perspectives of the critics      does not seem to be shrinking. Many judges are annoyed that      anyone would think they would compromise their objectivity      because of an invitation (or many invitations) to a privately      funded judicial seminar. Critics, on the other hand, argue      that only certain groups of litigants have the wherewithal to      support these seminars and that it diminishes the appearance      of justice when judges attend them at luxury resorts to hear      programs designed by those who can afford to sponsor them.      Unfortunately, we have little in the way of guidance,      mainly Opinion 67 of the Advisory Committee and several      judicial opinions, including Judge Winter's opinion in In      re Aguinda, 241 F.3d 194 (2d Cir. 2001). Judge Winter      wrote: ``[A]ccepting something of value from an      organization whose existence is arguably dependent upon a      party to litigation or counsel to a party might well cause      a reasonable observer to life the proverbial eyebrow. . .      . Judges should be wary of attending presentations      involving litigation that is before them or likely to come      before them without at the very least assuring themselves      that parties or counsel to the litigation are not funding      or controlling the presentation.'' Judge Winter cites In      re School Asbestos Litigation, 977 F.2d 764 (3d Cir.      1992), another leading case from Judge Smith's Circuit.      the judge there was disqualified after attending a      conference without ascertaining the source of funding for      it. The source made the judge's attendance improper.       The authorities agree that before attending an expense-paid      judicial seminar, a judge should learn who is picking up the      tab for the judge's travel and housing. This indeed is what      Opinion 67 says: ``It would be improper to participate in      such a seminar if the sponsor, or source of funding, is      involved in litigation, or likely to be so involved, and the      topics covered in the seminar are likely to be in some manner      related to the subject matter of litigation. If there is a      reasonable question concerning the propriety of      participation, the judge should take measures as may be      necessary to satisfy himself or herself that there is no      impropriety. To the extent that this involves obtaining      further information from the sponsors of the seminar, the      judge should make clear an intent to make the information      public if any question should arise concerning the propriety      of the judge's attention.''       Obviously, there would be room for much mischief if a judge      invited to an expense-paid judicial seminar could rely on the      non-profit nature of an apparently neutral sponsor to      immunize the judge's attendance. Judge Smith is therefore      wrong in his assumption, in reply to your follow-up question      6a, when he wrote that because ``George Mason's sponsorship      of LEC was apparent from the face of the materials I received      regarding the seminars, I conclude that no further inquiry      into sources of funding was required.'' If was required.                              sec v. black       Conflicts in the Black cases arise from the fact that the      Smiths owned stock in Mid-State or Keystone. How much is      uncertain. I understand that Judge Smith's financial      disclosure form In 1997 revealed between $100,000 and      $250,000 in stock in Keystone. The form also indicated      that his wife had a 401(k) account with Mid-state, where      she was an officer. Her account ranged between $100,000      and $250,000, but Judge Smith's financial disclosure form      did not say where the money was invested. In answers to      recent questions you posed (question 14), Judge Smith      wrote: ``At the time in question [October 1997], my wife      and I held stock in Mid-state and she was employed by the      company.'' So now we do know that Mrs. Smith also held      stock in Mid-State, but we don't know how much. As a      result, we do know the amount of the Smiths' joint      holdings in Mid-State or Keystone in October 1997 and      thereafter or what percentage of their wealth it      represented.       Anoter basis for a possible conflict in the Black matters      was the fact that Mrs. Smith was an officer in Mid-State.      However, Judge Smith recently responded to your written      quesiton1 7 by stating that his wife ``was a corporate loan      officer for Mid-state, a position far removed from those      parts of the bank that had dealings with John Gardner      Black.''       In this answer,I will assume that the Smiths had a      substantial financial interest in Mid-State or Keystone or      both (it was between $100,000 and $500,000) and that that      interest represented a signficant portion of their wealth. No      submission offered by or on behalf of Judge Smith has      asserted otherwise and the record we have supports this      conclusion.     a. October 27, 1997       I want now to focus on October 27, 1997 and the weeks      immediately preceding:       On October 24, ``all investment funds were removed from      Mid-State Bank'' by the Trustee. Letter of Mark A. Rush, 2/     22/02, at 2, Judge Smith knew this because the fact is      recited in an order he issued October 27. Letter of Douglas      A. Kendall, 2/20/02, at 5.       In the chambers conference with the Trustee and his counsel      on October 27, Judge Smith was told ``that information,      although in its very early developmental phases, was being      uncovered which may change Mid-State-Bank's involvement in      the case from that of merely a depository of funds.'' He was      advised ``of only a developing but not confirmed suspicion by      the Trustee that Mid-State Bank's role may be more than a      depository.'' Rust letter at 2, 3.       In September and October, the press in Pennsylvania      reported the possibility that defrauded school districts      would sue Mid-state. Kendall letters, 5/10/02, at 4 and      exhibits. Certainly, the possibility of bank liability, or at      least exposure to litigation, would have been apparent to any      lawyer. Suits were in fact filed, starting as early as      October 31, 1997. Id at 4. The suit was reported in the      press the next day. Id.       Papers before Judge-Smith suggested that the bank prepared      reports to the school districts showing the market value of      their account at $157 million, while reporting to Black that      the market value of these accounts was only $86 million. This      information was in a footnote that was in an exhibit to an      exhibit in the papers before Judge Smith, who apparently did      not recognize its significance or did not see it. Reply to      your follow-up question 8. However, the discrepancy was      reported in the local press on October 31. Id. at 3.       In the October 27 chambers conference, Judge Smith told the      Trustee and his counsel ``of his wife's employment in an      unrelated division of Mid-State Bank.'' And the Judge      ``indicated an intention to consider recusing himself based      on the potential for a future appearance of a conflict.''      Rush letter at 3. Judge Smith did not then reveal the Smiths'      financial interest in Mid-State or Keystone.       The information Judge Smith knew on October 27 required him      to reveal his family's financial interest before ruling on      the applications before him. So far as the Trustee and his      counsel knew, the only basis for recusal was Mrs. Smith's      employment in an ``unrelated division'' of the bank. That is      all they were told. Understandably, they did not see that as      a fact that required recusal or further discussion. (More on      this below.) But had Judge Smith revealed the Smiths'      financial interests in Mid-State on October 27, then the      Trustee and his counsel, and counsel for the school districts      seeking to unfreeze money held by Black in non-Mid-State      banks, would have been able to provide the Judge with      information (already in the press) about Mid-State's and      Keystone's potential future liability for Black's frauds.      Then, the footnote in the exhibit to the exhibit in the      papers before Judge Smith could have surfaced and its import      explained. Then, too, the public discussion about the      possibility of legal action against Mid-State could have      surfaced. The Trustee and counsel would then have had reason      to be more expansive about their statement in chambers that      ``Mid-State Bank's involvement in the case [may change] from      that of merely a depository of funds.''       In fact, had Judge Smith revealed not merely his wife's      employment in an ``unrelated division'' of the bank on      October 27, but also his family's substantial financial      investment in the bank, it would have been incumbent on      counsel to reveal all they knew about the bank's legal      exposure and to explore with the Judge whether what they      knew, but did not see any need to elaborate, and what Judge      Smith knew, but did not reveal, required recusal under      Section 455(b)(4), which disqualifies a judge if the judge or      the judge's spouse has ``any . . . interest that could be      substantially affected by the outcome of the proceeding.''      Based on what parties collectively knew at the time, this      exploration should have led to Judge Smith's recusal on      October 27, before he ruled on the school districts' effort      to unfreeze non-Mid-State accounts in Black's control      (totalling about $175 million). Once Judge Smith learned of      the probable lawsuits against Mid-State, he would have had to      step out of the case. By failing to reveal his family's      financial interest, however, Judge Smith effectively      prevented the entire inquiry and led to a ruling he was      disqualified from making because a bank in which his      family had a substantial investment had an interest in the      ruling, as discussed further below.       Although I focused above on the particular ruling Judge      Smith made on October 27, that ruling is incidental to a more      imposing fact. Even if there were no application for a ruling      on October 27, Judge Smith should still have recused himself      based on information that he could and should have discovered      on that date. That information revealed the enormity of Mid-     State's potential liability. As stated above, and as reported      in the press in October, Mid-State's own documents showed a      potential shortfall of $71 million in school district funds      that Black had deposited with Mid-State. So I want to stress      that it was this exposure, and not alone the ruling Judge      Smith was asked to make on October 27, that required recusal      by that date if not sooner. In short, Judge Smith should not      have been sitting in a matter when, as he could have and      should have known, a bank in which he had a substantial      investment faced financial liability in tens of millions of      dollars. As we now know, Keystone eventually paid $51 million      to settle depositor claims.     b. October 31, 1997       On October 31, Judge Smith recused himself citing only his      wife's employment. He has explained to the Committee that he      did so because he foresaw the possibility that the bank might      be a source of evidence in the case. Letter of 2/25/02, at 2.      As stated, Judge Smith has acknowledged that his wife was in      a ``position far removed from those parts of the bank that      had any dealing with John Gardner Black.'' It is hard to      understand why Mrs. Smith's position caused Judge Smith to      recuse himself, even assuming that Mid-State officials might      be deposed or that Mid-State might be the source of      documents. At this point Judge Smith believed that the bank      was merely a ``depository.'' If that were all it was, it      should make no difference that officers or employees, from a      part of the bank ``unrelated'' to the one in which his wife      worked, might be deposed or that the bank might be a source      of documents. In fact, Judge Smith does not appear to believe      that he even had to recuse for this reason. In his answer to      your question 13, he wrote that he had no ``legal      obligation'' to recuse when he did, but did so ``out of an      abundance of caution.'' (See also the answer to your question      14.) Judge Smith acknowledges in his answer to question 18      that there was a possibility that his wife might herself be a      witness. By failing to reveal the Smiths' investments on      October 31, Judge Smith denied the litigants information that      they could have used to overturn on October 31, Judge Smith      denied the litigants information that they could have used to      overturn his October 27 ruling refusing to unfreeze half the      money (about $77 million) that Black maintained in non-Mid-     State accounts.       A ruling by a judge who should have been disqualified may      be vacated. This is true even if the judge, when ruling, was      unaware of the basis for the disqualification. Liljeberg v.      Health Services Acquisition Corp., 486 U.s. 847 (1988) Judge      Smith's rulings in SEC v. Black, and in particular his ruling      on October 27 refusing to unfreeze all of the non-Mid-     State funds in Black's control, could have been challenged      based on the Smiths' financial interest. However, because      Judge Smith did not reveal the Smiths' financial interest      in Mid-State on October 27, or on October 31 when the      Judge did recuse himself, or thereafter, parties to the      proceedings before him, including the school districts      that sought to unfreeze all of their non-Mid-State funds,      could not use this interest as a basis for vacating the      Judge's rulings. While it is true that a judge may recuse      without giving any reason, where there are reasons for      recusal that could retroactively affect the legitimacy of      orders already entered, the judge must reveal that      information so that the parties can determine whether to      challenge the judge's orders on this basis. Id. at 867.      The fact that a judge might not believe that a particular      fact would suffice to warrant recusal, or to warrant an      order vacating a ruling, is not a justification for      failing to make the disclosure. A judge should not,      through silence, be the ultimate arbiter of his or her own      disqualification. If a fact could reasonably support      disqualification or an effort to overturn a ruling, as is      true here, that fact should be revealed so that counsel      may argue it or bring it to the attention of another judge      or an appellate court. Id.     c. Events after October 31, 1997       Even if Judge Smith continued to believe on October 31 that      the bank's role was solely as a prospective witness in its      capacity as depository, it shortly thereafter became      apparent, when lawsuits were filed, that this was not so, and      that in fact the bank would be exposed to financial      liability. At that point, at least, Judge Smith should have      revealed the Smith's financial investment in Mid-State. While      it is true that Judge Smith no longer had jurisdiction over      SEC v. Black after October 31, he did not need jurisdiction      to make financial information known. So even assuming Judge      Smith did not realize the bank's financial exposure as of      October 31, which I do assume, and even assuming (which I do      not) that he had no duty even to explore the possibility of      the bank's financial exposure with counsel on October 27,      Judge Smith should nevertheless have revealed his family's      financial interest in the bank once its potential civil      liability became evident, as it did soon after October 31.       Those appealing Judge Smith's order would have benefited      from knowledge of the facts and amounts of the Smiths' Mid-     State investment because that investment meant Judge Smith      should not have ruled on any issue that could affect Mid-     State's financial exposure. The effort to unfreeze the non-     Mid-State money is such an issue because the more money      available from other sources to compensate school districts      with Mid-State accounts, the smaller would be Mid-State's      exposure. In other words, if money in non-Mid-State banks      could be used to compensate districts whose funds were in      Mid-State accounts, Mid-State could be benefited. So could      the Smiths as substantial investors.       In Liljeberg, supra, Judge Collins ruled in a case even      though at the time, he was a fiduciary of a non-party      (Loyola) that stood to gain financially from the ruling. At      the time he ruled, he did not know of Loyola's interest in      the matter, although he previously knew of it and learned of      it again later. The Court agreed that Judge Collins could not      have recused himself when he lacked knowledge of the      disqualifying fact. A ``judge could never be expected to      disqualify himself based on some fact that he does not know,      even though the fact is one that perhaps he should know or      one that people might reasonably suspect that he does know.''      486 U.S. at 860. The Court then went on to hold that ``[n]o      one questions that Judge Collins could have disqualified      himself and vacated his judgment when he finally realized      that Loyola had an interest in the litigation.'' Id. at 861.      Doing so might ``promote confidence in the judiciary by      avoiding even the appearance of impropriety whenever      possible.'' Id. at 865. Judge Collins ``silence,'' once he      recalled Loyola's interest, ``deprived respondent of the      basis for making a timely motion for a new trial and also      deprived it of an issue on direct appeal.'' Id. at 867. So,      too, here.       Judge Smith no longer had jurisdiction of the case after      October 31, and therefore could not recuse himself or vacate      his orders, as the Supreme Court ruled Judge Collins could      have done. But once he learned of the bank's exposure, Judge      Smith could have taken the lesser step of informing counsel      of his family's financial interests in the bank. He should      have done this because he should have realized that the      following facts, once publicly known, would undermine      confidence in the judiciary and create the appearance of      impropriety. These facts are:       (1) Judge Smith was told on October 27 that the bank may be      more than a mere depository:       (2) papers before Judge Smith on October 27 showed a      substantial discrepancy between what the bank was telling      depositors and what the bank was telling Black;       (3) the press in Pennsylvania was reporting on the prospect      of lawsuits against the bank;       (4) the Smiths had a substantial financial interest in the      bank:       (5) three days prior to October 27, as Judge Smith knew,      the Trustee had removed all of the school district funds from      the bank and placed it in another institution;       (6) on October 27 Judge Smith made a ruling that an      objective observer could view as beneficial to Mid-State by      keeping frozen monies that might be available to compensate      school districts that had accounts in Mid-State;       (7) despite the information available to him on October 27,      Judge Smith made no effort to conduct a further inquiry of      counsel into the possible financial exposure of Mid-State or      reveal his family's investment in Mid-State.       The upshot of this is that even if we assume that as of      October 31 Judge Smith thought of Mid-State as merely a      depository whose personnel might be witnesses, nonetheless,      in retrospect, Judge Smith should have realized from the      facts itemized above that his conduct threatened confidence      in the impartiality of the courts and that he had to take      steps to correct that, Liljeberg, quoting the lower court's      opinion, states: ``The goal of Section 455(a) is to avoid      even the appearance of partiality. If it would appear to a      reasonable person that a judge has knowledge of facts that      would give him an interest in the litigation then an      appearance of partiality is created even though no actual      partiality exists because the judge does not recall the      facts, because the judge actually has no interest in the case      or because the Judge is pure in heart and incorruptible. The      judge's forgetfulness, however, is not the sort of      objectively ascertainable fact that can avoid the appearance      of partiality. Under section 455(a), therefore, recusal is      required even when a judge lacks actual knowledge of the      facts indicating his interest or bias in the case if a      reasonable person, knowing all the circumstances, would      expect that the judge would have actual knowledge.'' Id. at      860 (internal citations omitted). See also In re School      Asbestos Litigation, 977 F.2d at 784, quoting some of the      same language from Liljeberg. It is hard to fathom Judge      Smith's silence after October 31 even if one accepts his      explanations for his conduct until that time.                         united states v. black       This brings me to United States v. Black, the criminal case      against Mr. Black, assigned to Judge Smith in 1999, when Mid-     State's financial exposure was apparent. Judge Smith kept the      case for five months, until a motion to recuse him was made      and granted. Again judge Smith cited his wife's employment as      the basis for granting the motion. I don't understand why, if      an ``abundance of caution'' caused Judge Smith to recuse      himself sua sponte in SEC v. Black because of the prospect of      testimony from bank personnel, or because the bank might be a      source of documents, he did not recuse in United States v.      Black immediately. Be that as it may, for other reasons      Judge Smith should never have accepted United States v.      Black. First, Third Circuit precedent directly on point      prohibited Judge Smith from accepting the case. ``We adopt      the view that a judge who owns a substantial interest in      the victim of a crime must disqualify himself or herself      in the subsequent criminal proceeding because the strict      overarching standard imposed by Sec. 455(a) requires that      the appearance of impartiality be maintained.'' United      States v. Nobel, 696 F.2d at 231, 235 (3rd Circuit 1982).      This is a holding of the case and cannot be more explicit.      The court went on to conclude that on the particular facts      disqualification had been waived under Sec. 455(e). But      the court would not have had to consider waiver unless it      had first found that the judge, as an investor in the      defrauded institution (``INA''), was disqualified from      sitting in judgment of the man accused of defrauding that      institution.       The facts here are even stronger than the facts in Nobel.      Nobel also held that Sec. 455(a) would have required      disqualification of the trial judge even though ``by the time      of the criminal trial a settlement had been effected which      called for defendant to repay INA for substantially all of      the funds which defendant received as a result of the      fraud.'' Id. at 234. Since INA had recovered its lost money      in Nobel, no ruling in that case could have affected the size      of the investing judge's loss. Not so here. Mid-State was      either the victim of Black's misconduct or civilly liable for      facilitating it (or perhaps both). In either event, unlike      INA, it stood to lose or have to pay a lot of money (as in      the end it did) in part as a result of Black's acts.      Obviously, it was in the bank's interest to minimize the      amount it would lose or have to pay, and in furtherance of      that goal it would want to shift as much blame to Black as      possible. It was in the interest of the Smiths as Mid-State      investors to achieve the same objectives. It should have been      apparent that these objectives might be furthered by rulings      in Black's criminal case and by limiting any monetary      sanction against Black, as next discussed. Judge Smith's      defense (in answer to your question 20) that Nobel is      inapposite because Mid-State was not a ``victim'' in the same      way that INA was a victim entirely misses the purpose of the      disqualification statute and the reasoning of Nobel.       Judge Smith should have realized that decisions he might      make in Mr. Black's criminal case could affect the civil      actions then pending against Mid-State. This could happen in      at least two ways. First, Judge Smith would be called upon in      Black to make evidentiary rulings that could lead to the      revelation, or to the concealment, of information that might      affect the course of the civil litigation against Mid-State.      Second, I understand that in the event of a conviction, Black      would have been subject to monetary sanctions. Obviously, the      more money Black had to pay as a criminal sanction, the less      money he would have available to compensate the school      districts allegedly harmed by Mid-State and Black.      Consequently, Mid-State would have an interest in Black      retaining as much money as possible so that his wealth could      be used to offset depositor losses. If somehow Judge Smith      did not appreciate that his family's Mid-State investments      required recusal, he should have revealed this information to      counsel so they, and the defendant, could decide whether to      act on it.       In sum, assuming that Judge Smith did not know of Mid-     State's financial exposure on October 27, 1997, and did not      therefore recognize a need to recuse himself in SEC v. Black,      still there was sufficient information before him to warrant      both further inquiry and revelation of his family's      investments in Mid-State. Inquiry and revelation at this      point would have resolved the issue and made disqualification      immediately necessary. As stated above, a federal judge does      have a duty to be forthcoming with facts that could support a      request for recusal. Once Mid-State's financial exposure      became apparent, as early as press reports of the first      lawsuit on November 1, Judge Smith's continued silence is      inexplicable. His order of October 27 was being challenged      and his family's financial investment would have provided the      challengers with strong arguments to vacate it, perhaps more      quickly. Just as Judge Collins in Liljeberg should have      immediately revealed his reawakened knowledge of Loyola's      interest in a litigation before him, Judge Smith should have      revealed his family's financial interest in the bank      immediately on learning that the bank had financial exposure      in the events underlying SEC v. Black.       For the reasons given above, Judge Smith should never have      accepted United States v. Black. Rulings in that case have      affected the amounts of money Mid-State would eventually have      to pay and therefore the value of the Smiths' investment.      Even if they could not, Circuit precedent required his      recusal.       I hope I have answered your questions. Please don't      hesitate to ask if I can be of further assistance.

Re nomination of Judge D. Brooks Smith.     Hon. Russell D. Feingold,     Committee on the Judiciary, Hart Senate Office Building, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feingold. This letter is in response to your      letter to me of May 9, 2002, requesting my opinion on ethical      issues that have arisen in connection with the nomination of      United States District Judge D. Brooks Smith to the United      States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. These issues      related to (A) Membership in the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun      Club; (B) Attendance at Judicial Education Seminars; and (C)      Judicial Disqualification Requirements.     (A) Membership in the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club       I had originally concluded that Judge Smith's membership in      the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club was not a ground for      denying him a judgeship on the Court of Appeals. In reaching      that conclusion, I was relying in significant part on the      opinion expressed in the letter to Senator Orrin G. Hatch of      April 23, 2002 by Professor Ronald D. Rotunda, for whom I      have considerable respect. Subsequent research has convinced      me, however, that Professor Routunda's analysis in this      instance is seriously flawed, that his conclusion is      clearly wrong, and that Judge Smith's membership in the      Club is a serious violation of his ethical      responsibilities as a judge.       I was troubled from the outset, of course, that Judge      Smith's membership in the Rod and Gun Club violates the plain      meaning of Canon 2C of the Code of Conduct for United States      Judges. That provision forbids a judge to hold membership in      an organization that ``practices invidious discrimination on      the basis of . . . sex. . . .'' Since the bylaws of the Rod      and Gun Club arbitrarily restrict membership to men, and      since Judge Smith held membership in the Club for eleven      years while he was a federal judge, his violation of Canon 2C      appears to be obvious.       Nevertheless, two aspects of Professor Rotunda's letter      persuaded me that this plain-meaning reading was not the      final word. First, I accepted Professor Rotunda's assertion      that the Club is a ``purely social'' organization with no      formal business or professional activities. In this regard,      Professor Rotunda may well have been misled by Judge Smith      himself, who has repeatedly mischaracterized the Club to the      Judiciary Committee as a ``purely social group'' that does      not conduct any business or professional activities. In any      event, I now understand that the crucial factual premise is      false, because professional meetings are in fact held at the      Rod and Gun Club.       Of equal importance to my original judgment is the fact      that I accepted Professor Rotunda's statement regarding      Sec. 2.14(b) of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges,      Compendium of Selected Opinions (2002). In Professor      Rotunda's words, that section holds that: ``[T]he Masonic      Order, which limits full membership to males does not      practice `invidious' sex discrimination because it does `not      provide business or professional opportunities to members.''      Frankly, I have difficult with the notion that important      business and professional contacts are not made at a club      where business and professional men interact and bond with      each other and with important political figures and judges.      Moreover, I was troubled that this exception for the Masons--     as stated Professor Rotunda--would effectively swallow up the      rule against discrimination on grounds of sex. Nevertheless,      for purposes of forming an opinion about Judge Smith's      compliance with the Code of Judicial Conduct, I accepted      Professor Rotunda's representation that such a distinction      has been made in the Compendium of Opinions.       However, the full summary of the opinion regarding the      Masons in Sec. 2.14(b) of the Compendium is not based simply      on the premise that the organization does not provide      business or professional opportunities to members (which is a      factual premise that, in any event, is inapplicable to the      Rod and Gun Club). Rather, the summary refers only once to      the absence of business or professional opportunities, but      refers twice to the religious purposes of the Masons.      Compare, then, the actual summary set forth in Sec. 2.14(b)      with Professor Rotunda's rendering of that summary, which is      quoted supra: ``Masonic Order, represented to be fraternal      organization devoted to charitable work with religious focus      and not providing business or professional opportunities to      members, is not consider to be an organization practicing      invidious discrimination although women are not permitted to      be full-fledged members. Organization is considered to be      dedicated to the preservation of religious and cultural      values of legitimate common interest to members. Commentary      to Canon 2C.'' Because of this reiteration in Sec. 2.14(b) of      the Masons as being ``devoted'' and ``dedicated'' to the      preservation of religious values through charitable work, the      exception for the Masons does not swallow up the proscription      of Canon 2C against discrimination on grounds of sex.      Instead, the Masons' exception becomes a limited one that      respects the First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of      religion.       Contrary to Professor Rotunda's abridged version of      Sec. 2.14(b), therefore, the full text of Sec. 2.14(b) does      not support the conclusion that the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun      Club's discrimination against women is permissible.      Accordingly, Judge Smith was clearly in violation of Canon 2C      for most of the eleven years that ``dragged on'' while Judge      Smith was on the bench and remained a member.       Finally, with respect to the specific questions that you      raised on this issue in your letter to me:       1. Judge Smith is incorrect in asserting that revisions to      Canon 2 of the Code of conduct exempt clubs like Spruce Creek      from the ban on membership in discriminatory organizations.      Indeed, that assertion is fanciful, on a plain-meaning      reading of Canon 2C: ``A judge should not hold membership in      any organization that practices invidious discrimination on      the basis of . . .  sex . . .'' Moreover, the exceptions in      the Comment reinforce the conclusion that the Rod and Gun      Club falls within this plain language. For example, the      Comment exempts an organization that is ``dedicated to the      preservation of religious, ethnic or cultural values of      legitimate common interest to its members [like the Masons],      or that is in fact and effect an intimate, purely private      organization whose membership limitations could not be      constitutionally prohibited.'' Obviously, neither clause in      that exception describes the Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club.       2. Judge Smith violated ethical standards by remaining a      member of the Spruce Creek     Rod and Gun Club for eleven years--or, at least, for most of      those years--while serving as a federal district judge. The      1998 Code reiterates the language of the 1992 Code in      allowing a judge a maximum of two years to make immediate and      continuous efforts to change the club's policy before      resigning. Since Judge Smith claims to have made such efforts      beginning in 1988, he should have resigned at least by 1992,      when he knew that four years of efforts had already been      unavailing.       3. If Judge Smith somehow believed after 1992 that he could      ethically remain a member of the Club (a conclusion that is      difficult to credit) he should at least have consulted with      the Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct before continuing      his membership. Apart from that, having given his word to the      Judiciary Committee that he would resign from the Club if it      did not change its discriminatory bylaw, Judge Smith should      have informed the Committee of his intention to break his      word and his reasons for doing so.     (B) Attendance at Judicial Education Seminars       In answer to your specific question, Judge Smith is not      correct in asserting that under existing ethical standards,      he was not required to inquire into the identity of corporate      financial supporters of an organization like the Law and      Economics Center at George Mason University.       As noted in the Comment to Canon 2A, the appearance of      impropriety depends on the appearance to a reasonable person      who has ``knowledge of all the relevant facts that a      reasonable inquiry would disclose.'' Thus, if a reasonable      inquiry would reveal the source of the funding, the source of      the funding is relevant to determining whether there is an      appearance of impropriety and, thereby, whether the judge has      committed a violation of the standard. In order to conform      his conduct to the rule, therefore, the judge must at least      make the same reasonable inquiry that the hypothetical      reasonable person would be making into the source of the      funds for the seminar.       It is important to address here Professor Rotunda's      disparaging comments on the appearance of impropriety as a      standard in judges' and lawyers' ethics. Professor Rotunda is      correct in saying that some authorities have rejected the      appearance of impropriety as a standard. That has come about,      however, for reasons that have nothing to do with the merits      of the standard. Moreover, the views of those authorities      could not overrule either the Due Process Clause of the      Constitution or the Code of Conduct for United States Judges.       In fact, the appearance of impropriety is central in      judges' and lawyers' ethics, and, specially, in the Code of      Conduct for United States Judges. Moreover, a fundamental      principle of constitutional due process of law is that ``any      tribunal permitted by law to try cases and controversial not      only must be unbiased but also must avoid even the appearance      of bias.'' That is, ``to perform its high function in the      best way, justice must satisfy the appearance of justice.''       As recently as 1998, the Judicial Conference of the United      States reiterated its commitment to avoiding the appearance      of impropriety on the part of judges. As stated in the      Comment to Canon 2A:       ``Public confidence in the judiciary is eroded by      irresponsible or improper conduct by judges. A judge must      avoid all impropriety and the appearance of impropriety. A      judge must expect to be the subject of constant public      scrutiny. A judge must therefore accept restrictions that      might be viewed as burdensome of the ordinary citizen and      should do so freely and willingly. The prohibition against      behaving with impropriety or the appearance of impropriety      applies to both the professional and personal conduct of a      judge. Because it is not practicable to list all prohibited      acts, the proscription is necessarily cast in general terms      that extend to conduct by judges that is harmful although not      specifically mentioned in the Code.'' Then, directly      addressing Professor Rotunda's complaint that the appearance      of impropriety is ``too vague to be a standard,'' the Comment      explains precisely what is meant by the standard of an      appearance of impropriety: ``Actual improprieties under this      standard include violations of law, court rules or other      specific provisions of this Code. The test for appearance of      impropriety is whether the conduct would create in reasonable      minds, with knowledge of all the relevant circumstances that      a reasonable inquiry would disclose, a perception that the      judge's ability to carry out judicial responsibilities with      integrity, impartiality, and competence is impaired.''       Thus, the Code tells us, that an appearance of impropriety      is one that would cause a reasonable person, with knowledge      of all the relevant circumstances that a reasonable inquiry      would disclose, to believe that the judge has violated a      specific provision of the Code, or has violated the law, or      has violated court rules, in such a way that impairs the      judge's impartiality.       Consistent with that definition, the appearance of      impropriety with regard to the judicial seminars is the      appearance that a party is buying special access to the      judge, both by financing an expert to express ex parte      opinions to the judge, and by making a gift to the judge to      induce the judge to pay special attention to the expert's ex      parte opinion. Thus, judge Smith's conduct violates Canons 2,      2B, and 6, and appears to violate Canon 3A(4), as explained      below.       As a general matter, there is nothing in the Code of      Conduct for United States Judges that would forbid a judge      from attending a privately-sponsored judicial seminar. Also      as a general matter, there is no limitation--nor should there      be--on the ways in which judges engage in continuing legal      education.       However, a specific rule of critical importance in Canon      3A(4), which forbids a judge to consider ``ex parte      communications on the merits * * * of a pending or impeding      proceedings.'' This rule goes so far as to forbid a judge to      receive the ex parte advice even of a ``disinterested      expert'' on the law applicable to a proceeding before the      judge, unless the judge gives nothing to the parties of the      person consulted and the substance of the advice, and affords      the parties reasonable opportunity to respond.       Also relevant is Canon 6, which provides that a judge may      not receive reimbursement of expenses to judicial seminars      ``if the source of such payment * * * give[s] the appearance      of influencing the judge in the judge's judicial duties or      otherwise give[s] the appearance of impropriety.''.       I understand that Judge Smith has attended seminars in      which experts addressed legal issues that appeared to be the      same as the issues that were presented in matters that were      then before him. In addition, it is entirely possible that      one or more of the speakers discussed those issues in      informal contacts with the judge at those seminars.       Your letter refers, for example, to Gerber v. Medtronic,      Inc. This was a products liability case that Judge Smith was      adjudicating when he attended a seminar at Hilton Head. At      the seminar, experts discussed ``Risk, Injury, and      Liability.'' In the Center's words, this seminar      ``demonstrates the superiority of a legal system that assigns      liability to those best able to avoid injury over a system      that seeks only to spread losses by assigning them to the      `deepest pockets.''' Also, one of the lecturers at the      seminar published a paper the same year arguing for federal      preemption of state tort claims involving pharmaceuticals      subject to federal regulation.       Upon returning home, Judge Smith granted summary judgment      in favor of Medtronic--the party that had provided financial      support to the Law and Economics Center, which had sponsored      the seminar. The ground for Judge Smith's decision was      federal preemption of the state tort claims.       On those facts, there is an appearance that Judge Smith      violated Canon 3A(4) by receiving ex parte communications on      issues then before him in the Medtronic case.       Under the language of Canon 3A(4), of course, it is      irrelevant whether the seminars were funded by a party      appearing before the judge. However, the fact that a party      before the judge was providing financial support for a      seminar at an expensive resort, the fact that the judge      stayed at the resort without cost, and the fact that the      expert's ex parte presentation was also financed in part by      the party, would all heighten the appearance of impropriety.      Specifically, the appearance is that the party is buying      special access to the judge, both by making a gift to the      judge and by financing an ex parte communication by an      expert.       In addition, Judge Smith's attendance at the seminar      violated Canon 6 because of the source of the reimbursement      of the judge's expenses ``give[s] the appearance of      influencing the judge in the judge's judicial duties or      otherwise give[s] the appearance of impropriety.''     (C) Judicial disqualification requirements       Your final question to me is whether there is anything in      Judge Smith's answers to your written questions that changes      the opinion in my letter to the Committee of March 14, 2002      (which I adopt here by reference).       The answer is no. Judge Smith's written answers like his      testimony before the Committee, consist of obfuscation and      disingenuousness. In addition, those answers confirm the      conclusion stated in my earlier letter that Judge Smith has      committed repeated and egregious violations of judicial      ethics; that to this day he has failed to inform himself of      his obligations under the Federal Judicial Disqualification      Statute; and that he has been disingenuous before this      Committee in defending his unethical conduct.       For example, in answer to your Question 7a, Judge Smith      says: ``Starting on October 27th, I began to develop concerns      that Mid-State's involvement in SEC v. Black might, in the      future, require it to play a more prominent evidentiary role      in the litigation. I may have told the Trustee and his lawyer      that I would consider recusing myself based on the potential      for a future appearance of impropriety...'' In those two      sentences, Judge Smith displays either an ignorance of the      nature of conflict of interest law or a desire to confuse the      issue with meaningless verbiage (``the potential for a future      appearance of impropriety'').       First, all conflicts of interest are concerned with      potentials--that is, with the risk of substantive ethical      violations that might arise in the future. As explained by      the Restatement of the Law Governing Lawyers, ``conflict of      interest'' refers to whether there is a ``substantial risk''      that a substantive violation of one's ethical obligations      will arise in the future. (With regard to a judge, this would      refer, e.g., to the risk that the judge's impartiality might      come to be impaired in the course of the litigation.) To be      ``substantial,'' the risk must be ``more than a mere      possibility.'' However, it need not be     ``immediate, actual, and apparent.'' On the contrary, as      explained in the comment to Restatement Sec. 121, a risk      can be substantial, within the meaning of the rule, even      if it is ``potential or contingent,'' and despite the fact      that it is neither ``certain or even probable'' that it      will occur. The ultimate test is that there be a      ``significant and plausible'' risk of adverse effect on      one's ethical responsibilities.       When Judge Smith said, therefore, that on October 27th he      ``began to develop concerns that Mid-State's involvement in      SEC v. Black might, in the future, require it to play a more      prominent evidentiary role in the litigation,'' he was      acknowledging that he had a conflict of interest that      required him immediately to recuse himself. That is, he was      acknowledging that there was a ``significant and plausible      risk''--even if it was not ``certain or even probable''--that      he would find himself adjudicating a case in which he had a      substantial financial interest.       Moreover, Judge Smith reiterates that ``Mid-State Bank was      not a party to the litigation before me.'' As a Federal Judge      for fourteen years, Judge Smith should be familiar with the      leading Supreme Court case of Liljeberg v. Health Services      Acquisition Corp. He should know, therefore, that it is      immaterial whether the Bank had been a party. In Liljeberg,      for example, Loyola University was not a party and, indeed,      the judge had forgotten that Loyola had any possible interest      in the outcome of the case. Nevertheless, simply because the      judge had been a trustee of Loyola, the Supreme Court vacated      the judgment under the Federal Disqualification Statute (28      U.S.C. Sec. 455).       For all of the reasons in my earlier letter and in this      one, therefore, I continue to believe that Judge D. Brooks      Smith should not be honored with advancement to a      distinguished Federal Circuit Court.           Respectfully submitted,                                           Monroe H. Freedman,                              Lichtenstein Distinguished Professor     of Legal Ethics.                          ____________________
