 President, I compliment the chairman and ranking member of the committee.  This bill was held up for a long while. Provisions were added to the bill, which I totally support, that will allow people who were wrongly accused of having committed crimes to be able to have DNA testing to prove their innocence.  I don't want anyone to misunderstand why this is so important. All of you should know so you can tell your constituents. In fact, we set up a provision in the crime bill whereby when there is a rape or a sexual assault, we have put a lot of money--you have put a lot of money over the years into providing for training of police, training forensic nurses and doctors to be able to take DNA samples.  There are over 800,000 so-called rape case kits sitting on shelves of the cities where you live and the States you represent. They have never been tested because of the cost of testing them. The bottom line is that an estimated 48 percent of outstanding rapes could be solved by just comparing the database that will come from testing these kits and the existing database in our State prison systems where DNA is already on the record. This will liberate thousands of women from the fear and concern that the man who raped them is out there and will be back again.  We have done a good thing today. You should let your people back home know. It is a big deal.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
