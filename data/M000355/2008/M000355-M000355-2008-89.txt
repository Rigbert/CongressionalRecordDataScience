 President, if I may, our good friend, Senator Warner, has, of course, been a leader on this issue throughout his tenure in the Senate, and we respect his views. He has been a strong supporter of a strong national defense.  But the issue before us tonight is whether we are going to continue to try to solve the No. 1 issue in the country, and that is the price of gas at the pump. It is not whether we will do a Defense authorization bill.  The ranking member of the Armed Services Committee shares my view, that the first thing we ought to do is stay on the subject of energy, stay on the subject of getting the price of gas at the pump down, and then do the Defense authorization bill.  I am authorized to speak on behalf of the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee, our colleague, Senator McCain, who shares my view that at this particular moment, the most important issue related to the national security of our country is to stay on the subject of energy, finish the job, and then, as Senator Warner and Senator Levin have suggested, do the job of passing the Defense authorization bill.
