Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 363, as amended, at the request of the distinguished gentleman from Utah (Chairman Hansen), congratulating the people of Utah, the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and the competing athletes for an inspiring Olympic Winter Games. The Committee on International Relations, on which I serve as vice chairman, waived its consideration of this measure before the Easter recess to facilitate its consideration by the House today.  I am very pleased to join with my colleagues, particularly those from the State of Utah, in congratulating for a job well done not only each and every one of the 211 members of the United States Winter Olympics team, who won a record 34 medals and competed with great tenacity, focus and sportsmanship, but also the over 7,000 members of the law enforcement and public safety agencies and over 5,400 members of the Armed Forces who ensured that the games were safe for athletes and spectators alike. That was no small feat, Mr. Speaker, in light of the 9-11 world that we live in where terrorism and threats are a daily routine.  We also note with deep appreciation that the Olympic games would not have been possible without the active involvement of close to 20,000 Americans, whose volunteer efforts in Utah and around the country made a critical difference to the success of these games. Their legacy is an inspiration to all Americans and a shining example of what this country represents.  My understanding is that this resolution, as amended, does have broad bipartisan support, and I do hope that every Member of this Chamber will support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
