President, recently in my State, as throughout the world, Yom Kippur was celebrated. This beginning of the Jewish year comes as Vermonters and residents of other States are struggling to regain their footing and to renew their lives and livelihoods after the devastation wrought by Hurricane and Tropical Storm Irene.  Vermonters of all faiths can take heart and inspiration from the thoughts about the meaning of the Yom Kippur observance, in the context of the aftermath of this natural disaster, which were presented in a recent essay published in the Rutland Herald and the Huffington Post. It was written by my good friend, Rabbi Michael Cohen. Vermonters' resilience in the face of this devastation and its lingering challenges truly has been remarkable. I commend Rabbi Cohen's message to the Senate's attention, and I ask unanimous consent that his essay be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be prined in the Record, as follows:     Beginning the Jewish Year in the Aftermath of Hurricane Irene                        (By Rabbi Michael Cohen)       Acting as a leitmotif rain lightly showers the beginning of      the Jewish year. The powerful song Avinu Malkeiyu, Our      Father, Our King sung on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur was      written by the first and second century Rabbi Akiva as a      prayer for rain during a drought (Babylonian Talmud Taanit      25b). During the holiday of Sukkot, while the ancient Temple      stood in Jerusalem, the ceremony of drawing of the water,      Simchat Beit Ha-Shoeva was performed. It was said in the      Babylonian Talmud (Sukkot 51b), the rabbinic discussion of      Jewish law, that ``One who has not seen the joy of Simchat      Beit Ha-Shoeva has never seen true joy.'' Finally on Shemni      Etzeret, the one day holiday after Sukkot, Tefilat HaGeshem,      the Prayer for Rain is recited even to this day. With Judaism      arising out of a parched region of the world when it comes to      rain and water it is not surprising that such an emphasis is      placed on them.       For those of us living in parts of the United States where      the effects of Hurricane Irene are still an all too real      reality the thought of praying for rain can be somewhat      jarring. That being the case, what can the holidays at the      beginning of the Jewish year offer us in the wake of Irene?      The symbol most associated with the Jewish New Year is the      shofar, the ram's horn blown during Rosh Hashanah and at the      end of Yom Kippur. In the Torah, the five books of Moses,      Rosh Hashanah is actually called yom teruah, the day of      blowing (the shofar). There are numerous explanations why the      shofar is blown on Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur; it is also      blown every weekday during the month of Elul, the month      before Rosh Hashanah. One explanation that addresses those of      us who felt the wrath of Irene is taught by Rabbi Art Green.      In the Machzor, a prayerbook for the Jewish holidays, of the      Reconstructionist movement called Kol HaNeshamah Rabbi      Green writes:       The shofar sound represents prayer beyond words, an      intensity of longing that can only be articulated in a      wordless shout. But the order of the sounds, according to one      old interpretation, contains the message in quite explicit      terms. Each series of shofar blasts begins with tekiyah, a      whole sound. It is followed by shevarim, a tripartite broken      sound whose very name means ``breakings.'' ``I started off      whole'' the shofar speech says, ``and I became broken.'' Then      follows teruah, a staccato series of blast fragments, saying:      ``I was entirely smashed to pieces.'' But each series has to      end with a new tekiah, promising wholeness once more. The      shofar cries out a hundred times on Rosh Hashanah: ``I was      whole, I was broken, even smashed to bits, but I shall be      whole again!''       Hurricane Irene literally and figuratively broke in some      cases, and smashed in other cases, people, their lives, and      their possessions. The road to wholeness for some was quick,      for others longer, and for some they are still a traveler on      that journey. The message of the shofar, as taught by Rabbi      Green, can help remind us not to lose hope along that path. A      similar message is also taught during the Jewish High      Holidays, but in a different way.       According to the traditional reading of the Bible, Moses      received the Ten Commandments, called Aseret HaD'varim,      literally the Ten Words, (Exodus 34:28) on the 17th of     the Hebrew month of Tammuz. On that same day, ``Moses came      near the camp and saw the calf (idol) and the dancing, he      became enraged; and he hurled the tablets from his hands and      shattered them at the foot of the mountain.'' (Exodus 32: 19)      One can argue that the pinnacle of his life's work was the      receiving of the Ten Commandments; and there they lay      shattered at his feet. Moses could have given up then, but he      did not. Rather he climbed back up Mt. Sinai on the 1st of      Elul and remained there for 40 days. Remember, according to      the text he is 80 years old at the time. While up there he      asked to see God face to face, but God told him that that      would be impossible as he could not survive such an encounter      and live.       God tells Moses, after Moses carves a second set of blank      tablets that God will write the Ten Commandments on again, to      go to a crack in the mountain. At that point, as God's back      passes before Moses God reveals his essential attributes,      ``The Lord! the Lord! a God compassionate and generous, slow      to anger, abounding in kindness and faithfulness, extending      kindness to a thousand generations, forgiving iniquity,      transgression, and sin.'' (Exodus 34: These attributes are      sung as part of the liturgy of the Jewish holidays at the      beginning of the year, as well as at other holidays during      the year. At the beginning of the year they remind us when      Moses was back up on Mt. Sinai and when he returned to the      people with the new set of tablets 40 days later on Yom      Kippur.       Moses climbing back up the mountain serves as an important      model for all of us, not just those dealing with the      aftermath of Hurricane Irene. We all have moments in our      lives when something has been shattered. Often the easiest      way to deal with that new reality is to run away from it.      That is not what the actions of Moses tell us to do. When      Moses finds his life's work shattered in front of him he      turns back and retraces his steps up that steep mountain. The      word for repentance, the main theme of the holidays at the      beginning of the Jewish new year, in Hebrew is teshuvah which      means to return. Both the cycles of the shofar's notes and      the model of Moses returning to get a new set of tablets      provide us with a way to address what may have been shattered      by Hurricane Irene.                          ____________________
