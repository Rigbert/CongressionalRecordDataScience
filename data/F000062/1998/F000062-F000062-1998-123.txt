 McCAIN. Further parliamentary inquiry. Will the Parliamentarian describe the procedures here in the Senate called for as a result of a question, and that the Senate is not supposed to be abused by long, lengthy discussion of a question. This is clearly what is going on. It is not in keeping with the spirit of the Senate. There is another speaker waiting to speak, and that is why I am concerned about it. Otherwise, I would not care.  I ask a parliamentary inquiry, to describe the procedures of the Senate in this case.
