President, like most Americans, I start off the year with my new year's resolution to work harder at getting in shape. As always, my first stop is the Concept2 rowing machine in the Senate gym. I have used it for years, and always think of Vermont when I do.  The rowing machines are made in Vermont, and last fall the Burlington Free Press had an excellent article about the company and its founders. I ask that a copy of the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Free Press, Oct. 14, 2005]                             What a Concept                           (By Matt Crawford)       Morrisville.--Peter and Dick Dreissigacker will be on      Boston's Charles River next weekend, rowing their way toward      the finish line in the annual Head of the Charles regatta.       The Dreissigacker brothers are two members of an eight-man      team called the Motley Rowing Club--a team that captured      third place in its division during last year's race. If the      Motley team is beaten again, part of the blame can be placed      squarely on the broad shoulders of the Dreissigackers.       What Nike is to running, what Orvis is to fly-fishing, what      Burton is to snowboarding, Concept2 is to rowing. Concept2 is      a Morrisville-based company that employs 55 people, and it is      run and owned by Misters Peter and Dick Dreissigacker. The      company leads the world in producing oars used by crews and      sculling teams and controls a significant portion of the      global indoor rowing machine market, too. ``Their products      are found around the world,'' said Alex Machi, director of      rowing at Middlebury College. ``They easily dominate the oar      manufacturing business.''       How two Connecticut brothers maneuvered their      internationally successful company into the center of the      rowing universe from a small town in northern Vermont is a      remarkable tale, one that continues to evolve on rivers and      ponds and indoor gyms around the world . . .       ``The challenge,'' said Peter, ``is trying to continue to      improve on what we've got.''       Dick Dreissigacker, now 58, was a member of the 1972 U.S.      Olympic Rowing Team and a Brown University product. He      drifted out to California to take a rowing coaching position      at Stanford, a school Peter, who's four years younger, was      attending.       Dick was looking for a ``secret weapon'' after the 1972      Olympics and began to explore ways to improve oars, which had      been crafted out of wood pretty much since humans started      rowing boats through water. ``There were quite a few      companies making composite boats,'' said Peter, ``but nobody      was making oars.''       By 1976, the Dreissigackers had built a prototype of a      composite oar and began making them in the back of a bread      truck. They looked at places around the country and decided      to buy an old barn in Morrisville, partly because they were      from the Northeast, and started producing oars. By the 1980      Olympics, composite oars--made of carbon fiber and epoxies      and glues--were standard, thanks to the work of the      Dreissigacker boys.       The company makes ``sweep'' oars, oars for sculling and      oars for a small niche of rowers who specialize in trans-     Atlantic crossings. Oars range in price from about $200 to      more than $400 each, and there are custom orders, blade and      shaft repairs and stylized custom painting jobs that keep the      company's employees busy. Dick says there are two other      companies that are viewed as competitors with the      Dreissigackers, but Concept2 controls about two-thirds of the      world's competitive oar market.       In 1991, the Dreissigackers struck again, changing the      shape of the oar blades to a bigger, ``hatchet'' style, a      change that exploded through the rowing scene. At the 1992      Olympics in Barcelona, Spain, said Peter, ``boats were on the      water, changing their blades to our style.'' There was some      discussion of banning the bigger blade, which was more      efficient and more effective, but the style quickly became      the sport's standard. Two Middlebury teams and a University      of Vermont women's team will be using Concept2 oars when they      compete at the Head of the Charles next weekend. ``If 75 or      80 percent of the teams at the Head of the Charles are using      our oars,'' said Dick, ``then almost 100 percent of those      teams will have trained on our indoor trainers. They're      pretty much the standard.''       The Dreissigackers started making the indoor machines in      the mid-1980s, the first versions little more than bike      wheels and chains. Now the machines--their fourth version--     come equipped with computers to monitor an athlete's      performance and sell for $850. There are hundreds of them in      the Morrisville factory, stacked up and awaiting the start of      the Christmas buying season.       The first indoor rowing machines were called rowing      ergometers, or ``Ergs,'' for short, and the Dreissigackers      even developed a formula that allows the machines to measure      rowing ability--a number that the rowing world now refers to      as ``Erg scores.'' ``It's kind of like an athletic SAT      score,'' said Dick, who attributes Peter's higher Erg score      to the fact that he's four years younger, even though Dick      rows almost every day of the summer on a lake at his cottage      in Albany. There's a gym for Concept2 employees at the      company's headquarters, and yes, it is filled with rowing      machines. No longer in the barn, the company moved in 1984 to      a more industrial location, not far from the center of      Morrisville. The factory today is more than 45,000 square      feet.       Sarah Tousignant, a senior at the University of Vermont and      president of the school's women's rowing team, knows how      important Concept2's Erg machines are. The Catamounts train      six days a week on the Lamoille River using Dreissigacker      oars. They'll soon move inside for the winter and shift onto      Ergs. ``We just ordered 12 new Ergs from them,'' she said.       Most of the Head of the Charles athletes will be using      Dreissigacker oars, and nearly all will have trained and      honed their skills on Dreissigacker indoor machines. So even      if the Motley crew team gets beaten to the finish line on the      Charles River next weekend, the Dreissigackers still win.      With the Boston Red Sox out of baseball's playoffs, the eyes      of the sporting world turn to Boston this month for one      thing: The Head of the Charles Regatta.       A stretch? Consider that more than 7,000 athletes from      around the globe will compete in 24 race events in the 41st      annual Head of the Charles on Oct. 22-23. It is the world's      largest two-day rowing event. Rowing teams from the      University of Vermont and Middlebury College will be among      the competitors, as will brothers Dick and Pete Dreissigacker      from Morrisville.       The Dreissigackers, both former Olympics rowers, have been      competing in the Head of the Charles since 1978. In a way,      they'll be in the majority of boats on the river, given that      most of the competitors will be using oars made by the      Dreissigackers' Concept2 company. ``It's pretty much the most      prestigious fall race,'' said Sarah Tousignant, women's team      president of UVM rowing. ``It's the race that everybody looks      forward to and holds in high regard.'' The Head of the      Charles was first held Oct. 16, 1965. As many as 300,000      spectators are expected to be on hand for the weekend.                          ____________________
