President, today Senator Levin and I are introducing a resolution recognizing the historic Juneteenth Independence Day. June 19 is an ordinary day for many Americans but is a significant day for those who know its history. Juneteenth Independence Day celebrates June 19, 1865, when Union soldiers, led by Major General Gordon Granger, arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War had ended and that the enslaved were free.  Americans across the United States continue the tradition of celebrating Juneteenth Independence Day as an inspiration and encouragement for future generations. This legislation recognizes the historical significance of Juneteenth Independence Day and supports its continued celebration as an opportunity for the people of the United States to learn more about the past and to understand more fully the experiences that have shaped our nation.  As Americans, we must remember the lessons learned from slavery. Juneteenth is a day that all Americans, of all races, creeds and ethnic backgrounds, can celebrate freedom and the end of slavery in the United States. Therefore, I encourage my colleagues to recognize historic Juneteenth Independence Day and support this important resolution.                          ____________________
