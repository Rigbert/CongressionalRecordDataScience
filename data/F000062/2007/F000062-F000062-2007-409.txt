 This morning I was visited by a delegation from Tulare County, which is an agricultural county in the central valley of California. These were city and county officials who pointed out the enormous loss from the frost and the fact that it looks as though the citrus loss is going to be at least $800 million and the total loss will be over $1 billion. Nobody knows the tree loss yet, let alone the avocado or nursery plant loss or the row crop loss of strawberries and lettuce and other crops. But this will also have an impact onthe ability to find agricultural labor, and I think the Senator agrees, I know I agree, that we must pass the AgJOBS bill.  Madam President, an estimated 90 percent of agricultural labor in this country--the picker part of it, not necessarily the processing and canning part of it, but the picking part, the field work--an estimated 90 percent is by undocumented people. What we have tried to do is develop a plan, which actually passed the Senate once before as part of the comprehensive immigration bill, called AgJOBS. This also reformed the H-2A program.  We have been trying to get that bill up before this body for a vote. This next year is going to be a singularly difficult year for agriculture, and with the inability to get a consistent workforce, farmers don't know if they can plant, they don't know if they can prune, they don't know if they can pick, because they don't know if they will have enough labor.  My question to the Senator from Idaho through the Chair is, Do you agree with the statement I made?
