President, I rise today to again pay tribute to one of the Senate's finest: our colleague, the late Craig Thomas from Wyoming. Two years ago this week, the Senate lost a steady hand and a man who did much for his State of Wyoming. Craig was dependable in the finest sense of the word. He defined the word ``dependable.'' He was the epitome of a workhorse, not a show horse.  On a personal note, for many Senators, why, Craig was not only a colleague but a dear friend. I will cherish that always. Craig was also a fellow marine. In this case, Semper Fidelis--always faithful--is most appropriate. If anyone faced trouble in their life, the one person you would want by your side would be Craig Thomas.  This is why I am proud and honored again to join with my colleagues Kent Conrad and Tom Harkin, and with the new Senator from Wyoming, John Barrasso, and the distinguished Senator from Utah, Orrin Hatch, to introduce the Senate Rural Health Caucus bill in honor of Senator Thomas.
