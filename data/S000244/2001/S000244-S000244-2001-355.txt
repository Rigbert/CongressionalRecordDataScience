Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute to tell the rest of the story. The gentleman from Michigan is so right that the Articles of Confederation did require a supermajority of nine of the 13 States to raise taxes. But the Constitution as originally ratified by the States was even more severe. It prohibited direct taxes on the people and required a constitutional amendment in the beginning of the last century to allow the income tax to be constitutionally passed by Congress.  So if we are looking at what Madison hath written, Madison put an even greater straitjacket on the Congress' ability to raise taxes than the Articles of Confederation had.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Gibbons).
