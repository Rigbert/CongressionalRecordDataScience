Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 5418) to establish a pilot program in certain United States district courts to encourage enhancement of expertise in patent cases among district judges, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 5418       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PILOT PROGRAM IN CERTAIN DISTRICT COURTS.       (a) Establishment.--       (1) In general.--There is established a program, in each of      the United States district courts designated under subsection      (b), under which--       (A) those district judges of that district court who      request to hear cases under which one or more issues arising      under any Act of Congress relating to patents or plant      variety protection must be decided, are designated by the      chief judge of the court to hear those cases;       (B) cases described in subparagraph (A) are randomly      assigned to the judges of the district court, regardless of      whether the judges are designated under subparagraph (A);       (C) a judge not designated under subparagraph (A) to whom a      case is assigned under subparagraph (B) may decline to accept      the case; and       (D) a case declined under subparagraph (C) is randomly      reassigned to one of those judges of the court designated      under subparagraph (A).       (2) Senior judges.--Senior judges of a district court may      be designated under paragraph (1)(A) if at least 1 judge of      the court in regular active service is also so designated.       (3) Right to transfer cases preserved.--This section shall      not be construed to limit the ability of a judge to request      the reassignment of or otherwise transfer a case to which the      judge is assigned under this section, in accordance with      otherwise applicable rules of the court.       (b) Designation.--The Director of the Administrative Office      of the United States Courts shall, not later than 6 months      after the date of the enactment of this Act, designate not      less than 5 United States district courts, in at least 3      different judicial circuits, in which the program established      under subsection (a) will be carried out. The Director shall      make such designation from among the 15 district courts in      which the largest number of patent and plant variety      protection cases were filed in the most recent calendar year      that has ended, except that the Director may only designate a      court in which--       (1) at least 10 district judges are authorized to be      appointed by the President, whether under section 133(a) of      title 28, United States Code, or on a temporary basis under      other provisions of law; and       (2) at least 3 judges of the court have made the request      under subsection (a)(1)(A).       (c) Duration.--The program established under subsection (a)      shall terminate 10 years after the end of the 6-month period      described in subsection (b).       (d) Applicability.--The program established under      subsection (a) shall apply in a district court designated      under subsection (b) only to cases commenced on or after the      date of such designation.       (e) Reporting to Congress.--       (1) In general.--At the times specified in paragraph (2),      the Director of the Administrative Office of the United      States Courts, in consultation with the chief judge of each      of the district courts designated under subsection (b) and      the Director of the Federal Judicial Center, shall submit to      the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of      Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the      Senate a report on the pilot program established under      subsection (a). The report shall include--       (A) an analysis of the extent to which the program has      succeeded in developing expertise in patent and plant variety      protection cases among the district judges of the district      courts so designated;       (B) an analysis of the extent to which the program has      improved the efficiency of the courts involved by reason of      such expertise;       (C) with respect to patent cases handled by the judges      designated pursuant to subsection (a)(1)(A) and judges not so      designated, a comparison between the 2 groups of judges with      respect to--       (i) the rate of reversal by the Court of Appeals for the      Federal Circuit, of such cases on the issues of claim      construction and substantive patent law; and       (ii) the period of time elapsed from the date on which a      case is filed to the date on which trial begins or summary      judgment is entered;       (D) a discussion of any evidence indicating that litigants      select certain of the judicial districts designated under      subsection (b) in an attempt to ensure a given outcome; and       (E) an analysis of whether the pilot program should be      extended to other district courts, or should be made      permanent and apply to all district courts.       (2) Timetable for reports.--The times referred to in      paragraph (1) are--       (A) not later than the date that is 5 years and 3 months      after the end of the 6-month period described in subsection      (b); and       (B) not later than 5 years after the date described in      subparagraph (A).       (3) Periodic reporting.--The Director of the Administrative      Office of the United States Courts, in consultation with the      chief judge of each of the district courts designated under      subsection (b) and the Director of the Federal Judicial      Center, shall keep the committees referred to in paragraph      (1) informed, on a periodic basis while the pilot program is      in effect, with respect to the matters referred to in      subparagraphs (A) through (E) of paragraph (1).       (f) Authorization for Training and Clerkships.--In addition      to any other funds made available to carry out this section,      there is authorized to be appropriated not less than      $5,000,000 in each fiscal year for--       (1) educational and professional development of those      district judges designated under subsection (a)(1)(A) in      matters relating to patents and plant variety protection; and       (2) compensation of law clerks with expertise in technical      matters arising in patent and plant variety protection cases,      to be appointed by the courts designated under subsection (b)      to assist those courts in such cases.
