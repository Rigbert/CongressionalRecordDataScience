 Unfortunately, that is not what the Marine Corps has in mind. The Marine Corps wants, obviously, to have it both ways. They want to keep generals in the old redundant marine headquarters. In fact, the Marine Corps would like to place at least three of these 12 new generals in these overlapping commands.  Get this: We have 12 more generals. You say we need them because of Goldwater-Nichols. They want to place three of these new generals in these overlapping commands. They want to assign more generals to the new joint headquarters, too. I think the Marine Corps needs to make a choice and to place priorities where they belong. That is the argument, my comment, on Goldwater-Nichols.  The second is the use by the Senate Armed Services Committee of the rationale in its report language where it wants to make very clear that the extra generals are not needed for war-fighting jobs. It kind of backs up what I said in regard to the supposed argument that we need more generals because of the requirements of Goldwater-Nichols. The Armed Services Committee says they are not needed for war-fighting jobs. Remember, the purpose of our defense is the defense of the country. That involves the potential of going to war. That is war fighting.  I want to read the language one more time:       The increase is intended to permit the Marine Corps to have      greater representation at the general officer level on the      Department of Navy Secretariat staff and in the joint arena.  Now, that is not war fighting. The committee is saying that these generals are needed for bureaucratic infighting. That is the way I read it. And where? Maybe in the Pentagon budget wars.  Now, the Marine Corps tells an entirely different story. The Marine Corps has provided a list of 14 positions that might be filled with new generals.  Now, I know the legislation only called for 12, but the list covers 14 slots. I ask unanimous consent to have the list of these 14 generals for the Marine Corps printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 USMC Additional authorization request       CG, II Marine Expeditionary Force.       DepCG, I Marine Expeditionary Force.       DepComdr, MarForLant.       ADC, 1st Marine Division.       ADC, 2d Marine Division.       AWC, 2d Marine Aircraft Wing.       CG, MCRC/ERR.
