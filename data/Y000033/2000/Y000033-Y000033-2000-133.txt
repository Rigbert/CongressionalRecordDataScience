Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4148 makes technical changes in the Indian Health Self-Determination Education Assistance Act, and particularly to the contract support costs for the Indian Health Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs programs previously administered by the two departments.  This bill is technical in nature to ensure that tribal contractors recover their full and direct costs associated with these Federal programs, to receive funding for all Federal employees previously under the employment of IHS and BIA, and to direct the Secretaries of Health and Human Services to fully pay preaward and start-up costs without regard to the year in which such cost occurred.  Many tribal contractors have paid their preaward and start-up costs out of their own funds and have not been reimbursed for these programs by IHS and BIA. This corrects this inequity and prevents tribes from using their own program funds to pay for these administrative costs.  In a recent presentation at the Indian National Self-Governance conference in Nashville, Tennessee, Dr. Trujillio of the Indian Health Service reportedly told tribal representatives that the IHS supports enactment of H.R. 4148, as amended.  Again, Mr. Speaker, this bill is technical in nature and has been supported by all tribal contractors. I urge an aye vote for this important bill for American Indians and Alaskan Natives.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
