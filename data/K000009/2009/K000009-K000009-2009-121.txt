Speaker, I rise in support of S 352, the DTV Delay Act.  America is unready and as always, the poor and elderly are the most at risk. In my district alone, 4,569 people have requested vouchers for their analog televisions and have not yet received the coupons. Unless Congress acts, these televisions will flicker black. These constituents will not be able to hear news alerts, be notified of national emergencies and continue to be connected to the outside world through their televisions because the Government didn't follow through with a promise to provide DTV vouchers.  It is the Federal Government that for years, has been assuring these constituents that their televisions will not turn black as long as they follow through with the instructions and submit requests for digital television vouchers. It is imperative that we delay implementation of the digital transmission and fulfill the commitment we have made to our constituents that have followed the rules.  The legislation being considered today has important provisions which allow the FCC with flexibility in implementing these requirements. The bill permits the FCC to approve full DTV conversion in markets where the consumers are prepared for the transition before the hard date in June. Where the transition does occur before the June 12th date, this legislation allows first responders to take over the airwaves immediately once the analog signal space is open.  While this delay is unfortunate, it is a necessary step to assure that the millions of Americans televisions will not go dark because of a bureaucratic snafu.  In the multiple media markets in Ohio, 6.88 percent of the Dayton market is unready for the digital transition, 5.91 percent of theCleveland market, 4.4 percent of the Detroit market and 4.29 percent of the Columbus market. I urge a Yes vote on this legislation because I cannot simply turn my back on this many constituents.                          ____________________
