Madam Speaker, I want to thank my colleague for presenting this resolution.  Madam Speaker, I rise in tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Dr. King was a man I knew personally and regarded as a brother, friend, colleague, prophet, and my hero. He was a simple human being filled with love, peace and compassion for all humankind. He was a ray of hope who preached a doctrine of nonviolence and civil disobedience to combat segregation, discrimination, and racial injustice.  Dr. King's speech at the March on Washington transformed the steps of the Lincoln Memorial into a modern day pulpit. On that day, he shared his dream of the beloved community, a truly interracial democracy. I can still hear him say, ``I have a dream today, deeply rooted in the American Dream.''  It is fitting and appropriate that we pause, as a Nation and as a people, to remember the life of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. He inspired a Nation and changed America forever. It is also fitting that while remembering his life and his contributions, that we commit ourselves to serving our communities, to become the change that we all wish to see in the world.  Madam Speaker, today we encourage all citizens, especially our young people, to take the time to reflect on the teaching and the leadership of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. We encourage all people to do something today for your neighbor, for your community, for your country that will move us closer to Dr. King's dream of creating a beloved community.  I urge all Members to reflect on this day of service and peace. Remember Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s legacy this weekend; make a difference in your own community, and continue Dr. King's great legacy of service and make it your own.
