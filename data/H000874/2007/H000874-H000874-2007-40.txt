We believe very, very strongly, as you know, that the alternative minimum tax was never, ever meant to apply to some of the people it may well be applied to this tax year. We have passed legislation to prevent that. In that legislation, as the gentleman knows, was also tax cuts for millions of people on property taxes, on other taxes, tax relief for teachers who buy things for their classroom, in effect, business expenses for making sure that our kids are learning.  The Senate, as you know, tried to bring that bill, not that bill but the chairman of the Finance Committee today made a unanimous consent to place the alternative minimum tax relief bill on the floor of the United States Senate without paying for it and it was objected to, as you know, as you probably know, by a Republican Member of the Senate because there was a refusal, apparently not an allowed amendment on the flat tax. We think that is unfortunate.  In answer to your question, we hope the AMT, in fact, is passed by the Senate. We hope that it is paid for. We have committed ourselves to paying for things that we spend money on so our children don't have to pay for them.  But we are going to be working very hard next week, I want to assure the gentleman, to make sure that the AMT is, in fact, addressed so that the 23 million people who are at risk of a tax increase and were never intended to be, as both sides agree, do not have that reality come April 15.
