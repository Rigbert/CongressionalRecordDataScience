Chairman, I want to balance the budget for our children. I agree. I voted for a balanced budget amendment this year and in years past. I voted for the Stenholm amendment to balance the budget in 7 years.  But those who stand on this floor and say we are balancing the budget do not tell the truth. We are taking $9 billion from children that my constituents do not believe are pork, from seniors that my constituents do not think is waste, from rural health that my constituents do not believe is fraud, and from people who need energy assistance to keep warm and cool in distress, and people do not believe that is abuse.  Mr. Chairman, we are taking that $9 billion and we are giving it not to balance the budget, not to bring down the deficit, not to save our children from debt, but we are taking that money and we are shifting it over here to the wealthiest Americans among us so that they can have a tax cut.  We are not saving any money. We are not reducing the deficit by these cuts. In point of fact, we have been on a downhill slide on domestic spending like education and like health care.  Reject this bill. It is bad for America, it is bad for the future, it is bad for our children, and it does not make sense.                              {time}  1215
