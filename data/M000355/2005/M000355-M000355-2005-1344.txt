 The majority leader certainly has on his list for very near future consideration all of those judges, and I am pleased to hear they will be in all likelihood approved when they are brought up at a time of the majority leader's designation.  Let me repeat, all we are looking for is an up-or-down vote. We are not looking for a guaranteed outcome. But my friend from Illinois is probably suspicious that there will be success if up-or-down votes are granted because all of the judges who have been pending have bipartisan majority support.  We will look forward to dealing with all of the judges the Senator from Illinois would like to schedule, instead of the majority leader, in the very near future, but in the meantime we are dealing with the nomination of Justice Priscilla Owen to the Fifth Circuit.  Mr. President, I object.
