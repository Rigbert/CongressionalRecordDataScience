President, I am introducing legislation to improve the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act and am especially pleased to be joined by Senators Feingold, Torricelli and Schumer as original sponsors on this law enforcement effort. I am also pleased that the senior Senator from Colorado, Senator Campbell, is joining us, again, in this effort. We worked together closely and successfully last year to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act into law.  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, which President Clinton signed into law on June 16, 1998, authorizes the Department of Justice to award grants to pay for half of the cost of providing bulletproof vests for State and local law enforcement officers. Beginning this month, the Department of Justice plans to open the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program so that State, county and local law enforcement agencies may receive grants to pay for half of the cost of providing body armor for their officers. The entire application and payment process for the program will occur electronically via the Internet at http://vests.ojp.gov. I am confident that this innovative process will be a great success at harnessing the power of the information age to assist law enforcement do its job better, safer and more cost effectively. I want to commend the Attorney General and the Department for making this effort.  To build on the success of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program, our bipartisan legislation would permit the Department of Justice to waive, in whole or in part, the matching requirement for law enforcement agencies applying for bulletproof vest grants in cases of fiscal hardship. Some police departments in smaller jurisdictions may be unable to contribute half of the cost of buying body armor for their officers. This waiver provision was included in the Campbell-Leahy version of the Act introduced last year, but was unfortunately eliminated by others during House-Senate consideration of the final legislation.  Our bipartisan bill is strongly supported by Federal Bureau of Investigation Director Louis Freeh and the International Association of Chiefs of Police.  More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the country face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during routine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives, and I believe this new law will put vests on our State and local law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line.  I look forward to working with all Senators to ensure that each and every law enforcement community in Vermont and across the nation can afford basic protection for their officers.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.                                 S. 521       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
