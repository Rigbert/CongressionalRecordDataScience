 President, I rise in support of the Grassley amendment, which seeks to modify section 505 of this bill. Section 505, which is almost identical to S. 635, would eliminate Senate confirmation of retiring three-star and four-star officers.  Currently, the President nominates senior officers for retirement and they come before the Senate for confirmation. As we all know, in recent years, there has been great cause for Senate involvement in the confirmation of retiring officers. This new section would allow officers who have served 3 years in grade the ability to retire with their highest grade without action by the Senate.  On May 11 of this year, I joined Senators Grassley and Boxer in sending a letter to the Armed Services Committee outlining our concerns with the provisions in S. 635. At a minimum, we asked that public hearings be held before proceeding with this action. Obviously, my concerns with this section have not been alleviated.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the complete text of the letter sent to the Armed Services Committee be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 1995.     Hon. Strom Thurmond,     Chairman, Senate Committee on Armed Services,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: We are writing to express our concern      regarding S. 635, legislation recently introduced to      eliminate the Senate's role in confirming the retirement      nominations of military officers who hold three- and four-     star rank and who have served three years or more in grade.       As you know, the law governing the Senate role in approving      the retirement nominations of three- and four-star military      officers was enacted in 1947 and has been amended several      times since. Available information on the legislative history      of this issue indicates that the introduction of Senate      confirmation of senior military officers in 1947, for      promotion or retirement, was principally an issue of      separation of powers. One of the goals of the original      statute, the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, was to reinforce      civilian control over the military and increase Congressional      purview over what had once been an exclusive function of the      Executive Branch. We believe these principles are as valid      today as they were in 1947.       Perhaps even more importantly, Congress' governing power      and authority over the Nation's armed forces is clearly set      out in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. Of      additional relevance is Article II, Section 2, which      describes the Advice and Consent role of the U.S. Senate with      regard to Presidential appointments.       Therefore, we would like to take this opportunity to      outline our concerns regarding S. 635 and to respectfully      challenge the rationale behind its introduction.       Upon introduction of S. 635, the argument was made that our      Nation's highest ranking military officers should be treated      like their civilian superiors and other government officials.      We believe that civilian comparisons are not relevant to this      situation. The military, and indeed the Committee, have often      taken the position that civilian rules and laws are not      appropriate when applied to the unique role and mission of      our Nation's armed forces. It is precisely for these reasons      that we have concluded that requiring our highest ranking      military officials to come before the Senate for their      retirement      nominations provides an important safeguard for their      civilian leadership and the American taxpayer.       Likewise, we disagree with the argument that standards      acceptable in the private sector are relevant to the      military. For a variety of reasons, including the involvement      of taxpayer funds, public service really bears no comparison      to private sector service when it comes to standards of      accountability and compensation.       Perhaps most importantly, we are concerned with this issue      as it relates to leadership and command accountability in our      Nation's armed services. The central issue in considering      retirement nominations has been, and remains, that service in      our Nation's military, especially at the highest levels, is a      privilege and an honor. We continue to believe that the      military should be governed by the highest standards, and      that command accountability to those standards should in no      way be compromised.       An additional argument made in support of S. 635 is that      this legislation will ``reduce the administrative work load      of the Senate Armed Services Committee and the Department of      Defense.'' We are sympathetic with this goal, but we believe      that S. 635 fails to provide an effective and prudent      response to this problem. We understand that in fiscal year      1993, for example, the Committee was asked to review just six      grade 0-10 officers for retirement, and less than twenty at      grade 0-9. In total, these retirement nominations represented      just a fraction of the total number of nominations reviewed      by the Committee--which we have been told numbered in the      thousands. According to the Congressional Research Service,      the numbers for 1993 are typical of the work load presented      in other years by these retirement nominations.       Moreover, we reject the idea that military nominations, be      they for promotions or retirements, are nothing more than      routine ``administrative workload.'' Reviewing military      nominations is one of the Armed Services Committee's most      important responsibilities. It is a Constitutional      responsibility and an important tool for maintaining civilian      control and accountability. It is also a way of keeping the      Senate involved in the crucial process of nurturing military      leadership.       Since the passage of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947,      your Committee has held the view that the top-most military      and naval officers in the Nation should be subject to Senate      approval. The reason for this is quite simple: the question      of who gets the ``top rank'' will in the log-run determine      the overall quality of      the leadership in the Armed Forces. And having top quality      military officers is probably the single most important      ingredient of military strength.       Keeping the Senate involved in the promotion and retirement      process as the final, independent check will help to ensure      that only the best are rewarded with top-level promotions.      Most of those promotions go to future leaders, but some are      given as rewards at retirement for outstanding service.       Retirement nominations are no less significant than others      handled by the Committee. As you know, retired members of the      armed forces can be recalled to active duty at any time,      voluntarily or involuntarily, and therefore the status      conferred on those individuals at the time of retirement      carries much more than ceremonial significance.       Finally, last year we were encouraged by the Senate's      almost unanimous support of the Moseley-Braun/Murray      amendment to the FY 1995 Defense Authorization Act which      required that the armed services improve the procedures by      which discrimination and sexual harassment complaints are      processed. In part, the amendment states:       ``The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that the Department      of Defense regulations governing consideration of equal      opportunity matters in evaluations of the performance of      members of the Armed Forces include provisions requiring as a      factor in such evaluations consideration of a member's      commitment to elimination of unlawful discrimination or of      sexual harassment in the Armed Forces.''       This statutory language reflects an important public      policy, but we are concerned that      without strong enforcement mechanisms DoD will not get the message. It      is our understanding that so far DoD has missed every      deadline for reporting to Congress and adopting the new anti-     discrimination regulations required under the Amendment. This      foot dragging underscores the need to maintain congressional      oversight, including the Senate confirmation of retirement      nominations where relevant leadership can be questioned on      these types of matters. We believe it would be very unwise to      relinquish this important tool for assuring compliance with      national anti-discrimination policies and others critical to      military readiness. In addition, less senior members of our      armed forces who cannot turn to an independent judiciary with      an unresolved but persistent discrimination or whistleblowing      complaint deserve to know that their leadership is routinely      held accountable to the highest standards.       In short, we have serious reservations about S. 635, and we      hope you will consider our views carefully when reviewing      this legislation. At a minimum, we strongly urge the      Committee to hold a public hearing on this issue before any      further action is taken.       Thank you very much for your consideration.           Sincerely,     Patty Murray.     Charles Grassley.     Barbara Boxer.
