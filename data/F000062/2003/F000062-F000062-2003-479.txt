 President, today commemorates the forty-fourth anniversary of the 1959 ``Lhasa Uprising.''  I offer my comments today in the sincere hope that it will promote a constructive dialogue between Chinese and Tibetan leaders, and with the goal of ending the bitter divisiveness now plaguing relations between China and Tibet.  When, following the Chinese invasion in 1949-1950, Tibet was established as an autonomous region in the People's Republic of China, the Tibetan people were granted the right of autonomy in determining the shape of their religious, cultural and social institutions. China's leadership is on record as agreeing to this principle.  Unfortunately, between 1951 and 1959 the government of the People's Republic of China did not uphold these guarantees of autonomy, leading to the 1959 Lhasa Uprising and the flight of the Dalai Lama from Tibet. During the past 44 years, tens of thousands of Tibetans have been forced to flee their homeland in the face of continued Chinese repression and violation of their right to religious and cultural autonomy. I find this a tragedy.  Nonetheless, the Dalai Lama, in seeking to engage with China's leadership to discuss the future of the Tibetan people, has specifically cited that he is not seeking independence for Tibet, that he is willing to confine his discussions to achieving cultural and religious autonomy for his people, and that he is willing to negotiate within the framework enunciated by Deng Xiaoping in 1979.  Indeed, in his statement today on the ``44th Anniversary of the Tibetan National Uprising,'' the Dalai Lama stated that ``As far back as the early seventies in consultation with senior Tibetan officials I made a decision to seek a solution to the Tibetan problem through a ``Middle Way Approach.'' This framework does not call for independence and separation of Tibet. At the same time it provides genuine autonomy for the six million men and women who consider themselves Tibetans to preserve their distinctive identity, to promote their religious and cultural heritage that is based on a centuries-old philosophy which is on benefit even in the 21st century, and to protect the delicate environment of the Tibetan plateau. This approach will contribute to the overall stability and unity of the People's Republic of China.''  Over the past 12 years I have made every effort to encourage rapprochement between China and Tibet, including helping to pass messages from His Holiness, the Dalai Lama to China. I believe the Dalai Lama is absolutely sincere in his desire to negotiate a peaceful solution to what has been a great tragedy for the Tibetan people.  This past September the Chinese government made it possible for two envoys of the Dalai Lama to visit Beijing to re-establish direct contact with the Chinese leadership, and to visit Tibet to meet with local Tibetan officials. This trip was, in my view, very significant, very encouraging, and very meaningful.  Nonetheless, much remains to be done if the people of Tibet are to achieve freedom and autonomy in determining the shape of their society. It is my sincere hope that China's new leadership will extend the hand of cooperation in resolving differences with Tibet.                          ____________________
