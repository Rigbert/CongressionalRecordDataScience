Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time.  Mr. Chairman, before I speak about the specifics of the bill, I want to pay tribute to the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot]. This is his first year as chairman of the committee. As I said on a number of occasions, I would not have planned that he be chairman of the committee, because it means, of course, that I am not chairman of the committee. But if we had to have a new chairman and I was going to be replaced, I am very thankful that it was the gentleman from Iowa, [Mr. Lightfoot].  The gentleman is one of our finest Members, he is a conscientious, effective leader on his side of the aisle, and he is first an American who cares about the efficiency and effectiveness of the application of the tax dollars of our citizens. He is a pleasure to work with, and I congratulate him for the work he has done to date. He has cooperated with the minority side and with me individually each step of the way, and I would like to thank him for that.  I particularly want to thank the staff, some of whom have been with the committee, and I want to say that they have also cooperated very closely with me individually and other members of the minority side of the committee, and with our staffs. That cooperation, I think, has helped the confidence that each of us have in dealing with one another. We have not agreed on every issue, but we are working cooperatively together.  Having said that, Mr. Chairman, let me make an observation that I make almost every time I start to talk on an appropriations bill. The American public and our colleagues need to understand that we have a financial problem at the Federal level. We have a deficit that must be dealt with. We have a deficit that has been growing. We have a deficit that is crowding out capital funds for economic expansion. I am a supporter of the balance budget amendment, because I believe we need an extrinsic constraint which will force us and, yes, force the American public to make tough choices.  Having said that, Mr. Chairman, it is important for us to realize that the expansion of Federal expenditures has not, and I underline has not, occurred in the discretionary spending items over which the Committee on Appropriations has jurisdiction. In point of fact, as we have pointed out on a number of occasions, the Committee on Appropriations has appropriated less money than the Presidents have asked for since 1981, and, indeed, even before that. But particularly in the administrations of Mr. Reagan and Mr. Bush, Presidents Reagan and Bush, we appropriated about $100 million less than they asked for.  It was not that the appropriation process got out of hand that led to the substantial operating deficits during the last decade. The fact of the matter is entitlements have grown exponentially. The fact of the matter is that we have not come to grips with that, and if we do not come to grips with it, very frankly, we are going to crowd out all discretionary spending, all investment spending, all of the decisionmaking process in which we involve ourselves annually as to where to apply the resources of our Nation.  In point of fact, Mr. Speaker, since 1953 until today, we have gone from spending approximately 18 percent of our Gross Domestic Product in discretionary spending, making decisions where to invest on defense and on the domestic side, to where now less than 8 percent of our GDP at the Federal level is spent on discretionary spending between defense and nondefense discretionary spending.                              {time}  1200  Why do I make that preface? Because we are going to have on the floor perhaps an amendment to cut this million dollars or $10 million or $20 million. That is significant money, of course. But the fact of the matter is, it will not solve the deficit. And it is not the reason the deficit grew, notwithstanding what the National Taxpayers Union says on the voting on these individual, sometimes small and sometimes significant, dollar amendments.  The Treasury, Postal bill, Mr. Chairman, has been a hard bill to put together for fiscal year 1996. Based on the deck we have been dealt, however, with our 602(b) allocation, it is an inadequate allocation to fund the priorities and responsibilities in this bill for law enforcement, for tax collection and for other matters.  In addition to law enforcement and revenue collection, the Customs is also in this bill, and every American is worried about the integrity of our borders. Every American is worried about the commerce and the stealing of jobs from the U.S. workers. Customs plays a critical role in that, and they are being sorely tested in terms of the resources that have been made available to them in this bill.  Within the limited resources of which I have just spoken, however, I think the chairman and the committee have tried to do the best job possible in funding the allocations of the agencies under this bill. The $23.2 billion provided in the bill is about $322 million below the amount we appropriated last year and $1.8 billion below the amount requested by the administration; in other words, almost 10 percent below what the administration requested. And I might say, of course, this bill is divided about half discretionary spending, half on the mandatory side in terms of Federal retirement and Federal employment health benefits.  On the positive side, Customs and law enforcement have been funded pretty much at the administration's request. The IRS tax system modernization has been accommodated under the administration's new estimate for fiscal year 1996. The committee bill also includes funding for tax systems modernization at the Internal Revenue Service. This broad effort to update all aspects of IRS's computer and processing systems is, Mr. Chairman, a very high priority for our country.  On the negative side, we have not been able to proceed with the funding of the IRS tax enforcement program off budget and, therefore, have had to spread the program over 7 years, a decision with which I did not agree, do not agree now and which will cost us money.  Mr. Chairman, you will recall that last year we unanimously in a bipartisan fashion had agreement that we would fund the tax enforcement program off budget. Why? It was a $2 billion, 5-year initiative that would gain us over $9 billion, in other words a $4 return for every dollar invested. CBO, OMB and the Congress agreed that it made sense to put that off budget in light of the fact it was a money maker, not a money loser.  However, we have not done that this year. In fairness to the chairman, however, the administration suggested that we put it on budget. Now, to the extent that it does appropriately and accurately reflect expenditures, that made sense. On the other hand, it forced the chairman and the committee to stretch this program over 7 years, and that will cost us revenues and make it difficult to administer at the Treasury Department.  Mr. Chairman, those are some of the more positive aspects. Unfortunately, I and this side of the aisle are very concerned about some aspects of this bill. I believe that there are a number of political decisions. I know the chairman disagrees with that. He says these are economic decisions, fiscal decisions, but I believe we are making some political decisions in this bill which are wrong. The elimination of the Council of Economic Advisors, every head of the Council of Economic Advisors, an institution which advises the President on macroeconomic issues, an institution which everybody that I have talked to says is one of the more objective, outside-of-government advisory groups that we have in Government to advise the President on macro- and micro-economic issues, this is critically important. The President, every day, needs to confront issues which are impacted by his information and perception of what the macroeconomic and microeconomic impacts are of decisions to be made by the White House.  It is wrong to eliminate this agency in the way it was done. There were no hearings. Now, I want to say that we cut the Administrative Conference of the United States the same way. I though we were incorrect and we changed that decision. But the fact of the matter is there were no hearings which were directed at elimination of this agency. And every head, Republican and Democrat, for the last two decades opposes this provision.  The most recent former administration head of the Council of Economic Advisors, Michael Boskin, has written a letter opposing this provision, as have Charlie Schultze and Herb Stein, CEA directors under President Nixon and President Carter.  Furthermore, Mr. Chairman, we have cut the White House office. We have not cut it a great deal, but significantly enough to adversely affect the ability of the White House to run its shop. I will discuss this later in the bill, but this is wrong.  In fact, from 1981 to 1992, under a Democratic House and for the last 6 years of that period, under a Democratic Senate, we essentially accepted the White House's request. For the last 2 years this President has been subjected to cuts from the Republican side not based upon the finances of the office but based upon, in my opinion, the intent to impact adversely the political independence of the President of the United States to make policy judgment as he or she sees fit.  Mr. Chairman, that is wrong. There is not going to be an amendment offered, I understand, which will affect the transportation of the White House. But there are too frequently now folks who are willing to undermine the historical, two-century comity between the President and the legislative branch in the Congress, where the President says to the legislature, you pass your budget, and I will pass mine. Neither will impact the other because both of us have to go to the American public.  I am not talking about the executive departments. I am talking about the White House office. The Office of Management and Budget, and other executive branch offices were cut. I think that is unfortunate. We oppose that.  All reflect an initiative that is politically aimed at the President. The Committee on Appropriations has honored presidential requests, as I have said, in the last period of time that I have been on the committee. I have opposed cuts to President Reagan and President Bush's budget for exactly that reason.  Also, Mr. Chairman, there are cuts to the Federal Election Commission. The inclusion of language restricting the choices for Federal health insurance which we will oppose. They take on a political tone that I do not think is helpful for the bipartisan nature of this bill. I also believe that the elimination of the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations will interfere, Mr. Chairman, with the executive branch's responsibility to monitor unfunded mandates.  The irony of this bill is we eliminate the Administrative Conference on Intergovernmental Relations, the Commission on Intergovernmental Relations for the purposes of saving $1.4 million. We then provide in this bill a committee provision, protected under the rule language, which provides for an advisory committee on the mandates which we have just eliminated another agency to do. In other words, on the one hand we are going to have money spent, $300-some-odd thousands to accomplish the purpose of an agency that we are now doing away with. It simply does not makes sense, in my opinion.  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that the full Committee on Appropriations took out a provision which was very foolishly included by the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government at markup that would have provided background checks for rich felons so that they could have received approval to have their guns back. We had information at the subcommittee and the full committee that we brought out where you had murderers reapplying for reinstatement of their privileges to have a gun and they were approved. That made no sense. No taxpayer is asking me to spend their money to make sure that criminals get their guns back. That does not make sense, and I am pleased that the chairman saw fit at the full committee to offer language to reinstate language included in our bill in 1992. That language was good then, it is good now. And I am pleased that the chairman put it back in.  Finally, Mr. Chairman, I am concerned that neither the President nor the committee has provided the full 5.9 percent increase that the Civil Service is due as employment cost index and locality pay increases under the Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act. This was an act signed by President Bush in 1990. It tried to provide and did provide for a rational way to compare the private sector and the public sector and to make sure that our work force would be competitive and would be comparable to the private sector. Unfortunately, the President has only provided 2.4 percent in his recommendation. The bill is silent on this issue. And unless the President provides for a higher sum come August, next month, that will be limited to 2.4 percent.  I will be discussing with the President, and I know others will, as to the distribution of that 2.4 percent between comparability adjustment and locality pay, but is it very unfortunate that we are going to be falling further behind the private sector in pay comparability as a result of the actions of the President and of this committee.  Mr. Chairman, in closing, I hope that the provisions that detract from the positive side of the bill can be changed on the floor and during the full legislative consideration of the bill. Again, I thank the chairman for all of his cooperation and inclusion in the work of this committee. I look forward to working with him as we consider the individual titles of this bill.   Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
