President, in September 1998, I introduced, with the support of Senator Daschle and several other Democratic Senators, a comprehensive crime bill, S. 2484, and am pleased today to join in introducing an updated version of that bill, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1999. A number of provisions from S. 2484 were enacted last year and it is my hope that this new bill, S. 9, will have similar success.
