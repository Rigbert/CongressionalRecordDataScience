Speaker, I rise today to recognize the tremendous accomplishments of Air Force Colonel Eileen Marie Collins as the first female space shuttle commander. Col. Collins represents the best in America's space program and I congratulate her and the crew for the successful deployment of the Chandra X-Ray Observatory during the STS-93 Mission aboard the Shuttle Columbia. With three missions under her belt, Col. Collins has certainly become one of our most experienced astronauts.  I look forward to seeing the results of the time and resources invested in making the Chandra X-Ray Observatory a reality. The telescope will give scientists an important tool to study phenomena like exploding stars, quasars and black holes.  Chandra and other major projects like Hubble and Landsat are the results of a team effort of NASA scientists, engineers, contractors, educational institutions and the highly trained astronauts who place these satellites and observatories into orbit. While we commend the efforts of this mission and NASA's many previous accomplishments, I am deeply concerned by the $1 billion cut in NASA's overall budget of $13.6 billion and the impact this will have on future programs like Hubble's successor, the Next Generation Space Telescope.  Goddard Space Flight Center is one of NASA's premier research and program management facilities and the facility that will be most impacted by the cuts. The $1 billion dollar cut would adversely impact NASA's Space and Earth Science Programs based at Goddard. These are serious cuts and I am deeply concerned with the impact this will have on the almost 12,000 employees that work either directly as employees or indirectly as contractors.  So as we recognize the success of STS-93 and Col. Collins' tremendous achievement, let us also keep in mind that future programs like Discovery and the Next Generation Space Telescope--programs that will utilize the shuttle program--face an uncertain and unnecessary fate, as a result of these cuts.                          ____________________
