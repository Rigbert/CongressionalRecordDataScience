 President, I further ask the chairman of the committee. He may well have received--I know I did and other Members of the Senate did--a letter today from William Donohue, Ph.D., who is president of the Catholic League For Religious and Civil Rights. He said, among other things, in his letter:       Some of Pryor's critics are themselves Catholic and thus      resist the contention that is being opposed because of his      religion. But they do so by falsely claiming that on the      subject of abortion, there is more than one acceptable      position for Catholics to take. They are dead wrong. Catholic      teaching on abortion is unequivocal: It is gravely sinful.      This is not a matter of dispute--it is a matter of doctrine      that all Catholics are expected to uphold. Especially public      officials.       The danger, then, is that Bill Pryor may be rejected      because of his religious convictions.  I think what is so disturbing here to many of us--I am personally not a Catholic--is that you could adhere to the teachings of your church and then in effect be penalized for it even though there is no evidence that in carrying out your duties as a public official you wouldn't follow the law.  I ask the chairman: Are we being penalized for our own personal religious convictions in seeking public positions?
