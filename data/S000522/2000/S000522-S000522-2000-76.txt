Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that I think is tremendously exciting in terms of the potential to help developing nations of the world in two areas: food production and health.  This amendment sets aside $30 million for plant biotechnology research and development. Its language reflects language put in the Senate bill by Senator Bond of Missouri. It is technology aimed at solving the health and humanitarian and environmental challenges, particularly in the developing world. Indeed, the fruits of this research promise to address some of the most serious challenges faced there: hunger, malnutrition, drought, pestilence, and disease. Can we imagine if we develop a kind of plant that can now grow in those arid soils where food cannot be grown at the present time.  Since we first cultivated about 10,000 years ago, mankind has searched for ways to improve them. Traditional selection and cross-breeding has been very useful in improving crop plants, but this is a time-consuming process that commonly produces unwanted traits that must be eliminated. We now have over 1,000 biotech products on the market.  With the development of biotechnology, plant breeders are now able to develop new varieties of plants in a level of precision and range unheard of just 2 decades ago. The potential benefits to mankind are limited only by the resourcefulness of our scientists. Just today, it was announced that genes are the major cause of cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer.  U.S. farmers, of course, have been quick to adopt the plants modified by biotechnology, and it is also spreading around the world. But as great as the potential of biotechnology here in the United States is, it holds even greater promise to solve many intractable problems facing farmers and hungry people, consumers in the developing world. Improved crop plants promise to mitigate common agricultural problems in much of the developing world through weather, pest and drought resistance, improved nutrition, and higher yields.  On April 13, as chairman of the Subcommittee on Basic Research, I issued a report on the benefits of safety and oversight of regulation, Seeds of Opportunity, a large section of which is devoted to a discussion of the potential benefits of this technology in improving nutrition, health, and feeding a growing worldwide population.  A white paper issued just yesterday, a white paper was issued by the National Academy of Sciences, joined by the Royal Society of London, the Brazilian, Chinese, Indian, Mexican, and Third World Academies of Science put the situation plainly, and I quote: ``Today there are some 800 million people who do not have access to sufficient food to meet their needs. Malnutrition plays a significant role in half of the nearly 12 million deaths each year of children under 5 in developing countries.''  Still quoting, ``In addition to lack of food, deficiencies in micro-nutrients, especially vitamin A, iodine and iron, are widespread.''  They conclude that agricultural biotechnology research and development should be aggressively pursued, and I quote again, ``to increase the production of main food staples, improve the efficiency of production, reduce the environmental impact of agriculture, and provide access to food for people and farmers around the world.''  Mr. Chairman, let me just conclude. I am excited about this. I think agricultural biotechnology and gene technology offer tremendous opportunities, only limited by the creativity and funding for research dollars.                              {time}  0020  It can play a major role in helping developing countries become self-sufficient in food production.  One example of its promise is the development of a new strain of rice. It is called golden rice. It contains both beta carotene and iron, and work is underway to get this new variety to the field.  The merging of medical and agricultural biotechnology has opened up new ways to develop plant varieties with characteristics to enhance health.  It was announced today that this kind of gene research has huge potential in the developing world. Researchers are now working on developing plants that will develop medicines and edible vaccines through common foods that could be used to immunize the kids around the world. This is significantly important.                             Point of Order
