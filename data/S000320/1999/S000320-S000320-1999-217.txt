 President I will take just a minute and commend the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Domenici, and also the junior Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Bingaman, for their work in bringing this about. I think what they have done is drafted a good amendment. I have no problem with it, and I am sure Senator Kerrey doesn't.  I urge adoption of the amendment.
