President, I rise today to once again speak out against what I consider to be and many others consider to be a regulatory assault on our Nation's economy. I have previously discussed my concerns with regulations having a negative impact on our agriculture community. That was last week. Earlier this week, I spoke about what I consider to be the egregious regulations that are being promulgated by the EPA, or what Senator Grassley calls the ``end of production agriculture agency.''  Today, I rise to talk about health care regulations that patients and providers have brought to my attention. I have listed a number of these regulations in a letter I sent earlier today to President Obama. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 2011.     President Barack Obama,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear President Obama: I write you today to express my      sincere appreciation for the Executive Order that you issued      on January     18, committing all federal agencies to review regulations and      remove any that place unreasonable burdens on our nation's      business community and/or impact the ability of our economy      to grow. I agree that in light of our current economic      crisis, establishing a regulatory environment that promotes      growth and job creation should be the number one priority for      this Congress and Administration. To that end, I would like      to offer some suggested areas related to health care that      patients and providers have communicated are of the most      concern to them, and would urge you and your Administration      to consider these and their impact when implementing your      Executive Order.       While the majority of this communication will focus on      regulations already on the books, I would also like to take      this opportunity to share with you what seems to be an even      greater concern within the patient, provider and stakeholder      community. When discussing regulations in general and your      Executive Order more specifically with my constituents and      those representing the patient and provider community, the      number one concern that I hear is related to a fear of the      impact of future regulations. While there is still a large      concern with the burden of regulations that have already been      issued, I have heard time and time again that there is an      even greater concern with the uncertainty of future      regulations, especially those regulations for implementing      the ``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act'' (PPACA)      and their potential to have a further and greater impact on      jobs and the economy. While I regularly hear concerns about      the compounding costs related to implementing any and all of      these regulations, the specific areas that are mentioned the      most include, but are not limited to:       Individual Mandate and related penalties       Employer Mandate and related penalties       Defining Essential Health Benefits and related coverage      mandates       Accountable Care Organizations       New taxes and fees including the ``Cadillac Tax'' and new      excise taxes on industries       1099 reporting       Additionally, I hear often that patients and providers feel      that they do nut have a voice in the regulatory process and,      more specifically, that a number of regulations are being      issued through a shortened process. This shortened process      allows limited or no input from those most affected by the      regulations, prior to their implementation, and may result in      greater costs and economic impact if changes are necessary      based on comments that the Administration receives. It is my      understanding that the PPACA rules that have been issued as      interim final rules, and therefore with limited input are:       National Provider Identifier       Web Portal Requirements       Early Retiree Reinsurance Program       Coverage of Children to Age 26       Underserved Rural Communities       Grandfathered Health Plans       Pre-Existing Condition Exclusions       Preventive Services       Internal Claims/Appeals and External Review Processes       Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan Program       Amendment to Grandfathered Health Plans Rule       Medical Loss Ratio Requirements       While there may have been instances in which a shortened      process was necessary or appropriate I would strongly      encourage your Administration to limit the use of this      regulatory process and take every available opportunity to      get feedback from those who would be most affected by these      regulations and allow for ample time to review and consider      that feedback prior to implementing future regulatory      priorities. I would also strongly encourage you to review any      comments you have received on these regulations for any      concerns that indicate a potential to further our economic      crisis.       Without fail in my conversations with patients, providers,      advocates, and stakeholders, which include my Kansas      constituents, I hear about their concerns with the burden of      government ``red tape'' and the impact of regulations on      their ability to maintain and grow their businesses. While      this is not an exhaustive list, I will share the health care      regulations that I have been hearing about the most and would      ask you to review them for their potential economic impact      and modify or remove them to ensure the least burden on our      struggling businesses, individuals, and economy.       It should come as no surprise the regulations that I am      hearing the most about are related to the impact of PPACA.      Although the full impact of recently passed health care      legislation is still uncertain, it is clear that additional      employer costs will be substantial, as will the burden of      what promises to be extreme complexity in compliance. Already      patients, providers and advocates have cited a number of      regulations related to PPACA that would have profound impact      on jobs and our economy. Specifically:       The ``Preexisting Condition Insurance Plan'' and the      concern that it is not being utilized efficiently to provide      an option for those unable to afford coverage;       The ``Patients Bill of Rights'' and the concern that it has      resulted in the loss of child-only insurance markets in over      20 states;       ``Grandfathered'' health plan regulation and a concern that      the regulation is drafted too narrowly to allow businesses to      keep their current coverage and maintain current costs of      coverage and are too cumbersome and don't allow plans to      comply with ``the early requirements over a period of time'';       ``Medical Loss Ratio'' and the concern that the calculation      of the standard will increase cost of care for patients and      the concern that it will directly result in lost employment      and more specifically the omission of health care fraud work      as part of ongoing quality improvement activities;       ``Rate Review'' and the concern that this requirement will      do nothing to control costs and that there are a number of      areas within the rule that could cause significant and      negative disruption to States and consumers;       ``Annual and Lifetime limits'' and the concern over the      impact on businesses and individuals the more than 1,000      waivers already issued will have.       Additionally, I have heard that the combination of the      regulations being issued to implement the PPACA statute have      resulted in an increase in premiums for individuals and      businesses, which as you know results in increased costs and      tough choices. Related to this, I am deeply concerned by      signals from your Administration that regulations being      issued to implement the PPACA statute will not be held under      the scrutiny of your Executive Order. I would strongly      encourage your Administration to review all of the      regulations that have been issued, past, present and future,      while considering their impact on our economy and jobs.       Finally, patients and providers have expressed a number of      concerns related to the regulatory burdens that they face.      Generally, they have asked that while the Administration may      measure indirect benefits for regulatory proposals, that      there is a lack of willingness to analyze and make publicly      available the indirect costs to consumers, such as higher      energy costs, jobs lost, and higher prices and would request      that a reasonable estimate of indirect impact and the      methodology used in determining those impacts be made      available. They would prefer that agencies be accountable for      providing a balanced statement of costs and benefits in      public regulatory proposals. Also, I have heard that a number      of patients and providers are being buried by the paperwork      burden of complying with all of the regulations.      Specifically, I have heard about the compliance burden of      having to adjust to the sheer volumes of changes that the      Administration issues every year and the impact on providers      to do their jobs and provide care for patients.       The regulations that I have been hearing about their      negative economic impacts and would suggest you review are:       The 2011 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule, which      requires that laboratory requisition forms are signed by the      ordering physician. This rule could have potentially serious      implications on patient care and business practice. Under      this new policy, laboratories will face a difficult decision      when they receive a patient specimen with an unsigned      requisition. Laboratories will have to decide not to provide      their needed services and therefore be unable to provide a      physician the information necessary to make health care      decisions--or--provide the services without a guarantee of      payment and then work to obtain signatures in order to submit      claims to Medicare. As you can imagine, in the former      situation, care may be significantly delayed; in the latter      scenario the laboratories who serve a high percentage of      Medicare beneficiaries could spend a large amount of time      contacting providers to gather the required signatures and      could see their payments delayed or face the possibility of      being unable to receive payment.       On November, 17, 2010, CMS issued a final rule, as directed      by PPACA (P.L. 111-148). The rule conditions payment for home      health and hospice services based upon a face-to-face      encounter between patients and their physicians or certain      non-physician practitioners prior to certification for home      health or hospice services. This is resulting in burdensome      requirements for our rural home health and hospice patients.       Physicians Assistants are an important part of care for      rural communities especially hospice and palliative care;      however, they are often not considered when drafting      regulations related to providers allowed to provide services.       Anti-Switching Rule in Medicare's Competitive Bidding      Program (CBP) for Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics,      Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS). Specifically, the proposal      to enforce the rule in subsequent rounds of the CBP, but not      Round 1, may compromise beneficiary access to appropriate      diabetes testing supplies and leave beneficiaries vulnerable      to pressure from suppliers to switch testing systems.       DMEPOS Competitive Bidding implementation continues to be a      concern. We originally had over 400 DME providers in KS;      however, now that Round 1 has been implemented I am concerned      that patients, especially in rural areas, are facing issues      related to access.       Two sets of regulations and guidance--one for hospices and      one for rural health clinics--that may have resulted in an      oversight in the Medicare billing regulations is creating      obstacles for individuals in rural, underserved communities      to receive hospice care. In these communities, the primary      care physicians are often (and sometimes exclusively) members      of Medicare-certified ``rural health clinics.'' However, when      a hospice patient's attending physician also happens to be a      rural health clinic physician, Medicare     is not reimbursing either the physician or the clinic for the      physician's services.       Health IT rules related to implementing the Health      Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health      (HITECH) Act which I am hearing are creating uncertainty and      confusion, jeopardizing the goal of the rapid adoption of      electronic health records. Without policy changes, innovation      will be marginalized and job creation threatened.       Privacy and security regulations adopted by HHS under the      Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIP AA)      and the HITECH Act expand the accounting of disclosures      requirement to include all disclosures, even daily, routine      disclosures. While patient safety and privacy should be a      high priority, businesses are concerned that maintaining      detailed records would require an overwhelming amount of      information to be stored.       The short amount of time to comply with new ICD10 and 5010      coding requirements impose an incredible administrative      burden that I am hearing will increase administrative costs      significantly.       CMS regulations that restrict the ability of non-physician      practitioners to meeting the CMS requirement for supervision      for cardiac and pulmonary rehab. These rules are limiting      access to cardiac and pulmonary rehab, particularly in rural      and Critical Access Hospitals.       Clearly this is not a comprehensive list, but it represents      a number of areas that patients, providers and constituents      have expressed concerns on.       Again, thank you for the opportunity to share my      recommendations on what rules and regulations pose serious      negative consequences to the growth of our nation. As the      112th Congress gets under way, I will continue to identify to      your Adminitration regulations that handicap American      businesses and halt American job creation. It is my hope that      we can create a regulatory environment that provides American      businesses with the necessary tools to hire and thrive in      this global market.           Sincerely,                                                      Pat Roberts,                                                     U.S. Senator.
