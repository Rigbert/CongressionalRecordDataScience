'  One can see why the global powers took note. In fact, China lifted 55,000 of its oil workers out of Libya.  History will judge whether these resource wars and selective dictator deposals are justifiable. But the answer for America is to invest here at home and to restore America's energy independence and to extricate ourselves from all these foreign oil involvements.                                                   March 22, 2011.     President Barack Obama,     The White House, Pennsylvania Ave, NW, Washington, DC.       Dear President Obama: According to information available      from public sources, the United States participated, and      perhaps has led, military operations against the government      of Libya. Press reports indicate U.S. military engagement      began at 16:53 GMT March 19, 2011 bombing commenced on      targets including surface to air systems and other air      defense infrastructure.       It appears four days of U.S. air and naval strikes inside      Libya have destroyed strategic communications facilities, the      military intelligence headquarters, and air defense systems.      It is unclear how many lives, civilian and military, have      been lost, or saved, in these Libyan operations.       Please provide a detailed description of the coalition of      forces involved in these operations in which the U. S. has      participated, its command and decision-making structure, and      from the planning stage to execution.       Further, under which accounts of the U.S. Departments of      Defense and State are these operations being funded? What      level of funding does the United States expect to use in the      operations in Libya?       Thank you for your reply.           Sincerely,                                                     Marcy Kaptur,     Member of Congress.                                  ____                       CIA World Fact Book--Libya                  www.cia.gov (Accessed June 24, 2011)       Economy--overview:       The Libyan economy depends primarily upon revenues from the      oil sector, which contribute about 95% of export earnings,      25% of GDP, and 80% of government revenue. The weakness in      world hydrocarbon prices in 2009 reduced Libyan government      tax income and constrained economic growth. Substantial      revenues from the energy sector coupled with a small      population give Libya one of the highest per capita GDPs in      Africa, but little of this income flows down to the lower      orders of society. Libyan officials in the past five years      have made progress on economic reforms as part of a broader      campaign to reintegrate the country into the international      fold. This effort picked up steam after UN sanctions were      lifted in September 2003 and as Libya announced in December      2003 that it would abandon programs to build weapons of     mass destruction. The process of lifting US unilateral      sanctions began in the spring of 2004; all sanctions were      removed by June 2006, helping Libya attract greater foreign      direct investment, especially in the energy sector. Libyan      oil and gas licensing rounds continue to draw high      international interest; the National Oil Corporation (NOC)      set a goal of nearly doubling oil production to 3 million      bbl/day by 2012. In November 2009, the NOC announced that      that target may slip to as late as 2017. Libya faces a long      road ahead in liberalizing the socialist-oriented economy,      but initial steps--including applying for WTO membership,      reducing some subsidies, and announcing plans for      privatization--are laying the groundwork for a transition to      a more market-based economy. The non-oil manufacturing and      construction sectors, which account for more than 20% of GDP,      have expanded from processing mostly agricultural products to      include the production of petrochemicals, iron, steel, and      aluminum. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit      agricultural output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food.      Libya's primary agricultural water source remains the Great      Manmade River Project, but significant resources are being      invested in desalinization research to meet growing water      demands.                                  ____                      PROVEN RESERVES OF THE MAJOR OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES, AS OF END 2002----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              Proven reserves (billion     Percentage of world               Major producer (in rank order)                         barrels)                    total----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1.

Suncor Response, March 3, 2011            Suncor's Operations in Libya--Brief Backgrounder       Update: French translation added at 3:08 p.m. EST on March      3, 2011       Suncor's Libyan assets were acquired in the company's 2009      merger with Petro-Canada which, in turn, assumed interests in      Libya through the acquisition of the German energy company,      Veba Oil, in 2002. In 2007 and 2008, these interests were      converted to ``Exploration and Production Sharing      Agreements'' (or EPSAs).       Operations under the EPSAs include exploration in the Sirte      basin operated by Suncor and the redevelopment of other      existing Libyan oilfields, operated by a joint venture      company in which Suncor is a partner. To date, Suncor has      invested approximately $1.4 billion in its Libyan operations,      including an initial US$500 million, representing 50% of the      agreed price to buy into assets and development plans under      the EPSAs.       Suncor's working interest share of production from Libyan      operations was 34,700 barrels per day in 2010, representing      less than 6% of Suncor's total production and approximately      2% of Libya's national oil production.           Breve description des activites de Suncor en Libye       Suncor a acquis ses actifs en Libye lors de la fusion avec      Petro-Canada en 2009, qui a son tour, avait obtenu des      participations en Libye en faisant l'acquisition de la      societe energetique allemande Veba Oil en 2002. En 2007 et      2008, ces participations ont ete converties en <> (ou CEPP).       Les activites convenues en vertu des CEPP comprennent      l'exploration du bassin Syrte exploite par Suncor et la      remise en valeur d'autres champs petroliferes existants en      Libye, exploites par une coentreprise dans laquelle Suncor      est partenaire. A ce jour, Suncor a investi environ 1,4      milliard $ dans ses activites en Libye, incluant une somme      initiale de 500 millions $ US qui represente 50% du prix      convenu d'investissement dans les actifs et les plans de      developpement en vertu des CEPP.       La quote-part de la participation directe de Suncor dans      les activites en Libye etait de 34 700 barils par jour en      2010, ce qui represente moins de 6% de la production totale      de Suncor et environ 2% de la production petroliere nationale      en Libye.                                  ____                     [From IBNLive, Mar. 21, 2011]             Libya Says May Give Oil Deals to China, India       Tripoli.--Libya is considering offering oil block contracts      directly to China, India and other nations it sees as friends      in its month-long conflict with rebels, Libya's top oil      official said on Saturday.       Oil companies have pulled out staff and shut operations in      the country, formerly Africa's third-largest producer, due to      the uprising against Muammar Gaddafi's rule, leading to a      sharp reduction in output.       National Oil Corporation Chairman Shukri Ghanem, speaking      about future projects, said Libya was considering awarding      contracts directly to new partners instead of using its more      traditional open bidding process.       ``We will be looking at giving direct block contracts to      countries ready to come and work in the country, because we      want to increase production,'' he said.       He said Libya would look into the possibility of working      closer with partners such as India, China, Brazil and others      in the future but gave no details.       Ghanem said, however, that the government would honour all      existing contracts with Western firms and called on foreign      workers to return to help restore output.       ``It's not our intention to violate any of these      agreements,'' he told reporters in Tripoli.       ``Of course, as you know, production has declined      drastically because of the dramatic events,'' he added.       He said crude production had fallen to less than 400,000      barrels per day from 1.6 million before the crisis. He warned      that oil exports might halt altogether if output is not      restored.       ``We will be able to restore most fields but we need the      foreign workforce to come back . . . We call on them to send      back their workers,'' he said.       Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has taken a tougher stance on      Western oil companies. He said earlier this month that      Germany was the only Western power that had a chance of doing      business with Libyan oil in the future.                                  ____                            [Feb. 24, 2011]          China's Oil Projects, Workers, Under Attack in Libya       China rushed to evacuate thousands of workers from Libya on      Thursday, after CNPC and other Chinese firms were attacked in      the wave of unrest sweeping the country.       Officials say 30,000 Chinese are in the country and the      scramble to evacuate them--in what may be the country's      largest overseas evacuation ever--is posing a new foreign      policy dilemma for China, which has for decades supported the      Gaddafi regime.       CNPC, China's largest oil and gas producer, said on      Thursday that its facilities had been attacked and that CNPC      employees were being evacuated back to Beijing. The statement      is the first confirmation of attacks on oil companies, after      oil majors such as Eni of Italy and Repsol YPF shut down      their Libyan operations earlier this week.       The violence in Libya poses a new test for China's foreign      policy in the region, which has centred around the concept of      non-interference. That policy has become increasingly      difficult to maintain as China's commercial engagement with      Africa deepens and Chinese workers decamp by the thousands to      build infrastructure projects on the continent.       Ma Zhaoxu, Foreign Ministry spokesman, acknowledged that      some Chinese companies in Libya ``had their local camp sites      raided by gangsters and some people got hurt.''       One Chinese railway worker painted a vivid picture of those      attacks in his microblog posts on Chinese website Sina.      Raiders set fire to equipment and cars and injured Chinese      workers in an attack on his work camp on Monday, said the      blogger known as ``Happy Xufeng,'' posting pictures of the      inferno as well as desperate calls for help.       ``We are in great danger,'' he wrote on Monday night,      describing a group of more than 500 Chinese workers who      lacked basic supplies. ``Chinese companies in Libya are in a      state of emergency, our projects are being raided and      communications are down.'' By Wednesday the blogger, whose      internet records indicated he was an employee of China      Railway 11th Bureau, reported that he and his colleagues were      being evacuated to safety.       In an unusual statement on Tuesday, China's President Hu      Jintao ordered government workers to ``spare no efforts to      ensure the safety of life and properties of Chinese citizens      in Libya.'' China has dispatched charter flights, COSCO      transport ships and Chinese fishing boats to travel toward      Libya. Hired buses will also stand ready to enter Libya to      help with the evacuation if necessary, the foreign ministry      said.       There have already been signs of resentment in Libya at      China's growing economic clout in the region. At the end of      2009, Libyan Foreign Minister Musa Kusa said in an interview:      ``When we look at the reality on the ground we find that      there is something akin to a Chinese invasion of the African      continent. This is something that brings to mind the effects      that colonialism had on the African continent.''       The forced evacuation of such a large group of overseas      Chinese has exposed one of the new vulnerabilities of China's      foreign policy as its interests expand rapidly around the      globe.       There are now tens of thousands of Chinese migrants working      in potentially volatile places such as Sudan, Congo, Burma      and Pakistan. Chinese diplomats worry that high-profile cases      of kidnapping or violence towards Chinese workers overseas      could provoke nationalist reactions at home and push the      government, which prides itself on a policy of non-     intervention, to become much more involved in the domestic      political affairs of crisis-ridden countries.       To the intense discomfort of Beijing, a defiant Colonel      Muammer Gadaffi has used the example of China's violent      crackdown on protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989 to     justify his own use of military force against domestic      opponents. ``The unity of China was more important than those      people on Tiananmen Square,'' he said earlier this week.       The evacuations of oil companies have caused Libya's oil      output to fall by half, sending oil prices higher amid global      fears that unrest in the Middle East will lead to shortages.       News of the attack on CNPC will heighten concerns among oil      industry executives that the turmoil in Libya may lead to      widespread sabotage of oil facilities and that it would take      many months or even years to return the country to full      production capacity, even if a semblance of peace returns.       In a speech earlier this week, Seif al-Islam Gaddafi, the      son of Col Gaddafi, warned that in the event of a civil war,      Libya's oil wealth would be ``burned''.       Oil experts in Beijing have said that unrest across the      Middle East is likely to prompt Chinese authorities to      accelerate oil purchases in an effort to fill reserves, a      move that would put further pressure on global supplies of      crude.       ``Recent events made them very nervous and they believe the      oil price may be on an upward trend, so better to buy sooner      rather than later,'' said K F Yan, director of IHS Cera in      Bejing. ``With or without events in the Middle East, China      needs to refill the tanks after depleting supplies at the end      of 2010.''       China's trade with Libya centres mainly on oil, but the      $6.6bn in bilateral trade also includes companies in a wide      range of other businesses, thanks in part to China never      having imposed sanctions on the Gaddafi regime. Chinese rail      companies have signed lucrative railway contracts with Libya,      agreeing in 2008 to build a rail line between Tripoli and      Sirte for $1.7bn, according to reports.               China's Other Problem with Protests Abroad       Talk of a ``Jasmine Revolution'' online and a subsequent      stepping up of censorship by Beijing authorities this week      has helped thrust the Internet--microblogging in particular--     to the center of the conversation around how China's      government manages problems at home. But as the upheaval in      Libya grows increasingly violent, microblogs are also serving      to highlight a challenge China faces abroad: The presence of      tens of thousands of Chinese nationals, many of them workers      for state-owned enterprises, living in potential conflict      zones in Africa and elsewhere.       On Tuesday morning Beijing time, a person claiming to be      one of those expatriates, an employee of a Chinese company in      Libya, took to Sina Weibo, China's most active microblogging      service, to send out a plea for help.       ``Urgent situation Libya has lost control, the army has      moved suppress demonstrators, countless numbers of dead and      wounded,'' read the hastily punctuated Chinese-language      message, posted on an account with the name Happy Xu Feng.      ``Communication is completely cut off. Right now it's middle      of the night I used a satellite to leave a message, calling      on the government to send a plane to rescue us. Urgent''       It's not clear how the user was posting to Sina Weibo      despite communications being down, but several hours later,      the user posted another message saying a number of the      company's compounds had been trashed. That was followed by      photos of a construction vehicle and a building in flames      along with another urgent call for help:       ``The UK, France and South Korea are preparing to send over      planes. How come there's still no movement from our      government? A lot of Chinese brothers are embroiled in fights      with gangsters.''       It's not clear which company Happy Xu Feng is working for      and is almost impossible to confirm details of the attack      described in the posts. State media reported that ``armed      gangsters'' looted a Chinese-operated construction site in      the eastern city of Agedabia, forcing nearly a thousand      Chinese workers to abandon their living quarters. However,      that attack reportedly took place on Sunday, a day before the      attacks described by Happy Xu Feng.       The messages were forwarded thousands of times and      attracted hundreds of comments urging the government to move      quickly.       Xinhua reported Tuesday night that China's State Council      had set up a ``special headquarters'' to coordinate efforts      to evacuate Chinese nationals from Libya. The headquarters      had decided to dispatch chartered airplanes, as well as      fishing boats and cargo ships, the report said, adding that      Chinese president Hu Jintao and premier Wen Jiabao had      jointly ordered ``all-out efforts to ensure life and property      safety of Chinese nationals in Libya.'' News of Messrs. Hu      and Wen's orders, including the ``all-out'' modifier, was      repeated multiple times on CCTV's main news broadcast Tuesday      night, a sign of the sensitivity surrounding the effort.       Indeed, for Chinese leaders confronting the protests in      Libya, Egypt and elsewhere, public criticism over their      ability to protect Chinese citizens abroad is arguably as big      a concern as the possibility the unrest will somehow spread      to China. While regular Chinese people seem to have little      interest in emulating protestors in North Africa (whether      because censorship has kept them in the dark or because      they're just not that keen on revolution), they are      interested in having a government strong and competent enough      to look after them when they're overseas.       Beijing came under considerable public pressure over its      handling of the killing of Hong Kong tourists who had been      taken hostage in Manila last August. More recently, leaders      faced criticism for sending too few planes to evacuate      Chinese citizens from Cairo after protests erupted there in      late January. With Libya, too, the pressure is on.       ``I just called the number 86-10-6596114 listed on the      website of Ministry of Foreign affairs and a woman answered,      sounding as if she's just woken up,'' one user wrote in a      comment on Happy Xu Feng's Sina Weibo feed. ``As soon as the      word `Libya' left my mouth, she said `the leaders have all      gone home, we'll deal with it tomorrow.' ''       Wrote another: ``Government, the time has come to test      whether you rule for the people.''       That test is not likely to be easy. According to state      media, there are more than 30,000 Chinese living in Libya.                                  ____                    China in Africa: The Real Story                            [Feb. 22, 2011]                       (By The Associated Press)       New York.--Europe gets over 85 percent of Libya's crude      exports.

Perhaps. But, add on doing it for major Canadian investors,      reinforcing his ``principled'' foreign policy rhetoric and      reasserting western control over a region in flux, and you      pretty much have the range of reasons why a half dozen CF-     18s, four other military aircraft and naval frigate are      currently engaged in combat 10,000 km away from Canadian      soil.       Over the past few months the Conservative's plan to buy 65      F-35 Joint Strike Fighter jets has become a serious political      headache. A recent poll showed 68 per cent of Canadians--     including a majority of Conservative supporters--agreed that      ``now is not a good time'' to spend between $16 and $29      billion on these controversial single-engine jets. So,      sending Canadian military aircraft to enforce a UN ``no-fly      zone'' in Libya provides an opportunity to soften opposition      to the F-35 purchase, an issue bound to be a hot topic in the      election campaign that formally began Saturday. Most critics      of the F-35 purchase--from the NDP's Michael Byers to Project      Ploughshares Ernie Regehr to Liberal foreign affairs critic      Bob Rae--support the ``humanitarian'' mission in Libya. With      these and other liberal interventionists supporting a bombing      campaign in North Africa, Harper can more easily justify      spending nearly $1,000 per Canadian on the best fighter jets      money can buy. (Quebec housing group, FRAPRU, claims the cost      of a single F-35 equals 6,400 social housing units.)       Conveniently, the right-wing press has already begun to      connect the dots in support of the Harper government. An      Ottawa Citizen headline read, ``Libya shows why Canada needs      jets,'' while a Sun Media chain commentary explained,      ``enforcing a `no-fly' zone to shut down a dictator is an      expeditionary air operation. Is that something Canadians want      to be able to do in the future? If yes, you need an F-35,      expensive or not.''       Over the past five years, the Conservatives have further      militarized Canadian foreign policy. Military spending is at      its highest level since World War II--the Harper government      expanded Canada's role in the occupation of Afghanistan,      claimed that Russia is planning to attack and sent 2,000      troops to police Haitians after a devastating earthquake.       The Conservatives draw significant support from the      military as well as its associated companies and culture. To      get us in the fighting spirit, for instance, the Canadian      Forces released onboard video footage of a CF-18 destroying a      ground target in Libya.       But there is more to it than pleasing the Great White      North's version of the military-industrial complex. On March      21, The Financial Times reported that western oil companies      were worried that if Gaddafi defeated the rebels in the east      of Libya he would nationalize their operations out of anger      at the west's duplicity. Presumably, this includes Suncor,      Canada's second largest corporation, which signed a multi-     billion dollar 30-year oil concession with Libya in 2008.       Home to the second largest amount of Canadian investment in      Africa, instability in Libya has put a couple billion dollars      worth of this country's corporate investment in     jeopardy. Dru Oja Jay, editor of the Dominion and a candidate      for the Mountain Equipment Co-op Board of Directors, notes      ``Canadian investors are legitimately worried about what's      going to happen to the $1 billion signing bonus Suncor paid      out to the Libyan government, or whether SNC-Lavalin is going      to recoup its investments in the country, which is home to 10      per cent of its workforce.'' And these are some of this      country's most powerful corporations. Embassymagazine      includes both Suncor and SNC-Lavalin's CEOs among the nine      most influential business executives in determining Canadian      foreign policy.       Would a victorious Gaddafi have moved against Canadian      companies? Even if he didn't, with all the bad press SNC and      Suncor have received could they continue in Libya without      regime change? Finally, will the rebels dependence on the      west lead to better contract terms?       Unlike Egypt or Tunisia, the Conservatives denounced      Gaddafi's repression at the beginning of the Libyan uprising.      This is partly because Gaddafi has never been on great terms      with much of the West, even if there have been warmer      relations in recent years. Also, the Conservatives were      widely derided for supporting Egypt's Hosni Mubarak and (to a      lesser extent) Ben-Ali in Tunisia to the bitter end. So Libya      gave Harper an opportunity to re-affirm his ``principled''      foreign policy rhetoric.       Beyond wanting to appear on the side of human rights and      democracy, another element motivating the military      intervention in Libya is the desire to influence the      revolutions in bordering states Tunisia and Egypt, which are      still in flux. Controlling Libya gives the West another point      of leverage over developments in those countries. Bombing      Libya tells democratic forces in the region that the west is      prepared to use force to assert itself (as does tacit support      for the Saudi military intervention in Bahrain).       Recent developments in Libya are a reminder that if you      give the western decision-makers an interventionist inch they      take an imperial mile. In principle trying to stop Gaddafi      from massacring people in eastern Libya is a good thing. But,      the ``no-fly zone'' immediately became a license to bomb      Libyan tanks, Gaddafi's compound and other targets in      coordination with rebel attacks. On March 22, Foreign Affairs      Minister Lawrence Cannon claimed the UN resolution allowed      for ``boots on the ground.''       Beyond the inevitable death and destruction in Libya, the      security council resolution further undermines state      sovereignty, which provides the weakest states with some      protection from the most powerful. This is the main reason      why many Latin American and African countries have opposed      the intervention.       Finally, let's put the current moral outrage in      perspective. A little over two years ago Israel launched a      22-day onslaught against Gaza that left some 1,400 people,      mostly civilians, dead. There, the power imbalance between      the two sides was much greater and the aggrieved population      had been under the boot of the attacking force for as long as      Gaddafi has ruled. Yet there was no talk of imposing a no-fly      zone over Gaza. In fact, the Harper government cheered Israel      on.
