President, I thank the senior Senator from Maryland for her kind comments. We do a lot. It is interesting. In the foreign aid part, it is less than 1 percent of our budget. But what we do is show the face of America--the best of the face of America throughout the world. The distinguished Senator has been, throughout her career, both in the other body and here, a strong supporter of those programs and made life better for an awful lot of people who never know who Senator Mikulski is or Senator Leahy or anybody else. All they know is that life is better because of the things we have done.  I was in Haiti just a couple of weeks ago. I have been there several times since the earthquake. I have seen how our programs have helped, including the Leahy War Victims Fund, which helps land mine victims around the world. The Senator from Alabama knows, as he was there with me a year ago.  I saw youngsters with prosthetics learning to walk again. I saw people from other parts of the world who were inspired by what the United States was doing.  I remember a physician from Brussels who had gone to Haiti. When I asked him why he spent so much time volunteering there, We were speaking French with each other, but I remember the emotion in his voice as he grabbed my arm and said, ``pour les enfants,'' for the children. Those children are not rich. They are not powerful. They will never vote for us. But we are human beings, and we have a responsibility.  The Senator from Maryland has spoken about security at our embassies. We tell people to go to some of the most dangerous parts of the world and show the best face of America. We have a responsibility to protect them. We have tried to get that money passed only to have had it held up in the other body. Let's continue our work.  I yield the floor.
