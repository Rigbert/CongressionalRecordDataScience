You bet I did, and I will do it again. But I am going to suggest one thing on this thing. What he suggested, that means a new piece of legislation. I go back to what I have said again and again. I will say it again. We are looking at a time frame. I will admit, the Senate is not going to act, but that stock market opens Monday. If we do not have an assurance that these airlines are going to be taken care of in the sense they lost because we tell them they had to sit down, they are going down and the stock market will go down with them.  Let us talk about legislation later on, but let us think about tonight. Let us not think about 3 weeks down there, 4 weeks down there, but tonight and Monday. After Monday, we have got Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and the Senate goes back in. If they do not want to do this, fine. But let us give them some line that the House of the people is backing it up and not going to let these airlines go down. And they will go down if we do not do this.
