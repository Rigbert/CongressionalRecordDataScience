 President, I too wish to thank the Senator from Washington for raising this critically important issue. Indeed, no State has been more disadvantaged than my own by the decision to target the available emergency relief funding in this bill largely if not exclusively to the recent hurricanes. That decision was not made by the conferees on the military construction portion of the bill. Rather, it was made by the full committee leadership. As such, I am grateful to the subcommittee chairman, Senator Hutchison, for working with her own leadership and Chairman Young in gaining their assurance that these outstanding emergency relief claims will be fully funded in this year's omnibus appropriations bill.
