Chairman. In a memo which the Forest Service produced yesterday in opposition to the Furse amendment, they said the Forest Service is working to reduce overhead and increase expenditure clarity and accountability through better financial management. Well, I think they need a little pushing, because the results of that hearing were absolutely disastrous.  Basically, they are not auditable at this point in time. There is no accountability. How can we say we are going to take 25 percent of these needed K-V funds for reforestation and environmental investment and divert it arbitrarily for whatever purpose?  Twenty-five percent is high in anybody's book. But for an ongoing, existing agency which does not have to go out and rent new space, does not have to go out and buy new vehicles, does not even have to hire new employees, because for many of them it is only part of their time, 25 percent seems very high to me and an arbitrary number.
