President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it recess until the hour of 9:30 in the morning on Tuesday, September 26. I further ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then begin consideration of the H-1B visa bill as under the previous order.
