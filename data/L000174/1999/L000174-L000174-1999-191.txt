President, I would like to engage the Chairman in a colloquy. First, let me thank the Senator from Missouri for his diligence in balancing funding for the wide variety of programs within the VA-HUD Appropriations bill under very difficult budget constraints. Under these constraints, you were able to increase funding for the Environmental Programs and Management over Fiscal Year 1999. However, one very important organization in the Northeast was not funded this year. For more than a decade, this body has supported an organization called the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management or (NESCAUM) with a modest $300,000 line item. NESCAUM is a non-profit organization that provides technical assistance to the Northeast states and the nation on a host of important air quality issues. By providing recommendations for consistent regional action, NESCAUM helps both states and regulated industry avoid a costly patchwork of differing regulatory requirements. While I know that this is a very difficult year, I believe that NESCAUM provides a valuable service and is strongly supported by the Senators from our region. At a minimum, I believe the Environmental Protection Agency should be encouraged to allocate $300,000 from the Environmental Programs and Management account to NESCAUM.
