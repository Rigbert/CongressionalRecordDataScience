 President, I, Senator Chuck Grassley, intend to object to proceeding to the nomination of George Wheeler Madison to be General Counsel of the Department of the Treasury, Calendar No. 302, and to the nomination of Carmen R. Nazario to be Assistant Secretary for Family Support of the Department of Health and Human Services, Calendar No. 304, dated July 23, 2009, for the following reasons.  My support for the final confirmation of Mr. Madison rests on his continued responsiveness, and the responsiveness of the Treasury Department, to my questions. I am very concerned that the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program is not getting the cooperation Congress entitled him to from the Treasury Department and that his recommendations are not being seriously considered.  Regarding Ms. Nazario, I still have an outstanding issue regarding the release of key data on States' TANF participation rates that need to be resolved.                          ____________________
