 Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, the horror that we are dealing with is so unspeakable that it is literally very difficult to imagine the extent of what is going on, but let us try for a moment.  In at least eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa, between 20 and 35 percent of children under 15 have lost one or both parents. Let us stop and think what that would mean to our hometowns or our State. One-third of the children under 15 have already lost one or both parents.  I think after all is said and done, what we are learning tonight is that we live in one world, and whether we like it or not, we cannot ignore the horrendous suffering that is going on in Africa. Our souls will be tarnished if we do not respond, and ultimately, mark my words, it will become a national issue, as well.  We live in one world. We have got to respond. We should support this amendment, and do a lot more than that.
