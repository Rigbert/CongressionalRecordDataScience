President, I rise today to pay tribute to a man for whom I have great respect: Dr. Gene Simon.  Tomorrow, June 30, Dr. Simon will retire after 31 years of exceptional service as chief executive officer of Chaddock, a nationally acclaimed, faith-based, child welfare agency in Quincy, IL.  In the New Testament, James, the disciple of Jesus, tells us, ``Suppose a brother or sister is without clothes and daily food. If one of you says to him, `Go, I wish you well; keep warm and well fed,' but does nothing about his physical needs, what good is it? In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead.''  Gene Simon has taken that Bible lesson to heart his whole life. He has taken action. For more than 30 years, he has provided a home and food and clothing for children who might otherwise have had nowhere to turn.  Chaddock serves more than 6,500 people a year--children and families. Many of the young people Chaddock helps are at-risk. Some have endured serious abuse or neglect. Chaddock provides outpatient and residential treatment and the help young people and their families need to heal.  Chaddock was founded in 1853 as a college. Over the years, it has been a boys school and a treatment center for at-risk young people. It opened its doors to girls in 1982.  Chaddock is proud of its history, but it is not bound by that history.  One of the hallmarks of Gene Simon's leadership is his commitment to continual learning and innovation. You can see that at Chaddock.  Chaddock's school and treatment programs are national models for dealing with changing emotional and behavioral needs of children and their families. Chaddock offers a residential treatment program for adolescents with severe trauma and attachment disorders--one of only a handful of such centers in America.  Chaddock also has an outstanding program that works with families who have adopted children, helping the children and their new families to develop strong, loving bonds. I understand that this program has helped families from more than 20 States.  In recent years, Chaddock has risen to meet another critical need: helping children and adolescents move from foster care to adoption.  Gene Simon was born and raised on a family farm in Farmersville, IL. His parents, Eldon and Beryl Simon, owned a grain and livestock farm.  Dr. Simon holds a bachelor of science degree in agriculture from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, a master's degree in human development counseling from the University of Illinois-Springfield, a master's of divinity degree from Garrett Evangelical Theological Seminary at Northwestern University in Evanston, IL, and a doctoral degree from Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, FL.  From 1959-1971, he served as a United Methodist minister in the Illinois communities of Iroquois, Pontiac, Moweaqua, and Decatur.  With the importance Gene Simon places on family, it should come as no surprise that he is deeply committed to his own family, including his wife Peggy, who has been a constant partner in his work at Chaddock. Gene and Peggy Simon take great pride in their two sons, Chris and Paul, and four grandchildren.  The outstanding work of Gene Simon and the Chaddock staff has brought the agency much praise and many awards.  In 2001, the United Methodist Association of Health and Welfare Ministries honored Dr. Simon as one of the association's Administrators of the Year. And this year, the United Methodist Association named Chaddock its Organization of the Year--so Dr. Simon is going out on a high note.  But the testimonials that mean the most to Gene Simon are not from professional committees; they are from the young men and women who have found new hope at Chaddock.  I would like to close with a quote from one of those testimonials--from a former student of Chaddock. ``Gene Simon and this Chaddock family were here for me when I needed them most. The lessons I learned at Chaddock, such as dealing with emotions and just the everyday needs for love, care, and concern for myself and others, have helped me to become me . . . a good husband, father, employee, and a great friend to many.''  Imagine thousands of similar testimonials and you begin to see the tremendous amount of good he has done and the positive difference he has made in the lives of so many young people and families who have walked through the doors at Chaddock over the years.  On a personal note, Gene has been a source of friendship and inspiration to me for many years. He has helped me understand the reality of the human condition and he has reminded me never to give up on a person in need.  I wish Gene Simon well in his retirement, and I know that the difference his life has made will continue to be felt by the many people he has helped                          ____________________[Pages S6772-S6773]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       TRIBUTE TO DR.
