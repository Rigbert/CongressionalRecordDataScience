 President, I rise today to comment on the recent decision of the Justice Department regarding a qui tam lawsuit filed under the false claims act against Energy Secretary-designate Federico Pena. Now, as a Senator I will not comment on the merits of an on-going court case. However, I do believe that it is appropriate to comment on what may be considered an unusual circumstance.  As many of my colleagues may know, when someone files a qui tam lawsuit, the Department of Justice has to make a decision as to whether to intervene in the case or to decline to intervene in the case. Now, this time period is generally from 6 months to 1 year because qui tam lawsuits can be so complex.  With regard to the Pena case, the Justice Department has had the lawsuit for about 1 month and they have already made a decision--to ask the court to dismiss Secretary Pena from the lawsuit. Now, I realize that Secretary Pena is a cabinet nominee and a former Cabinet Member and this case might warrant expedited consideration. But this seems like a rush to judgment. It seems unwise and it raises questions in my mind as to whether the Justice Department's decision in this case is due more to political pressure than to a genuine desire to protect taxpayer dollars.  There are several troubling questions which remain regarding the role of the Department of Transportation, Secretary Pena and other top Transportation Department officials in seeking the reinstatement of a Government contract with the D.M.E. Corp. which the Coast Guard had terminated in March 1994. According to documents supplied to me by the Coast Guard, the D.M.E. Corp. was simply unable to satisfy the contract. Also, according to a memo prepared by the legal adviser to the Coast Guard, a financial audit revealed such serious irregularities that the FBI recommended that D.M.E. be prosecuted for fraud. Did Department of Transportation officials know of the FBI's recommendation when they pressured the Coast Guard to sign a memorandum of understanding committing the Coast Guard to reinstate the D.M.E. contract?  As it happens, Ms. Lus Hopewell, who was Mr. Pena's top aid for the affirmative action programs for the Transportation Department had been the executive director of the Latin American Management Association immediately prior to working for the Transportation Department. Mr. Luis Mola who was the president of D.M.E.--the company whose contract was terminated--sat on the board of directors for the Latin American Management Association. Should Ms. Hopewell have recused herself? Did she disclose to her superiors that she had in effect worked for Mola only months before at her previous job as she was working to get D.M.E. reinstated?  So far, as I understand it, Secretary Pena's defense has been that Coast Guard officials somehow got the mistaken impression that he had met with D.M.E. officials and was involved in reinstating the contract. So, in essence the revealing documents which I have received, which were created contemporaneously and by people with no apparent motive to lie, are mistaken. This explanation is almost identical to a an explanation supplied by SecretaryPena when he was the mayor of Denver. According to a March 26, 1995 article in the Denver Post newspaper, Alvarado Construction Co. received a $13 million contract to build an administration at the new Denver airport. Alvarado got the bid, however, even though its first bid was disqualified. In order to ensure that Alvarado got the bid, someone voided the first round of bidding for the contract and set up a new round of bidding. Alvarado got the contract on the second round. According to George Doughty, who was the Aviation Director at the time, Pena made the ultimate decision to void the first round of bidding. Secretary Pena said he wasn't involved and he didn't even know that Alvarado had received the bid. Finally, Alvarado was a strong financial backer of Secretary Pena when he was the mayor of Denver as well as a member of the Latin American Management Association. I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Denver Post, Mar. 26, 1995]                     Mr. Pena and a Pair of Probes                            (By Gil Spencer)       At the top of the Sunday, March 12, front page was this      Denver Post headline: ``Probe Zeros in on Pena.''       At the top of the Friday front page just six days later,      was this Denver Post headline: ``Pena Inquiry Dropped.''       With Commerce Secretary Ron Brown under investigation, with      former Agricultural Secretary Mike Espy under investigation,      with Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros under investigation,      and with the president himself under investigation for      financial dealings while he was governor of Arkansas, it is      worth more than a mere mention that Transportation Secretary      Federico Pena has been cleared by Attorney General Janet      Reno, who is not under investigation.       I last talked to Federico Pena almost exactly three years      ago. The topic was his integrity, which, if pushed, he might      liken to a cross between the Hope Diamond and the Holy Grail.      He thinks very highly of his integrity, and not very highly      of anyone who might question it, which he said The Denver      Post did.       Keeping Mr. Pena's opinion of his integrity in mind,      imagine his reaction when some blabber-mouths in Los Angeles      started making noises about Pena's former investment firm,      which he founded after he left the mayor's office and which      he sold in 1992, still bearing his name. The firm, Pena      Investment Advisors, was awarded a rather succulent contract      to manage a $5 million Los Angeles transit pension fund.       Pena Investment Advisors got the transit contract less than      three weeks after its namesake became transportation      secretary. The timing of the contract award and the      investment firm's pedigree intrigued certain parties in Los      Angeles and inspired an intriguing comment by the manager of      the transit pension fund, one Melvin Marquardt.       Marquardt, a candid soul, was quoted as saying the      investment firm would not have been retained if President      Clinton hadn't made Pena secretary of transportation.       Enter Janet Reno. Investigation opens. Investigation      closes. Federico and his integrity ride on.       That seems about right. There may possibly have been a      case. If so, it was hardly visible to the naked eye. In the      other words, the only thing on the table was timing: Pena      gets a big job and his old firm gets a big contract. If the      firm had been a hopeless loser, Ms. Reno's alarm would have      gone off. It would have had to. As it was, the firm seemed      qualified and, of course, richer. Life in big-time politics.       Incidentially, in dismissing the contract allegation, Janet      Reno also closed down a Justice Department investigation into      whether the city--both Pena and Webb--was illegally diverting      revenue from Stapleton and using it for non-airport services.       Pena's own department is continuing to investigate that      charge, for what it may or may not be worth. And because I      know you're absolutely on the edge of your chair, we'll keep      you advised.       So Federico Pena is in the clear and has issued a statement      that he is pleased but not surprised, adding that his focus      has been and remains on serving the president and the      American people.       In that spirit, he might turn back the calendar to May      1991. He was mayor Denver and the Alvarado Construction Co.      had been awarded a $13 million contract to build the      administration building at the new airport. That contract      drew political fire 10 months later, when it was learned that      Alvarado's first-round low bid had been defective and thus      was disqualified.       Standard procedure would have had the contract awarded to      the second low bidder, which in this case appeared fully      qualified. Didn't happen. The city rejected all bids, saying      it did so in the city's best interest, and Alvarado wound up      with the contract.       Alvarado got the contract on the second bounce. Mayor Pena      said he didn't even know Alvarado had the contract. Aviation      Director George Doughty said it was Pena's ultimate decision.      Pena said somebody must have had the impression that he made      a decision he didn't make.       There's a fat lie in there somewhere.       Pena said he didn't know Alvarado had a $13 million city      contract? Pena's world was alive with Alvarados--enjoying his      support before the city council, contributing to his '87      campaign and his post-mayorial investment firm (Linda      Alvarado became a director of that firm in 1993). He didn't      know?       It's been three years since Pena damned The Denver Post for      questioning his integrity in connection with the Alvarado      contract--three years since the issue was buried whole. This      isn't the first time I have written about the issue and it      isn't the second. There may be a fourth. That contract has a      certain fragrance. Then there was the lying. But maybe we're      got it all wrong. Care to straighten us out, Mr. Secretary?
