President, I will defer to the chairman and ranking member as the sequence of amendments are considered on the bill. My amendment, I assume, is currently pending, but I understand if there is a different sequence both of these Senators would seek.  I thank the Chair.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kennedy). The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.
