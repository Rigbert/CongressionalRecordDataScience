 President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:45 p.m. today the Senate proceed to executive session for the consideration of Calendar No. 685; that the Senate vote on the nomination without intervening action or debate; that, if confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session without any intervening action or debate.
