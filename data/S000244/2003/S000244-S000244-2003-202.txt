Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, my friend, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt), seems to have forgotten that the civil rights laws that were passed in the 1960s were passed with Republican support because his predecessors in North Carolina would not support civil rights laws, no way, no how. Those laws took away from the States the right to ensure equal treatment of all American citizens. I am proud my party, the party of Lincoln, led the charge on that.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Moran).
