Those who would argue that gun control legislation and Capitol Hill want to take your gun away, that is not the case at all. What it is all about here is to say if you want to purchase a gun in America, whether it is from a licensed dealer, a pawnshop, or a gun show, we want to know a little about you. Are you a stable person? Do youhave a criminal record? If the answer is yes to either of those, if you are unstable, or you have a criminal record, then we will deny you the right to own a gun. Who can argue with that? A person who may in a weak moment do something to hurt an innocent person shouldn't be given advantage or given an opportunity by the purchase of a firearm.  We passed that when Vice President Gore came to the floor and cast a deciding vote just a few weeks after Columbine. And that issue died over in the U.S. House of Representatives when the gun lobby came through and said that is an outrageous suggestion--that you would keep guns out of the hands of kids and criminals.  I think American families see this a lot differently. I am hoping that when Members of the Senate who voted with the gun lobby go home, they will hear the other side of the story.
