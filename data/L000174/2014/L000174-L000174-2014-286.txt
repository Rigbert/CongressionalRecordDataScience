I stand behind nobody in my support of law enforcement. I was picked as one of the three outstanding prosecutors in this country when I was a prosecutor. But I believed throughout all that time that everybody who was prosecuted deserved the best of representation.  Despite Debo's expertise, some are opposing his nomination based on a single case: Mumia Abu-Jamal's appeal of his death sentence for the 1981 murder of Officer Daniel Faulkner. I condemn that murder. I condemn the murderer for it. But, just as the British in the Boston Massacre deserved representation, and got it from John Adams; just as the man who murdered a number of people, including a couple of teenagers, deserved representation from John Roberts, a Republican who is now Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court; so, too, did Mumia Abu-Jamal deserve legal representation.
