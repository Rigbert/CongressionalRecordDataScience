Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to take from the Speaker's table the bill (H.R. 3) to authorize funds for Federal-aid highways, highway safety programs, and transit programs, and for other purposes, with a Senate amendment thereto, disagree to the Senate amendment, and request a conference with the Senate thereon.  Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from Alaska?  There was no objection.               Motion to Instruct Offered by Mr. Oberstar
