Speaker, I rise in support of this bill which will move the Federal Government out of planting decisions while providing some support during the shift to a market driven agricultural economy. However, I must express my strong opposition to language inserted in the bill during the conference which will severely impact our ability to move to a modern science-based meat and poultry inspection system.  Section 918 of this bill establishes a permanent advisory committee to evaluate and review meat and poultry inspection programs. This proposal is similar in effect to the proposal made last summer in the Appropriations Committee to slow meat and poultry inspection reform by forcing USDA to undertake negotiated rulemaking at a late point in the regulatory process.  Section 918 was never subject to public hearings and was not included in the Senate or House passed bills.  This advisory committee would review every decision made by the Food Safety Inspection Service, including inspection procedures, labor relations, employee work rules, food safety practices in meat and poultry plants and approval of new technologies. This could delay the implementation of the new Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points [HACCP] inspection system, a science-based system endorsed by both industry and consumers.  Further, this panel will be able to meet in secret and conduct its deliberations outside of public scrutiny because it is specifically exempt from the requirements of Federal Advisory Committee Act.  Mr. Speaker, last year there were five million foodborne illnesses and 4,000 deaths in our Nation. Section 918 has no place in this bill and we should take no actions which will decrease public confidence in the healthfulness and safety of our meat and poultry products. Have we learned nothing from the recent British experience?
