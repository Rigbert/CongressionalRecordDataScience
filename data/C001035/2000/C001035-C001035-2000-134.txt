President, today I am pleased to join my friend from Wisconsin, Senator Feingold, in introducing the Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act of 2000, which is intended to improve access to automated external defibrillators in small communities to boost the survival rates of individuals who suffer cardiac arrest.  We are very pleased to be joined in introducing this legislation by the following cosponsors: Senators Murray, Abraham, Wellstone, Hutchinson, Dorgan, Grams, Bingaman, Chafee and Enzi.  Heart disease is the leading cause of death both in the State of Maine and nationwide. According to the American Heart Association, an estimated 250,000 Americans die each year from cardiac arrest. Many of these deaths could be prevented if AEDs were more accessible. AEDs are computerized devices that can shock a heart back into the normal rhythm and restore life to a cardiac arrest victim. They must, however, be used promptly. For every minute that passes before a victim's normal heart rhythm is restored, his or her chance of survival falls by as much as 10 percent.  We have a number of new and improved technologies in our arsenal of weapons to fight heart disease, including a new generation of small, easy-to-use AEDs that can strengthen the chances of survival. These new devices make it possible not only for emergency medical personnel, but also trained lay rescuers, to deliver defibrillation safely and effectively. The new AEDs are safe, effective, lightweight, low maintenance, and relatively inexpensive. Moreover, they are specifically designed so they can be used by nonmedical personnel, such as police, firefighters, security guards, and other lay rescuers, providing they have been trained properly.  According to the American Heart Association, making AEDs standard equipment in police cars, firetrucks--as I know the Presiding Officer has done in his hometown--ambulances, and other emergency vehicles, and getting these devices into more public places could save more than 50,000 lives a year.  Last December, the Bangor Mall installed an AED that is one of the first of these devices in Maine to be placed in a public setting outside the direct control of emergency medical personnel and hospital staff. Both the AED and an oxygen tank are kept inside a customer service booth, which is in an area of the mall where there is a high concentration of traffic and where heart emergencies might occur. Mall personnel have also received special training and, during mall hours, there is always at least one person who has been certified in both CPR and defibrillator use.  For at least one Bangor woman, this has been a lifesaver. On January 12th, just weeks after the AED was installed, two shoppers at the Mall collapsed in a single day. One was given oxygen and quickly revived. But the other shopper was unconscious and had stopped breathing. The trained mall staff--Maintenance Supervisor Larry Lee, Security Chief Dusty Rhodes, and General Manager Roy Daigle--were only able to detect a faint pulse. They quickly commenced CPR and attached the AED.  It is important to note that defibrillation is intended to supplement, not replace standard CPR. These devices, which are almost completely automated, run frequent self-diagnostics and will not allow the administration of shock unless the victim's recorded heart pattern requires it. When the AED is attached, it automatically analyzes the victim's vital signs. One of two commands will then be voiced and displayed by the unit: ``Shock advised--charging''; or ``Shock not advised--continue CPR.''  In the Bangor Mall case, the shock was not advised, so CPR was continued until the emergency medical personnel arrived. The EMT's told Mr. Daigle, the General Manager of the mall, that the woman--who had had a heart attack and subsequently required triple by-pass surgery--simply would not have survived if they had not been so prepared. As Mr. Daigle observed, ``Twelve to fifteen minutes is just too long to wait for the emergency services to arrive.''  Cities across America have begun to recognize the value of fast access to AEDs and are making them available to emergency responders. In many small and rural communities, however, limited budgets and the fact that so many rely on volunteer organizations for emergency services can make acquisition and appropriate training in the use of these life-saving devices problematic.  The legislation that Senator Feingold and I are introducing today is intended to increase access to AEDs and trained local responders for smaller towns and rural areas in Maine and elsewhere where those first on the scene may not be paramedics or others who would normally have AEDs. Our bill provides $25 million over three years, to be given as grants to community partnerships consisting of local emergency responders, police and fire departments, hospitals, and other community organizations. This money could then be used to help purchase AEDs and train potential responders in their use, as well as in basic CPR and first aid.  I commend the leadership of the Senator from Wisconsin for coming forth with this idea. I am very pleased to join him in introducing this important legislation.  The Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act has been endorsed by both the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross as a means of expanding access to these lifesaving devices across rural America. I urge all of our colleagues to join us as cosponsors of the bill.  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from both the American Heart Association and their Maine affiliate be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   American Heart Association,                                         Augusta, ME, May 3, 2000.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The State Advocacy Committee of the      American Heart Association in Maine commends you for your      leadership in sponsoring the ``Rural Access to Emergency      Devices (AED) Act.'' As volunteer advocates for the American      Heart Association, we are pleased that you have recognized      that the placement of AEDs with trained, local, first      responders, such as fire and rescue departments, paramedics,      police departments and community hospitals in rural areas      will make a difference in a person's chances of surviving a      sudden cardiac arrest. We are also proud that this bill is      being sponsored by a Maine Senator.       Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the state of      Maine, as well as the nation. Early defibrillation is the      only known therapy for most cardiac arrests. Each minute of     delay in returning the heart to its normal pattern of beating      decreases the chance of survival by 7% to 10%. As you well      know, Maine's population is dispersed over a large      geographical, mostly rural, area. The Emergency Medical      Services in our state are excellent, but travel times within      rural communities can occasionally be too long to benefit the      patient in cardiac arrest. The availability of AEDs and      trained local responders should improve the chain of survival      for these victims of sudden cardiac arrest. The American      Heart Association estimates that the sudden cardiac arrest      survival rate can improve from only 5% to 20% when AEDs and      trained rescuers are readily available within communities.       Thank you, Senator Collins, on behalf of the residents of      Maine and our fellow citizens in other rural states.           Sincerely yours,                                           Gayle Russell, RN, BSN,     Chair, Maine State Advocacy Committee.                                  ____                                   American Heart Association,                                   Washington, DC, April 27, 2000.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Hon. Russell Feingold,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Feingold: The American Heart      Association applauds your commitment to saving lives and      thanks you for your introduction of the ``Rural Access to      Emergency Devices (AED) Act.'' The legislation will help      improve cardiac arrest survival rates across rural America.       As you know, heart disease is the leading cause of death in      this country. Cardiac arrest, whereby the electrical rhythms      of the heart malfunction, causes the sudden death of more      than 250,000 people every year. We are fighting this killer      with improved technology, including automated external      defibrillators (AEDs). These small, easy-to-use devices can      shock a heart back into normal rhythm and restore life to a      cardiac arrest victim. But, they must be used promptly. We      have to act quickly because for every minute that passes      before a victim's normal heart rhythm is restored, his or her      chance of survival falls by as much as 10 percent.       Cities across America have begun to recognize the value of      fast access to these devices and are making them available to      emergency responders. The Rural AED Act recognizes that we      cannot and should not leave rural communities behind in this      fight to improve survival. Because the first emergency      responders on the scene of a cardiac arrest may not always be      the medical responders, the Rural AED Act makes resources      available to rural communities to purchase AEDs for police      and fire as well as emergency responder vehicles. In      addition, it provides resources to train these responders in      the use of the devices. The bill provides $25 million for      this effort to expand access to devices that can save lives      across rural America.       The American Heart Association thanks you for your      leadership in the fight against heart disease and looks      forward to working with you to ensure the passage of this      important legislation.           Sincerely,                                       Lynn A. Smaha, M.D., Ph.D.,                                                        President.
