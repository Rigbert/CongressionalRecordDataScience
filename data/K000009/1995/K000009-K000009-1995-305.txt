Speaker, I just wanted to mention to the gentleman I was in a meeting this morning with our Secretary of the Treasury, and I very pointedly asked him why we should approve this, why should Congress just go along with the administration and its supporters on both sides of the aisle up here, and he said, ``Well, you know, back in 1982 Mexico had financial problems, and they owed 12 commercial banks, and America had to try to help back then.'' Yes, Mexico had debt then, they have debt now.  And I said, ``Of course, who do they owe the money to now? Where is the specific list of the investment banks on Wall Street that took a gamble in Mexico and now had their tail caught in the wringer?'' I said, ``Could you provide us with that list? What about the big megabanks all over the world that have invested in Mexico and are making huge profits by the way?'' This is a good time to be in the banking industry because the profits are so huge. ``What about some of these corporations like Mattel Corp. that have their hand out to the Government of Mexico through our taxpayers?''  [[Page H321]] And he said, ``Of course you know it's different now because so much of the investment came through mutual funds.''  And I asked him a very pointed question. I said, ``Are mutual funds insured deposits where we have the kind of promise that we have made to our own depositors?''  He could not answer ``yes'' obviously. They are uninsured speculative investments.  So, what responsibility do we have to take the people's money to bail them out?
