Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, the distinguished chairman of the committee has made the point on a number of occasions that the Labor-Health bill is held up because of a filibuster. But he never says why, the reason being, because the Republicans have put a provision on the Labor-Health bill that will make it easy to fire people, easy to get rid of people, easy to get them out of jobs. Is it not ironic that the CR that you will not allow us to pass does exactly the same thing, keeping people out of jobs? That is why the Labor-Health bill has not passed.
