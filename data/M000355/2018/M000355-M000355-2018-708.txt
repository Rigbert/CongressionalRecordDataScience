 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 618, introduced earlier today.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Young). The clerk will report the resolution by title.  The senior assistant legislative clerk read as follows:       A resolution (S. Res. 618) commemorating the 50th      anniversary of the commissioning of the USS John F. Kennedy.  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to the bill.  Mr. McCONNELL. I further ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
