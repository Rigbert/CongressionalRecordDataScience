Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time, and I rise in strong support of her amendment.  Mr. Chairman, as I sat here to think about what could one say in 90 seconds, it occurs to me that each and every one of my colleagues ought to consider this. None of us, not one of us in this body wants to take ownership of every policy adopted by the D.C. City Council and its mayor, not one of us. It is theirs to take, theirs to do.  But I suggest to my colleagues, to the extent that we include provision 1, 2, 3, and 4 and leave out 5, 6, and 7, one could clearly argue, well, apparently one is against 1 through 5, but one must be for 6, 7 and 8. That is not the case. It is not the case. I am not responsible for what the D.C. City Council does, the D.C. City Council is, and the voters of the District of Columbia are, any more than the D.C. Council is responsible for what I do on this floor.  This is called a democracy amendment, because, in a democracy, we believe that the people can be wrong. The people can disagree. The people do not all need to be overseen by Big Brother. It seems to me that is a conservative concept. It seems to me that is something that people who want smaller government adopt as a premise, that Big Brother ought not to be overseeing the District of Columbia. Vote for this democracy amendment.
