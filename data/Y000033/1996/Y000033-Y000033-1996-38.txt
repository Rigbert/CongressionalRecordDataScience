Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Saxton], is right. He has brought this to my attention. The definition in no way denies the recreational fishermen the pleasure of eating their catch, as long as the fish was caught during the appropriate season and met any State or Federal regulations, including size restriction, and other appropriate landing laws.  My staff has contacted the National Marine Fisheries Service and their interpretation is the same as mine and the same as the gentleman's, that this definition does not preclude the recreational fisherman from consuming his or her catch if it meets the appropriate State and Federal rules.
