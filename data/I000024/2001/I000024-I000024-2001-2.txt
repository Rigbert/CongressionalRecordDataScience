President, I say to Senator Stevens that I appreciate all his hard work on the Defense appropriations bill. I would like to discuss pending actions on the Crusader Program. Crusader is a critical transformation system, which is already a generation ahead of the existing Paladin system. When fielded, Crusader will have unparalleled rate of fire, range of fire and lethality unmatched by any system in the world. We must continue to fund this program in its entirety. To do this we must put $80,972,000 into the Defense appropriations bill. Again, I thank the Senate and the committee for their hard work.
