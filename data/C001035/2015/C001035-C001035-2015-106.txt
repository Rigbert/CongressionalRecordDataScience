President, this August the Senate unanimously passed a resolution designating September 25, 2015, as National Lobster Day. I was proud to cosponsor that resolution with my fellow Mainer, Senator Angus King, and to be joined by our New England colleagues, Senators Shaheen andAyotte of New Hampshire, Reed and Whitehouse of Rhode Island, and Murphy and Blumenthal of Connecticut.  That day has arrived and will be celebrated with a special event at the Maine Maritime Museum in the City of Bath. For more than a half-century, this outstanding museum has honored our State's seafaring heritage and the important role Maine plays today in global maritime activities.  Lobster fishing is central to that heritage. Since colonial times, it has served as an economic engine and a family tradition in New England, helping to support the livelihoods of thousands of families. Throughout the region, more than 120 million pounds of lobster are caught each year, making it one of our most valuable commodities.  More than 70 percent of this harvest is hauled in by Maine's 6,000 commercial license holders. Lobster is the backbone of Maine's prolific fishing industry, which produces more than $1 billion in economic activity and supports 26,000 year-round jobs in such affiliated enterprises as boatbuilding and maintenance, trap-making, bait, fuel and other supplies. The Maine lobster industry is built upon thousands of owner-operated family businesses, where the generations work together, supporting themselves and sustaining their communities.  The hard-working men and women of the Maine lobster industry are the original conservationists. For more than 150 years, they have led the way in managing this precious resource through size restrictions and trap limits, and they are at the forefront of efforts to protect whales and other marine mammals. The economic activity they generate helps to preserve the working waterfronts that are essential to coastal communities.  The lobster industry represents the very essence of Maine--a deep respect for the environment and a dedication to hard work. I congratulate the men and women of the Maine lobster industry for upholding this centuries-old heritage and thank the Maine Maritime Museum for celebrating it.                          ____________________
