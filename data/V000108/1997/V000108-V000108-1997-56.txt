Speaker, it is my great pleasure to congratulate the Hammond Technical Vocation Appreciation Society as it holds its first annual ``Thanks for the Memories'' Recognition Dinner tonight, September 26, 1997, at the After Four Supper Club in Cedar Lake, IN. I would also like to take this opportunity to commend the Society's board of directors, Stan Bafia, Dave Carlson, Chester Lobodzinski, Tom Martin, and Marvin Snorton, for the work they have put forth in planning this special event.  The Hammond Technical Vocation Society was founded in November 1996, for the primary purpose of paying overdue recognition to past faculty members of Hammond Technical Vocation High School, Hammond Tech. Tonight's dinner will be in recognition of four outstanding former educators and coaches of Hammond Tech High School, who have displayed the utmost in pride and dedication throughout their careers. Special recognition will be given to this year's selected honoree, retired educator and coach, George Bereolos. Former coaches, Dale Vieau, the late Swede Carlson, and the late Richard Milton Wilson, will also be honored on this occasion. Hammond Tech will forever be remembered for its 1940 State Championship Basketball Team, whose three remaining members, Bob Haack, Richard Haack, and John Thomas, will be recognized at the dinner tonight.  An educator and coach for 42 years in the Hammond School System, George Bereolos' accomplishments in the classroom and on the court are shining examples of the pride and dedication he exhibited in his work. A 1934 graduate of Hammond High School, George earned a degree in education from Indiana University after his service with the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant during World War II. In addition to teaching social studies, George assumed the added responsibility of head basketball coach in 1954. George's coaching career also included positions with the track and football teams. George currently resides in Munster, IN.  Dale Vieau, Swede Carlson, and Richard Milton Wilson were very devoted teachers and coaches at Hammond Tech, as well. Dale Vieau, a 1944 graduate of Hammond Tech, coached for his alma mater for approximately 32 years, and within the Hammond School System for 38 years. Dale served as coach of the basketball, baseball, and cross country teams. Swede Carlson, a 1938 graduate of Ball State University, was a history and social studies teacher for Hammond Tech. Before his retirement in 1979, he worked with the golf and football teams during his 34-year coaching career. Upon earning his teaching degree from State Normal School, now the University of Wisconsin, Richard Milton Wilson began Hammond Tech's physical education and athletic programs. In the early years of the program, Richard coached every sport with one assistant. An excellent athlete, Richard played football with the Green Bay Packers from 1919 to 1921. In the early 1980's, he was inducted into the Green Bay Packer Hall of Fame. Although Swede Carlson and Richard Milton Wilson have both passed away, memories of their spirit and love for teaching will always remain.  Hammond Tech was founded in 1919, when Fred S. Barrows began a vocational high school in the attic of Central High School on Russell Street in downtown Hammond, IN. In the first year of the school's existence, there was only one teacher and one student. However, only 3 years later, Hammond Tech students filled the halls of the Central High School building when a new Central High School was built on Calumet Avenue. Hammond Tech remained at this location until the summer of 1949, when a new Hammond Tech High School was built on Sohl Avenue. Although the State of Indiana closed Hammond Tech in 1980, the school will always be held in high esteem for the strong dedication and concern of its faculty, as well as the academic and athletic accomplishments of its student body. Today, Hammond Tech still holds the record for the highest high school graduation rate in the nation, at 98.6 percent.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the Hammond Technical Vocation Appreciation Society and this year's faculty honorees for their lifetime of dedication to their school and its students. I commend all of those who have played a role in successfully keeping the memory of Hammond Tech alive over the years, as the pride and spirit of its faculty and former students serves as an inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
