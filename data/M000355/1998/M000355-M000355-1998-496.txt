 He has very skillfully presented the analogy. The wallet story, I think, is a very, very important addition to the debate and really says a lot about what this is all about. In fact, as the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, if you are going to have much of an impact on the political dialog in a country of 270 million people, you have to be able to amplify your voice, you have to be able to project your voice to large numbers of citizens or your voice isn't very much.  Of course, as the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out, Dan Rather, Tom Brokaw and the rest certainly have more speech than we do. Nobody is suggesting that we rein them in. But there are many of us who think their speech is not very helpful, occasionally, to the political process. So I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for a very important speech.
