Speaker, let me also add my congratulations and thanks to Keith Jewell, who has served as chief in our Office of Photography for so many years, for his distinguished service, for his courtesy, for his good humor, for all the years that he has served here, and we wish him very well in his future endeavors. We hope he will stop back many times to see us.  Mr. Speaker, today I would like to call upon the Clinton administration to convene a very high level working group, reporting directly to the President, to address the ever more serious and growing illicit drug trafficking problem facing us from Mexico, Central America, and South America.  This drug scourge is truly crippling our Nation: every one of our neighborhoods, every town, every city, 80 percent of the crime in this country, the burglaries, the robberies, murder, 80 percent of the people in our prisons and our local jails, all related to the drug problem.  Recently, three penetrating articles appeared in publications across the country that detailed the magnitude of this assault on civilized society. One of them appeared in the Nation magazine on July 10, 1995, written by Andrew Reding, entitled ``The Web of Corruption: Narco-politics in Mexico.''  He talks about the problem not just being a Mexican problem, of course, but a problem for our country as well. He then points out that integration of our continent's economies, formalized by the North American Free Trade Agreement, is increasingly binding our fates. He talks about the importance of a populous, unstable Mexico corrupted by narco-dollars threatening to subvert prospects for regional economic expansion. He adds that economic integration requires a common political currency, starting with democratic accountability and a rule of law.  Then this past Sunday, in the New York Times, on July 31 and then yesterday, Monday, there were two superb articles summarizing the Mexican connection growing as the chief cocaine supplier to our country. In the article on Sunday and yesterday, the authors expressed a concern that the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA], got caught up in collusion by our Government with the Government of Mexico to not deal with the growing drug problems in order not to jeopardize the passage of that treaty.  The article says that both the Clinton and Bush   administrations kept the problems of drugs and corruption from jeopardizing the trade accord and the new economic partnership that it symbolized. A senior official for international drug policy in our government was quoted in the article as saying, ``People desperately wanted drugs not to become a complicating factor for NAFTA and there was a degree of illicit activity that was just accepted.''  ``What a shame for us as a country,'' the article states. It talks about a community just south of our border in Ciudada Juarez, Mexico, where the bodies of police informants, people who want to try to help, turn up around this sprawling border city, their mouths sometimes stuffed with one of the fingers that they might have pointed at drug traffickers. if you try to be an honest citizen, if you try to help, you can be sure that you will be shot for your desire to try to deal with this critical issue.  As Mexico's political and economic ties to the United States have strengthened, American demand for illegal drugs has helped a new generation of Mexican traffickers to consolidate their power, carving out an ever-larger share of the world's drug trade and posing a growing threat on both sides of the border.  If we do not do something both in the southern United States and in Mexico, Mexico will take over from Colombia in a few years as the traffickers' headquarters of choice, undermining democracy, undermining commercial development and, in fact, undermining the very free trade agreement that was supposed to be helped out by wiping out this drug trafficking.                              {time}  1845  American officials, who once trumpeted Mexican cooperation in fighting drugs, now worry that the Government of Mexico has lost control of most of its police. When the authorities located a leading cocaine trafficker last month after his rented Learjet crashed as he flew to a wedding in Guadalajara, they needed army troops to capture him. The city's federal police commander and most of his deputies were on the trafficker's payroll, and while America's officials lavishly praised Mexico's cooperation in fighting drugs under the prior President, Mr. Salinas, growing evidence indicates that protection for the traffickers reached high into his administration.  I urge the American people, I urge President Clinton, to read these articles I am going to put into the Record. Let us get serious. Let us deal with a real war on drugs in this country. It is ripping our Nation apart.  (The articles referred to are as follows:)               [From the Nation magazine, July 10, 1995]              Web of Corruption--Narco-Politics in Mexico                           (By Andrew Reding)       The Tijuana cartel is one of three powerful border cartels      that manage the multi-billion-dollar business of      transshipping cocaine from Colombia's Cali cartel and heroin      from Southeast Asia and Pakistan into the United States. At      one end of the border, in Matamoros, the Gulf cartel      dominates the eastern delivery routes into Texas. The Juarez-     based Chihuahua cartel, run by Amado Carillo Fuentes,      dominates the central border. At the other end, strategically      straddling the busiest of all border crossings, the Tijuana      cartel dominates Pacific delivery routes. To defend this      coveted turf from rivals, the Arellanos have hired what      amounts to a private army, ranging from federal and state      police to members of San Diego gangs.       This is not just a Mexican problem but a U.S. one.      Integration of the continent's economies, formalized by the      North American Free Trade Agreement, is increasingly binding      our fates. A populous, unstable Mexico corrupted by narco-     dollars threatens to subvert prospects for regional economic      expansion, overwhelm U.S. capacity to absorb immigrants, add      to budget deficits with expensive bailouts and, as      demonstrated by the harm inflicted on the dollar by the      plunge of the peso, undermine our global stature and standard      of living. Economic integration mandates a common political      currency: democratic accountability and the rule of law.                [From the New York Times, July 30, 1995]          Mexican Connection Grows As Cocaine Supplier to U.S.                            (By Tim Golden)       Ciudad Juarez, Mexico.--The bodies of police informants      still turn up around this sprawling border city, their months      sometimes stuffed with one of the fingers they might have      pointed at drug traffickers.       As Mexico's political and economic ties to the United      States have strengthened in recent years, American demand for      illegal drugs has helped a new generation of Mexican      traffickers to consolidate their power, carving out an ever      larger share of the world's drug trade and posing a growing      threat on both sides of the border.       ``If we don't do something, both in the southern United      States and in Mexico, Mexico will take over from Colombia in      a few years as the traffickers' headquarters of choice,'' the      United States Ambassador to Mexico, James R. Jones, said.      ``It will undermine democracy. It will undermine commercial      development. It will undermine free trade.''       American officials who once trumpeted Mexican cooperation      in fighting drugs now worry that the Government has lost      control of most of its police. When the authorities located a      leading cocaine trafficker last month after his rented      Learjet crashed as he flew to a wedding in Guadalajara, they      needed army troops to capture him. The city's federal police      commander and most of his deputies were on the trafficker's      payroll, officials said.       While American officials lavishly praised Mexico's      cooperation in fighting drugs under Mr. Salinas, growing      evidence indicates that protection for the traffickers      reached high into his Administration. Those directly      implicated in taking bribes include former federal police      commanders and two of the administration's three drug      enforcement directors.       American officials say huge amounts of drug money have      flowed into Mexico's tourism, transportation and construction      industries, helping to fuel the speculative rise of the      economy until last year. Without offering details, a senior      F.B.I. official, James Moody, asserted recently that many of      the state-owned companies privatized under Mr. Salinas had      been bought by traffickers.       The bursts of violence that have attended the traffickers'      rise have led many Mexicans to fear that their country is      sliding toward the sort of terror that the Medellin cocaine      cartel unleashed on Colombia during the late 1980's and early      1990's.        In the last three years, the victims of drug-related      shootings have included the Roman Catholic Cardinal of      Guadalajara, a crusading police chief of Tijuana, two former      state prosecutors and more than a dozen active and retired      federal police officials.                   trade pact helps all entrepreneurs       Law enforcement officials say more and more drug cargoes      are moving through Mexico into the United States as part of      the widening flow of legal commerce between the two      countries.       Clinton Administration officials insist that the 19-month-     old trade agreement has not quickened the flow of drugs      through Mexico. But United States Customs Service officials      acknowledge that the smugglers are moving more of their drugs      into the United States taking advantage of rising truck      traffic and a falling rate of inspections.                                                                    ____                [From the New York Times, July 31, 1955]         To Help Keep Mexico Stable, U.S. Soft-Pedaled Drug War                            (By Tim Golden)       Concerned for Mexican stability and the fate of the North      American Free Trade Agreement, officials said, the United      States often exaggerated the Mexican Government's progress in      the fight against drugs, playing down corruption and glossing      over failures.       Above all, though, American officials said they were kept      in check by the desire of the Clinton and Bush      Administrations to keep problems of drugs and corruption from      jeopardizing the trade accord and the new economic      partnership it symbolized.       ``People desperately wanted drugs not to become a      complicating factor for Nafta,'' said John P. Walters, a      senior official for international drug policy in the Bush      White House. ``There was a degree of illicit activity that      was just accepted.''       Mexican and American officials also acknowledged that at      least half a dozen top-level traffickers, including the man      now considered Mexico's most powerful cocaine smuggler, Amado      Carrillo Fuentes, were arrested during the Salinas Government      and quietly freed by corrupt judges or the police.                               ____________________
