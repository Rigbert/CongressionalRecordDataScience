Mr. Chairman, that was not an answer. IPPF has said to its own affiliates, action outside of the law and even in violation is part of the process of stimulating change. They are telling their people to violate the law. Again, my amendment simply says, we do not want to contribute to an organization that gets involved in that kind of law breaking.
