Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the Government of Vietnam likes to say that Vietnam is a country, not a war. It is a catchy little self-evident phrase that some Members of Congress picked up during the bilateral trade agreement debate, as if to suggest that the debate was somehow about the Vietnam War, which it was not, instead of Vietnam's shameful present-day human rights record, which it was.  Of course Vietnam is a country, to which I respond: behave like an honorable country. Live up to their word as a signatory to numerous human rights covenants, including the international covenant on political and civil rights. Stop bringing dishonor and shame to their government by abusing their own people.  Mr. Speaker, according to the U.S. State Department report, the ``Report on Human Rights Practices for 2003'': ``The Government's human rights record remained poor, and it continued to commit serious abuses.'' Rather than repress and jail, harass, intimidate, and torture, the government should recognize and reflect the innate goodness of the Vietnamese people, a kind, gentle, compassionate people who deserve better, much better.  Take the case of Father Ly. In February 2001, Father Thaddeus Nguyen Van Ly submitted written testimony to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom for a hearing at which he was invited to testify. He was not able to testify in person, but submitted written testimony which I will include in its entirety in the Record.  Because this brave Catholic priest told the truth, spoke the truth to power, the Government of Vietnam persecuted and cruelly mistreated him;and he is now serving a 10-year prison sentence, and he has been in prison for 3 of those years. Amnesty International calls Father Ly a prisoner of conscience, and even the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has condemned his detention.  I think it is worth focusing just for a moment on his testimony, which was incisive and compelling; and I quote it in part: ``Since their victory of April 30, 1975,'' Father Ly wrote, ``the Vietnamese Communists have extended its oppressive policy toward the different religions of South Vietnam. Laws and decrees have been promulgated to confine, restrict, or ban religious activities. The government has falsely accused clergy members and lay people as a pretext to detain and imprison those who protest its oppressive policy, or those who teach catechism, lead a church choir, or join a seminary. They have been banished to concentration camps for years. This policy has been ongoing,'' he writes, ``for nearly 50 years.  ``The government has used many ruses,'' he continues to write, ``to divide and politicize the Cao Dai, Catholic and Protestant Churches; to split the Buddhist Church in two, the Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam and the Buddhist Church of Vietnam; and to set up the puppet Hoa Hao Buddhist Committee of Representatives, which consists of mainly Communist cadres, to claim leadership over 5 million Hoa Hao Buddhists. The government has requisitioned for its arbitrary use numerous facilities and properties belonging to different Churches.''  Father Ly continues to write: ``With regard to the Catholic Church, the Communists have severely restricted her fundamental rights,'' and he points out and lays out some 10 different instances, including the fact that the government still keeps many priests, clergy members, and lay people in prison or under house arrest.  Father Ly continues to say: ``Faced with this extremely cruel policy of the Vietnamese Communist Government to strangle religions, the Churches in Vietnam have unceasingly demanded religious freedom. Their nonviolent and persistent campaign will continue until the Vietnamese people have full religious freedom, which anyone else in the civilized world has.''                              {time}  1630  This campaign has, as he points out, the following objectives. This is number one. This is Father Ly's testimony:  ``Number one: the government must fully respect the right of all citizens to true religious freedom and the right of churches to select, train and appoint their own priests, clergy members and dignitaries. The government must stop its practice of listing the religious affiliation of citizens on their identity cards and personal documents so that no citizen be discriminated against and be able to freely practice his or her faith.  ``Number two,'' Father Ly writes: ``The government must return all facilities and properties it has confiscated or requisitioned from the churches, even when the documentary evidence of ownership was lost in the war if local people can confirm the rightful ownership of these facilities.  ``Number three: the government must abandon the ruses and schemes it has used to oppress and destroy religions. Its interference in church affairs must cease. Committees created by the government but dressed up as religious institutions in order to serve the government's anti-religion policy must be disbanded.  ``Number four: the government must unconditionally release all clergy members, priests, officials and dignitaries of the churches and lay people who are currently in prison or under administrative detention because of their faith.  ``Number five: the government must fully respect every and each article of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, of which the Vietnamese Communist Government became a signatory on September 24, 1982.''  Finally, Father Ly writes, ``However, for as long as the Vietnamese Communists keep their dogmatic and totalitarian rule and disregard the fundamental freedoms of the people as I have presented above,'' he goes on to say, ``by trading with Vietnam the U.S. and other countries only strengthen the Communists' grips on power.''  Again, I would like his full statement read by Members, because it is a very strong and compelling bit of testimony.  These are the words of Father Ly. He is now in prison 3 years of a 10-year prison term.  The resolution we are considering today, Mr. Speaker, has over 100 cosponsors and I believe, we believe, will send a strong message to the leaders of Hanoi to free Father Ly and that the ongoing systematic abuses of human rights must cease and that they will not be tolerated.  H. Con. Res. 378 also condemns, and this amendment we are offering with the language today, the brutal crackdown against the Montagnard. Largely ignored by the American press, Vietnam crushed thousands of Montagnard in the Central Highlands on April 10 and 11. In classic dictatorship style and brutality, many Montagnard, who were protesting the confiscation of tribal lands and ongoing restrictions on religious activities, were beaten and there are reports that some were killed. This comes on the heels of another brutal crackdown against the Montagnard in December of 2001 that has resulted in the closing of over 400 churches.  I would just point out to my colleagues that there are also attempts to coerce people to renounce their faith, renunciation of faith. According to Ambassador John Hanford, our Ambassador At Large For Religious Freedom, there are approximately 100,000 Montagnards who were pressured to renounce their faith. I am happy to say that most resisted, but 100,000 within the last few months and years have been pressured to say ``no'' to their faith in Christ.  H. Con. Res. 378 also urges the government of Vietnam to allow unfettered access to the Central Highlands, where all of this is going on, by foreign diplomats, the international press and nongovernmental organizations, and condemns the extent of the violence used against, as I said, the Montagnard protestors.  Mr. Speaker, finally, human rights have gotten worse, not better, since the Bilateral Trade Agreement with Vietnam of 2001. We must not remain silent while the government of Vietnam continues to persecute religious and political dissidents and ethnic minorities. As a matter of fact, I believe strongly that Vietnam should be branded a Country of Particular Concern, a CPC country, pursuant to the provisions of the International Religious Freedom Act.  We care deeply, Democrats and Republicans, Mr. Speaker. We care deeply about the people of Vietnam and respect and honor their legitimate aspirations to be free. Why does not Hanoi?  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the written testimony of Reverend Thaddeus Nguyen Van Ly before the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.                Testimony of Rev. Thaddeus Nguyen Van Ly       Ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honor to be perhaps the      first Vietnamese Roman Catholic priest living under a      communist regime to testify before your Commission at a      location that represents the ideals of democracy. I would      like to send my greetings of the New Millennium to you and to      the people of the United States.       In the opening statement of the Declaration of Independence      of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on September 2, 1945,      Ho Chi Minh tried to win your nation's support by solemnly      quoting the second paragraph of Declaration of Independence      of the United States: ``All men are created equal. They are      endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,      that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of      happiness.''       In less than 250 years since her independence, your country      has become the shining example of freedom and independence--     anyone who wants to know what freedom and independence are      only needs to visit your country and her people.       As an eyewitness living in Communist Vietnam for more than      25 years, I would like to boldly and frankly present my ideas      on three issues as your invitation letter has suggested.   i. the realities of the religions in vietnam in the new millennium       In order to achieve independence, liberty and happiness for      the Vietnamese people, Ho Chi Minh chose Communism. This is a      fundamental contradiction because Communism calls for a      dictatorial regime that does not tolerate the concept of true      liberty. Freedom of religion will be absent for as long as      the Vietnamese government hangs on to its Communist ideology.       Since their victory of April 30, 1975, the Vietnamese      Communists have extended its oppressive policy toward the      different religions     to South Vietnam. Laws and decrees have been promulgated to      confine, restrict, or ban religious activities. The      government has falsely accused clergy members and lay people      as a pretext to detain and imprison those who protest its      oppressive policy, or those who teach catechism, lead a      church choir, or join a seminary. They are banished to      concentration camps for years. This policy has been on-going      for nearly 50 years (from 1954 to 2001).       The government has used many ruses to divide and politicize      the Cao Dai, Catholic and Protestant Churches; to split the      Buddhist Church in two--the United Buddhist Church of Vietnam      (UBCV) and the Buddhist Church of Vietnam (BCV); and to set      up the puppet Hoa Hao Buddhist Committee of Representatives,      which consists of mainly Communist cadres, to claim      leadership over five million Hoa Hoa Buddhists. The      government has requisitioned for its arbitrary use numerous      facilities and properties belonging to the different      Churches.       With regard to the Catholic Church, the communists have      severely restricted her fundamental rights. The many      petitions issued by the Catholic Bishops Conference of      Vietnam (CBCV) since 1980 have unmasked the Government's      policy. This I have analyzed in my Ten-Point Proclamation      released on November 24, 1994 and the follow-up proclamation      dated November 24, 2000, which I have sent to your      Commission. Following is the summary of the points made in      those two statements.       1. The Vietnamese Communists have brutally interfered with      CBCV's authority to organize its annual Pastoral Assembly:      the Bishops must apply for permission to organize and the      Assembly's agenda must be pre-examined by the Government.      After the Assembly, the minutes must be submitted to the      Government. All reports from the Assembly must be vetted by      the Government before they can be released to the Catholic      community and the public.       2. The Vietnamese communists have brutally interfered with      CBCV's authority to appoint bishops and ordain of priests.      The Holy See had to negotiate with the Vietnamese Government      for years on each bishop appointment. The Government often      rejects candidates selected by the Church and only accepts      those they are pleased with. The Government counts on The      Vatican having to yield eventually so as to prevent excessive      harm to dioceses facing extended absence of a bishop. The      dioceses of Hung Hoa, Hai Phong, and Bui Chu . . . have not      had a bishop for more than eight years and The Vatican is not      allowed to appoint any.       Anyone intending to join a seminary of any candidate for      priesthood elected by the Church must have the approval of      and their background examined by the Public Security Police.      These candidates must prove their docility and show no sign      of resisting the regime. The police give special preference      to those agreeing to serve as informants for the Government      within the seminary. An applicant's chance would increase if      he can afford to bribe the authorities. Applicants having      family members who worked for defunct Republic of Vietnam or      holding nonconformist views stand no chance of being approved      for admission into a seminary or priesthood regardless of      their qualifications and moral virtues and regardless of the      Church's support. I know many young men who have repeatedly      passed the Church-administered entrance exam with top scores      but have not been approved for admission into any seminary.      Any bishop intending to ordain a seminarian into priesthood      or to assign a priest to a mission must ask for permission      and negotiate with the Government in a protracted process,      which in some cases has taken nearly 20 years without      results. The approval criteria imposed by the Government has      nothing to do with the moral quality that the Church requires      of candidates for priesthood. As a result, the number of      newly ordained priests has drastically decreased and is      currently insufficient to meet the Church's pastoral needs.      Aging priests die or retire without successors. Many priests      in rural regions have to minister more than ten parishes, all      distant from each other. There is hardly normal religious      life in these parishes. It is very difficult for priests to      change their residence for new assignments.       3. Groups of faithful in new economic zones or in remote      areas are anxious to have mass for Christmas and Easter each      year but their most basic spiritual need is rarely met. The      atheist Government wants these people not to think of      religion, which it considers harmful and dangerous.       4. A Mass that brings together the faithful from different      places and priests desiring to say mass in places other than      their usual assigned location must have prior government      permission.       5. The Government still keeps many priests, clergy members,      and lay people in prison or under house arrest. (Committee      for Religious Freedom in Vietnam has made this list available      to your Commission.)       6. The Government brutally violates the Church's freedom of      the press. No local or national publication of the Church is      allowed. As a result, The Church cannot fulfill      its evangelical duties. Before 1975, there were more than      a dozen Catholic newspapers and magazines in South      Vietnam. Today there are only two weekly magazines, Cong      Giao & Dan Toc (The Catholics & The People) and Nguoi Cong      Giao Viet Nam (The Vietnamese Catholics), which are      created and financed by the Government. CBCV's only      publication is the newsletter Ban Tin Hiep Thong (The      Communion News), of which the first six issues were      ``illegal.'' The Government gave the Church temporary      permission to publish issues 7-9 from February to      September 2000. In October 2000, the government rescinded      its permission and discontinued this only publication of      The Church. There is no freedom of speech in my country.      Churches of course have none. This kind of statement that      I am presenting to you cannot be circulated in Vietnam      because no photocopying store or printing shop would dare      to reproduce it. Nobody dares to keep it, fearing for his      own life and the safety of his family. Those who dare must      be prepared for martyrdom. In fact, on February 7 the      public security police searched two of my assistants and      found a floppy disk containing a draft of this statement.      These two brave young men were detained overnight at the      police station for extensive questioning.       7. The Government forces all students from all grades and      in college to study and love Socialism while in fact nobody      likes to teach or study it. Only the three million communist      party members and the five million members of the Communist      League of Youth should study this ideology if they still      believe in it. Forcing the entire Vietnamese nation to study      a bankrupt ideology that has caused them so much suffering is      outright unconscionable.       8. The Communist Government has, since 1954 in North      Vietnam and since 1975 in South Vietnam, seized or      requisitioned thousands upon thousands of Church facilities      used for education, charity, and medical service.      Consequently the Church has no means to train seminarians,      providing education and human services to the poor, the sick,      the handicapped and the orphans, and it is extremely      difficult for Church members to deliver service in a      government facility. For example, the Pius X Papal Institute      in Da Lat, run by the Jesuits, had been an outstanding      college for priesthood formation until its confiscation in      1976 by the Government, which turned it into a training      school for Communist cadres. The Hoan Thien Minor Seminary at      11 Dong Da, Hue, offering high school-level training to      seminarians, was taken by force by the Government in December      1979; all three priests teaching at the seminary and more      than 80 seminarians were evicted. These are but a few      examples.       Faced with this extremely cruel policy of the Vietnamese      Communist Government to strangle religions, the Churches in      Vietnam have unceasingly demanded religious freedom. Their      non-violent and persistent campaign will continue until the      Vietnamese people have full religious freedom, which anyone      else in the civilized world has. This campaign has the      following objectives.       1. The Government must fully respect the right of all      citizens to true religious freedom and the right of Churches      to select, train, and appoint their own priests, clergy      members and dignitaries. The Government must stop its      practice of listing the religious affiliation of citizens on      their identity cards and personal documents so that no      citizen will be discriminated against and be able to freely      practice his or her faith.       2. The Government must return all facilities and properties      it has confiscated or requisitioned from the Churches, even      when documentary evidence of ownership was lost in the war if      local people can confirm the rightful owner of these      facilities and properties.       3. The Government must abandon the ruses and schemes it has      used to oppress and destroy religions. Its interference in      Church affairs must cease. Committees created by the      government but dressed up as religious institutions in order      to serve the Government's antireligion policy must be      disbanded.       4. The Government must unconditionally release all clergy      members, priests, officials and dignitaries of the Churches      and lay people who are currently in prison or under      administrative detention because of their faith.       5. The Government must fully respect every and each article      of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,      of which the Vietnamese Communist Government became a      signatory on September 24, 1982.   ii. effects of the bilateral trade agreement on human rights and                       religious freedom in vietnam       I am only a priest, not a specialist in economics and      politics. I speak as a Vietnamese citizen with a deep love      for my country and my people.       Vietnam needs the Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) for her      economic development. In principle I dearly want my country      to have the trust of other countries, among them the United      States, so that my country may achieve prosperity and my      people may have a better life and fully realize their      potentials.       However, for as long as the Vietnamese Communists keep      their dogmatic and totalitarian rule and disregard the      fundamental freedoms of the people as I have presented above,      by trading with Vietnam the United States and other countries      would only strengthen the Communists' grips on power; the BTA      may end up benefiting only the governing minority while      prolonging the suffering of the entire people; the vast      majority of the common people like us may at best receive      small crumbs trickling down from the top but in return must      endure our fate of the exploited and disenfranchised for so      much longer.       In regard to the ratification of the BTA, I urgently warn      the US Congress not to trust     the Vietnamese Communists' promise of good faith. The United      States and many other countries have had bitter experiences      dealing with their broken promises in the past.       The Vietnamese Communists have signed many international      accords and agreements on human rights but have never      intended to respect them. Their intention is to deceive the      international community. For example, Vietnam became      signatory to the International Covenant on Civil and      Political Rights in 1982 but does not abide by Articles 18      and 19 of this covenant which call for the respect for the      freedoms of thought, speech, and religion. If international      human rights institutions allow themselves to fall victim to      such deception, they will contribute to the following dire      consequences: (1) the Vietnamese Government will exploit      their signing the document to falsely claim that there are      human rights in Vietnam; (2) these international      institutions will lose their credibility as they prove to      be so easily deceived; and (3) these institutions      unknowingly prolong the Communist oppression of the      Vietnamese people--this in fact constitutes a major crime      against my people.       Therefore, if the United States and other countries truly      sympathize with my ill-fated people and truly care about      human rights, especially the right to religious freedom, of      the Vietnamese people, you must not help the Communist      Government prolong its totalitarian rule. Instead, the United      States and other countries should suspend all agreements      harmful to the Vietnamese people and do everything in your      capacity to put pressure on the Vietnamese Government to      allow freedom and democracy to dawn on our country.iii. what can be done to help improve freedom of religion in Vietnam in                   the near term, and in the long term?       The Vietnamese Communists have idolized Ho Chi Minh,      turning him into a ``god'' and creating a new religion      revolving around him. The Communist Government wants to      suppress all other religions and replace them with this new      religion in order to unify the Vietnamese people behind it.      In fact, Ho Chi Minh had made significant contributions to      our national struggle for independence but at the same time      had committed serious crimes against the Vietnamese people.      One basic endeavor that the international community needs to      undertake is to unravel the harmful myths woven by the      Communists around this historical figure.       In the short term, the United States and other countries      should help the Churches in Vietnam achieve greater      independence from the government, should show by example how      freedom of religion is respected in the free world, and      should expose the oppression that the Vietnamese Government      has imposed on the Churches. At first, the Vietnamese      Communists may feel that such independence would clash with      its totalitarian power but with time it may realize that the      power to control and interfere with Church affairs, such as      the appointment of priests, should have never been theirs to      start with.       The Vietnamese people will not enjoy religious freedom for      as long as the Communist regime remains in place. Therefore      if the United States and other countries truly desire to see      the return of religious freedom to the Vietnamese people,      they will need to create favorable conditions for the early      demise of the Communist regime.       Ladies and gentlemen,       This is a precious opportunity to speak on behalf of my      people, of the different Churches, and of the Catholic Church      in particular. I would like to extend my gratitude to you, to      the U.S. Congress, and the American people, including some      two million Vietnamese-Americans, for having given me such an      opportunity.       May God bless you, your families, your colleagues, the      American people, and your beautiful country. Thank you.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
