President, reserving the right to object, on behalf of myself and other Senators, I will object to the appointment of conferees at this point. This is an issue which has been debated for a short time here on the floor and never went through the Senate Judiciary Committee for consideration. It is our belief that at this point in the session asking for a conference committee is premature.  I object.
