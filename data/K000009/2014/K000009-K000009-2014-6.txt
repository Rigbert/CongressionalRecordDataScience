Speaker, I rise today because the American people keep asking: Where have all the good jobs gone? And I truly appreciate my colleagues, Congresswoman Louise Slaughter of New York and Congressman Paul Tonko of New York, for joining me tonight.  We are talking about jobs that can create a middle-class way of life for the people who occupy them as well as local businesses, jobs that produce living wages, that produce good health benefits and pensions and 401(k)s you can depend upon.                              {time}  1645  Now, since the 1980s, unlike any period following World War II, because the United States is importing more than we are exporting, we actually have lost millions and millions of jobs.  People complain about a budget deficit. The reason we have a budget deficit is because we have a trade deficit. In fact, since the mid-1970s, every single trade agreement the United States has signed of any consequence has resulted in more and more and more red ink.  Go to any store in this country. I don't care if you are trying to buy a suit or an automobile or curtains, I really don't care what it is, if you can find something made in America, that is a discovery.  What does that mean? It means that rather than exporting more than we import, we have been driving down the living standard of most Americans decade after decade. Jobs here disappear while capital moves abroad and exploits penny wage workers who have no hope for a better life because they live in places that have no Democratic values.  It is a shocking number to put on the record, but since the mid-1990s, this country has amassed over $4.3 trillion in trade deficit--and that is a conservative estimate--amounting to a job loss of over 8.5 million good jobs. That is what this red ink is all about. It is a shocking figure. The American people, they sort of know it innately, but when you really put it up there they go, ``Yeah.'' That is what happened.  If you look here, this shows that, with more imports, you get fewer jobs. When the trade deficit keeps getting worse, if you are out of a job yet, keep buying foreign. I am not against trade, I am for balanced trade, but I am not for trade that puts our country in this kind of an economic hole.  This is just one example--and we will go back to it a little bit later--this is the most recent agreement that the United States signed called the Korea Free Trade Agreement. We were supposed to be able to sell 50,000 cars in Korea.  Guess what. We have been able to ship--here is our piddly little shipment over there--750,000 cars. Guess how many they have sent over here. Look at this arrow compared to that little tiddlywink there. Imported vehicles from Korea, over 561,000 compared to 7,450.  So when you start wondering where your job has gone, think about what has happened to these trade agreements and how they have put us deeper and deeper in the trade hole and then in the budget deficit hole.  When I ask individual Americans how their life is going under the corporate globalization model that has been accelerated by the so-called free trade agreements, if they answer honestly and if they are not a multimillionaire investor, consistently, the response is one of great disappointment and too frequently one of great distress. The middle class in America is in trouble.  It is safe to say that this is a direct result of the long list of free trade deals that have benefited only the wealthiest in the global environment in which we live, wealthy investors who can survive anywhere. In fact, they have a lot of houses--Paris, Geneva, you name it--but each of us has a house that is our most important asset.  We come from little communities across this country, and we have a right to a good life. Our people have a right to a good life because they work so hard. Trade policy is the major reason, in my opinion, that America cannot employ all Americans seeking work.  I wanted to allow my colleagues to also speak this evening. Let me just give you a couple examples, practical examples--actually, the list could go all across this floor if I were to roll it out. Fort Smith, Arkansas, ask the 1,860 workers who lost jobs at Whirlpool when production was shifted to Mexico.  How about the 300 people who worked at the Vise-Grip plant in DeWitt, Nebraska, a town of only 572 residents, who all lost their jobs, and some would say their town identity, when the company moved to China to keep the name competitive.  How about Maytag from Newton, Iowa--one of America's iconic products--shut down, moved to Monterrey, Mexico. If you look at the census statistics from the time that happened over a decade and a half ago until today, poverty in Newton has risen up to a level of 25 percent.  This is happening across this country.  How about the 535 workers who made hearing aids in Eden Prairie, Minnesota, who were laid off when the Starkey Laboratories factory moved to Mexico and China.  Every American listening knows a company or more that has done exactly the same thing. If you go down to those countries and you see how the people live, you couldn't stomach it; you simply couldn't. I have gone down to the maquiladoras in Mexico.  I have asked the workers in those factories, ``Take me to where you live,'' and they do. It is truly sad to see a tiny little crate barrel house powered by a lightbulb connected to a battery, and this is what development brings them. Come now. Come now. The world can do better than that.  13,000 citizens of our congressional district in Ohio had jobs shifted overseas, outsourced to someplace else. Oh, they know this tale all too well.  I would ask my dear colleague from New York--New York has been battered, just like Ohio has been battered--Congressman Paul Tonko, one of the greatest leaders on economic growth for our country, who has taken time tonight during a very busy week to join us here, thank you so very much for coming to the floor tonight.
