Speaker, I rise today to congratulate thirteen community leaders who are being recognized as 2015 honorees of the Toledo African American Legacy Project. The Toledo African American Legacy Project is dedicated to bringing together people to document and preserve the history of northwest Ohio's African American communities and demonstrate the impact and influence of individuals upon Toledo and the greater world community.  This year's honorees are indeed a celebrated group. Elinor Allen is a retired school teacher who for 33 years served as an elementary teacher, Unit Leader, and reading teacher in Toledo Public Schools. Ronald Jackson, Sr., was appointed as the first African American Deputy Chief of the Toledo Police Department and also served as Executive Director of the Board of Community Relations. Theresa M. Gabriel has served in many capacities within the city government including Director of Parks, Recreation and Forestry and Director of Department of Human Resources. She currently serves on Toledo City Council. John Moore is a consultant, motivational speaker and author whose current and past board memberships include Owens Community College and the College's foundation, Boys and Girls Clubs of Toledo and Hospice of Northwest Ohio. Doni Miller is the CEO of the Neighborhood Health Association, a federally qualified health center. She earned a Doctor of Jurisprudence from the University of Toledo and has 25 years of experience in health administration in addition to hosting a local public affairs television program. Ben Williams has dedicated his life to youth. He is currently the Executive Director of the Ben E. Williams Youth Service, Inc., and was the first African American coach inducted into the Ohio High School Basketball Coaches Association Hall of Fame.  The Toledo African American Legacy Project also posthumously recognized: Dr. Frank A. Brown, who was elected the first African American as Vice President of the Toledo Board of Education and eventually President; and Roland A. Gandy, Jr., who was Chief of Staff at Mercy Hospital and Maumee Valley Hospital and was known for providing services free of charge to Scott High School and the University of Toledo athletics.  In addition to honoring these community leaders, the Toledo African American Legacy Project also highlights young, emerging African-Americans leading the way for the future. This year, four people were recognized for their efforts. Larome Myrick is a Parole Service Supervisor in the Department of Youth Services Toledo Region. Kelly Westmoreland is an agent for Bankers Life and Casualty. Jason Woodward is a minister, deacon and finance director at Trinity Faith Tabernacle Church. Rashieda Timpson is founder and CEO of the Christian based non-profit organization United Sisters (women inspiring women).  It is my sincere pleasure to congratulate all of these honorees for their hard work and dedicated service. We stand on the shoulders of those who came before us and together we build community forward. The 2015 African American Legacy Project honorees represent the excellence that is in us. Their leadership inspires.                          ____________________
