Let me make a couple comments.  We are talking as if this is some program that we are putting together. This is a feasibility study. This is something to determine what the costs would be, what risks are out there, what the potential threat is that we could be guarding against. We are talking about a defensive system. I have heard all of the arguments.  Since we do have some time, I will let them use some of their time, and then I would like to respond so we can stay on schedule.  I yield the floor.
