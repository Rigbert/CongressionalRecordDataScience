Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me. I will not take the 2 minutes.  As indicated, the gentleman's amendment does require that no person can receive food stamps if that person is required by a court order to pay child support, and then dealt with the unpaid liability issue. The gentleman has amended his amendment so that becomes more flexible and certainly more practical.  Let me seek the gentleman's assurance that the effective date of this amendment will coincide with the implementation of the new child support enforcement system as described in H.R. 4.
