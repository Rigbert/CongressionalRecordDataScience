Speaker, I rise this week to praise passage of the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act. With an estimated 40 million people relying on the Great Lakes basin for jobs, drinking water, and recreation, the health of this resource is paramount and should remain a priority for Congress. Our Great Lakes constitute the largest body of freshwater on the face of the earth.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to tell you about a treasured spot in the Great Lakes--the north coast of Ohio. It is a true sapphire jewel, enjoyed by large communities of birders, sport and commercial fishermen, hunters and recreational boaters. And it is vital to life for every living creature in our region.  While the value of this treasure should be obvious to all, it is undeniable that the resources it provides remain threatened. This is a region whose wildlife populations are under attack by invasive species like the Gobe, Asian Carp and Zebra Mussel and where encroaching sprawl constantly jeopardizes the region's priceless wetlands. Without addressing the social and human costs posed by these problems, we face an incalculable menace of inaction--a menace that this week, this body took a step to fight.  Mr. Speaker, the reason that I wish to praise passage of the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act is not because this bill solves all the longstanding problems that our Great Lakes face, but because it serves as one step in the journey toward restoring the integrity of our lakes. The bill authorizes the Fish and Wildlife Service for grants of up to $12 million per year and gives legal authority for the Fish and Wildlife Service to receive $2 million per year. These funds will be used to implement recommendations of the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration that are consistent with water quality, fisheries, and wildlife agreements.  Though the House has taken a tremendous step towards restoring the Great Lakes by passing this bill, we must not rest. Instead, we must continue on with the next steps, taking up the additional priorities of the Great Lakes Regional Collaboration not addressed in this bill. Let us find the will to expand the Ottawa and Cedar Point National Wildlife Refuges. Let us preserve more wetlands for the migrating birds that pass through the Great Lakes. Let us stop the flow of invasive species in the ballast water of transport ships. Let us celebrate victory for the crown jewel of our refuge system by fully funding the grant programs that we have just authorized.  Mr. Speaker, we are the only species with the capability of precipitating the wholesale extermination of other species; but, through compassion and conviction, we are also capable of protecting the things we treasure. We are unique in our ability to affect the fate of the planet, but also unique in our ability to predict those effects and to change our ways in light of what we foresee.  So now, let us take this one moment to appreciate the importance of passage of the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act. I would like to thank the many friends who made passage of this bill possible and ask them for the strength to continue the battle in restoring the Great Lakes to the pristine beauty that we can all foresee.  great lakes fish and wildlife restoration act of 2006--bill summary  Summary: This bill would reauthorize the Great Lakes Fish and Wildlife Restoration Act, a program first enacted in 1990 and again in 1998.
