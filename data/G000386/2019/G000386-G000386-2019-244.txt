 President, for 1 minute, I will speak to a piece of history of the Senate.  I call to the Senate's attention this fact: When the Senate first convened in 1789 at Federal Hall in New York City, one of the Senate's first orders of business was to appoint a committee to recommend a candidate for Chaplain. On April 25, 1789, the Senate elected the Right Reverend Samuel Provost, Episcopal bishop of New York, as its first Chaplain.  That means 230 years ago this week, the Senate elected its first Chaplain, and since then the Senate has had 62 people serve in the position as Chaplain of the Senate.
