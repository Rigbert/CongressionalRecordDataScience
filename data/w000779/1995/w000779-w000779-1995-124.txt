Speaker, today I am introducing the Comprehensive Survey of Young Offenders Act. While Congress has spent much time and effort, and is about to spend vast sums on measures to address crime committed by adults, it is juvenile crime that is increasing exponentially. Particularly ominous, experts in the field report that while one can collect voluminous information on the national patterns and problems of adult crime and the adult criminal justice system, basic statistical data on the juvenile justice system is sketchy at best. Congress, States and localities have little or no comprehensive data on what the career record of a young offender looks like or how juvenile offenders flow through our country's juvenile justice systems.  A 1994 FBI study on major crimes reported that while the number of murders committed by adults 25 or older dropped 20 percent, the number of homicides committed by 18-24-year-olds increased 65 percent, and those by 14-17-year-olds increased 165 percent. However, according to several experts who study juvenile crime, by the year 2005 the number of teenagers in this county will increase 23 percent, and youth crimes will increase dramatically as well.  To effectively address youth crime, the Federal Government and the States need clear, straightforward data on how the current juvenile system functions. I have worked closely with Dr. James Q. Wilson, the noted UCLA criminologist, to meet this need through the legislation I introduce today. Dr. Wilson correctly pointed out that instead of fighting youth [[Page E1239]] crime with grandiose rhetorical statements like harsh treatment and mollycoddling, it is time to address the issue with a commonsense look at the facts.  There is a substantial amount of anecdotal evidence that indicates the juvenile system is in trouble. For example:  In Portland, my hometown, the Oregonian, described a case where a child committed 50 crimes, 32 of which were felonies, before the juvenile justice system took action to protect the community.  According to New York magazine, in New York State, 30,000 juveniles picked up for misdemeanors in 1993 were issued youth division cards and then released--essentially the paperwork was filed and the child walked out.  In Chicago, in the case of Yummy Sandifer, Newsweek reported that he averaged a felony a month for the last year and a half of his life (23 felonies and 5 misdemeanors in all). He was actually convicted of two felonies in juvenile court and nothing ever happened to him. Finally, he killed someone and was killed himself.  A system like this neither serves the children who commit crimes nor the community it is supposed to protect. Nationally, only 50 percent of juvenile cases even go to juvenile court. Most cases are handled by some form of social services division. The majority of juveniles who do go to court are given probation.  While this information indicates a system that is overwhelmed with violent offenders and doesn't have the legal remedies necessary to deal with such an influx, a broad overview of the problem is missing. The Comprehensive Survey of Young Offenders Act, would help Congress, States, and localities fill the holes in our knowledge of juvenile crime and our country's juvenile services. Right now there is little or no comprehensive data on the patterns of crime for young offenders, how many times a young offender goes through the juvenile justice system or which punishments or programs effectively protect the community and reduce recidivism.  This legislation would require the Bureau of Justice Statistics [BJS] to look into these issues--to survey available data on the crimes juveniles commit, to examine how young offenders flow through the juvenile justice system, and to report the outcomes of juvenile cases that are both petitioned to juvenile court and those that are handled informally.  Additionally, my legislation would require the BJS to design and estimate costs of a program that will improve data collection on young offenders in the States. While many States are moving in the direction of juvenile reform, few systematically evaluate the outcomes in their juvenile justice programs.  It is obvious that the rate of juvenile crime is climbing. What Congress now needs to do is take a comprehensive look at how our country's juvenile systems are handling that increase in crime and then evaluate where our national policy needs to go to address this enormous challenge.                          ____________________
