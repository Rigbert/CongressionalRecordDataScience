 President, again reserving the right to object, what we do on the floor is allow Senators to go back and forth. Senator Kennedy has also been waiting. He is not on the floor, but he has been waiting his turn.  I again ask if the Senator will allow us to go ahead and let your two Republican Senators speak, then allow Senator Kennedy to speak, and then go back to your side of the aisle?
