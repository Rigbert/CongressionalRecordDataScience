We know the Leahy-Crapo reauthorization bill passed the Senate with a strong bipartisan majority of 68 votes. Every woman in the Senate--Republican and Democrat alike--voted for it. But Republican leaders in both the House and the Senate have hidden behind a procedural technicality. They refuse to allow the House to vote on the Senate bill.  Well, that obstruction has to end. Too many lives are on the line to play these political games. Here in the Senate, we have twice asked Republican leaders to agree to take up a House revenue bill, substitute the bipartisan Senate VAWA bill, and send it to the House immediately to overcome this procedural concern. Each time they have refused this commonsense resolution. This contrasts how we moved forward earlier this year using the same process to overcome similar technical hurdles with both the Transportation bill and the FAA reauthorization legislation. So with a little bit of cooperation from the other side we could move VAWA now.  People watching this and listening to this might think: Well, these are technical and arcane procedures. They are technical and arcane procedures. But they are stopping us from moving forward with the Violence Against Women Act. We can set them aside for Transportation and the FAA--both important things--but if you are somebody who has been battered and abused, if you are near death, do not talk to that person about technicalities.  I have said many times on this floor--I still have nightmares from some of the crime scenes I went to as a young prosecutor. It was always at 2 and 3 and 4 o'clock in the morning. The ones easiest to handle were those where the victim lived, although sometimes just barely. I remember riding in the ambulance with a victim on the way to the emergency room to find out what happened. Many other times we were there waiting for the coroner to arrive because the body was on the floor.  I wish everybody who is hiding behind these technicalities would come with those of us from both parties, those of us who have been prosecutors, who have gone to those crime scenes. I guarantee you, they would be back here saying: Get rid of those technicalities.  I cannot understand the House Republican leadership hiding behind this excuse to avoid debating and voting on the bipartisan Senate bill. This is a good bill. It brought Republicans and Democrats together in this body across the political spectrum. The House Republican leadership should stop blocking it on this obscure technicality. The Speaker can waive the technicality. The House could vote on the Senate bill any time.  I would like to see people stand up and say: Yes, I want to stop violence against women or I am going to vote ``no.'' Right now they are allowed to vote ``maybe.'' No victim wants to hear ``maybe.'' They want us to do something. Both in the House and the Senate, we have a privileged position as Members. Do not hide behind a technicality. Have the courage--have the courage--to stand up and vote ``yes'' or ``no.''  The House Republicans could have allowed a vote on the text of the Senate bill as a House amendment or a House bill. Instead, they are choosing to hold up VAWA reauthorization for all victims. Please reconsider. Move forward with us to protect all victims of violence. And if you are unwilling to do that, if you are going to stand behind this, do not go home and campaign and say you have a commitment to women.  Battered women are in all categories. They go across all political spectrums. They go across all economic spectrums. Do not go back home and say: I am standing up for you. No, you are not standing up. You are hiding. You are hiding. You are hiding behind a technicality. Well, these victims cannot hide. They are sought out, and they become victims. Let's do something for them.  Our bill was developed with the input of victims and the service providers who work with them day in and day out. It helps women who are victims of terrible crimes--the very people we claim we want to support and protect. It does so in important and responsible ways. Do not go home and say: I stand up for all of you; do not go home and say: I am standing for law enforcement; do not go home and say: I want people protected when you refuse to step around a procedural motion and protect them. Do not be that hypocritical.  We have only a few precious days left this Congress to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act. If the Republican leadership wants to help end domestic and sexual violence, well then, do so. Now is the time to act. Do not hide behind fiction. Have the courage to stand up and say you are on the side of victims. And if you are not on their side, then stand up and vote against them. Do not vote ``maybe.'' Do not hide behind a technicality. It is time to make good on our promise tothe victims of these horrible crimes. Helping them--no matter who they are--has to be our goal. Their lives depend upon it. Our lives do not depend upon it, but their lives depend upon it. They are counting on us. It is time to stand up.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                    [From Politico, Sept. 11, 2012]     Weakening Violence Against Women Act Betrays Immigrant Victims                  (By Mark Shurtleff and Doug Gansler)       All women who have lived through violence and abuse should      have the certainty that the law will protect them--no matter      their race, creed, color, religion or immigration status.      Unfortunately, Congress is now considering proposals that      would erode this certainty--and its failure to act is already      causing harm.       We urge congressional leaders to move forward now to      reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, without      provisions harmful to immigrants.       As long-time law enforcement leaders, we know this act is      crucial. Since passage in 1994, it has helped cut domestic      violence by more than half. Still, the scourge of domestic      violence remains a serious problem: One in four women      experiences an act of domestic violence or sexual assault in      her lifetime, and three women die every day at the hands of      abusive husbands or partners.       Rates of trafficking women--often from one abusive context      to another--are also alarmingly high. Roughly 100,000      survivors of human trafficking live in the United States      today, according to the State Department, whose estimates      suggest as many as 17,500 foreign-born victims are illegally      brought in each year.       We need every available tool to fight these serious crimes,      so we fully support reauthorization of the Violence Against      Women Act--but not in a dangerously altered form that would      harm vulnerable immigrant women.       We don't use ``dangerously'' lightly. When the House sought      reauthorization, legislators made changes that dramatically      roll back important protections for battered immigrant women      and their children--leaving them vulnerable to abuse and,      worse, death at the hands of an abuser.       Several House provisions would further endanger immigrant      survivors of human trafficking and domestic abuse. These      provisions would leave them no legal way to break the cycle      of violence in which they are trapped and leave law      enforcement no way to bring perpetrators to justice. The      changes, for example, would discourage immigrant survivors      from calling the police, for fear of immigration issues--so      police can't intervene and save their lives.       For many of these women, immigration status is one more      weapon that abusers use to intimidate them. Abusers often      threaten, ``You can't call the police. They'll just deport      you.''       Under the existing law, our response is clear: ``He's      wrong. You're safe.'' If we certify that a victim was helpful      to law enforcement during an investigation, she can seek      special legal immigration status--known as a U visa.       But the House bill would make this visa temporary and take      away an immigrant survivor's incentive to come forward.      ``He's wrong; you're safe'' would be replaced with the far      less reassuring message ``You'll have to wait and see.''       What kind of person does the U visa help? Consider      ``Stephanie,'' an immigrant living in Maryland who lacked      work authorization. She had already been sexually harassed by      work supervisors when a stranger followed her into a room in      the building where she was working and tried to rape her.      Stephanie was able to fight him off and immediately reported      the incident to police, who found the man nearby and arrested      him.       After reporting the terrible crime, Stephanie learned she      would be eligible for a U visa for her cooperation with      police and the state's attorney. Her assistance helped get a      rapist off the streets. Today, Stephanie has her U visa and      is confident and self-supporting.       The House bill would silence thousands of women like      Stephanie and derail our efforts to put their attackers      behind bars. Worse, it would further endanger some of the      very women whom the Violence Against Women Act is meant to      help.       In late August, we received a reminder of reauthorization's      urgency. Our immigration authorities announced that they had      reached the limit of 10,000 U visas for the current fiscal      year, leaving a six-week gap before the new fiscal year      brings a fresh allotment. In the meantime, lives are at risk.       The Senate's bipartisan reauthorization bill would increase      that visa limit to 15,000, a significant boost for law      enforcement and public safety.       The law enforcement community now has 17 years of      experience with the Violence Against Women Act and has used      it successfully to combat human trafficking, sexual assault      and domestic violence. We have relied on it to protect      survivors of all stripes and hold their abusers accountable.       These abusers don't differentiate by race, creed, color,      religion or immigration status. In seeking justice for      survivors, neither should we.       The House version of the Violence Against Women Act      reauthorization seeks to turn a bipartisan concern for abuse      survivors into a partisan wedge. Congress must not let      partisanship stand in the way of our work to protect all      women, and their families, from harm.                                  ____                         Department of Justice                        Office of Public Affairs         [For Immediate Release--Thursday, September 13, 2012]Statement from Attorney General Eric Holder on the 18th Anniversary of                      the Violence Against Women Act       Attorney General Eric Holder released the following      statement today on the 18th anniversary of the Violence      Against Women Act:       ``Since the landmark Violence Against Women Act (VAWA)      became law 18 years ago today, VAWA has vastly improved our      ability to address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual      assault, and stalking and has helped countless victims of      these crimes get access to needed services. It's important to      remember that none of this progress has been inevitable--it      has been the result of the tireless work of advocates, law      enforcement, prosecutors, and others. On the front lines of      this effort, the Office on Violence Against Women administers      VAWA programs, providing states, territories, local and      tribal governments, and nonprofit organizations with critical      resources to initiate and sustain efforts to reduce and stop      violence against women. As Congress moves to consider      reauthorizing this critical law, we urge lawmakers to come      together on a bipartisan basis, as it has historically, to      pass a VAWA reauthorization that expands rather than limits      victim access to justice and strengthens law enforcement and      prosecutorial tools to seek justice and hold violators      accountable. VAWA has been strengthened each time it has been      reauthorized, with bipartisan support, and this year after 18      years of progress, it should be no different.''
