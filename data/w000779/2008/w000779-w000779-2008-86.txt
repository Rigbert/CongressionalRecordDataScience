President, it is not easy talking to a family member or loved one about what kind of medical care you'd want or not want at the end of your life. Yet every day family members are making medical care decisions for seriously ill people who cannot speak for themselves. Most family members with relatives who had executed advance directives find comfort in knowing that the hard decisions they may need to make about end-of-life care will reflect the wishes of the ill relative. End-of-life planning is a gift to the people who are important to you and to yourself.  Americans are talking a lot more about the topic of advance directives than they used to and are also doing something about it by preparing written advance directives. Advance directives come in two main forms. The first is a ``health care power of attorney'' in which someone is designated to be your voice in health decisions if you can not speak for yourself. The second is a ``living will'' which states what types of medical care you would want or not want at the end of life. Most married people have had a conversation with a husband or wife about end of life medical care and most people have spoken with one or both older parents about the topic. Research has found that people who have had to make decisions about medical care at the end of life for others are more likely to make end of life plans for themselves. They have learned how important it is to make a plan. Congress helped to get the advance directives conversation going with the Patient Self-Determination Act. This law directed Medicare-participating health care facilities to engage patient and staff in a discussion of end of life wishes. Since 1990 when the Patient Self-Determination Act was passed, the percentage of Americans who have made a living will has more than doubled from 12 percent to 29 percent.  Yet more conversation is needed. The National Health Care Decisions Day will help promote that conversation. National Health Care Decisions Day will be a 50-state annual event to increase knowledge and awareness of the importance of advance directives for all Americans. At this year's annual event on April 16, 2008, a coordinated series of activities across the U.S. will encourage Americans to discuss their wishes for end-of-life care and then fill out documents that reflect those wishes. The National Heath Care Decisions Day is supported by many of our distinguished local, state, and national health care organizations.  This joint Senate-House resolution: supports the goals and ideals of National Health Care Decisions Day and the importance of advance care planning, encourages health care, civic, educational, religious and other organizations to encourage individuals to use advance directives, and asks all Americans, including members of Congress, to prepare advance directives for themselves. The Senate resolution is cosponsored by Senators Enzi, Wicker, Warner, and Whitehouse. A companion House resolution will be introduced by Congressman Phil Gingrey, M.D. I encourage my congressional colleagues to support this resolution. I also ask you to begin or continue the dialogue about end-of-life issues with family members and to complete written advance directives.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint resolution be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              S.J. Res. 29       Whereas National Health Care Decisions Day is designed to      raise public awareness of the need to plan ahead for health      care decisions related to end-of-life care and medical      decision-making whenever patients are unable to speak for      themselves and to encourage the specific use of advance      directives to communicate these important decisions;       Whereas the Patient Self-Determination Act (42 U.S.C.      1395cc(f) et seq.) guarantees patients the right to      information about their rights under State law regarding      accepting or refusing medical treatment;       Whereas it is estimated that only a minority of Americans      have executed advance directives, including those who are      terminally ill or living with life-threatening or life-     limiting illnesses;       Whereas advance directives offer individuals the      opportunity to discuss with loved ones in advance of a health      care crisis and decide what measures would be appropriate for      them when it comes to end-of-life care;       Whereas, the preparation of an advance directive would      advise family members, health care providers, and other      persons as to how an individual would want to be treated with      respect to health care;       Whereas, to avoid any legal or medical confusion due to the      emotions involved in end-of-life decisions, it is in the best      interest of all Americans that each person over the age of 18      communicate his or her wishes by creating an advance      directive;       Whereas the Conditions of Participation in Medicare and      Medicaid, section 489.102 of title 42, Code of Federal      Regulations (as in effect on the date of enactment of this      resolution), require all participating facilities to provide      information to patients and the public on the topic of      advance directives;       Whereas the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has      recognized that the use of advance directives is tied to      quality health care and has included discussions of advance      directives in the criteria of the Physician Quality Reporting      Initiative;       Whereas establishing National Health Care Decisions Day      will encourage health care facilities and professionals as      well as chaplains, attorneys, and others to participate in a      collective, nationwide effort to provide clear, concise, and      consistent information to the public about health care      decision-making, particularly advance directives; and       Whereas as a result of National Health Care Decisions Day,      recognized on April 16, 2008, more Americans will have      conversations about their health care decisions, more      Americans will execute advance directives to make their      wishes known, and fewer families and health care providers      will have to struggle with making difficult health care      decisions in the absence of guidance from the patient: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled, That      Congress--       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Health Care      Decisions Day;       (2) supports the goals and ideals of advance care planning      for all adult Americans;       (3) encourages each person in the United States who is over      the age of 18 to prepare an advance directive to assist his      or her loved ones, health care providers, and others as they      honor his or her wishes;       (4) calls upon all members of Congress to execute such      documents and discussions for themselves; and       (5) encourages health care, civic, educational, religious,      and for- and non-profit organizations to encourage      individuals to prepare advance directives to ensure that      their wishes and rights with respect to health care are      protected.                          ____________________
