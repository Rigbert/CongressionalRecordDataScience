 President and Members of the Senate, tomorrow morning the Senate will begin consideration of the nomination of Priscilla Owen to be U.S. circuit court judge for the Fifth Circuit. We will debate the nomination throughout the day tomorrow. I encourage Members who wish to speak on the nomination to come to the Senate during tomorrow's session.  I talked to the Democrat leader about the structure of the debate, and he will accommodate Members who desire to make statements. I encourage Senators to contact cloakrooms if they would like to speak on the nomination. We look forward to the debate on Priscilla Owen, and we hope all of the Members will participate.                          ____________________[Page S5369]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                PROGRAM  Mr. McCONNELL.
