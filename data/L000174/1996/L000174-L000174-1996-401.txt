President, I would strongly urge that the Senate vote as it already has. We have, indeed, voted 65 to 34 in favor of this compact. I would explain that was the vote on the compact before. This is something that involves only the Northeast. It affects dairy only in the Northeast.  It is a compact carefully set up where consumers and farmers work together, where consumers actually have a veto over any price increase. I hope that we would allow the Northeast States to do what their legislatures have joined together to do.  I yield to the Senator from Vermont.
