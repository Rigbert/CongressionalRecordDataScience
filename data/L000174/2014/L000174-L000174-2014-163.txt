Michael Colburn, who is thedirector of the U.S. Marine Band, will retire after nearly 30 years with this history-rich and venerated organization.  We like the Marine Band, of course. My son is a Marine. But it is especially nice because Colonel Colburn is a native Vermonter, and his appreciation for the band, known worldwide as ``The President's Own,'' began decades ago when the then-12-year-old euphonium-playing St. Albans native met a principal in the band while at summer band camp in Vermont.  In 1987, Colonel Colburn joined ``The President's Own'' as a euphonium player and ultimately became the band's director, a post he has held for the last decade. His tenure has taken him around the world and back again. He has played for Presidents and foreign dignitaries, at state dinners and inaugurations and regular performances that thousands have witnessed in Washington at the Marine Barracks during the weekly parades.  I have represented the Green Mountain State of Vermont in this Chamber longer than anyone in the history of our State. So you can imagine my enthusiasm when I see a Vermonter here in Washington and all the more so when I have the opportunity of capturing an image such as this, of Colonel Colburn conducting ``The President's Own'' during the January 2013 inauguration of President Obama. I was standing up on the stand when the President was being inaugurated and took that picture of Colonel Colburn. Of course, the whole world was watching the Colonel and watching the President.  I join with the proud citizens of Vermont and the people of a grateful nation in thanking Colonel Colburn for his service and his many, many memorable performances conducting ``The President's Own,'' following in the footsteps of John Philip Sousa and making his own giant footsteps for others to follow. I wish him the very best as he begins the next chapter of his career as the director of bands at the University of Indianapolis.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an interview with Colonel Colburn published in the Marine Corps Times in February.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Marine Corps Times, Feb. 2, 2014]   `President's Own' Leader Looks Back on Time With Elite Marine Band                           (By Gina Harkins)       When Col. Michael Colburn was a 12-year-old euphonium      player at a summer band camp in Vermont, he was in awe of one      of the instructors there, Lucas Spiros, a principal in the      United States Marine Band.       Colburn said the Marine, a fellow euphonium player, left a      lasting impression.       ``It was really the first time I thought, `Hey, I could do      that for a living,' '' Colburn said. ``From that moment on, I      pursued my musical studies more diligently.''       When Colburn himself joined ``The President's Own'' as a      euphonium player in 1987, he had no idea his career path      would lead to becoming director of the prestigious band. Now      27 years later, he's just months shy of his final performance      with the band. He'll retire from the Marine Corps in July,      and take over as the next director of bands at Butler      University in Indianapolis.       Colburn said he wants young musicians to know that if they      work hard and use their creativity, they can still pursue a      career doing what they love. After all, his perseverance led      him through seven presidential inaugurations, to the former      Soviet Union and to the stage of the ``Late Show with David      Letterman.''       Q. Tell us what has surprised you during your time with      ``The President's Own.''       A. In my early days as a conductor [while a member of the      band], I had an interesting experience at the White House. I      was leading our orchestra and was tapped on the elbow. I      turned around and it was President Bill Clinton. He was very      interested in the piece of music we were playing and had many      questions that I tried to answer while I was conducting the      orchestra. I realized that even though we were providing      background music for a social event, you never know who's      listening very carefully--it could be your commander in      chief.       Q. What's one of the most rewarding things you've done with      the band as a Marine?       A. Back when I was a player in the band, we toured the      former Soviet Union for three weeks. That was really a      memorable experience because it was in the 1990s, when the      Soviet Union was really starting to come apart at the seams.      To spend three weeks traveling the country and getting to      know the people who lived behind the Iron Curtain--who we      really didn't know on a personal level at all--to hear their      stories and learn how much we had in common is something I'll      never forget.       Q. After all these years with the band, is there any one      song that you tend to feel strongly about when you guys play      it?       A. People often ask whether I'm sick of playing ``The Stars      and Stripes Forever.'' But even after these thousands of      performances, we never get tired of it. And there's one      reason for that, and it's the audience's response to it,      especially if they don't know it's coming. The ``oohs and      aahs'' and the cheering make you feel like you're playing it      for the first time.       Q. Most troops do their job without much interaction with      the public. What's it like to carry out your job on a stage?       A. We really do understand that so much of our military      indeed works behind the scenes. They don't have the privilege      of being on a stage and receiving applause. It's especially      during our tour concerts when we play the ``Armed Forces      Medley,'' which includes all the service songs, that we      remember all the men and women serving in uniform who are in      difficult and trying circumstances where no one is offering      applause. In those moments, we feel we are representing all      those troops when performing for the American public.       Q. As you move into academia, what are some of the things      you're going to miss the most about the Marine Corps?       A. A lot of people assume my favorite part of the job is      making music at the White House or meeting politicians and      celebrities. That is thrilling, and I've loved it. But really      the best part has to do with the quality of the people I've      had the chance to work with in ``The President's Own.''      They're some of the finest people I've met. I'm really      excited about the opportunity to make music with students,      and I hope I can bring the very high standards that I have      hopefully developed during my Marine Corps career.                          ____________________
