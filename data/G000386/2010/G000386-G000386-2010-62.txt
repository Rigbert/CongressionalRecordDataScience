 President, I rise to pay tribute to a brave and patriotic son of Iowa who gave his life for his country, CPT David Anthony Wisniewski. He graduated from Woodbury Central High School in Moville, IA, before attending the Air Force Academy. It had been his dream to be an Air Force pilot since visiting Offutt Air Force Base as a young child and he died doing what he loved. By all accounts, David Wisniewski was a remarkable man and his numerous accomplishments include the saving of many lives during his several tours of duty in support of the global war on terrorism. In reference to the reason for his service, I understand that he would end letters to his parents with the reminder that, ``I do this so you can sleep safe at night.'' That is an excellent reminder for all of us to never take for granted the tremendous cost of our freedom. I find that words fail me in trying to describe the debt of gratitude we owe to the courageous and selfless Americans like Captain Wisniewski. We can never begin to repay the debt, but we can honor it by honoring David's memory and by fully appreciating our way of life and the sacrifices made to preserve it. Of course, his loss will be felt very deeply by his parents, Chet and Beverly Wisniewski, and all his family and friends. My prayers go out to them in this difficult time. They are no doubt very proud of their son, and all Iowans can be proud to call him one of our own.                          ____________________
