. 1720, the Government-Sponsored Enterprise Privatization Act of 1996. In particular, I am pleased that H.R. 1720 includes the privatization of the Student Loan Marketing Association, or Sallie Mae.  Sallie Mae has fulfilled the mission of its Federal charter. However, as a for-profit, stockholder owned company, Sallie Mae wishes to continue to operate without the support of U.S. taxpayers and without restrictions from the U.S. Government. Sallie Mae's interest in privatization clearly shows that it remains committed to continuing its strong record in providing student loan servicing for hundreds of thousands of Americans.  H.R. 1720 is an excellent example of how a properly managed Government program can use Federal resources to serve the American public and successfully make the transition to private business without Government assistance.  Mr. McKEON. Madam Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
