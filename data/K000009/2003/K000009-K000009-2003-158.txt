Speaker, on March 17, 1953, the Maumee, Ohio Kiwanis Club was chartered. This year, the organization proudly celebrates its fiftieth anniversary. Its members through the years have fostered its growth, and ``have demonstrated that service, hard work, and good fellowship bring individual satisfaction'' according to its guide.  An integral part of Maumee's fabric, the Kiwanians have contributed much to the community in the club's half-century. Many students have received scholarships that have enabled them to further their higher education. Other young people have been able to participate in sports because of the Kiwanis Club's gifts and team sponsorships. Still more youth have had the opportunity to attend summer camp and recreational activities thanks to the Maumee Kiwanis. Senior citizens, too, have been helped by Kiwanis' donations to the Maumee Senior Center. The community at large has also benefited from Kiwanis civic offerings such as park maintenance and purchases to restore buildings of the Maumee Historical Society.  The Maumee Kiwanis Club is an able embodiment of the international organization's motto, ``We Build.'' Through its efforts, all of the residents of Maumee but especially its children, have been built up and strengthened. Truly, Maumee Kiwanians have proudly upheld its theme: ``Serving the children of the world.'' I am very pleased to recognize the achievements of the Maumee Kiwanis Club and congratulate its members past and present on 50 years of service as we look forward to 50 more. Onward.                          ____________________
