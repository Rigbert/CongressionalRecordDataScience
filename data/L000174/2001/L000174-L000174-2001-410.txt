Last month, just 6 days before Timothy McVeigh was to be executed, we learned that the FBI had withheld thousands of pages of documents from McVeigh's defense team. The execution was then postponed until June 11 to give McVeigh and his lawyers time to review the evidence that should have been provided to them before the trial began.  The bombing of the Oklahoma City Federal Building 6 years ago left 168 people dead and hundreds more injured.  The Federal Government spent millions investigating and prosecuting McVeigh, and millions more on his defense. The prosecution and the courts bent over backwards to ensure that he got a fair trial--one in whose outcome all Americans would have confidence. A member of the prosecution team once called McVeigh's trial ``a shining example . . . of how the criminal justice system should work.''  I have great respect for the dedicated team of prosecutors and law enforcement agents who worked on the Oklahoma City bombing case. I honor their commitment and I commend their accomplishments. But I agree with the trial judge that the FBI's belated discovery of thousands of pages of documents that were not turned over to the defense was ``shocking.'' And I believe that this shocking incident holds some lessons for us about our criminal justice system.  First, something we all know, even if we do not want to admit: Mistakes happen. Even in the highest of high profile cases, where the world is watching every step of the way, and even when the government devotes its most talented personnel and spares no expense, you cannot eliminate the possibility of human error or, as appears to be the case here, an unreliable computer system.  That should tell us something about other less infamous cases. The average case, even the average death penalty case, does not get the benefit of intense media scrutiny, and is not litigated by the best lawyers in the land. In the average death penalty case in Alabama, for example, the defense does not get millions of public dollars. Sometimes, defense lawyers are paid less than the minimum wage for defending a man's life. Too often, in the average death penalty case, corners are cut.  We saw what comes of corner cutting last month, when Jeffrey Pierce was released from prison in Oklahoma. He served 15 years of a 65-year sentence for a rape he did not commit, because a police chemist claimed his hair was ``microscopically consistent'' with hair found at the crime scene. Turns out it was someone else's hair. Whoops: Mistakes happen.  The second lesson to be learned from the McVeigh case is this: Process matters. The new documents that the FBI discovered may have no bearing on McVeigh's guilt or sentence, but that does not excuse the FBI's initial oversight in failing to produce them.  The right to a fair trial is not some arcane legal technicality. It is the bedrock constitutional guarantee that protects us all against wrongful convictions. The fair trial violation in Jeffrey Pierce's case did have a bearing on his guilt or innocence, and cost an innocent man 15 years of his life.  Finally, the McVeigh case reminds us that however much we may long for finality and closure in criminal cases, our first duty must always be to the truth. While I am dismayed by the FBI's failure to produce evidence 6 years ago, I would be far more troubled if it had tried to cover up its mistake. It appears that the FBI and the Department of Justice acted responsibly under the circumstances, by turning over the materials in an orderly manner and giving McVeigh time to consider his response. The Government's willingness to acknowledge its mistake and uphold the rule of law was proper and commendable.  It also stands in sharp contrast to the actions of certain State and local authorities. The sad truth is that in America in the 21st Century, with the most sophisticated law enforcement and truth-detection technologies that the world has ever seen, there are still some law enforcers who would rather keep out critical evidence, and hide the system's potential mistakes from the public, than make sure of the truth. There are still people playing ``tough on crime'' politics with people's lives, at the expense of truth and justice.  A prosecutor's duty is to the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. That duty does not end just because the defendant has been convicted. As Attorney General Ashcroft said in announcing the postponement of McVeigh's execution: ``If any questions or doubts remain about this case, it would cast a permanent cloud over justice, diminishing its value and questioning its integrity.''  One cannot think of the Oklahoma bombing case without thinking of the hundreds of victims whose lives that bomb shattered. We as a society cannot give the families back their loved ones, but we can and should give them closure. As the Attorney General acknowledged, you cannot have real closure without a fair and complete legal process that ensures that all of the evidence has been properly examined.  We cannot achieve infallibility in our criminal justice system, and we cannot spend millions of dollars on every trial. No one suggests that we should. But if we want real justice for those defendants, like Jeffrey Pierce, who happen to be innocent, and real closure for victims of violent crime, we must ensure that we as a society do not cut corners in the administration of criminal justice. That requires, at a minimum, that we provide competent counsel to capital defendants and make DNA testing available in all cases where it could demonstrate the defendant's innocence.  Process matters, for victims and defendants alike, and I hope that we will take real action in this Congress to pass the Innocence Protection Act and stop cutting the corners.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a recent Wall Street Journal article discussing the growing support for stronger protections against wrongful executions.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Despite McVeigh Case, Curbs on Executions Are Gaining Support                           (By John Harwood)       Washington.--Americans last year elected an enthusiastic      proponent of capital punishment to the White House. And      they're applauding the resumption of federal executions next      month, when mass murderer Timothy McVeigh is scheduled to die      by lethal injection.       Yet, paradoxically, the dawn of George W. Bush's presidency      is bringing a swing in the pendulum away from executions in      America. Though most Americans continue to back capital      punishment, support has been dropping in recent years in      tandem with declining rates of violent crime. Advances in DNA      testing and scandals involving the prosecution of major      offenses have underscored the fallibility of evidence in      capital cases.       One state, Illinois, has placed a moratorium on the death      penalty. Others, including Arkansas and North Carolina, have      indirectly curbed its application by beefing up standards or      taxpayer funds for the representation of indigent defendants.      The number of people annually sentenced to death in the U.S.      has fallen in three of the last four years for which      statistics are available, to 272, in 1999, since peaking at      319 in 1994 and 1995.       Just last week, the Texas House voted to create the state's      first standards for court-appointed lawyers. The Texas Senate      had already passed similar legislation. The Supreme Court      this fall is scheduled to revisit whether to bar the      execution of mentally retarded inmates. In the Republican-     controlled Congress, support is building for stronger      protections against the execution of defendants who may be      innocent.                           shift in oklahoma       The pendulum swing is occurring even in Oklahoma City,      where Mr. McVeigh bombed the Alfred P. Murrah Federal      Building six years ago, killing 168 people. There is early      evidence that Oklahoma convicts are receiving fewer death      sentences in the wake of the     state's decision to improve legal counsel for poor defendants      and expand access to DNA testing. Recent allegations of      misleading testimony by an Oklahoma police chemist who served      as a frequent prosecution witness, as well as the FBI's      mishandling of records in the McVeigh case, are only adding      to pressure for better safeguards.       ``The politics of the death penalty are clearly changing .      . . because of the blunders of the system,'' says Oklahoma      Gov. Frank Keating. Though he staunchly supports capital      punishment, the conservative Republican says he favors      establishing a higher standard of proof in capital cases,      even if that makes death sentences more difficult to obtain.       Just five years ago, such a change was unthinkable. But it      reflects a broader reconsideration taking place across the      spectrum of criminal-justice issues.       Since crime rates began to soar in the 1960s, voters and      politicians have responded with an increasing array of get-     tough measures, from more-aggressive police practices to      longer sentences to sterner jails. But now, questions about      the wisdom of America's get-tough approach are coming from      state officials straining to finance the prison boom, leaders      of poor neighborhoods depleted by the incarceration of rising      numbers of drug offenders and criminologists concerned about      the long-term effect of inmates of harsher jail practices.       ``Maybe we have gone too far,'' says U.S. Rep. Ray LaHood,      a member of the GOP leadership on Capitol Hill, whose      downstate Illinois district includes a federal prison. He is      co-sponsoring the Innocence Protection Act, which would      encourage states to provide capital defendants with      ``competent counsel'' and death-row convicts with access to      DNA testing.       Mr. LaHood says federal judges--both Republicans and      Democrats--are urging him to ease stiff ``mandatory-minimum''      drug-sentencing laws and the 1987 U.S. sentencing guidelines      that took away most discretion from judges. One of those      judges, Michael Mihm of Peoria, Ill., a Ronald Reagan      appointee, says that with experience on the bench, he has      concluded that some mandatory minimums are excessive. At      sentencing time, ``I am saying, `All right . . . could we      accomplish all of the legitimate concerns of the society with      10 years rather than 20, with 10 years rather than 30?' ''       ``We're filling up our prisons,'' Mr. LaHood adds. More      than 1.9 million people reside in the nation's prisons and      jails. ``When people think about the number of prisons,'' the      congressman says, ``they really wonder if this is what we      should be doing.''                          looking at minimums       President Bush himself has raised similar questions about      prison policy. ``Long minimum sentences may not be the best      way to occupy jail space and/or heal people from their      disease,'' he told a CNN interviewer just before taking      office in January. ``And I'm willing to look at that.'' The      administration is expected to propose sentencing changes      later this year.       On capital punishment, the shift has occurred in spite of      Mr. Bush, not because of him. In Texas, he presided over 152      executions, more than any other U.S. governor in the last      quarter-century. He said earlier this month that the one-     month delay in Mr. McVeigh's execution is ``an example of the      system being fair,'' as he has long maintained.       But that hasn't stopped the development of an unusual      community of interest across the political spectrum as debate      has shifted from whether capital punishment should exist to      how it is applied in practice. Opponents want stronger      safeguards because it will mean fewer executions. Supporters      will tolerate fewer executions as a means of stemming the      erosion of public confidence in the death penalty. The result      is an emerging consensus resembling a goal former President      Bill Clinton once articulated concerning abortion, which he      said should be ``safe, legal and rare.''       It isn't the first time that post-World War II America has      reconsidered capital punishment. Before public attention      focused on the rising crime rates of the 1960s, and amid that      decade's optimism about liberal social goals, support for      capital punishment dropped below 50%, notes Pew Center      public-opinion analyst Andrew Kohut. The supreme Court halted      executions across the country in 1972, declaring the death      penalty's application arbitrary and capricious.       But that was followed by years of steadily increasing      support for capital punishment, as crime levels rose. In the      1970s, state legislatures scrambled to pass new death-penalty      statutes designed to meet the Supreme Court's constitutional      objections. Today, capital punishment is legal in 38 states.      In 1977, Utah became the first state to resume executions      after the high-court ruling, and 30 others have followed      suit.       In the late 1980s, moderate Democratic strategists said      fielding a presidential nominee who supported the death      penalty was crucial to the party's hopes of recapturing the      White House after three consecutive Republican victories.      They found such a candidate in then-Arkansas Gov. Clinton,      who left the campaign trail at one point in 1992 specifically      to preside over the execution of murderer Ricky Ray Rector.       Public support for the death penalty crested at 80% in      1994, following another decade of rising violent-crime rates.      Legislation passed that year by a Democratic-controlled      Congress and signed by Mr. Clinton made some 60 additional      categories of crime, such as major narcotics trafficking,      subject to the federal death penalty. Two years later, an      antiterrorism bill signed by Mr. Clinton placed new      limitations on federal appeals by death-row inmates, while      the new GOP majority in Congress cut federal funding that      aided defense lawyers in capital cases in many states.                          Themes of the 1990s       But the tide of opinion turned under the influence of two      of the most powerful themes running through American society      in the late 1990s. One was improving social trends, including      a steady drop in rates of murder, rape and assault. Fear of      violent crime likewise fell. The other was technological      advancement, which in the forensic field led to DNA evidence      being used to exonerate some long-serving inmates, including      some on death row.       In 1996, two death-row prisoners in Illinois were freed      after an investigation by journalism students at Northwestern      University led to DNA testing that exonerated the inmates. A      year later, the American Bar Association called for a      national moratorium on the imposition of the death penalty.       Increasing opposition to capital punishment among religious      leaders helped fuel the shift in opinion. Catholic bishops      have called for the abolition of capital punishment as part      of the ``ethic of life'' that leads to their opposition to      abortion. In early 1999, then-Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan      commuted the death sentence of one inmate after receiving a      personal plea from the Pope. Last year, televangelist Pat      Robertson, a former-Republican presidential candidate, called      for a moratorium on capital punishment, after earlier      unsuccessfully lobbying Mr. Bush to spare the life of      convicted Texas murderer Karla Faye Tucker.       Messages in popular culture, including films such as ``The      Green Mile'' and ``Dead Man Walking,'' also helped soften      attitudes by depicting the humanity of prisoners facing      execution. Sixteen months ago, opponents of capital      punishment claimed a striking breakthrough when Republican      Gov. George Ryan of Illinois imposed a death-penalty      moratorium in the sate amid mounting evidence of botched      cases.       In Congress, legislation that would create financial      incentives for states to expand access to DNA testing and set      standards for legal representation of defendants in capital      cases is gathering support in both parties. In the Senate,      its 19 co-sponsors include four Republicans and last year's      Democratic vice presidential candidate, Joseph Lieberman, who      declined to back the bill a year earlier. Its 191 co-sponsors      in the House include several members of the GOP's      conservative wing.       GOP Rep. Mark Souder of Indiana, one of the co-sponsors,      says, ``I support he death penalty, [but] I'm a little      uncomfortable. We want to be more sure.''       There's no sign of White House support for such      legislation, which if implemented could have the effect of      significantly decreasing the number of death sentences handed      down. But one Bush adviser says the president ``would      probably have to sign'' a death-penalty-reform bill if it      reached his desk.       Moderate GOP lawmaker Sherwood Boehlert of New York says      Mr. Bush should affirmatively embrace the cause to ``soften''      his image after his narrow presidential-election victory.      Among other things, such a move could help tamp down      hostility among black voters, who are far more inclined to      oppose the death penalty than are whites. Though African-     Americans make up just 12% of the nation's population, they      represent 43% of American inmates now on death row.       States aren't waiting for action from Washington. Florida      this year became the 15th state to bar the execution of      mentally retarded inmates, in legislation now awaiting the      promised signature of Gov. Jeb Bush, the president's brother.      Gov. Jim Gilmore of Virginia, whom Mr. Bush made chairman of      the Republican National Committee earlier this year, signed a      statute to improve access to DNA testing. In Texas, Mr.      Bush's gubernatorial successor has also signed DNA      legislation, while lawmakers in Austin move forward on      improvements in the state's indigent-defense system.       Perhaps most striking, neighboring Oklahoma, the focus of      national attention because of the McVeigh execution plans,      began taking similar steps four years ago. A state board      controlled by Gov. Keating hired Jim Bednar to run the state      agency that provides lawyers for poor defendants. Mr. Bednar      had formerly sought the death penalty as a state      prosecutor and presided over its imposition as a judge.       In the past, if a lawyer assigned to represent an indigent      defendant ``had vital signs, he was determined to be      competent,'' says Mr. Bednar. ``In theory I'm not opposed to      the death penalty. But it's the practice we need to look at.      The system is flawed.''       He began to overhaul the indigent-defense agency by winning      funding increases to hire better-quality lawyers. The agency      is now sending the message that attorneys for poor inmates      ``are really going to show up and do our job,'' Mr. Bednar      says.       Because of stiffer opposition, prosecutors are becoming      ``more hesitant to seek the death penalty,'' he adds. In      fiscal year 1998, as Mr. Bednar was beginning to reorganize      his agency, prosecutors in the area served by his Norman      office, which covers roughly the western half of the state,      sought death sentences in 36 cases. They obtained the      punishment in four cases. Last year, prosecutors     sought 26 death sentences and obtained only one.       Doubts about the validity of some prosecution evidence--     sown most recently by the scandal involving alleged flaws in      the work of Oklahoma City police chemist Joyce Gilchrist--may      have also made juries more reluctant to impose the death      penalty in the state. Oklahoma Attorney General Drew      Edmondson, whose office is reviewing the cases of all 121      death-row inmates in the state to see if additional DNA      testing is called for, has declined to set an execution date      for any of the 12 against whom Ms. Gilchrist had testified.      Ms. Gilchrist, who was suspended by the Oklahoma City police      department in March and now faces a state investigation of      her work, said in an interview, ``I stand by my testimony.''       Republican Gov. Keating says further steps are needed. He      proposes a higher standard of proof--``moral certainty'' of      guilt--for capital cases, instead of the families absence-of-     reasonable-doubt standard used in criminal trials. ``The      people now expect moral certainty,'' says Mr. Keating. ``No      system can survive if it's fallible.''                          ____________________
