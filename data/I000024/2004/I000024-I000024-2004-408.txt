In the meantime, I will make a statement that I would otherwise be making after the cloture vote. I am hoping the cloture vote will be successful and we can move right on to this very significant vote. In the meantime, I am inclined to want to share a few things that are in this bill, which I would be glad to do at this time, and then yield to any Senator who comes in who may want to be heard.  I ask the Chair to go ahead and recognize the Senator from Massachusetts now, if he wishes to be recognized. Mine is going to be a rather long statement. We will go ahead and move to that when the Senator from Massachusetts is through.                Congratulating the New England Patriots
