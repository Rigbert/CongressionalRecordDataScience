 Chairman, a few moments ago my friend, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Houghton], talked about the need of people to work together, and he is right. If this country is going to succeed, we all need to work together. But that is not what is happening in America today. The fault for that is not the working people, it is not the unions, but it is to a very large degree corporate America. It is not working together when companies replace striking workers with permanent replacement workers. And that is happening. That is not working together.  It is not working together when CEO's of large corporations pay themselves now 15 times more than what the workers are earning and give themselves huge bonuses at the same time as they cut back on wages and health benefits for their workers. Corporate profits are soaring. Wages, incomes are in decline. That is not working together.  It is not working together when corporate America says to its workers: Thank you for 30 years of your effort but we are taking the company to Mexico or China because we can get workers there for 20 cents an hour or 50 cents an hour. That is not working together. That is greed.  It is not working together when companies get in new automation and then throw their workers out on the street, as large corporations are doing by the millions all over America, rather than developing a plan to rehire and retrain their workers. It is not working together when corporate America fights those of us who are trying to raise the minimum wage from the starvation level of $4.25 an hour. The only effective way that workers have to protect their interests is to join a union. This law would help weaken unions. It is bad. Let us defeat it.
