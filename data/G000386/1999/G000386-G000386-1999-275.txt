 President, on the Africa trade bill, which is now before the Senate, we are in a parliamentary position in which all the amendments offered have been offered by the Republican side. Such a position had to be taken by the majority leader because of failures to get time agreements and commitments from the other side, meaning the Democrat side, on a limitation on amendments and time agreements on those amendments so we could bring this bill to a vote.  I hope our Democrat friends will heed the necessity of this legislation from President Clinton's State of the Union Address that this was one of the most important goals of his administration. Since the Republican majority in the Congress is often criticized by the President for not working closely with the President--and I think those charges by the President of the United States are overblown most times, but those charges are still made. So in the present environment in which one of the President's prime pieces of legislation is before the Senate, with a determination by our majority leader to help get this part of the President's program into law, I would think the Democrat minority would be embarrassed that they are taking actions that make it difficult to get one of the President's programs through this Congress for the President's signature.  I hope, as one Senator--not speaking for the majority leader, just speaking for myself--they will reach agreement on these very important amendments so we can bring this bill to finality and get it sent to the President, not because it is one of the President's major goals, not that it shows the President's charges against the Republican majority are many times unfounded, not for any of those reasons, as legitimate as that might be, but because the substance of this legislation is very important for the economy of the United States and the economy of the countries that it applies to--because free trade strengthens economies, free and fair trade creates jobs, not only in the United States, but also economies that practice free trade anywhere around the world are stronger economies because of it. That is the goal we seek in this legislation.  We have heard we have a lot to fear from free trade. In the last few months, we have heard from many quarters that free trade is harmful because it destroys jobs. We have heard free trade is not fair trade because it causes investments to shift overseas. We have heard that the Africa trade bill will do both of these things, as well as cause illegal transshipment that we cannot do anything about.  When you look at the facts, none of these three arguments that are used against this piece of legislation has any merit. First, let's look at the claim that free trade destroys jobs. The 50-year history of the multilateral trade negotiations, first under the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade, and now under the World Trade Organization, called WTO for short, shows the enormous positive effect on the world economy of liberalizing trade by reducing tariffs and getting rid of nontariff trade barriers.  We have had eight series, or rounds as they are called, of multilateral trade negotiations since GATT first started in 1947. We are about to launch a new round, the ninth one, at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle in about 5 weeks.  During the first round, the Geneva Round it was called, in 1947, we negotiated 45,000 tariff concessions affecting one-fifth of world trade.  In the sixth round, which was called the Kennedy Round, we slashed custom duties on average of 35 percent.  During the last round, the Uruguay Round, starting in the middle 1980s, ending in 1993, we reduced or eliminated many nontariff trade barriers.  The results of this trade liberalization have been nothing short of astounding--creating jobs, expanding the world economic pie, creating better economies in various countries around the world, enhancing political opportunities and, most importantly, political stability. The expansion of free trade that has followed this 50-year period of trade liberalization has spurred one of the greatest bursts of wealth creation the world has ever seen.  In 1947, when we started postwar trade liberalization, the total value of world exports was about $50 billion. Today, the total value of world exports is $7 trillion, more than 3\1/2\ times the total budget of the United States.  Free trade has enriched every American family. According to the President's own 1998 economic report, the added economic benefit to each American through expanded trade is $1,000 per year or $4,000 per year for a family of four, as we measure families in America. This is equivalent to an annual $4,000 per family tax cut. Where can one get a $4,000 tax cut these days? Even the tax cuts now being debated in the Congress do not come anywhere close to this amount of money to enhance family income and disposable income.  The facts that show the benefits of free trade seem to be so compelling that in explaining them, I don't know where to begin.  Let me mention a recent example that comes from NAFTA. According to a September 1998 report published by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, approximately 191,000 jobs were certified, between January 1, 1949, and August 12, 1998, as potentially suffering NAFTA-related loss--affecting 191,000 workers. That is on the negative side. We have always said that free trade will cause some job dislocation. That is why we have programs such as trade adjustment assistance--to ease the transition that is sometimes necessary when we have open markets.  On the positive side, there has been much more gain. Let's go back to that Congressional Research Service study I cited. The number, 191,000 workers affected negatively by NAFTA over 4 years, represents less than the number of jobs created in any single month in 1997. In contrast, then, on the positive side, more than 1 million new jobs were created from new exports to Mexico and Canada after NAFTA was enacted into law--more than 1 million new jobs.  Next let's look at the claim that is made by opponents of this legislation or free trade generally that it causes investment to shift overseas. That claim, too, has little or no merit. Section 512 of the NAFTA Implementation Act required the President to provide a comprehensive assessment of the operation and effects of NAFTA to Congress. The President's report shows that the amount of new United States investment in Mexico is very low. Again, the specific facts are compelling. In 1997, direct United States investment in Mexico was $5.9 billion compared to United States domestic investment in plant and equipment of $864.9 billion. In other words, United States investment in Mexico was less than 1 percent of all United States domestic investment in plant and equipment in 1997. So much for that giant sucking sound we were supposed to have heard continuously from south of our border.  Free trade has been so good for our economy. If all these predictions about economic disaster haven't come true when we have liberalized trade in the past, it is clear we shouldn't fear tearing down barriers around the world, as we have for the last 50 years with the good results we have for the 50 years, without the expectation that those beneficial impacts would continue. We should, then, embrace such an opportunity.  Let me get specifically to the Africa trade bill. The fear that the Africa trade bill will cause a huge influx of illegal textile transshipments from Asia, as has been stated on the floor of the Senate, just is not true. I cite the International Trade Commission study, our own Government. It looked at the transshipment issue. Here is what our International Trade Commission found:  Assuming we will get illegal transshipments in a worst case scenario, the ITC study shows that U.S. apparel shipments would drop by one-tenth of 1 percent and result in the loss of less than 700 jobs. Again, to put this number in perspective, the U.S. economy has created about 200,000 jobs each month this year.  Remember, the ITC study guesstimate of 700 jobs is based on a worst case scenario. It is highly unlikely, then, that sub-Saharan Africa will see this level of export growth in the near term. They don't have the infrastructure. They don't have the trained workforce. They don't have good transportation. And the Africa bill has strong anti-transshipment provisions.  One might say, then, why the big deal about the Africa trade bill? Because trade is better than foreign aid and because, when you want to build up the economies of the developing nations, you start someplace. This is how we can best help them to help themselves.  Participating countries will have to commit to full cooperation with the United States to address and take any necessary action to prevent transshipment. The spirit of this legislation is that there not be transshipment. In addition, the U.S. Customs Service has effective procedures to thwart illegal transshipments, as Customs jump teams have proven to be successful in doing in both Hong Kong and Macao. And there are many other provisions aimed at preventing transshipments. So free trade works. Free trade creates jobs and prosperity in the United States, adding $4,000 every year in economic benefits to each American family at home. Free trade keeps the peace by building interdependence among nations, and by bringing political stability to nations that heretofore have relied upon dictators and relied upon a government-controlled economy. Finally, free trade will help Africa break the shackles of poverty by bringing economic freedom to the most economically unfree and also the poorest regions in the world. So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important piece of legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment, No. 2335, be temporarily laid aside in order for Senator Reid of Nevada to offer an amendment. I further ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of that amendment, amendment No. 2335 become the pending business.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so ordered.                           Amendment No. 2336 (Purpose: To amend the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal      Year 1998 with respect to export controls on high performance                                computers)
