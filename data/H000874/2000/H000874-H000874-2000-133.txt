I am not going to oppose the amendment for the same reason that the gentleman mentioned. I have discussed with the gentleman from Vermont, but not the gentleman from Ohio yet. But I would hope that the amendment is not necessary because I believe that the IRS is following the law. I understand that that is the purpose of the amendment, however, and we are not going to oppose it.
