  If the House bill were to be successful--and we are going to do everything in our ability to make sure it is not successful--and Medicaid were severely cut back, what do my colleagues think will eventually happen in the near future--not eventually, but in the short term, to programs like Medicare and Social Security? Would it be a reasonable assumption that this is the beginning of the effort on the part of the Koch brothers and Republicans in the Congress to begin dismantling virtually every Federal program that helps working people? Is it not true that the House Budget Committee has already passed legislation that would move toward voucherizing Medicare and privatizing it?
