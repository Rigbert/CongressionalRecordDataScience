President, over the course of the Senate's consideration of the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown, we have heard many compelling statements in opposition. Significantly, we have heard from both Senators from California in opposition. Their opposition, like mine, is based on Justice Brown's record.  Through bipartisan action, the Senate has deterred the misguided bid by some on the other side of the aisle for one-party rule by means of their so-called nuclear option. Thanks to the hard work of a bipartisan group of 14 Senators, we have, for now, preserved the system of checks and balances. I mention this because as we vote on the nomination of Janice Rogers Brown, I urge all Senators to take seriously the Senate's constitutionally mandated role in determining who is going to serve lifetime appointments in the Federal judiciary.  I wish all Senators, Republicans and Democrats alike, would take these matters seriously and vote their consciences and evaluate with clear eyes the fitness of this woman for this lifetime appointment. After all, some of my Republican colleagues have admitted to me privately how they would like to vote. They know that Justice Brown is a consummate judicial activist whose record shows she favors rolling back the clock 100 years on workers' and consumer rights and consistently has taken the side of corporations against average Americans.  Her record shows she does not believe in clean air and clean water protections for Americans and their communities. She does not believe in laws providing affordable housing, and she would, if she could, wipe out zoning laws that protect homeowners. Her record shows she takes an extremely narrow view of protections against sexual harassment, race discrimination, employment discrimination, and age discrimination. In fact, she has such a hostility toward such programs as Social Security that she has argued that Social Security is unconstitutional. She has said that ``[t]oday's senior citizens blithely cannibalize their grandchildren . . . ''  Why is this important? Because she would be on a court that would handle every one of these issues, and it would mean that as a judicial activist, she would rule entirely different in the cases that court decides.  We have heard a lot about her life story. If this were a vote on a Senate resolution commemorating her life story, I am sure the entire Senate would gladly support it. Instead, this is a vote about the lives of multiple millions of other Americans whose lives would be affected by this nominee's ideological activist penchants. This is, after all, a lifetime appointment on a Federal circuit court on which her ideology would be especially harmful and destructive to the people. That is why she has earned opposition of African-American leaders, law professors, and newspapers around the country. In fact, the list of African-American organizations and individuals opposing Justice Brown's nomination is one of the most troubling indications that this is another divisive, ideologically driven nomination. All 39 members of the Congressional Black Caucus oppose her nomination. The Nation's oldest and largest association of predominantly African-American lawyers and judges, the National Bar Association, and its state counterpart, the California Association of Black Lawyers, both oppose this nomination. The foremost national civil rights organization, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, opposes it.  The women of Delta Sigma Theta oppose this nomination.  I ask unanimous consent that letters detailing opposition, as well as a list of such letters, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Letters of Opposition to the Nomination of Janice Rogers Brown to the                      D.C.

Re Justice Janice Rogers Brown Nominee to the U.S. Court of          Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.     Senate Judiciary Committee,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: The National Bar Association, this nation's      oldest and largest Association of predominantly African      American lawyers and judges, deems that Justice Rogers Brown      is unfit to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals of the      District of Columbia.       Justice Brown has served the California Supreme Court for      seven years, providing a substantial body of work for      analysis by critics and supporters alike. If appointed, Brown      would follow Justice Judith Rogers, a President Clinton      appointee, to become the second African American woman judge      on the D.C. Circuit Court. Many people consider this      appointment as preliminary grooming for a future nomination      to the U.S. Supreme Court. This consideration is not without      merit: Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas, and Ruth      Ginsberg all previously served on the prestigious D.C.      Circuit Court.       The National Bar Association must consider, among other      things, whether a judicial nominee will be a responsible      voice upon which all people, particularly people in the      traditionally underserved communities, for instance African      Americans, other ethnic minorities and women, can depend when      fundamental legal issues of race, ethnicity, or gender may      profoundly impact the designated population in the areas of      advancement in business, education, civil rights, and the      judicial arenas arise.       A rigorous review of several of Justice Brown's opinions in      the California Supreme Court undertaken by the California      Association of Black Lawyers (copy attached), an affiliate of      the National Bar Association, indicates a most disturbing      view and what may be in store for minorities under her      stewardship on the bench. In for instance Hi-Voltage Wire      Works, Inc. v. City of San Jose, 24 Cal 4th 537 (2000),      Justice Brown wrote the majority opinion striking down a San      Jose ordinance that required the City of San Jose to solicit      bids from companies owned by minority and women      subcontractors. She reasoned that the plan to seek minority      subcontractors violated Proposition 209, which is the 1996      voter-adopted state constitutional amendment that banned      racial preferences. She further concluded that instead of      affirmative action, ``equality of individual opportunity is      what the constitution demands.''       In view thereof, the National Bar Association strongly      urges and recommends that the Senate Judiciary Committee      reject the nomination of Justice Janice Rogers Brown to the      U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.           Sincerely,                                             Clyde E. Bailey, Sr.,     President.                                  ____                                         California Association of                                                Black Lawyers,                                Mill Valley, CA, October 17, 2003.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Hatch and Leahy: On behalf of the California      Association of Black Lawyers (``CABL''), I write to express      our strong opposition to the nomination of Janice Rogers      Brown to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.       CABL is the only statewide organization of African American      lawyers, judges, professors and law students in the State of      California. We are an affiliate of the National Bar      Association (the ``NBA'') and we join the National Bar      Association in its opposition to Justice Brown. (The NBA      recently forwarded CABL's Official Position Paper opposing      Justice Brown's nomination to you. I am enclosing a copy, for      your easy reference.)       As California lawyers, we are familiar with Justice Brown      and her record on the California Supreme Court. We are deeply      concerned about her extremist judicial philosophy, that she      has manifested in numerous opinions over the years. It is      clear to us that she misuses precedent and challenges      precedent, in order to achieve the result she desires. A      prime example is her opinion in Hi-Voltage Wire Works, Inc.      v. City of San Jose, the California's Supreme Court's first      application of Proposition 209. According to Chief Justice      Ronald George, who refused to join her opinion, Justice Brown      seriously distorted the history of civil rights jurisprudence      and concluded outright that the U.S. Supreme Court decisions      supporting affirmative action were wrongly decided.       California has strong civil rights statutes, and many of us      litigate pursuant to these statutes. Yet Justice Brown has      repeatedly deviated from precedent in order to narrowly      interpret these statutes and render them virtually      inaccessible to victims of discrimination.       We urge you to undertake an extremely careful review of      Justice Brown and her record. We hope that you will conclude,      as we have done, that she is simply not within the mainstream      of legal thought. She is therefore not suited for appointment      to the second most important court in our nation, the D.C.      Circuit.           Respectfully yours,                                               Gillian G.M. Small,                                                        President.
