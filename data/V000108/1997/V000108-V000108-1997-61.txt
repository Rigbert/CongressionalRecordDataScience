Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate a long-time friend of mine, Gary City Councilman Cleo Wesson, on his receipt of the Indiana Association of Cities and Towns [IACT], 1997 Meritorious Service Award. Cleo will receive this honor tomorrow, September 24, at the IACT annual conference, which is being held at the Fort Wayne Hilton in Fort Wayne, IN.  The Meritorious Service Award is presented by AICT to Indiana public figures who have devoted 40 years or more of noteworthy service to their communities. Cleo Wesson, who has displayed outstanding leadership qualities as a Gary City Councilmember for 38 years, has been selected as one of two people in the State of Indiana to receive the Meritorious Service Award, an honor which is in its first year of existence.  Cleo began his distinguished career of service when he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force upon his graduation from Gary Roosevelt High School. After his return from the military, Cleo began his political career when he was elected to the Gary Common Council in 1959. As the representative of Gary's Fifth District, Cleo has served in a variety of roles, including Precinct and Vice Committeeman, and 7-year president of the Common Council. He has served on every council committee, been elected delegate to the State Democratic Convention, and has served as Secretary to the Lake County Democratic Central Committee for a number of years. In recognition of his years of service, Cleo earned the title ``Dean of the Gary Common Council'' on May 16 of this year.  During his tenure as councilman, Cleo has worked tirelessly toward the betterment of the entire City of Gary. The construction of three neighborhood parks in the Fifth District, the effective restructuring of the police department, and the ordinance establishing in house demolition, were all projects conceived of and/or sponsored by Cleo Wesson. It was through the in house demolition ordinance that an unsightly junk yard at 21st and Madison Street was demolished, and in its place the Barbara Leek Wesson Community Center was erected. Other projects Cleo undertook include the relocation of the No. 4 fire station to 25th and Madison Street, the establishment of the Gary Community Mental Health Facility, and the founding of the Marina Committee and the Historical and Cultural Society.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Cleo Wesson on his receipt of the 1997 Meritorious Service Award. His numerous endeavors in the field of public service have left an indelible mark on the city of Gary, as well as Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
