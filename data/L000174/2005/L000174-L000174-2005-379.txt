President, I am proud to join my friend and colleague, Senator Specter, in submitting this bipartisan resolution commemorating the 25th anniversary of the National Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign, which is managed by the National Crime Prevention Council. I applaud all individuals and organizations involved in the Campaign for their efforts to advance the principles and practice of effective crime prevention throughout the United States.  We have all been urged over the years by McGruff the Crime Dog, the Campaign's icon, to ``Take A Bite Out Of Crime'' a simple and effective slogan to help begin to educate and make the public aware of the importance of crime prevention. Through their leadership, the Campaign and McGruff have played vital roles in reducing crime and making our communities safer.  The Campaign was the first public education program on crime prevention in the country. It is designed to stimulate community involvement, generate confidence in comprehensive crime prevention activities and provide a national focus and resource for crime prevention programs nationwide. When it was formally launched in 1979, most Americans viewed crime as inevitable and its prevention as the job of the police. Today, three out of four Americans believe that they can personally take actions to reduce crime and that their neighborhoods and communities can act to prevent crime. A major force behind this shift to a more positive attitude is the National Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign.  Crime prevention is central to maintaining a sound criminal justice system at the national, State, and local levels, and to ensuring safer and more secure communities. Making prevention a priority through the National Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign is a collective effort. This alliance of national, State and Federal organizations works with businesses, civic groups, individuals and law enforcement to generate crime prevention awareness and action throughout the country through a variety of mechanisms.  The National Citizens' Crime Prevention Campaign has inspired and directed millions of citizens to take action, individually and collectively, to reduce crime, drug abuse and the fear of crime. I look forward to another 25 years and beyond of McGruff and the Campaign, under the skilled leadership of its President and CEO, Al Lenhardt, who is the former Sergeant At Arms of the U.S. Senate, continuing to be national leaders in improving the quality of life in every community through crime prevention. I have no doubt that together they will continue to promote individual and collective action, in collaboration with law enforcement and other supporting agencies, to reduce crime and build safer communities throughout the United States.                          ____________________[Pages S8831-S8832]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]   SENATE RESOLUTION 208--COMMEMORATING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE               NATIONAL CITIZENS' CRIME PREVENTION CAMPAIGN
