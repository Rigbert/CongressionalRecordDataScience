 Speaker, we are running out of time, and I want to thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) for joining me this evening.  The bottom line of this discussion is the following, that unless ordinary people, working people, middle-income people, young people, get actively involved in the process and fight and stand up for social justice, what will happen is that the people who have the money, the people who make the campaign contributions, they will continue to call the tune here in the Congress and in the administration.  What will happen is that the policies, whether they are trade policies, health care policies, prescription drug policies, labor policies, environmental policies, whatever, those policies will be heavily influenced by the interests of those people who have the money, and they will work against the interests of the vast majority of the people.  The bottom line of this whole discussion is that we are a great and wealthy Nation. If we all stood together and became actively involved in the political process, we could create a society where every man, woman, and child had a decent standard of living. That is not utopian vision, that is concrete reality. That is what we could do. We could join the rest of the industrialized world and provide health care to every man, woman, and child, including prescription drugs.  We will not do that unless people stand up and be prepared to fight for what is right. I just want to thank the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio) for joining me this evening.                          ____________________
