Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I won't take nearly 1\1/2\ minutes. I just want to support the amendment.  I understand there are portions of the order that are widely accepted and some parts that need to be reworked. I hope the Bureau gets the message and works with all of the interested parties to improve onshore order No. 3.  Mr. Chairman, I am happy to support the amendment.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.
