President, I know the hour is late. The matter is very simple. The Hatch amendment kills the hate crimes legislation. If you want to kill the hate crimes legislation, vote for the Hatch amendment. If you do not want to kill the hate crimes legislation, if you want a chance to vote on something the Senate has voted for time and time again, then vote against the Hatch amendment.  The Attorney General testified at the request of the Republicans. He testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and endorsed the legislation before us. The Hatch amendment--perhaps well-meaning; I assume it is--would, in effect, eviscerate the hate crimes legislation. It would kill the hate crimes legislation.  The question is very simple: Vote for Hatch; you kill the hate crimes legislation. Vote against it, we have a chance to vote for the hate crimes legislation--something the Senate has voted for several times before and something the Attorney General supports based on a hearing we had at the request of the Republicans within the past month.
