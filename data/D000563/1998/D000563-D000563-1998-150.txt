President, it is the usual custom in the Senate as long as I have been here--almost 19 or 20 months now--to dispense with the reading of an amendment. In this case, I did not--first, because the amendment in its entirety is very brief, only one page; and, second, I wanted those who are following this debate to hear each word of the amendment, because in the wording of this amendment I think we have an important decision to make on the floor of the U.S. Senate.  This amendment which I offer reaffirms that the United States should only go to war in accordance with the war powers vested in the Congress by the Constitution. My colleague, who has just joined us on the floor, Senator Byrd of West Virginia, carries a well-worn and tattered version of that Constitution with him. I bet he has it on his person as this moment--and I win my bet--and Senator Byrd refers to it frequently to remind all of us that we, when we took the oath of office to become Members of the U.S. Senate, swore to uphold this Constitution.  The section of the Constitution which my amendment addresses is one which is central to the power of the U.S. Senate and the power of Congress. Article I, section 8, includes in the powers of Congress, the power:       To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal and      make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water.  Most constitutional scholars will know the meaning of the term ``marque and reprisal.'' We have read it many times, but for those of us who need to be refreshed, that is an effort, short of war, where the United States, short of some commitment of major troop forces and the like, would seek to impose its will or stand for its own national security.  The most operative section of Article I, section 8, are the simple words ``To declare War.''  This amendment would prohibit the use of funds appropriated to the Department of Defense for ``offensive military operations,'' except in accordance with Article I, section 8, which specifically gives to Congress, and Congress alone, the power to declare war and take other actions to govern and regulate the Armed Forces.  A similar amendment was offered by Congressman David Skaggs of Colorado and Congressman Tom Campbell of California in a bipartisan fashion. It has passed the House of Representatives. It is part of the Department of Defense appropriations bill, which will be considered in conference with the bill that we are debating.  This amendment that I offer today reaffirms that the Constitution favors the Congress in the decision to go to war, and that Members of Congress have a constitutional responsibility that they cannot ignore with regard to the offensive use of Armed Forces. Why is this necessary? Let me quote from a scholar who has written on this subject extensively. Louis Fisher is a senior specialist in the separation of powers with the Congressional Research Service at the Library of Congress. He wrote in an article entitled ``Sidestepping Congress: Presidents Acting Under the UN and NATO:       Truman in Korea, Bush in Iraq, Clinton in Haiti and      Bosnia--in each instance, a President circumvented Congress      by relying either on the UN or NATO. President Bush also      stitched together a multilateral alliance before turning to      Congress at the eleventh hour to obtain statutory authority.      Each exercise of power built a stronger base for unilateral      Presidential action, no matter how illegal, unconstitutional      and undemocratic. The attitude, increasingly, is not to do      things the right way, in accordance with the Constitution and      our laws, but to do the ``right thing.'' It is an attitude of      autocracy, if not monarchy. How long do we drift in these      currents before discovering that the waters are hazardous for      constitutional government?  On January 12, 1991, the Congress, in addition to authorizing the use of force to drive Saddam Hussein from Kuwait, took an important vote asserting its constitutional responsibilities and insisting that the President follow the wisdom of the framers of our Constitution when considering a question as serious as war. Despite the vocal opposition of the Bush White House, the House of Representatives in which I served voted 302-131 in favor of a resolution that I offered with Congressman Bennett of Florida. You may recall what happened. When Saddam Hussein of Iraq invaded Kuwait, there was fear that he would continue and then invade Saudi Arabia. The United States began positioning forces in Saudi Arabia. At the invitation of the Saudis, we brought in a sufficient force to at least discourage, if not deter, Saddam Hussein.  Over time, it became clear that the force in place was growing and the intention was just not to protect Saudi Arabia, but in fact to remove Iraqi forces from Kuwait. At that moment, the nature of our commitment changed, and at that moment, the congressional responsibility changed, from my point of view. We were no longer in Saudi Arabia just at the invitation of the Saudis to defend; we were preparing a massive military force to, in fact, invade Kuwait and to oust the Iraqis. We knew that that would necessarily involve the loss of life, and many of us in Congress believed that it clearly fit within the four corners of Article I, section 8, that Congress should act and, in fact, we did. There was an extensive debate on the floor of the Senate, as well as the House of Representatives, and ultimately, Congress voted to authorize the use of force by the President--President Bush at the time--in order to push the Iraqis out of Kuwait.  Another important congressional action was a 1994 Senate resolution rejecting the Clinton administration's claim that the United Nations Security Council 940 constituted ``authorization for the deployment of U.S. Armed Forces in Haiti under the Constitution of the United States.'' The Senate passed this resolution by a resounding 99-0 vote. The framers never intended the Armed Forces to be employed by the Executive as a blunt instrument for enforcing U.S. foreign policy without congressional approval. Yet, in the Iraq crisis earlier this year, and in the unstable situation in Kosovo today, that is exactly what we have seen. Absent a reaffirmation by Congress of its proper constitutional war powers, we will certainly see it again. The time for this amendment is now. I will speak to the Kosovo situation toward the close of my opening statement.  Article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution, the so-called war powers clause, vests in Congress this power that I have read. Other clauses of the same article I, section 8 vests in Congress the power to ``define and punish piracies'' and ``offenses against the Law of Nations,'' ``raise and support armies,'' ``to provide and maintain a navy,'' and ``make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces,'' and ``to provide for organizing,'' arming, and disciplining the militia, and ``governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States.''  Very significantly, clause 18 of this section gives Congress the power to ``make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers.'' This clause clearly states that it is Congress that makes the laws for the regulation of the Armed Forces, especially in matters of war.  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution states:       The President shall be commander in chief of the Army and      Navy of the United States, and of the militia of the several      states, when called into the actual service of the United      States.''  That is all the war powers vested in the President by the Constitution. It is instructive for us to look back at thedebate which gave rise to these constitutional provisions.  Comments by the framers of the Constitution clearly indicate their intent in favor of Congress in matters relating to the offensive use of military force.  James Wilson, speaking at the Pennsylvania State Convention on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution, argued that the system of checks and balances built into the Constitution ``will not hurry us into war; it is calculated to guard against it. It will not be in the power of a single man or a single body of men to involve us in such distress; for the important power of declaring war is vested in the legislature at large.''  No one less than Thomas Jefferson explained that he desired Congress to be ``an effectual check to the dog of war.''  James Madison wrote that Congress would have the power to initiate war, though the President could act immediately ``to repel sudden attacks'' without congressional authorization.  Roger Sherman further delineated on the President's war powers: ``The executive should be able to repel and not to commence war.''  Constitutional scholar Louis Henkin of Columbia University wrote this in 1987:       There is no evidence that the framers contemplated any      significant independent role--or authority--for the president      as commander in chief when there was no war. . . . The      president's designation as commander in chief . . . appears      to have implied no substantive authority to use the Armed      Forces, whether for war (unless the United States were      suddenly attacked) or for peacetime purposes, except as      Congress directed.  International law scholar, John Bassett Moore, wrote in 1944:       There can hardly be room for doubt that the framers of the      Constitution, when they vested in Congress the power to      declare war, never imagined that they were leaving it to the      Executive to use the military and naval forces of the United      States all over the world for the purpose of actually      coercing other nations, occupying their territory, and      killing their soldiers and citizens, all according to his own      notions of the fitness of things, as long as he called his      action something other than `war' or persisted in calling it      peace.  The constitutional framework adopted by the framers for the war power is remarkably clear in its basic principles. The authority to initiate war lay with Congress. Other U.S. Presidents have affirmed this interpretation of war powers under the Constitution.  Abraham Lincoln wrote this in 1848:       This, our (Constitutional) Convention understood to be the      most oppressive of all Kingly oppressions; and they resolved      to so frame the Constitution that no one man should hold the      power of bringing this oppression upon us.  Fast forward 100 years into the 20th century, as we debated the possibility of creating a United Nations. The U.N. Charter was written against the backdrop of the disaster of the Treaty of Versailles and President Wilson's determination to make foreign policy without Congress. When President Wilson submitted that treaty to the Senate in 1919, he attached the covenant of the League of Nations. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge offered a number of reservations, specifically including a protection of the prerogative of Congress, and Congress alone, to declare war. President Wilson called this reservation ``a nullification of the treaty.'' The issue was joined. The Senate rejected the treaty, and thereby the League of Nations, in 1919 and again in 1920.  In the midst of World War II, when the concept of another world organization began to form, care was taken not to cross the line that had doomed the League of Nations. Any commitment of U.S. forces to a world body would require prior authorization by both Houses of Congress. Debate on the Hill between the House and Senate had more to do with each body's prerogative and role than the underlying assumption. Even under the auspices of the United Nations, congressional approval was necessary before troops could be committed.  Section 6 of the United Nations Participation Act is explicit. Agreements ``shall be subject to the approval of the Congress by appropriate act or joint resolution.''  Ultimately the decision was reached that both Houses of Congress--not just the Senate under its treaty authority--was necessary.  Soon after President Roosevelt's death, President Harry Truman sent a cable from the conference in Potsdam that led to the establishment of the U.N., stating that all agreements involving U.S. troop commitments in the U.N. would first have to be approved by both Houses of Congress.  President Eisenhower assured the press, in January of 1956, in an often-quoted statement, ``When it comes to a matter of war, there is only one place I would go, and that is the Congress of the United States and tell them what I believe. I will never be guilty of any kind of action that can be interpreted as war until Congress, which has constitutional authority, says so. I am not going to order any troops into anything that can be interpreted as war until Congress directs it.''  In the creation of NATO, Secretary of State Dean Acheson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1949 that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ``does not mean the United States would automatically be at war if one of the other signatory nations were the victim of an armed attack. Under our Constitution the Congress alone has the power to declare war.''  Then came Korea. President Truman sent U.S. troops in 1950 without ever seeking, or obtaining, congressional authority. By historical fluke, the Soviet Union was absent from the U.N. Security Council when a crucial vote was taken responding to the possibility that the Korean peninsula would be overrun. Without a Soviet veto, the U.N. moved forward, and President Truman rationalized the use of force in this ``police action'' to uphold the rule of law.  I recall that particularly, because my two older brothers served in the Korean war, and there was an ongoing joke about the fact that this was just a ``police action.'' They knew better. All of the families and all of those involved knew that it was, in fact, a war.  The courts, too, have supported the constitutional prerogatives of Congress with regard to war-making, including the implied constitutional power to ``authorize'' war.  The Supreme Court in Bas v. Tingy, in 1800 said, ``Congress is empowered to declare general war, or Congress may wage a limited war; limited in place, in objects, and in time. . . .''  Chief Justice Marshall, writing in Talbot v. Seeman in 1801: ``The whole powers of war being, by the Constitution of the United States, vested in Congress, the acts of that body can alone be resorted to as guides in this inquiry.''  U.S. Circuit Court, New York, U.S. v. Smith, 1806: ``It is the exclusive province of Congress to change a state of peace into a state of war.''  More recently, during the Persian Gulf episode, a case was filed in the U.S. district court in Washington. I joined with petitioners who filed this action to ask the court to spell out the power of Congress when it came to the declaration of war. The court rejected the Justice Department's contention that ``the question whether an offensive action taken by American armed forces constitutes an act of war (to be initiated by a declaration of war) or an `offensive military attack' (presumably undertaken by the President in his capacity as Commander in Chief) is not one of objective fact but involves an exercise of judgment based upon all the vagaries of foreign affairs and national security.''  The court said, ``This claim on behalf of the Executive is far too sweeping to be accepted by the courts. If the Executive had the sole power to determine that any particular offensive military operation, no matter how vast, does not constitute war-making but only an offensive military attack, the congressional power to declare war will be at the mercy of a semantic decision by the Executive. Such an `interpretation' would evade the plain language of the Constitution, and it cannot stand.''  Mr. President, over the last 40 or 45 years, Congress has virtually ceded its constitutional war powers responsibilities to the President. Many of the significant instances of use of force by the Executive without congressional authorization, including the only major unauthorized war in Korea, and localized conflicts in the Dominican Republic, Grenada, and Panama, among others, occurred during this period.  I will not visit that sad and contentious chapter of American history surrounding the Vietnam war, but sufficeit to say that after that war Congress made the decision, through the passage of legislation, to take a more active role in the decisionmaking process.  The 1973 War Powers Resolution, which then-Armed Services Committee Chairman John Stennis called ``an important step in this Congress to assume its duty in representing the people of this Nation,'' unfortunately has done little to slow down the gradual assumption of war powers claimed by successive administrations or to embolden Congress to properly exercise its war powers responsibilities under the Constitution.  Even in signing the congressional authorization of the use of force against Iraq in 1991, President Bush went to great pains to emphasize his claim that he possessed constitutional authority to act. ``As I made clear to congressional leaders at the outset, my request for congressional support did not, and my signing of this resolution does not, constitute any change in the longstanding position of the Executive Branch on either the President's constitutional authority to use the Armed Forces to defend vital U.S. interests, or the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution.''  The Clinton administration echoed President Bush's comments and even took it one step further.  During her congressional testimony during the Iraq crisis this last February, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright spoke of ``the President's constitutional authority as Commander in Chief to use armed forces to protect our national interests.''  In a Statement of Administration policy threatening a veto of the House version of this bill if the Skaggs-Campbell amendment were included, the administration stated that, ``The President must be able to act decisively to protect U.S. national security and foreign policy interests.''  I do not believe that the framers of our Constitution would have ever accepted such inflated claims of executive authority, or the idea the Armed Forces should be used by the President as a device for implementing administration foreign policy, without the approval of Congress.  President Bush's comments notwithstanding, Congress made a good start in regaining its proper constitutional war powers in its thorough 1991 debate and vote to authorize the war in the Persian Gulf. Congress affirmed at that time that its responsibilities extended far beyond merely paying the bills for Presidents' wars.  Now it is time for the Congress to take the next step. This amendment will restore the proper constitutional balance between the executive and legislative branches in deciding when or if the United States is to go to war.  Mr. President, in the time that I have served on Capitol Hill, in both the House and Senate, it has been my sad responsibility on several occasions to attend funerals in my home district, in my congressional district, for the families of those who have fallen in combat.  I can't think of a sadder occasion--one of the saddest that I can recall--than the one that involved the sending of Marines to Lebanon, putting them in harm's way, and after a terrible bombing of the barracks, the loss of life of a young man from Springfield, IL. Time and again, I thought at those sad services that there is a legitimate question the family could ask of their elected representative in Congress, and now in the U.S. Senate. Was I part of the decision that led to the war that took their son's life? Because the Constitution makes it clear that I should have been part of that decision. In so many instances, I was not; the decision was made by the President. The only course for Congress is control of the purse, and virtually nothing else. As a direct result, we lost lives without the American people speaking to the question of war through their elected Congress.  I caution my colleagues to read carefully this amendment and to realize that it does more than assert our constitutional authority to declare war. It also asserts our responsibility. Be careful for what you wish because with the passage of this amendment and the reassertion of our constitutional responsibility, we will be and should be called on more frequently to make important decisions about committing American troops.  There is one operative and very important word in this amendment. It is the word ``offensive,'' as in offensive military operations. So the Record is eminently clear, there is no doubt in my mind nor in anything I have read that the President of the United States, as Commander in Chief, has the power to protect American citizens and the property of the United States. He need not come to the Congress and seek our approval when he is, in fact, defending Americans and their property. We are talking about a separate circumstance, a circumstance where instead of taking a defensive action, the President decides to take an offensive action.  I might also add that for those who say, clearly the Senator from Illinois is offering this amendment because he is concerned about some current conflict, well, yes, I am concerned. I am concerned about any conflict that involves American lives, but that isn't what motivates me to join the gentleman from Colorado who offered this amendment in the House of Representatives. As I mentioned earlier, it was almost 7 years ago that I joined Congressman Bennett of Florida in a similar effort. I do believe this principle is sound, and those who want to gainsay this effort should know that I have tried to stand by this principle through the time that I have been in Congress.  Is there a need for us to consider it now? I will leave that to your judgment. Consider the statements made by Robert Gelbard, special representative of the President and Secretary of State on Implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement, when he spoke before the House International Relations Committee in Washington on July 23, 1998, relative to the tragedy in Kosovo.  Mr. Gelbard said:        In NATO councils, planning for possible NATO action is      nearly completed. While no decision has been made regarding      the use of force, all options, including robust military      intervention in Kosovo, remain on the table. NATO planning is      on track and Milosevic understands that this is no idle      threat. The deteriorating situation in Kosovo is a threat to      regional peace and security. The potential for spillover into      neighboring States remains a paramount concern. We and our      allies have made clear to President Milosevic that spillover      of the conflict into Albania or Macedonia will not be      tolerated.  Make no mistake, if Mr. Gelbard's statement is a statement of administration policy, the administration is poised to initiate an offensive military action relative to Kosovo, an action which I believe clearly requires congressional approval, If the men and women in service to our country who are presently in Bosnia--and I believe the number is about 6,900--should be called to take offensive military action and lives are lost, from all that I have read, it is clearly in derogation of article I, section 8 of the Constitution. This President, my President, any President, has the responsibility to come to Congress to seek our approval. Of course, then the responsibility is on our shoulders to decide whether or not this is in America's national security interest.  I ask my colleagues in the Senate in considering this amendment to consider the historical perspective here. For the first time since World War II, when President Franklin Roosevelt hobbled up the steps to take the podium for a Joint Session of Congress in the House of Representatives, asking for a declaration of war, we will state in clear and unequivocal terms that we are asserting our constitutional responsibility and authority when it comes to a declaration of war.  I understand that this will require more dialogue and conversation between the executive and legislative branches about our foreign policy, and particularly about committing troops, but I do believe that is what the framers of the Constitution had in mind. Those of us who must face the families and explain to them why their daughters and sons, their husbands, their wives and friends and relatives are called on to not only serve this country, but stand in harm's way and risk their lives have to have the authority to stand before them and say we have done our part, we have played our role, we have made the judgment, the judgment which the Constitution gives to us and us alone to make.  At this point, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, to add Senator Feingold as an original cosponsor of this amendment.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sessions). Without objection, it is so ordered.
