 President, I know the Senator from Georgia wants to speak on this issue, but my preference would be, and I consulted with Senator Leahy on this as well, to dispose of some agreed-to amendments. I have also consulted with the Democratic leader, who would like to have a couple of votes shortly because he must be absent from the Senate around 6:30.  It would be my plan, I say to my friend from Georgia, just for his information, to have votes on the Hatfield-Dorgan amendment and the Domenici amendment beginning at 5:50, and then we would go back to the pending amendment of Senator Brown, on which I know the Senator from Georgia wishes to speak.  I ask unanimous consent the Brown amendment be temporarily laid aside.
