 I do not challenge it. I just am reminded, I remember one time when I first got here--and I know he has been here a long time. I went up to Russell Long, the Chairman of the Finance Committee, and indicated to him I wanted help on an amendment to a Finance Committee bill. Senator Long, the senior Senator and Chairman of the Finance Committee, said, ``Fine.'' He accepted it.  Then I thought later it would be good to have a recorded vote. I stood up and said, ``I have decided I want a recorded vote.'' He said, ``In that case, I am against it.'' We had the recorded vote and he beat me. So I learned, from my perspective anyway, that when someone accepts an amendment, I am always happy to do it.  But I understand the Senator's motivation. I will not change my position, but maybe he would reconsider whether we need the vote. But that is his judgment. I yield the floor.
