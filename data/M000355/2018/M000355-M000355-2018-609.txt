 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of Calendar Nos. 1001, 1002, 1003 and all nominations placed on the Secretary's desk in the Foreign Service; that the nominations be confirmed; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon table with no intervening action or debate; that no further motions be in order; that any statements related to the nominations be printed in the Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.
