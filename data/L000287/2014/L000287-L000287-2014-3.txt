There is not any room in a civilized society for the abuse of anyone, but especially women and girls. I have seen and known women who are victims and survivors. Mother, sisters, and daughters must know that their pain is our pain.  The thought of another human being living in constant fear breaks my heart. Imagine life day in and day out afraid to come home at night and with no safe place in the day. It hurts my soul.  Throughout my life, I have taken a stand against violence in thoughts, in words, and in action. Violence is not in keeping with the human spirit. We do not come into this world beating and abusing our fellow human beings. We learn it from our environment and from our experiences.  Together, we have a moral obligation to teach our children--especially our young men--the way of peace, the way of love, and the way of nonviolence. There can be no place for abuse in our society. Madam Speaker, we must break this cycle, and we must do it now.                          ____________________
