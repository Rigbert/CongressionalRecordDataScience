 President, this morning the Senate is considering a very important bill, the port security bill, which many Members have come to the floor to talk about. I am proud to be an original sponsor of this bill and have been working on it for a number of years; in fact, since five years ago, after September 11, when I was the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee chair. At that time I began to bring stakeholders together to talk about how we can make sure the cargo containers that are coming into this country are secure. It is a very complex issue. It is very difficult to do. We have a tremendous balancing act of making sure that cargo containers are safe when they come into our ports but also that we don't halt our economy as we move forward with this initiative.  I have been very proud to work with a number of Senators in getting us to this point, and I am hoping this bill will move forward in an expeditious manner. Obviously, there will be a number of amendments that come before us, and I look forward to working with other Senators on both sides of the aisle to move them forward.
