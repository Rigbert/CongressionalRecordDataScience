President, I will yield the floor in just a moment.  First, I thank the Democratic leader for the Y2K effort, and Senator Dodd for all of his counsel and help. He, of course, is the principal author on securities litigation legislation which, to a great extent, this bill is modeled after.  Just before I yield the floor, I, too, want to say to Senator Hollings, the Democratic leader of the Commerce Committee, that I agree with so much of what he has done--whether it is a matter of Social Security surplus or campaign finance. I regret that on this one we have a difference of opinion.  I think that we have brought a balanced bill to the floor of the Senate. But I look forward to the many other issues on which Senator Hollings and I are going to be in agreement.  I yield the floor.
