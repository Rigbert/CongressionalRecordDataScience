 President, let me join the leader indicating there is no reason we should not and we will pass the Energy bill today. Now that it is clear it is not going to be a bill to raise taxes and drive up the price of fuel at the pump, I think there is broad bipartisan support for this bill. This is the way the Senate ought to function, coming together behind those things that are achievable.  The bill, with the changes the majority leader has indicated we are going to make, could be signed by the President and it will be something we could all be proud of.  We also intend to finish the farm bill as rapidly as possible, so I share his goals for today, and tomorrow if need be. I think we should move forward with the farm bill and finish it.  I yield the floor.
