 President, if I may, obviously I am not going to object. Let me say to all our colleagues on this side of the aisle, this will be a challenging week. Budget week always is, with numerous votes. Obviously, it would be to the advantage of the body to have a number of those votes before the so-called vote-arama, which occurs as the time expires late in the week.  So I encourage Republican Senators who have amendments to come on over, beginning tomorrow, lay them down, and let's try to proceed early in the week in order to minimize the inconvenience to everyone at the end of the week.
