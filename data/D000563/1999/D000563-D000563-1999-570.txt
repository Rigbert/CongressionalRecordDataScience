 That is what this legislation, the amendment, is all about: Find a way to help these people stay in business. Responsible businesses dealing with responsible businesses, not racing off to court, not playing with lawyers. I am stunned that at this point the amendment by the Senator from California just has not been adopted. It troubles me when I think about it in the context of the underlying bill.  If the people who are bringing this bill to the floor do not care that much about small and medium-sized businesses that will face the delays, face the layoffs, because of Y2K problems, this is not a probusiness bill. This is for an elite group of bad actors in an industry who have not done their homework and do not want to be held responsible for their bad conduct. That, to me, is not what we should be doing on the floor of the Senate.  I think the Senator from California, when you take a look at the first paragraph of this bill, really has an amendment that addresses the bottom line.
