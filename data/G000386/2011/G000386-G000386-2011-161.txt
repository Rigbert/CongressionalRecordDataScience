 President, the Federal Bureau of Investigation is on the front line in defending our country from terrorists, spies, and criminals. The FBI has a long history dating back over 100 years. The FBI started as an agency formed during President Theodore Roosevelt's administration when seven Secret Service agents were sent to the Justice Department to create a new investigative bureau. Since that start, the FBI has developed into acadre of talented agents who have pioneered new investigative tools advancing law enforcement across the country.  For example, the Bureau agents developed advancements in forensic science, such as fingerprint technology and DNA analysis, now utilized to build investigations from the smallest of clues obtained at crime scenes. Such advancements have allowed the FBI to combat organized crime and international terrorists across the country and around the globe.  Despite these successes, the FBI has also had its share of failures. These include maintaining secret files on elected officials, the investigation of civil rights leaders, the tragedies at Ruby Ridge and Waco, missing internal spy Robert Hanssen, the corruption and misuse of mob informants in the Boston field office, and the failure to connect the dots leading up to the 9/11 attacks. The FBI has also had problems in failing to manage high-profile projects, such as the procurement of information technology upgrades. They have failed to address personnel problems, such as the double standard for discipline that the Justice Department inspector general found agents believe exists. And there were the serious issues that required reform at the FBI crime lab. These are black marks on the history of the FBI.  I have been an outspoken critic of the FBI's culture for many years because of its unwillingness to own up to mistakes. Too often, officials sought to protect the agency's reputation at the expense of the truth. My concerns are magnified by the way the FBI treats internal whistleblowers who come forward and report fraud and abuse. All too often, instead of owning up to problems and fixing them, they circle the wagons and shoot the messenger. The FBI is all too often the exact opposite of an agency that can accept constructive criticism, from both those inside and out.  That said, I must give credit to the FBI when it is due. Following the tragedy of 9/11, the FBI has worked to fix the problems that have occurred. There has been a top-to-bottom transformation at the FBI moving it from a pure law enforcement agency to a national security agency. Chief among those lending this transformation has been FBI Director Robert Mueller. Sworn in as Director just 1 week prior to 9/11, Director Mueller has led the charge to ensure that the FBI is updated into a modern national security agency. This transformation includes upgrading the workforce from an agent-driven model to one that includes an ever-increasing number of intelligence analysts. Director Mueller has taken the transformation head-on and has done an admirable job. I applaud the hard work that has been done, but more work remains. That is why we are here today introducing legislation that will extend the term of FBI Director Mueller for 2 additional years. I join my colleagues from the Judiciary and Select Intelligence Committees in introducing a one-time statutory exemption that will extend the term of FBI Director Mueller's term by 2 years. I do this recognizing the good work of Director Mueller and against a backdrop of heightened alert to terrorist attack following the death of Osama bin Laden. However, I do this with a heavy heart because I believe the 10-year term is a good thing for both the FBI and the country.  Currently, the law requires that the FBI Director be limited to one single 10-year term. This limitation was put in place in 1976 following a 1968 change in the law making the Director a Presidential appointment. Congress included this term for two main reasons: one, to ensure that the Director was insulated from political influence of the President; two, to ensure that no one individual serves as FBI Director for such a long period of time to amass too much power. The inclusion of a term was part of a series of reforms to government agencies following the Watergate scandal and following the death of former Director J. Edgar Hoover, who had served a 48-year term.  The current term limit has been in place for 35 years. In that time, no Director of the FBI has ever served an entire 10-year term and no President has ever suggested the term limit should be extended. However, on September 4, 2011, FBI Director Mueller would be the first to reach the 10-year mark. President Obama has indicated it is his desire to have Director Mueller stay on for an additional 2 years and has asked us to extend the term.  While I join my colleagues in introducing this extension, I have also asked that we have a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee to address this extension. There are significant constitutional concerns that must be addressed, such as whether Congress has the authority to extend the term of a sitting appointee. A concern of this magnitude needs to be discussed in a formal hearing. Additionally, this would be the first time the Congress will be extending the term of the Director in over 35 years and nearly 37 years since a hearing was held on the term of the Director in the Judiciary Committee.  Director Mueller has done an admirable job of reforming an agency under difficult circumstances. While I have my concerns with the precedent that this will set for future Directors--namely, that the term can be extended--I do think that making a one-time exception is warranted in this limited case and with the current existing threats. But I do not want this to become a regular occurrence. This legislation is narrowly tailored to ensure that the intent of Congress is to create only a one-time exception. Further, we will be holding a Judiciary Committee hearing in the near future to address this important, limited, one-time extension. Against that backdrop, I support this extension and look forward to an open debate and discussion surrounding this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
