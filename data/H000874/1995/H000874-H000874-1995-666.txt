Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Georgia [Ms. McKinney].  Ms. McKINNEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker, to paraphrase Yogi Bera, its deja vu all over again. This bill ought to look familiar because this House overwhelmingly passed it last year. I am happy to vote for congressional compliance 25 times if need be.  Mr. Speaker I find it ironic that on the day we cut committee staff by a third and put thousands of people out of work we celebrate. Mr. Speaker, I also find it ironic that as we cut the committee staff by a third, the office budgets of the new Speaker and the new majority leader have increased by nearly 50 percent.  Mr. Speaker, it is important that we enact this legislation that protects employees.
