 A few weeks ago I met with my Governor and all the emergency preparedness officials in the State of Rhode Island. They have an excellent plan. They have an idea of what they can do, what they must do. They don't have the resources to do it. Time waits for no person. And if we waste this time when the crisis comes and a response is necessary, the plans won't mean anything.  This funding is critical now. It is critical to protect our preparedness infrastructure to allow first responders with appropriate equipment, with radios that communicate with all the different agencies, to be in place--not on order. We have to move now, and we have to move aggressively, and that is what the chairman has done. He has carefully weighed conflicting demands for scarce resources, and he has come up with a plan that covers the gamut of major responsibilities at the State level. We have to protect our infrastructure. We have to protect our nuclear facilities. We have to ensure that all of our State agencies and Federal agencies and not-for-profit groups, such as the Red Cross, are coordinated.  Rhode Island is one of three or four States that have a plan that has been approved and accepted by the Federal Government. They know what to do. But they would be the first to tell you, as they told me, they don't have the resources to do the job. When the crisis comes, when an attack comes, we cannot satisfy our constituents simply by saying we had a good plan. We have to be able to act. This money is necessary now. I commend and thank the chairman for his great efforts, his leadership on those resources.  If I may, I request 1 more minute.
