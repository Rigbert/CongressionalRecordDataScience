 Kyl) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                            S. Con. Res. 73       Whereas environmental sampling by the International Atomic      Energy Agency (IAEA) at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility      revealed the presence of 2 types of highly enriched uranium      that can be used to develop nuclear weapons;       Whereas the traces of highly-enriched uranium detected by      the IAEA at the Natanz facility and the Kalaye Electric      Company could indicate that Iran has been secretly attempting      to produce weapons-grade uranium at these facilities;       Whereas, in March 2003, the Director of the IAEA announced      that Iran was constructing a facility to enrich uranium, a      key component of advanced nuclear weapons;       Whereas, on January 1, 1968, Iran signed the Treaty on the      Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington,      London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered into force March      5, 1970 (the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'');       Whereas the June 6, 2003, report of the Director General of      the IAEA expressed concern over the failure of the Government      of Iran to report material, facilities, and activities at its      nuclear facilities, including those that have the potential      to enrich uranium and develop nuclear weapons, in      contravention of its obligations under the safeguards      agreement it signed in connection with the Nuclear Non-     Proliferation Treaty;       Whereas the Board of Governors of the IAEA adopted a      resolution on September 12, 2003, that calls on Iran to      provide the IAEA a full declaration of all imported material      and components relevant to the uranium enrichment program, to      grant unrestricted access, including environmental sampling,      to the IAEA, to resolve questions regarding the conclusion of      the IAEA experts who tested gas centrifuges in that country,      to provide complete information regarding the conduct of      uranium conversion experiments, and to provide such other      information and explanations and take such other steps as the      IAEA determines necessary to resolve by October 31, 2003, all      outstanding issues involving Iran's nuclear materials and      nuclear activities;       Whereas, in June 2003, Iran conducted a successful test of      the 800-mile range Shahab-3 missile, and Iran is also seeking      to produce a 1,200-mile Shahab-4 missile;       Whereas the construction by Iran of nuclear facilities,      coupled with its ties to terrorist groups, constitutes a      threat to international peace and security; and       Whereas, by signing the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,      signatories such as Iran that are not declared nuclear powers      commit themselves to abstaining from the acquisition of      nuclear weapons, preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and      weapons technology, promoting cooperation in the peaceful      uses of nuclear energy, and achieving nuclear disarmament:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That Congress--       (1) deplores the development by Iran of a nuclear weapons      program and the failure of the Government of Iran to report      material, facilities, and activities to the International      Atomic Energy Commission in contravention of its obligations      under the safeguards agreement it signed in connection with      the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done      at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, and entered      into force March 5, 1970 (hereafter in this resolution      referred to as the ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'');       (2) concurs with the view of the Department of State, as      delivered in testimony to the U.S.-Israel Joint Parliamentary      Committee on September 17, 2003, by the Assistant Secretary      of State for Verification and Compliance that the      explanations provided by the Government of Iran for its      nuclear activities are not credible;       (3) concurs with the conclusion reached in the Department      of State's Annual Report on Adherence to and Compliance with      Arms Control and Nonproliferation Agreements and Commitments      that Iran is pursuing a program to develop nuclear weapons;       (4) calls on the President to use all appropriate means to      prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, including--       (A) urging the Government of Iran to accept in full the      resolution adopted by the Board of Governors of the      International Atomic Energy Agency on September 12, 2003      (hereafter in this resolution referred to as the ``IAEA      resolution''), that calls on Iran to--       (i) provide the Agency a full declaration of all imported      material and components relevant to the uranium enrichment      program;       (ii) grant unrestricted access, including environmental      sampling, to the Agency;       (iii) resolve questions regarding the conclusion of the      Agency experts who tested gas centrifuges in that country;       (iv) provide complete information regarding the conduct of      uranium conversion experiments; and       (v) provide such other information and explanations and      take such other steps as the Agency determines necessary to      resolve by October 31, 2003, all outstanding issues involving      Iran's nuclear materials and nuclear activities;       (B) taking such diplomatic measures as are necessary to      encourage other nations, especially Russia, to urge the      Government of Iran to fully and immediately comply with the      such resolution; and       (C) working with the United Nations and other nations to      urge the Government of Iran to sign the Model Additional      Protocol to give the International Atomic Energy Agency      greater access in Iran to ensure that--       (i) no undeclared facilities exist in Iran; and       (ii) no materials or technologies have been diverted from      safeguarded facilities in Iran;       (5) calls on Russia to--       (A) use all appropriate means to urge Iran to accept in      full the IAEA resolution; and       (B) suspend all nuclear cooperation with Iran until Iran      fully and completely complies with the IAEA resolution;       (6) calls on member states of the United Nations to join      the United States in preventing the Government of Iran from      continuing to pursue and develop programs or facilities that      could be used in a nuclear weapons program;       (7) calls on the United Nations Security Council to      immediately undertake consideration of--       (A) the threat to international peace and security posed by      Iran's nuclear weapons program; and       (B) the passage of a Security Council resolution or the      taking of other actions that may be necessary to impose      diplomatic and economic sanctions against Iran if it fails to      meet its obligations to the International Atomic Energy      Agency by October 31, 2003; and       (8) calls on the Government of Iran to cease all efforts to      acquire nuclear fuel cycle capabilities until it is able to      provide specific assurances that it is not engaged in a      clandestine nuclear weapons program by--       (A) coming into complete and verifiable compliance with its      obligations under the IAEA resolution, including the prompt      and unconditional implementation of the Model Additional      Protocol; and       (B) fully meeting its obligations under the Nuclear Non-     Proliferation Treaty.
