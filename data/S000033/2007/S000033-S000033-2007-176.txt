 President, we hear much from the Bush administration and our Republican friends, almost on a daily basis, about how wonderfully our economy is doing. I recall not so long ago being at a Budget Committee hearing when we heard the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Paulson, indicating in fact that the economy is doing ``just marvelous.''  Yet, for obvious reasons, the American people do not seem to agree with the Bush administration or with our Republican friends as to how well the economy is doing. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record segments of two polls that were recently released, one by CBS News and one by Gallup.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                             CBS News Poll    [Conducted 4/9-12/07; surveyed 994 adults; margin of error  3%    (release, 4/15).

More generally,      a large majority of Americans support the principle that      wealth should be more evenly distributed in America, and an      increasing number--although still a minority--say there are      too many rich people in the country. Attitudes toward heavy      taxes on the rich are strongly related to one's own income,      and Democrats are much more likely to be in favor of income      redistribution than are Republicans.       Basic Trends       A poll commissioned by Fortune Magazine in 1939 and      conducted by famous pollster Elmo Roper included a question      phrased as follows:       ``People feel differently about how far a government should      go. Here is a phrase which some people believe in and some      don't. Do you think our government should or should not      redistribute wealth by heavy taxes on the rich?''       At that time, near the end of the Depression, only a      minority of Americans, 35%, said the government should impose      heavy taxes on the rich in order to redistribute wealth. A      slight majority--54%--said the government should not. (Eleven      percent did not have an opinion.)       Gallup asked this question again in 1998 and found the      percentage willing to say that the government should      redistribute wealth had gone up by 10 points (while the ``no      opinion'' responses had dropped to 4% and the negative stayed      slightly above 50%).       Now, the attitudes have shifted slightly again, to the      point where Americans' sentiment in response to this question      is roughly split, with 49% saying the government should      redistribute wealth by heavy taxes on the rich, and 47%      disagreeing.       People feel differently about how far a government should      go. Here is a phrase which some people believe in and some      don't.

One must be cautious in interpreting changes between the      1939 poll, which was conducted using different sampling and      methods than is the case today, and the current poll. It does      appear safe to say, however, that based on this one question,      the American public has become at least somewhat more      ``redistributionist'' over the almost seven decades since the      end of the Depression.       The current results of this question are in line with a      separate Gallup question that asks whether various groups in      American society are paying their fair share of taxes, or too      much or too little. Two-thirds of Americans say ``upper-     income people'' are paying too little in taxes.       As I read off some different groups, please tell me if you      think they are paying their FAIR share in federal taxes,      paying too much or paying too little?

More on attitudes toward wealth and the rich:       The most recent Gallup Poll included two other questions      measuring attitudes toward wealth and the rich.

The current      66% who feel that way is tied for the highest reading on this      measure across this time period in which the question has      been asked.       A separate question asked:       As far as you are concerned, do we have too many rich      people in this country, too few, or about the right amount?------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Percent                                ----------------------------------------                                                        Right      No                                  Too many   Too few    amount   opinion------------------------------------------------------------------------April 2 to 5, 2007.............         37         17       40         6April 23 to May 31, 1998.......         25         20       50         5May 17 to 20, 1990.............         21         15       55         9------------------------------------------------------------------------       Here we have evidence of a growing resentment toward the      rich. The percentage of Americans who say there are too many      rich people in the United States--although still a minority--     is up significantly from the two times in the 1990s when this      question was asked.       In summary, the data show that:       A significant majority of Americans feel that money and      wealth should be distributed more equally across a larger      percentage of the population.       A significant majority of Americans feel that the rich pay      too little in taxes.       About half of Americans support the idea of ``heavy'' taxes      on the rich to help redistribute wealth.       Almost 4 out of 10 Americans flat-out say there are ``too      many'' rich people in the country                              Implications       Most societies experience tensions revolving around      inequalities of wealth among those societies' members. This      seemingly inevitable fact of life has been at the core of      revolutions throughout history. American society has been      immune from massive revolts of those at the bottom end of the      spectrum in part because the public perceives that the United      States is an open society with upward social mobility. A      recent Gallup Poll found a majority of Americans believing      that people who make a lot of money deserve it, and that      almost anyone can get rich if they put their mind to it. And      a 2003 Gallup Poll found that about a third of Americans,      including a significantly higher percentage of younger      Americans, believed that they themselves would one day be      rich.       The findings reviewed in this report most likely reflect at      least in part the fact that it is easy to advocate greater      taxation of the rich, since most Americans do not consider      themselves rich.       In fact, a 2003 Gallup Poll found that the median annual      income that Americans considered ``rich'' was $122,000. Since      the average income in America is markedly below that, it      follows that most Americans do not consider themselves rich.      (Eighty percent of Americans put themselves in the middle      class, working class, or lower class. Only 1 % identify      themselves as being in the upper class, while 19% are willing      to say the upper middle class.)       The data show that as one gets closer to being what      Americans consider rich, one is also less interested in the      rich being taxed heavily. This relationship is fairly linear;      the more money one makes in general, the more likely one is      to say that the government should not be imposing heavy taxes      on the rich.       People feel differently about how far a government should      go. Here is a phrase which some people believe in and some      don't. Do you think our government should or should not      redistribute wealth by heavy taxes on the rich?------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                             Percent                                                       -----------------                        Income                                     No,                                                          Yes,    should                                                         should    not------------------------------------------------------------------------$75,000+..............................................       35       62$50,000 to $75,000....................................       46       51$30,000 to $50,000....................................       58       41$20,000 to $30,000....................................       55       42$20,000...............................................       64       26------------------------------------------------------------------------       There are also political differences in views on heavy      taxes on the rich.

About half of Americans are willing to      go so far as advocate ``heavy taxes'' on the rich in order to      redistribute wealth. These findings are despite the belief of      many Americans that the rich deserve their money and the      hopes Americans themselves harbor that they will be rich some      day.       From a political viewpoint, these data suggest that a      political platform focused on addressing the problems of the      lower and middle classes contrasted with the rich, including      heavier taxes on the upper class, could meet with significant      approval, particularly among Democrats and those with lower      incomes.                             Survey Methods       These results are based on telephone interviews with a      randomly selected national sample of 1,008 adults, aged 18      and older, conducted April 2-5, 2007. For results based on      this sample, one can say with 95% confidence that the maximum      error attributable to sampling and other random effects is  3      percentage points. In addition to sampling error, question      wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can      introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion      polls.
