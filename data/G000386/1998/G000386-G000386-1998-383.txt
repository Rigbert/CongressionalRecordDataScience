 President, on February 4, I joined Senator D'Amato in introducing legislation to repeal a provision of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which penalizes hospitals that provide appropriate and efficient care. This law punishes hospitals that make use of the full continuum of care and discourages them from moving patients to the most appropriate levels of post-acute care.  The current hospital prospective payment system is based on an average length of stay for a given condition. In some cases, patients stay in the hospital longer than the average and in other cases their stay is shorter. Historically, a hospital has been reimbursed based upon an average length of stay regardless of whether the patient remained in the hospital a day less than the average or a day more than the average. When the Balanced Budget Act transfer provision takes effect, however, this will no longer be the case.  This new policy penalizes facilities that transfer patients from the hospital to a more appropriate level of care earlier than the average length of stay. It encourages hospitals to ignore the clinical needs of patients and keep them in the most expensive care setting for a longer period of time. In short, it offers an incentive for hospitals to provide an unnecessary level of care, for an unnecessary length of time.  The transfer policy is particularly hard on hospitals in low-cost states like Iowa, where the cost of implementation has been estimated at $25 million a year. Because Iowa's hospitalspractice efficient medicine, they have average lengths of stay well below the national average. These hospitals will be hit especially hard. This kind of perverse incentive is part of the problem with Medicare, not part of the solution.  I understand that there may be concerns about abuses by some hospitals moving patients to lower levels of care sooner than is clinically appropriate. If that is a problem, let's attack it. But let's not punish all hospitals--especially the most efficient for the sins of a few others.  In addition to the irrational incentives this policy creates, there is the very real problem of administering it. This law holds hospitals accountable for the actions of patients that are no longer under their care. If a Medicare beneficiary were discharged from the hospital without the expectation of a need for further care and circumstances changed, the hospital would not be entitled to the full Medicare payment. But the reality is that, the hospital may or may not know of this change. The law sets hospitals up for accusations of fraud due to events that are completely beyond their control.  This law is a serious roadblock to the provision of appropriate and efficient care. The repeal of this legislation will help ensure that logical coordinated care remains a primary goal of the Medicare program.                          ____________________
