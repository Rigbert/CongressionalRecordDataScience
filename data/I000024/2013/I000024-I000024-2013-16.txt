It shows the House, on Friday, at 11 o'clock, is out of here. They are gone. They are adjourned. If something should happen--we were to amend something--they are not there. So it can't be done. This is where we are now. We only have these 5 days that are left.  A lot of people have said--and I would ask my friend from Arizona if he agrees with this--well, we can come back in January and do this. But then look at this. We come back on the 6th of January, and the CR--the continuing resolution--is here. I can assure you, from past experience, that will dominate the floor. They are certainly not going to have time to do it. So the only shot we have is up here.  But also important, I read a list of things before my good friend came in, that expire on December 31, and those are things that are happening right now to all of our pilots. My colleague certainly knows about that. They have bailed out. They are gone now. They are so upset with what is happening with the grounding of our squadrons. If we take away their reenlistment incentive, are we going to have any pilots left?  Mr. McCAIN. So we have established, by the calendar and by what has happened since May, that, obviously, the majority and the majority leader had a higher priority for whatever the hell it is we did rather than the defense of this Nation. That is a fact. I would challenge anyone on the other side of the aisle to come and argue differently. It is outrageous.  Now that we have established that, could I ask my friend what happens--and I know he has gone through it--what happens to the men and women in our military if we do wait until January, if we do wait until February or March or don't act at all?  For example, one of the best examples I have seen is that right now a married sergeant in the U.S. military who is serving as a helicopter crew chief in Afghanistan, beginning on the 1st of January--please correct me if I am wrong--will lose $890 a month; is that correct?
