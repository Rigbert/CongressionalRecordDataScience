President, I wanted to inform the Repubican leadership that the House of Representatives today passed the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, H.R. 4033, by an overwhelming vote of 413-3. I hope that the Senate will quickly follow suit and pass the House-passed bill and send it to the President. President Clinton has already endorsed this legislation to support our nation's law enforcement officers and is eager to sign it into law.  Senator Campbell and I have introduced the Senate companion bill, S. 2413. Unfortunately, someone on the other side of the aisle has a hold on our bill. We have been working for the past week to urge the Senate to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000, S. 2413. The Senate Judiciary Committee passed our bill unanimously on June 29. It has been cleared by all 45 Democratic Senators.  But it still has not passed the full Senate. This is very disappointing to our nation's law enforcement officers who need life-saving bulletproof vests to protect themselves. Protecting and supporting our law enforcement community should not be a partisan issue.  Senator Campbell and I worked together closely and successfully with the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee in the last Congress to pass the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998 into law. Senator Hatch is an original cosponsor this year's bill to reauthorize this grant program. Senators Schumer, Kohl, Thurmond, Reed, Jeffords, Robb, Reid, Sarbanes, Bingaman, Ashcroft, Edwards, Bunning, Cleland, Hutchison, and Abraham are also cosponsors of our bipartisan bill.  But for some reason a Republican senator has a hold on this bill to provide protection to our nation's law enforcement officers. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, more than 40 percent of the 1,182 officers killed by a firearm in the line of duty since 1980 could have been saved if they had been wearing body armor. Indeed, the FBI estimates that the risk of fatality to officers while not wearing body armor is 14 times higher than for officers wearing it.  To better protect our nation's law enforcement officers, Senator Campbell and I introduced the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 1998. President Clinton signed our legislation into law on June 16, 1998. Our law created a $25 million, 50 percent matching grant program within the Department of Justice to help state and local law enforcement agencies purchase body armor for fiscal years 1999-2001.  In its two years of operation, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program has funded more than 180,000 new bulletproof vests for police officers across the country.  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 builds on the success of this program by doubling its annual funding to $50 million for fiscal years 2002-2004. It also improves the program by guaranteeing jurisdictions with fewer than 100,000 residents receive the full 50-50 matching funds because of the tight budgets of these smaller communities and by making the purchase of stab-proof vests eligible for grant awards to protect corrections officers in close quarters in local and county jails.  More than ever before, police officers in Vermont and around the country face deadly threats that can strike at any time, even during routine traffic stops. Bulletproof vests save lives. It is essential the we update this law so that many more of our officers who are risking their lives everyday are able to protect themselves.  I hope this mysterious ``hold'' on the other side of the aisle will disappear. The Senate should pass without delay the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act of 2000 and sent to the President for his signature into law.                          ____________________
