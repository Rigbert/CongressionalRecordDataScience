Yesterday afternoon, we were finally able to get an agreement that was long overdue. But even now, this morning, we are not voting to confirm Loretta Lynch to be the next Attorney General of the United States; we are going to vote on whether to invoke cloture in regard to this top law enforcement position.  For those not familiar with the rules of the Senate, cloture is a rule that allows the Senate to end a filibuster.  The fact that Senate Republicans are requiring a cloture vote on her nomination acknowledges what we have known all along: Republicans have been engaged in an unprecedented filibuster of this nomination.  When we do vote to confirm Loretta Lynch this afternoon, she will be the first African-American woman to serve as Attorney General. She is a historic nominee, but it is Senate Republicans who are making history--and I would say for the wrong reasons. We have had 82 Attorneys General in our Nation's history. Until now, not one of those 82 has had to overcome a cloture vote. But this one, Loretta Lynch, as I said, the first African-American woman to serve as Attorney General, became the first and only to have to overcome a cloture vote.  I would have opposed any filibuster on any President. I have been here with President Ford, President Carter, President Reagan, President Bush, President Clinton, another President Bush, and President Obama. Neither Republicans nor Democrats have seen this.  President Obama first announced Ms. Lynch's nomination more than 5 months ago. At the time, Senate Democrats acceded to the request of Senate Republicans not to move her nomination during the lame duck period. Republicans promised that she would be treated fairly.  In fact, last fall, the now-majority leader promised that ``Ms. Lynch will receive fair consideration by the Senate. And her nomination should be considered in the new Congress through regular order.'' But she hasn't been treated fairly. There hasn't been regular order.  The nomination of Ms. Lynch has been pending in the Senate awaiting confirmation for 56 days. I went back over the last seven Attorneys General. I added up the number of days they waited for confirmation on the floor. She has waited longer than all seven of them put together twice over, so twice as long as the seven preceding Republican and Democratic Attorneys General combined: Richard Thornburgh, 1 day; William Barr, 5 days; Janet Reno, 1 day; John Ashcroft, 2 days, Alberto Gonzales, 8 days; Michael Mukasey, 2 days; and Eric Holder, 5 days. I have said it repeatedly, but it bears repeating again: this historic delay is an embarrassment for the United States Senate.  As the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Ms. Lynch brought terrorists and cyber criminals to justice. She obtained convictions against corrupt public officials from both political parties. She fought tirelessly against violent crime and financial fraud. Ms. Lynch has protected the rights of victims. She has a proven record prosecuting human traffickers and protecting children.  I am glad that yesterday the Senate was finally able to overcome an impasse on trafficking legislation which, unfortunately, those on the other side of the aisle caused by injecting partisan politics into the debate. That Republican leaders tied a vote on the confirmation of Ms. Lynch to human trafficking legislation never made sense at all, especially given her strong record of prosecuting human traffickers.  In a recent article, the Guardian rightly pointed out that the Republican leaderships' use of her nomination as a negotiating chip was ``painfully wrongheaded--tantamount to holding the sheriff back until crime goes away.'' I could not agree more. I ask unanimous consent that the Guardian article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  We all know that Loretta Lynch is eminently qualified to be our next Attorney General. She should not have been delayed for so many months by the Senate majority. And we should not be forced to vote to cut off debate on this nomination, especially when no other Attorney General nominee has ever needed such a vote. This is the complete opposite of the fair treatment that Senate Republicans promised last November. After this extended delay on the Lynch nomination, I can only hope Senate Republicans will show her more respect as Attorney General of the United States than she has received as a nominee. She deserves our respect and gratitude for being willing to continue to serve our Nation. She has earned this respect.  Ms. Lynch's story is one of perseverance, grace, and grit and I believe this process will only make her stronger. She was born and raised in North Carolina. She is the daughter of a fourth-generation Baptist preacher and a school librarian. Her proud mother and father instilled in her the American values of fairness and equality, even though as a child those around them were not living up to these values.  I must say that meeting Reverend Lynch at these hearings and then meeting him at the time of the markup--I was so impressed with the strength that man showed and his sense of faith in goodness. This is a pastor and a preacher we can all look up to. In fact, Ms. Lynch recalls riding on Reverend Lynch's shoulders to their church, where students organized peaceful protests against racial segregation. The freedom songs and the church music that went hand in hand with those protests undoubtedly made up the sound track of her childhood. As Attorney General, I am sure she will draw upon those childhood experiences and the struggles of her parents, her grandparents, and her great-grandparents when addressing the current protests over too many young lives lost on our streets.  As I said, the Judiciary Committee was honored to have her father, the Reverend Lorenzo Lynch, with us on both days of her hearing in January, as well as at the committee markup when her nomination was favorably reported with bipartisan support. He is here to watch these proceedings today. It is clear this undoubtedly proud father instilled in his daughter the great resilience she has shown over the past 6 months.  As a Senator, as have other Senators, I have gotten to meet wonderful people from all walks of life, up to and including Presidents, but I have said many times before and I will say again that meeting Reverend Lynch was really a very special moment in this Senator's life.  Throughout Loretta Lynch's life, those who encountered her intelligence and her tenacity have not all been prepared to accept her and her impressive accomplishments. But at every point, the content of her character has shone through and led her to even greater heights.  In elementary school, administrators did not believe that Loretta Lynch could score as high as she did on a standardized test. They demanded that she retake the test. How could this young African-American girl score so high? She took the test again and her second score was even higher.  In high school, she rose to the very top of her class but had to share the title of valedictorian with two other students, one of whom was White, because school administrators feared an African-American valedictorian was too controversial. But that didn't hold her back, either. She kept going forward. She went on to graduate with honors from Harvard College, and then she went on and earned her law degree from Harvard Law School.  This has been the story of Loretta Lynch's life. While some are not ready to embrace her distinction, she marches forward with grace to prove she is even stronger and more qualified than her detractors can imagine. She has dedicated the majority of her remarkable career to public service, andwe are fortunate as a nation that she wants to continue to serve.  Ms. Lynch's record of accomplishments makes me confident she will be able to lead the Justice Department through the complex challenges it faces today.  One issue the outgoing Attorney General prioritized was the protection of Americans' right to vote. After the Supreme Court's disastrous ruling in Shelby County v. Holder, Republican governors and State legislatures exploited the decision and implemented sweeping voter suppression laws that disproportionately affect African Americans and other minorities. Ms. Lynch will have to continue the commitment to fighting voting rights for all Americans.  At a time of severe budget cuts for too many vital programs that help victims and support public safety, something must be done about the massive financial burden that is the Bureau of Prisons. One-third of DOJ's budget goes to BOP. This imbalance has largely been driven by our reliance on drug mandatory minimum sentences, which do not make us safer but are costing us plenty. These sentences explain why the United States has the largest prison population in the world. We must work together on more thoughtful solutions to address our mass incarceration problem.  Few issues affect communities and families as intimately as addiction. Vermont, like many parts of the country, has seen a recent surge in the abuse of heroin and other opioids. The Department must work with States to find solutions to support communities struggling with heroin and other opioids, and help them break the cycle of addiction.  The Attorney General will also be called upon to build on the sometimes strained relationship between law enforcement and communities of color, which has been exacerbated by the recent tragic events in Ferguson, New York, and South Carolina. Restoring that trust will be as great a responsibility as she will have while in office.  Nor are these issues of trust limited to local law enforcement. Just the other day, a Washington Post article detailed the fact that the Justice Department and the FBI acknowledged numerous instances of flawed testimony by FBI examiners over a two-decade period in connection with hair analysis evidence. This included dozens of cases involving defendants who were sentenced to death row. This troubling revelation means that the FBI must conduct a comprehensive analysis to prevent future breakdowns such as this.  The Justice Department must also keep up with the rapid development of technology. We must stay ahead of the curve to prevent and fight threats to cybersecurity and data privacy. The growing threat of cyber crime is very real but so is the specter of unchecked government intrusion into our private lives--particularly dragnet surveillance programs directed at American citizens. The intelligence community faces a critical deadline this June when three sections of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are set to expire. We must protect our national security and our civil liberties. We must work together to reform our Nation's surveillance laws so we can achieve both goals and restore the public's trust.  When President Obama announced his intention to nominate Ms. Lynch last November, I had the privilege of attending the White House ceremony. At that event, Ms. Lynch noted with admiration that ``the Department of Justice is the only cabinet department named for an ideal.'' Just think of that. The Department of Justice is named for an ideal--the ideal of justice. And having served as a State prosecutor, although not with the complexity she has encountered, I always felt that was an ideal to uphold, and she has. I believe that when Loretta Lynch is sworn in as our next Attorney General, she will work tirelessly to make that ideal a reality for all Americans.  As I said, I am sorry that for the first time, after 82 Attorneys General, we have to have a cloture vote. I have great respect for my friends in the Republican leadership, but I must say they sent an awful signal to America in saying that for the first time in 82 Attorneys General, we require a cloture vote for this highly qualified woman.  I yield the floor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the Guardian, Apr. 21, 2015]Loretta Lynch `Led the Nation' on Human Trafficking Despite Republican                                 Standoff                           (By Tom McCarthy)       Republican leaders say they'll hold up Lynch's confirmation      until trafficking bill passes--and yet Lynch has been one of      America's boldest pursuers of sex traffickers, Guardian      review reveals.       After almost six months, the Republican blockade on the      confirmation of Loretta Lynch as the next US attorney      general--once a grand fight over immigration, then banking      prosecutions, then abortion--appears headed for a final      legislative showdown over protecting victims of sex      trafficking.       But the biggest Congressional headache of the year--a      single cabinet nomination effectively hijacking the      legislative calendar--has culminated in ``a very sad irony'':      Lynch has been one of the country's premier guardians of      victims of sex trafficking, and a tireless scourge of sex      traffickers, a review of her record and conversations with      current and former colleagues reveal.       Lynch--according to prosecutors, officials and victims'      advocates familiar with her tenure as US attorney for the      eastern district of New York--has a prodigious history of      throwing sex traffickers in prison, breaking up prostitution      rings, rescuing underage victims forced to work as      prostitutes and reuniting mothers held captive by the rings      with their long-lost children.       Heading into what could be the final day of protracted      negotiations over her job as the nation's highest law      enforcement officer, Lynch's supporters spoke at length with      the Guardian about what they say is one of the most powerful      legacies of her tenure.       Republicans have not challenged Lynch's record as a      prosecutor of sex trafficking--or any other part of her      record. But Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell has clung      to an announcement that he would hold up her nomination until      the Senate completed work on the Justice for Victims of      Trafficking Act, which would create a compensation fund for      victims. Republican and Democratic senators are squabbling      over abortion language in the bill.       ``I had hoped to turn to her next week, but if we can't      finish the trafficking bill, she will be put off again,''      McConnell said. More than a month later, that hold is still      in place, although Republicans aides on Friday signaled      potential new movement on the nomination, after President      Obama called the delay ``embarrassing''.       To those with close knowledge of Lynch's record on human      trafficking, the hold-up has not been embarrassing, so much      as painfully wrong-headed--tantamount to holding the sheriff      back until crime goes away.       Carol Robles-Roman, who in 12 years as deputy mayor of New      York City worked closely with Lynch's office to stop young      girls from falling victim to sex traffickers, said Lynch had      made ``protecting the most vulnerable members of our society      a hallmark of her tenure''.       ``The irony that it's a trafficking bill that's holding      everything up is just . . . it's a very sad irony,'' said      Robles-Roman, who now runs the nonprofit Legal Momentum.      ``The fact of the matter is, with this record, she has been      one of the top leaders in the country around the fight      against human trafficking.       ``This is such a difficult area for prosecutors to wrap      their hands around. And her office, the eastern district, has      really distinguished itself in the cases that they have      brought, and the fearlessness that they have shown in      prosecuting these cases.''                 `Heinous' cases with real resolutions       Lori Cohen, director of the anti-trafficking initiative at      New York-based Sanctuary for Families, has worked closely      with Lynch's office, including to reunite victims of sex      trafficking with their children, who in multiple cases have      been held in Mexico by members of the trafficking      organization.       ``The eastern district prosecutors have been exceptional in      terms of their willingness to listen to the clients,'' Cohen      said. ``And I think that, frankly, that came from the top,      that came from the attorney general nominee. I think she has      always had a very high degree of professionalism, but also a      very strong sense of compassion for victims. And a strong      sense of justice, that people who are exploiting these      vulnerable immigrant women and children in the commercial sex      industry need to be held accountable.''       In the typical sex trafficking case prosecuted under Lynch,      a community services organization might tip off law      enforcement to the presence of a prostitution ring based in      Brooklyn or Queens, New York. Investigators would discover      many girls and young women living under the control of men      who forced them to work in brothels or who drove them around      the city, sometimes to as many as 20 assignments a day.       Anne Milgram, a former prosecutor on human trafficking      cases in the eastern district, who went on to serve as      attorney general of New Jersey and is now a senior fellow at      the New York University school of law, said one after another      of the trafficking cases were prosecuted because Lynch made      them a ``personal priority''.       ``Under her leadership, the eastern district has really led      the nation in this area,''     Milgram said. ``I really couldn't say enough good things      about both the office and Loretta Lynch's record on human      trafficking. If you look nationally to find a US attorney who      was as thoughtful and progressive in prosecuting human      trafficking cases, I don't think you could find one.''       Lynch's office has specialized in breaking up rings that      share a remarkable similarity. Members of family-based crime      syndicates in Mexico, in a repeated pattern, would seek out      young girls in poor, rural areas and make them promises of      love and a better life in the United States. Sometimes a      marriage would follow. And then the girls would be introduced      to a new life, in which they were coerced to work as      prostitutes. Obedience was enforced with rape, beatings,      imprisonment, and, in some cases, by threatening the lives of      children born of the corrupt ``love'' affairs.       ``Any trafficking victim is going to be suffering in a      tremendous physical and emotional harm, and pretty extensive      sexual abuse,'' Cohen said. ``But these particular Mexican      trafficking cases are so difficult for our victims because      usually the trafficker is an intimate partner. So it could be      a man who held himself out to be a boyfriend, or a fiance,      and in at least one case it's been a husband. Who courted a      client, who won her trust, and her love, and in a number of      cases had children with her.''       ``You just pull the facts of one of these cases, and      they're heinous,'' Robles-Roman said. ``They almost don't      sound real.''                 The most active record in the country       Lynch's office has specialized in breaking up these rings.      The eastern district of New York has delivered more than 55      indictments in human trafficking cases and rescued more than      110 victims, including at least 20 minors, in the past 10      years.       Under Lynch, the eastern district is currently prosecuting      at least five cases relating to the prostitution of US minors      or sex trafficking--more active prosecutions than any other      US attorney's office in the country, according to      knowledgeable observers.       In 2012, Lynch's office reunited a child and mother who had      been separated for more than 10 years when the woman was      taken from Mexico to New York and forced to work as a      prostitute. It was one of 18 such mother-and-child reunions      completed by the eastern district.       Cohen worked with a client who was reunited with her child      after a conviction by Lynch's office.       ``It was really very moving,'' Cohen said. ``My client had      been separated from her child for a number of years and was      really frantic about her child's safety. Frankly it's      terrifying for a victim to come forward and report the abuse,      when she is afraid that if word of her cooperation gets back      to her traffickers, there's very little protection available      for her child back in Mexico.       ``These clients, when they have children, they are mothers      first. And they'll do anything to protect their children. In      fact some of them continue to be trafficked because they were      afraid that if they stopped or refused, that their children      would be harmed.''       In December 2012, Lynch announced the extradition and      arraignment of four suspects from Mexico in two separate sex      trafficking cases. In 2013, Lynch sent a New York bar owner      and two co-defendants to prison for dozens of years each for      running a sex-trafficking ring between Central America,      Mexico and two bars on Long Island. In 2014, three brothers      convicted of sex trafficking were sentenced to double-digit      prison terms for enticing victims as young as 14 to be      transported illegally into the United States and forced to      work as prostitutes in New York City and elsewhere.       ``It's horrible to think that children in the United States      are being exploited sexually,'' said Robles-Roman. ``They      are. [But Lynch's] office has shown that they have the      courage, the know-how, and the expertise to prosecute these      people--some of them involving international criminal      enterprises.       ``From my perspective, somebody who has that vision, and      that eye, to protect our most vulnerable, can protect us all.      It is a fearlessness that we need in our attorney general.''       As of Monday, after what minority leader Harry Reid called      ``164 very long days'', there was still no Senate deal over      the abortion language in the trafficking legislation,      although signs emerged that a deal may be close.       If Republicans stick to their promise, it will then be      Lynch's turn. And if she is confirmed, to hear Lynch's former      colleagues tell it, the Senate will have made a difference on      behalf of society's most vulnerable.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rubio).
