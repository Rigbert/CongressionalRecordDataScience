 President, authority for the community policing program has expired, and I rise today to introduce legislation to extend that hugely successful program for another six years.  We created this program in 1994 as part of that year's crime bill. The COPS program has worked better than any of us could have hoped. Crime has gone down every year since the program has been in existence. We have invested over $7.5 billion to make our streets safer. 115,000 officers will be funded by the end of this fiscal year. 73,600 of those officers are on the beat today, over 200 of them in my own state of Delaware. Grants have been issued to more than 12,400 law enforcement agencies. Big cities and small towns have benefitted, and more than 82 percent of all COPS grants have gone to departments serving populations of 50,000 or less.  Community policing methods are taking hold across the country. A recent Justice Department study revealed that the number of community police officers nationwide increased by 400 percent between 1997 and 1999. Schools are benefitting: by the end of this fiscal year COPS will have funded almost 5,000 school resource officers. These are specially trained officers who work in schools to prevent crimes before they occur, mentor students, and assist school administrators in creating a safe learning environment. Since COPS started funding school resource officers, their numbers acrossthe country have shot up more than 40 percent.  When we passed the crime bill in 1994, we set a goal of funding 100,000 officers by 2000. That goal has been met. But the need for more officers, for technology to help those officers do their job more efficiently, and for more prosecutors so the cases investigated by the police can effectively be brought, continues unabated. The Justice Department reports that in the last two fiscal years, demand for new police hiring grants has outstripped available funds by a factor of almost three to one. To meet this need, the legislation I introduce today authorizes $600 million per year over the next 6 years, enough to hire up to 50,00 more officer. We have made this portion of the program more flexible: up to half of these hiring dollars can be use to help police departments retain those community police officers currently on payroll. In another change from current law, portion of these funds can be used for officer training and education.  The legislation also provides funding for new technologies, so law enforcement can have access to the latest high-tech crime fighting equipment to keep pace with today's sophisticated criminals. Also included are funds to help local district attorneys hire more community prosecutors. These prosecutors will expand the community justice concept and engage the entire community in preventing and fighting crime. The statistics we have on community prosecutions are quite promising, and we should increase the funds available to local prosecutors, a piece of our criminal justice puzzle that has too often gone overlooked.  We need to pass this bill. Already the administration has announced its intention to end the police hiring program, to dramatically scale back the community prosecution program, and to cut other critical state and local law enforcement programs. That is not the right approach. Crime is down, but it will not stay down. Preliminary FBI crime reports for 2000 indicate that we may be reaching the end of our eight straight years of decreasing crime. Last December, the FBI reported that crime was down in most big cities, but up in cities of less than 50,000 people. It was up 1.2 percent in the South, the nation's most populous region. Several of our largest cities have reported increases in their murder rates. Crime will not stay down, unless we dedicate the resources necessary for state and local law enforcement to do their job effectively.  This bill has the support of every major law enforcement organization in the country. Fifty senators are original cosponsors of the legislation, including five Republicans. I want to pay a special tribute to my friends on the other side of the aisle and thank them for listening to their mayors, police chiefs, and officers who told them this is the right thing to do. We should not play politics with public safety, and I hope we can pursue common-sense crime-fighting proposals without regard to party.  I would like to thank the men and women of law enforcement for their service and heroism in bringing about the longest lasting decrease in crime in this nation's history. Let's build on that success, and let's continue to give them the support they deserve, by reauthorizing the COPS program.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill, as well as several letters supporting its introduction, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 924       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Hon. Joseph Biden, Jr.,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Joe: On behalf of the members of the Police Executive      Research Forum (PERF), a national organization of police      professionals who serve more than 50 percent of our nation's      population, I wish to express our continued support of your      plans to adequately fund and reauthorize the COPS Office and      its many critical programs.       The COPS program has been a highly successful crime-     fighting initiative. The vast majority of COPS grant      recipients have put those funds to unprecedented good use.      With COPS funding, PERF members have hired more officers,      purchased critical technology, implemented innovative      problem-solving programs, and received valuable training and      technical assistance, all of which have played an important      role in advancing community policing across the country. But      the COPS Office's work is far from over.       Providing the citizens in our jurisdictions with safe      communities requires resources beyond local reach. The COPS      program's sole mission is to respond to the needs of local      law enforcement and it has delivered much-needed resources in      the fight against crime. Through this partnership with the      federal government, we have made tremendous advances in      community policing. We have always called for multi-year      reauthorization and full funding for this critical program.       PERF would welcome the opportunity to work with you to      increase the flexibility of COPS hiring funds and otherwise      ensure the COPS programs' long-term success. We thank you for      your tireless support of law enforcement.           Sincerely,                                                     Chuck Wexler,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                    National Association of Police                                          Organizations, Inc.,                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2001.     Hon. Joseph R. Biden, Jr.,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Joe: Please be advised that the National Association      of Police Organizations (NAPO) will be strongly supporting      your reintroduction of S. 1760, the ``PROTECTION Act.'' NAPO,      representing 4,000 unions and associations and 230,000 sworn      law enforcement officers, truly appreciates your effort to      reauthorize and continue the success of the COPS program.       As you know, NAPO strongly supported the passage of the      1994 Crime bill creating the COPS program. Since its      inception the COPS program has funded grants for over 110,000      community police officers. Most law enforcement officials and      the public recognize the benefits of putting more cops on the      street. The steady decline of violent crime over the last few      years is evidence of the success of this program.       We support your legislation that will extend the COPS      program for another six years and put up to 50,000 more      police officers on our streets and in our neighborhoods to      continue the success of community policing. We also strongly      support the funding of educational scholarships for active      law enforcement officers and new technology to help fight      crime.       NAPO is cognizant of the fact that we must not become      complacent with our past success. There is still a lot of      work to be done and we will continue to fight with you for      the resources needed to serve our communities adequately.      NAPO's position is that the declining crime rate is not an      excuse to disband the COPS program, but an opportunity to      hire more officers to further fight     and decrease violent crime that still permeates many of      America's communities.       If I can be of assistance on this or any other matter,      please have your staff contact me at (202) 842-4420.           Sincerely,                                                 Robert T. Scully,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                      International Brotherhood of                                              Police Officers,                                      Alexandria, VA, May 4, 2001.     Hon. Joe Biden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Biden: On behalf of the entire membership of      the International Brotherhood of Police Officers (IBPO), I      want to thank you for introducing legislation to reauthorize      the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program.       As the author of the 1994 Crime Bill you understand the      significance of the COPS program. Every crime statistic      available shows that America is a safer place to live since      we implemented the COPS program. The COPS program enables      communities to combat crime in the most effective way      possible--by putting more officers on the street.       I understand that they are opponents to the COPS program. I      urge them to talk to police officers in their states. The      IBPO believes that public safety is far too important to be      caught up in political debate. It would be a tragedy to cut      back on any efforts to fight crime at this critical juncture.       As the largest police union in the AFL-CIO, we have first      hand knowledge of what a success the COPS program is. We look      forward to working with you on this most important piece of      legislation.           Sincerely,                                                 Kenneth T. Lyons,     National President.                                  ____                               National Sheriffs' Association,                                     Alexandria, VA, May 21, 2001.     Hon. Joseph Biden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Biden: I am writing to you regarding the      Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program and your      bill, the Protection Act. We at the National Sheriffs'      Association (NSA) support COPS and we appreciate the      commitment made to law enforcement by Congress.       As you may know, sheriffs around the nation depend on the      COPS program to supplement their law enforcement      capabilities. Sheriffs need the additional funding provided      so that they can better protect and serve their communities.      The COPS program has been an overwhelming success and has had      a tangible and positive impact on crime reduction. Nearly      two-thirds of the sheriffs offices in the Nation have      benefited from grant funding from this program and the added      funding has made a significant difference in how we enforce      the law. A sheriff with a COPS grant can fight and control      crime while a sheriff without a grant is at the mercy of the      criminal. With the added capability that a COPS grant      provides, we have reduced crime, streets are safer and honest      law-abiding people feel secure in their communities.       NSA supports a flexible COPS program that allows sheriffs      to determine their own needs and apply for funds accordingly.      Sheriffs have overwhelming technology needs that can be      addressed through the COPS technology grant programs. These      programs have helped sheriffs purchase state-of-the-art      computer technology and communications equipment. In this      information age, it is more important than ever that we      strive to achieve telecommunications and systems      compatibility among criminal justice agencies, improve our      forensic sciences capability at the state and local level and      encourage the use of technologies to predict and prevent      crime. All of these will give law enforcement the advantage      over criminals. The total package of law enforcement support      that COPS provides is an integral part of crime control in      America.       In our view, COPS is a program that is vital to effective      law enforcement and to sheriffs in both rural and urban      jurisdictions. Without COPS, I firmly believe our communities      would be a little less safe and a little more dangerous.      Thank you again for your commitment to reducing crime. Know      that NSA will do our part in the fight against crime and      given the proper resources, we can truly make a difference.
