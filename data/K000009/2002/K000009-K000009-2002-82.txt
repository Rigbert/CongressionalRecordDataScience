Speaker, I wish to say this past week I have called on President Bush to request an emergency meeting of the United Nations security council for the purpose of enforcing a peacekeeping or enforcement action in the Middle East.  In the past few months the world has witnessed a frightening increase in the level of violence in the Middle East. In this 21st century, which we had hoped would be a century of peace, our children have watched on television over 2,000 more people killed in this unnecessary fighting between the Palestinians and Israelis. We have seen lives and neighborhoods destroyed. We have seen children blown up and shot. We have seen the hope for peace diminished. Innocent Israelis and Palestinians have been literally caught in the crossfire of violence.  To date, as many as 1,400 more Palestinians and 500 more Israelis have died. The situation is clearly out of control.  I applaud President Bush's demands that Israel and the Palestinian Authority step back from one another. But the Israelis have refused to comply with the President's demand and the Palestinians have refused to comply with the President's demand.  What happens in the Middle East is crucial to U.S. interests. What happens in the Middle East is crucial to the United States's war against terrorism. What happens in the Middle East is crucial to our economy. The Bush administration's initial policy of disengagement for almost an entire year was ill conceived. But with Secretary Powell's mission to the Middle East, we have some indication that the administration realizes how important it is to put the full weight of our diplomatic and foreign policy apparatus behind the search for peace.  The United Nations should approve a peacekeeping or an enforcement action that is international in scope, because if the two sides can be separated and a situation created for dialogue, the world may have an opportunity to move forward.  A U.N.-supported force, after bringing down the level of violence, could help provide for regional stability that is necessary for preserving the State of Israel's continuing right to exist and establishing an independent Palestinian state.  Americans, I suppose, could ask, Why are we there? Is it because of regional stability, or is it because of our own oil interests? Let me reference a complicating factor and urge Americans to think domestically what we can do here at home also to contribute to a solution.  U.S. dependence on imported petroleum remains our chief strategic vulnerability. We watch gas prices going up again, and we see the recession we are beginning to pull out of being triggered perhaps again because of a 20 percent increase in gas prices here at home. Too often our dependence on imported petroleum, including from places like the Middle East, have served as proxy for our foreign policy.  I will insert into the Record this week important articles written in USA Today, which the headline reads, ``Gas Prices Up 20 Percent and Rising,'' and its relationship to what is going on in Iraq, in spite of the embargo, providing us with a minimum of 8 percent of the petroleum that we import into this country every day.  I will also supply for the Record articles from the New York Times of yesterday talking about the missing energy strategy of the Bush administration.  We have got to get serious here at home. Over half the petroleum we use is imported from very unstable places. It is time for America to become energy independent.  And an article from the Times on Tuesday talking about Venezuela: ``Venezuela Woes Worsen as State Oil Company Calls Strike.'' This is going to impact prices here at home as well.  Who or what is leading our foreign policy? Are we promoting democracy or securing international oil interests as our primary goal? Americans here at home need to demand a declaring of energy independence.  The U.S. Energy Department headed by Spencer Abraham reported this week that consumers can expect no relief at the gas pump before fall and predicted that the average price of regular unleaded gas to be $1.46 between nowand September, and in many parts of the country it is higher already. In fact, prices went up 23 cents a gallon last month alone, the fastest monthly increase in history.  There is a connection between what is happening internationally and what is happening here at home. The same insatiable appetite for foreign oil drives our domestic policy. We gave over $4 billion in taxpayer dollars to Enron folks to protect their overseas natural gas and oil interests. If we had spent that money over the last 10 or 15 years on alternative fuel research and development here at home, we might be self-sufficient by now. And that is the direction our country needs to head. We need to have a Manhattan Project to the extent that we involve every single major research university in this country in helping us become energy independent and having a foreign policy again designed for democracy, not just oil.                [From the New York Times, Apr. 9, 2002]        Venezuela Woes Worsen as State Oil Company Calls Strike                            (By Juan Forero)       Merida, Venezuela, Apr. 8.--A six-week tussle over      President Hugo Chavez's management of the state oil company      has turned into his most serious crisis, with exports of oil      disrupted by a labor slowdown and a general strike called for      Tuesday by labor and business leaders.       ``This can only end with the president resigning,''      Humberto Calderon Berti, a former minister of energy and      mines, told a throng of protesting executives from the oil      company Petroleos de Venezuela in Carcas. ``All Venezuelans      from all walks of life, from all social strata, from all the      political and ideological sectors, must take part in the      stoppage. This is about him or us. It is a choice between      democracy or dictatorship.''       Government ministers said today that exports of oil and      refined products remained normal for Venezuela, the world's      No. 4 exporter. But analysts and executives from Petroleos de      Venezuela said a five-day work slowdown among oil workers and      managers had forced a scaling back of operations at several      refineries and a cutback in production at wellheads, all of      which has disrupted oil shipments to the United States and      other countries.       ``The reality is you don't have business as usual,'' said      Larry Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research      Foundation, an industry-supported consulting group in New      York. ``We believe half to two-thirds of their exports have      been impacted. But it is literally an hour-by-hour      situation.''       Latin America's fourth-largest economy may also grind to a      halt on Tuesday, as dissident business leaders have promised,      in protest against what they see as Mr. Chavez's autocratic      style of governing and his treatment of oil company managers.      The first such stoppage took place on Dec. 10. Millions of      workers stayed home as part of a growing wave of protests      aimed at forcing Mr. Chavez from power.       The showdown that has churned up the current crisis began      when Mr. Chavez, a left-leaning former army paratrooper who      won office in 1998, took on the management of Petroleos de      Venezuela, a behemoth with 40,000 employees. Calling it a      ``state within a state'' that sapped resources while      benefiting a small number of high-flying executives, Mr.      Chavez in February fired the company president, a general      whom he had appointed months earlier, and appointed five      board members with ties to his administration.       For many of the company's 15,000 office workers, who had      long celebrated it as a meritocracy known for efficiency and      high standards, the president's management decision was      enough. The workers organized protests and slowdowns, which      have won the support of leaders from business and labor, as      well as from the local media, which report every anti-Chavez      protest or pronouncement with relish.       With Mr. Chavez refusing to withdraw his appointments or      negotiate with dissident oil executives, the office workers      and production workers persisted with their slowdowns, which      have intensified since last week. At one drilling site on      Thursday, two oil workers were killed when fighting broke out      between government supporters and opposition party members.       The exact impact on oil production, refining and the      transport of crude and oil products was unclear today.       But analysts and executives said the Amuay Cardon refinery,      which processes 950,000 barrels of crude daily and is a      crucial supplier of finished oil products to the United      States, had reduced operations. At least two other      installations, the Palito refinery on the north-central coast      and Puerto La Cruz to the east halted operations, they said.       Dissident oil executives, reading a statement outside a      Petroleos de Venezuela office building in Caracas, said      extraction of oil was slowing in the Furrial field in the      east while refineries and plants that produce chemicals or      distribute natural gas were also ratcheting down.       ``Progressively everything is shutting down,'' said Alberto      Quiroz, an oil analyst and former executive at Petroleos de      Venezuela (which is known worldwide by its Spanish acronym,      Pdvsa, pronounced peh-deh-VEH-sah).       Top government officials, among them Vice President      Diosdado Cabello, Energy and Mines Minister Alvaro Silva, and      the oil company president, Gaston Parra, have sought to      minimize the effects of the slow-down.       ``Everything is normal,'' Mr. Silva told reporters. ``Go to      the refineries. Everything is normal. There is a small group      protesting, but everything is operating normally.''       The commander of the armed forces, Gen. Lucas Rincon,      announced that the military was beefing up its presence at      refineries and oil fields, which are routinely protected by      the National Guard.       Through it all, Mr. Chavez has refused to back down or      acknowledge that the slowdown could hurt Venezuela, whose      economy relies on oil for 80 percent of exports and 50      percent of government revenues.       In a long nationally televised address on Sunday, the      president said the military could run oil production and      refining sites if necessary. He also took the opportunity to      announce that he had fired 7 dissident executives and forced      12 more to retire.       Blowing a soccer referee's whistle and calling the      executives ``off sides,'' Mr. Chavez warned about a      ``subversive movement in neckties'' trying to destabilize the      country. But, he warned, ``I can do away with all of them,''      he said.       Rafael Sandrea, president of the oil committee of      Fedecamaras, a powerful business group, said Mr. Chavez's      uncompromising approach had only made the opposition that      much more defiant.       ``The president has closed the door of reconciliation and      opened the doors for war,'' Mr. Sandrea said. ``That is what      this is now, war, between the people of PDVSA and the      government.''                                  ____                    [From USA Today, April 9, 2002]                      Gas Prices Up 20% and Rising              (By James R. Healey and Barbara Hagenbaugh)     experts fear higher energy costs could put brakes on recovery       Gasoline, blood of the economy and soul of consumers, is      20% more expensive than a month ago--like finding out that      sport-utility vehicle you want is now $30,000 instead of      $25,000, or that the suit you're planning to buy is $600, not      $500.       That's the kind of price inflation we associate with South      American or Eastern European countries that supposedly lack      U.S. economic stability.       The bad guys in this case aren't obvious. The big fuel-     price climb is due mainly to a complicated switch to summer-     blend fuel from winter blend, required by federal air      pollution regulations; by the routine and seasonal rise in      crude oil prices; and by a strike in Venezuela that's keeping      oil off tankers.       Only after ticking through that list are the experts and      analysts--if not politicians--ready to name Iraq's just-     announced 30-day oil-export boycott, fears that the USA will      invade Iraq and the Israeli-Palestinian tinderbox as      underlying causes. (Story, 2B.)       Consultants, analysts and other experts think the      nationwide average price should peak near $1.60 a gallon,      perhaps within a month. The government said $1.46 Monday,      before the Iraqi export embargo. Experts also foresee a      chance of local shortages, as refineries making ingredients      for specific summer blends are overtaxed or have mechanical      problems.       Not cheery, but not as bad as the last two summers, when      fuel passed $2 in some places and the Midwest ran short      because of refinery and pipeline problems.       More broadly and ultimately more important: Fuel price      increases could blunt whatever edge the economic rebound has      honed, although economists and experts say it shouldn't      flatten the recovery.       ``I certainly don't regard it as being helpful,'' says      William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St.      Louis.       Higher energy prices ``act like a tax on consumers and      businesses. The key is how long the rise is sustained and how      high it will go,'' says Richard Berner, chief economist at      Morgan Stanley. If they stay at today's level, it'll cut      economic growth 0.4 of a percentage point, which he calls      ``not a big deal.''       Price of benchmark light, sweet crude oil closed at $26.54      a barrel Monday, and Berner says that would need to ``go      north of $35'' to be ``a serious concern.''       Crystal Siembida of Columbiana, Ohio, puts a finer point on      it: ``I can hardly afford to pay the price of gas as it is,''      and thinks she might have to switch to carpooling or      bicycling to work if the price keeps rising.       Bonnie Sporn of Los Angeles drives a Jeep Cherokee SUV and      says she deals differently with her friends now that prices      are up: ``In the past, if I drove with my friends on an      extended trip, I did not expect them to contribute gas money.      Things have changed . . . . We figure out the portions we all      owe for gas before we get out of the car.''       Beyond gasoline, higher oil prices also translate into      higher heating oil and jet fuel prices. Both have the      potential to hurt the recovery. But heating oil season has      ended, ``so it's not going to crunch household budgets'' as      it has the past few years, says Paul Taylor, chief economist      for the National Automobile Dealers Association.       Still, price hikes will discourage some driving and car      buying, he says, and will push on industries such as      utilities that generate electricity using oil and chemical      manufacturing that uses crude oil.       Jet fuel is the second-biggest cost for airlines, after      labor. And that fuel is up about 40% this year, 71 cents a      gallon Monday. Airlines, though, often contract in advance      for fuel at a specific price to avoid big swings. Airlines      and private jet operators don't appear to be buying less.      There's been ``a lot of fussing,'' says Ed Hayman, vice      president of supply for World Fuel Service to Miami, but ``we      haven't seen a cutback.                             pushing costs       A look at what's driving prices: Summer-blend gas. The      Environmental Protection Agency can fine a service station      $27,500 a day for selling winter-blend fuel after May 1, so      the switch has to begin now. Fuel evaporates into the air and      pollutes it easier in hot weather, so summer gas is made to      compensate.       But there are more than 100 types of summer fuel across the      USA. Some, such as in the Mid-west, require ethanol--grain      alcohol--to support area farmers. Ethanol must be mixed      locally and distributed by trucks. If an ethanol plant or a      refinery supplying the special gas to blend with ethanol has      trouble, there's an immediate shortage threat, and prices      spike.       Last Aug. 14, for instance, the Lemont refinery outside      Chicago caught fire, stopping production of fuel needed for      the area's unique ethanol blend. By Aug. 16, the average      wholesale price there jumped 12.1 cents a gallon, and pump      prices averaged 12 cents higher than the day before the fire.       Crude oil prices. They rise and fall with demand. Crude oil      accounts for about 38% of gasoline's price. The retail gas      price hike ``is mostly crude and the changeover to summer      fuel. Everybody tries to read more into the numbers, but that      explains what's going on,'' says Alan Struth, oil market      consultant at Energy Insights.       Venezuelan strike. Oil-market experts worried more about      Venezuela than about the Arab nations Monday. Workers at the      state-owned oil company known as PDVSA have been protesting      management changes mandated by President Hugo Chavez for      about six weeks. Venezuela is a major supplier of gasoline      and heating oil to the USA. If a strike there lasted a week,      the USA would feel the pinch, Struth says. ``It's that      tight.''                          saddam makes a move       Despite mutterings it would happen, Iraqi leader Saddam      Hussein's pledge to sell no oil for 30 days unless Israel      withdraws from the West Bank caught traders and politicians      by surprise Monday and sent crude prices up.       Reassurances from the U.S. government and international      energy officials were prompt, but the boycott nonetheless      could cause disruptions. And disruptions cause oil traders      fits.       Monday ``was another wild and wooly day,'' says Peter      Beutel of Cameron Hanover, which advises companies at risk      when energy prices change drastically. ``Prices shot up. They      did come back down, but at one point, prices did look as if      they would roar out of control,'' he says.       Even before Iraq, ``the market was primed,'' Beutel says.      ``We are in the pre-summer urgency period. Everybody says,      `If I don't get it now I won't have enough,' '' because      summer driving uses up stockpiles of gas. This summer's      demand is expected to be a record 8.8 million barrels a day.       Even though other members of OPEC--the Organization of      Petroleum Exporting Countries--are expected to make up for      any Iraqi shortfall, ``there is the whole exercise of      flipping the switches,'' Beutel points out.       ``Saudi Arabia can go ahead and increase production today,      but the oil takes three or four weeks to get out of the      ground and into a tanker. And the Saudis won't do that unless      they're sure he's serious, so there's the whole question of      how serious is Saddam?''       It would be May before increases by other oil exporters      would show up in the USA.       And to heck with it, anyway, says Sherry Jones Nelson of      suburban Minneapolis. She'll take her usual long-distance      driving vacation, regardless: ``We won't let any company, or      country, stop us.''                                  ____                      The Missing Energy Strategy       The events of the past year--prominently, a power crisis in      California and the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11--gave the      nation many reasons to reexamine its energy strategy. Now      comes another: Saddam Hussein's decision to halt oil imports      to the United States, at least temporarily, in retaliation      for Washington's support of Israel.       In an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this      week. President Bush warned that the recent 20 percent jump      in oil prices could threaten economic recovery. While Iraq      accounts for about 8 percent of America's imports, according      to Washington's estimates, there is spare oil capacity in the      system, and thus there should be no petroleum shortage if      other Middle Eastern producers refuse to follow Baghdad. Even      so, Mr. Hussein's action draws attention once again to      America's dependence on imported oil, including oil supplied      by the troubled countries of the Persian Gulf. It also points      to Washington's sorry failure to devise a balanced strategy      to reduce America's reliance on gulf imports and give itself      greater maneuvering room in the war on terrorism and other      foreign policy issues as well.       The Senate, which has resumed debate on the energy bill, is      the last hope for such a strategy. Admittedly, the prospects      are dimmer than they were a month ago, when the Senate took      up an imperfect but honorable measure cobbled together by      Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico and Tom Daschle, the majority      leader. The bill included a mix of incentives for new      production of fossil fuels, largely natural gas, along with      provisions aimed at increasing energy efficiency and the use      of renewable energy sources. As such it stood in stark      contrast to a grievously one-sided House bill that provided      $27 billion in incentives for the oil, gas and coal      industries and less than one-quarter that amount for      efficiency. The House bill also authorized the opening of the      Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil exploration and      drilling.       On its first big test, however, the Senate collapsed under      industry and union pressure and rejected a provision      requiring the first increase in fuel economy standards since      1985. To Mr. Daschle's dismay, Democrats deserted the cause      of fuel conservation in droves; New York's senators, Charles      Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, were among the honorable      exceptions. The only bright moment in a dismal two weeks of      debate and defeat was the approval of a ``renewable portfolio      standard'' that would require utilities to generate between 5      and 10 percent of their power from wind, solar and other      forms of renewable energy.       There are several things the Democrats and their moderate      Republican allies can do to produce a respectable bill.      First, they must defeat any amendment aimed at opening the      Arctic refuge to drilling. Such an amendment is almost      certain to be offered by Frank Murkowski of Alaska, but the      facts are not on his side. Every available calculation--     including those that accept Mr. Murkowski's inflated      estimates of the amount of oil underneath the refuge--show      that much more oil can be saved by fuel efficiency than by      drilling.       Next, they must resist efforts to weaken the renewable      energy provision, while defending energy efficiency measures      that have yet to be voted on--chiefly a provision that would      increase efficiency standards for air-conditioners by 30      percent. The Senate should also preserve a useful provision      that would require companies to give a public accounting of      their production of carbon dioxide and other so-called      greenhouse gases. On the supply side, it can take steps to      improve the reliability of the nationwide electricity grid,      while increasing incentives for smaller and potentially more      efficient producers of power.       These are modest measures, less ambitious than the Senate's      original agenda. But at least they point in the right      direction, toward a strategy that includes conservation as      well as production.                          ____________________
