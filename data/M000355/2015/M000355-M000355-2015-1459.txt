 President, we will have a busy day of voting today. Senators should expect two rollcall votes at approximately 10:45 a.m. this morning and up to six rollcall votes starting at 2 p.m. to finish the antitrafficking bill. I filed cloture on the Lynch nomination last night, and under the regular order, that cloture vote would occur 1 hour after the Senate convenes tomorrow.                          ____________________
