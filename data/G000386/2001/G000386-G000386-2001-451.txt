 President, I rise today to introduce legislation aimed at protecting Social Security benefits of some of the most vulnerable people in our society.  Today, I am introducing, along with my colleagues Senator Breaux and Senator Burns, the Social Security Beneficiaries Protection Act of 2001. This legislation, identical to legislation introduced in the 106th Congress, is meant to provide additional safeguards for beneficiaries with organizational representative payees. Sometimes, beneficiaries are not capable of managing their benefits on their own. Usually, in these situations, a family member or close friend manages their benefits for them. However, there are those who, for whatever reason, don't have family or friends who are able to act as the representative payee. In those cases an organizational representative payee can handle their benefit checks.  Approximately, 750,000 Social Security beneficiaries have an organization handling their monthly checks. These organizations include social service agencies, banks and hospitals. Most of these organizations provide a much needed service.  However, in the spring of last year, the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chaired at the time, held a hearing examining the fraudulent misuse of benefits by some organizational representative payees. The hearing highlighted the findings of an investigation conducted by the Social Security Administration's, SSA, Office of Inspector General, OIG. James Huse, Inspector General for SSA testified that since fiscal year 1998 the Social Security Administration has identified over $7.5 million in losses to beneficiaries. In several of those cases, hundreds of individuals were victims of severe abuses by organizational representative payees.  Another witness at the hearing, Ms. Betty Byrd testified to the hardship that is placed on a beneficiary who is the victim of a dishonest representative payee. Ms. Byrd was 70 years old and required a representative payee because of an extended hospital stay 100 miles from her home, followed by placement in an assisted living facility. Her fee-for-service organizational representative payee, Greg Gamble, was responsible for collecting Ms. Byrd's benefits and paying her utility bills, medical expenses, and rent. However, Mr. Gamble had his own ideas for how to spend Ms. Byrd's money. He stopped paying her rent and as a result she was forced to sell her trailer. The power was turned off because he stopped paying her utility bills. Her care facility informed her that Mr. Gamble was several months behind on her payments. The nursing home threatened to evict her. In her own words she was left, ``almost homeless, without medical care, and in serious financial trouble.'' Mr. Gamble was caught and pled guilty to using his clients' benefits for his own purposes. He has agreed to pay back $303,314.  The primary purpose of this legislation, which is based on recommendations by Social Security Administration Office of Inspector General, is to provide immediate relief to victims of representative payee fraud. By providing SSA with the authority to re-issue benefits victims would be made whole again.  This legislation would also provide for additional accountability by payees to the SSA in an effort to prevent abuses from taking place in the future. While the Social Security Administration does have a selection process in place, it needs strengthening.  The Social Security Beneficiaries Protection Act of 2001 would require that non-governmental fee-for-service organizational representative payees be licensed and bonded. Under current law, an organization representative payee is only required to get one or the other.  For any month in which the Social Security Commissioner or the courts have determined that an organizational representative payee misused all or part of an individual's benefits he or she would be required to forfeit the fees. The legislation would also make the representative payee liable for any misused benefits.  Ms. Byrd's story demonstrates there is a need for stronger safeguards to protect the elderly and disabled who require an organizational representative payee. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation and help protect the most vulnerable Social Security beneficiaries.                                 ______                                       By
