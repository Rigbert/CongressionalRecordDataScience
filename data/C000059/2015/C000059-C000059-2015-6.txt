Speaker, on December 2, ISIS sympathizers attacked and killed 14 and injured another 22 in San Bernardino, California. Police and first responders put their lives on the line rescuing survivors and capturing the perpetrators. However, localities have faced unexpected costs as a result of this attack.  I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Culberson), the chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Subcommittee, to discuss DOJ counterterrorism funding in the bill.
