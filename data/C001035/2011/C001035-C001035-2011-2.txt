President, I would like to voice my concerns regarding two provisions included in the conference report, sections 321 and 327. These provisions constitute a major rewrite of depot policies and laws.  These sections have not been sufficiently vetted. They could potentially hurt competition in acquisition programs, harm our public depots, and cause unintended consequences that could significantly affect not only depots, but also the private sector industrial base and the thousands of employees in both sectors.  In February, the Logistics Management Institute, LMI, delivered a report to Congress making recommendations to modify the depot statutes. Both Armed Services Committees asked DOD to offer input on the LMI study, but the Department did not do so.  The Senate held DOD to account in the committee report accompanying this very bill, which states:       The committee is concerned that a lack of Department of      Defense input regarding the findings and recommendations of      the LMI study does not provide Congress with a comprehensive      view prior to enacting legislation that could have unintended      consequences.  But even without DOD input, the House went ahead and included changes to depot provisions when it passed its bill in May.  The Senate-passed bill also included a provision to prohibit any change to the definition of depot maintenance until after the Defense Business Board conducted its own study as well.  Given the concern identified by the Senate Armed Services Committee and the requests for additional fact-based analysis, you can imagine my alarm when I learned that such a rewrite was being considered for inclusion in the conference report.  What surprised me even more was that the proposed rewrite differed significantly even from the provision in the original House-passed bill.  The Senator from Oklahoma, Senator Inhofe, and I voiced our concerns about this in a meeting of the conferees. After that, six Senators and I sent a letter to the leadership of both committees warning of the unintended consequences of including these provisions in the conference report. I ask unanimous consent to have our letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                 Washington, DC, December 9, 2011.     Hon. Carl Levin,     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, Washington, DC.     Hon. John McCain,     Ranking Member, Senate Armed Services Committee, Washington,          DC.       Dear Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain: As conferees      to the Fiscal Year 2012 National Defense Authorization Act      Conference, we write to voice our concerns with the HASC      proposal regarding Sections 321 and 322 of the House bill.      While we appreciate the attempt to improve the depot and      shipyard related statutes, none of our offices were advised      or consulted regarding these last minute changes being      proposed by the     HASC or consulted during the last several months as these      provisions were apparently being crafted.       Only a few conferees received the new proposed language on      December 7th, but we are all now being asked to support new      language that will have far reaching implications on aviation      depots, shipyards, arsenals, and ammunition plants across the      United States. It is inappropriate to attempt legislative      changes that could affect more than 100,000 jobs, public and      private, across the United States without careful vetting and      ensuring there will be no unintended consequences.       While we support improvements to operations at our depots,      shipyards, arsenals, and ammunition plants, the HASC proposed      changes to the definitions of depot level maintenance could      have profound and enduring negative consequences to the      industrial base and ultimately the readiness of our force.      Given the lack of transparency and abbreviated conference      timeline, we request that you not include Sections 321 and      322 of the House bill in the FY12 NDAA Conference Report. We      further recommend that we begin to work together as soon as      possible regarding the possibility of incorporating a more      thoroughly considered version of this language in the Fiscal      Year 2013 NDAA.       Thank you for your consideration in this matter. A similar      letter has been sent to Chairman McKeon and Ranking Member      Smith.           Respectfully,     James M. Inhofe.     Jeff Sessions.     Susan Collins.     Jeanne Shaheen.     Kay Hagan.     Saxby Chambliss.     Kelly Ayotte.
