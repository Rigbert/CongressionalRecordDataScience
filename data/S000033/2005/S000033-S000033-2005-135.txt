 Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  My good friend mentioned what has happened since China has joined the WTO. I think he has neglected to mention that our trade deficit with China has soared, that millions of jobs have left the United States to go to China.  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Waters).
