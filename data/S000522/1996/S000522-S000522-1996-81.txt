Mr. Chairman, the recent debate on legislation to ban partial-birth abortion was America's wake-up call on the inherent violence of abortion. Somehow, the euphemisms and attempts to sanitize the killing of unborn kids did not work as well that time as it has in the past.  Somehow, the seemingly benign, always self-assured pro-abortion lobby, including the folks at Planned Parenthood and NARAL, did not look so humane or caring as most in the Congress and a huge majority of American public reacted with shock, dismay and disgust when they learned that some abortionists were routinely delivering babies most of the way, only to stab the child in the back of the head with scissors and then suck the brains out of his or her head.  Most of us recognize child abuse when we see it, which brings me to the DeLauro amendment. When President Clinton issued an Executive order on January 22, 1993, to turn DOD health care facilities into abortion mills, every military obstetrician, nurse, and anesthesiologist refused to comply. In other words, they refused to destroy unborn babies.  That, Mr. Chairman, is moral courage.
