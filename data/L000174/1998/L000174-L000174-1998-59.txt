President, my very good friend, Robert Lanctot, died after a courageous bout with cancer. Bob, and his wife Betty, were two very special friends of my wife and I.  When I first ran for the Senate in 1974, Bob helped me in an area of the state where no Democrat could ever expect to get votes. Everybody told him I couldn't win, but he persevered and not only did I win, but went on in subsequent elections to carry the area significantly. I have always felt that a large part of that was do to Bob Lanctot.  Notwithstanding our close friendship, Bob never requested anything for himself or his family from me. He did, however, continuously speak out for those people who did not have a strong voice in Washington. He truly believed in helping working families and those who have always made our state and our country strong. We have lost a special Vermonter, and I ask unanimous consent that the obituary from the Caledonia' Record be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Caledonian-Record, Sept. 21, 1998]       Lanctot: Robert ``Bob'' L. Sr., 77, formerly of Peacham and      St. Johnsbury, died at his daughter and son-in-law's home in      Waterford Sunday morning, Sept. 20, 1998.       He was born in St. Johnsbury Feb. 28, 1921, the last      surviving child of Archie and Ann (Brunelle) Lanctot. He      married Betty L. Farnham; together they raised six children.      Betty predeceased him, Sept. 12, 1996, and the oldest son      Robert predeceased his mother in January of 1996.       Bob was a great believer in the rights of the common      worker. He was president of the Northeast Kingdom Labor      Council for a number of years, served as vice president of      the state labor council, and was a very active member of      local 5518. He was the delegate to the state labor convention      for the last 25 years and was recognized by the Vermont State      labor council AFL-CIO for his significant contributions to      that organization, the labor movement and Vermont working      families. Bob was a working Vermonter, retiring from Vermont      America in 1982.       Bob was a strong Democrat. He was an active and valuable      member of the Caledonia County Democratic committee. He held      many positions over the years with the Vermont State      Democratic Party, including the platform committee, and most      recently served on the state executive board.       He was a veteran of World War II and a member of Sheridan      Council 421 Knights of Columbus. He also served on the board      of directors of NEKCA and Vermont State Council on      Alcoholism.       He is survived by five children, Patricia Ann Salomonson of      Manchester, N.H., James Lanctot and wife Kathy of      Lyndonville, Judith Syx of Hartland, Richard Lanctot of      Burlington, and Elaine Robinson and husband Thomas of      Waterford; 14 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren; a      daughter-in-law, Judy Woods Lanctot of Jamaica Plain, Mass.;      several nieces and nephews and a multitude of friends. He was      predeceased by brothers Lester, Philip and William, and a      sister Agnes.       A funeral Mass will be celebrated Wednesday at 11 a.m. at      St. John's Church. Burial will be at the convenience of the      family at Peacham Cemetery. Visiting hours will be held at      the funeral home Tuesday from 6-8 p.m.       Memorial contributions, marked for hospice, may be directed      to Caledonia Home Health & Hospice, P.O.
