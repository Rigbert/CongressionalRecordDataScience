Speaker, my congressional district in Riverside, California is extremely fortunate to have a dynamic and dedicated group of community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give of their time and talents to ensure the well-being of our city and county. These individuals work tirelessly to develop voluntary community action to improve the community's economy, its education, its environment and its overall quality of life. One individual, who is a member of this group, is Tom Kenney.  On the 19th of March, Tom will be honored with the Ira D. ``Cal'' Calvert Distinguished Service Award by the Corona-Norco Family YMCA. The award is given in memory of my father, ``Cal'' Calvert, and his enumerable philanthropic gifts to the community and his efforts to encourage others to serve their community in a similar fashion. The award recognizes Tom for his exceptional devotion to developing community volunteerism.  Tom was born in Pennsylvania, but moved to California during his service with the Navy. He met and married Barbara Keith, a school teacher in the Corona-Norco Unified School District, attended Riverside Community College and graduated from the University California, Riverside. After 12 years with Prudential Insurance Company, and earning an M.B.A. from University of Southern California, Tom moved to take what became a series of executive jobs. In 1995, Tom and Barb, with their sons Christopher and Patrick, took the opportunity to purchase the Key-Freeman Agency and move back to their California home. Tom has been involved in many community organizations, serving on the boards of Corona-Norco United Way, the Corona Rotary Club, the Corona Library Foundation, and the Corona Chamber of Commerce.  Tom's tireless passion for community service has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California. Tom has been the heart and soul of many community organizations and events and I am proud to call Tom a fellow community member, American and friend.                          ____________________
