I echo his sentiments. I think he has expressed very eloquently the major points we have been talking about this afternoon.  I would just like to briefly say that again we are trying to create a responsive, streamlined process that saves the American people money and aggravation, particularly businesspeople.  What I would regret very much is that 6 months, a year from now, if this legislation becomes law, if we saw articles about a Federal agency spending $1.6 million proposing a regulation and doing a regulatory impact analysis for a regulatory matter that was, say, much less than that. You can pick out an abundant amount of examples, raising, lowering bridges, setting time zones. All these things potentially could have a $50 million impact triggering this procedure, but I think the American people would say why are we spending money doing something we have done year in and year out which has very little effect at all on small business or most Americans or if it does have an effect it is not at all deleterious or harmful.  I think again we have to be very, very careful. If we stick with what seems to be working, which is the $100 million threshold, I believe we will have a bill that is better than the present model and one that we can support strongly.  Again, I would urge everyone to support the amendment to raise the threshold to $100 million.
