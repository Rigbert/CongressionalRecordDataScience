Over 2,000 studies have established a causal relationship between certain work patterns and certain injuries.  I also say to the Senator from New York that this large volume I referred to earlier from the Centers for Disease Control, which is not a political organization--it is an organization dedicated to public health in America--concluded after one of their more recent studies as follows:       A substantial body of credible epidemiological research      provides strong evidence of an association between      musculoskeletal disorders and certain work-related physical      factors when there are high levels of exposure, and      especially in combination with exposure to more than one      physical factor; that is to say, repetitive lifting of heavy      objects in extreme or awkward postures.  So the Senator from New York is correct. The evidence is in. There is need for standard of protection.
