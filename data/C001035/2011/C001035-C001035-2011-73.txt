President, I thank everybody for their cooperation. We worked long and hard on this bill. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin. He raises an excellent point. I thank the majority leader. I thank Senator Alexander and Senator Schumer, who are the chief sponsors of this bill, and Senator Lieberman. I am very glad we were able to work out this agreement and that we will be able to have final votes on the amendments and final passage tomorrow.  Thank you, Mr. President.
