Mr. Speaker, recently the Helsinki Commission, which I chair, held a briefing on political and human rights developments in Banja Luka, the second largest city in Bosnia. Among the participants was the Most Reverend Franjo Komarica, Roman Catholic Bishop of Banja Luka. Bishop Konmarica has steadfastly pursued peace and justice throughout the 4-year-long war of armed aggression and genocide in Bosnia which has left his church in ruins despite the fact that no large-scale fighting occurred in the diocese.  Catholics from the region, predominately ethnic Croats, have been, and continue to be subjected to various forms of harassment and violence. An estimated 90 percent of Catholics have fled the diocese, many the victims of ethnic cleansing. Scores of churches have been destroyed while virtually all of those left standing sustained at least some damage. Several members of the clergy and religious were murdered during the course of the war. Meanwhile, Father Tomislav Matanovic, the former director of Caritas Banja Luka, is missing and believed to be held by Bosnian Serb forces of the 43d Brigade. Bishop Komarica, who was under house arrest for much of 1995, has demonstrated his firm commitment to peace and justice for all people of Banja Luka, regardless of their ethnic or religious background. Strengthened by his faith, Bishop Komarica is a leading advocate of reconciliation in a country rent by violence and war.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that the text of Bishop Komarica's opening statement be placed in the Record.The Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe--Banja Luka-Ethnic         Cleansing Paradigm, or Counterpoint to a Radical Future   opening statement by most reverend franjo komarica roman catholic                   bishop of banja luka--june 11, 1996       Bishop Komarica: (through interpreter). Honorable friends,      I greet you today as friends of peace and God-loving people.      I thank you for your interest specifically regarding Banja      Luka, my home town. I thank you for this opportunity given to      me to express my concerns and my hopes for my country. I      thank you on behalf of all the citizens of my city,      regardless of their national or state orientation.       You know that I'm a Catholic bishop and not a political      representative of any specific group. I'm not assuming the      representation neither of Croatian people specifically, nor      Bosnian Muslims or Serb people in this territory.      Regretfully, there is no politician available or existing      right now to represent the views of my country, of my city,      especially to represent the views of the people, of tens of      thousands of voiceless people who have no voice.       As a leader and a Christian, I have an obligation to help      all the people in their effort to be human and to be God-     loving people. I would like to help every human being to      affirm their human rights and their freedom and to establish      their right to existence. It is now six years that hundreds      of thousands of people whose basic human rights have been      taken away and denied.       That is the right to life, the right to professions, the      right to possess homes and live, the right to have a country,      the right to work and to secure a living, the right to have a      social and security support, the right of movement, the right      to freedom of religion, the right to raise your own children      in your own convictions, the right of freedom of conscience,      the right of equality of being free to belong to a political      or a different faith group.       We cannot talk at all about these rights for thousands of      our citizens. The denial of basic human rights has taken      place without the presence of any media or any voice to      publicly declare this. We had the impression that we are      forgotten in our corner of the world. We were strengthened      only by our faith in our God, whom we trust that he has      the potential to redeem us.       And this thing that I once again mention is really the      basis, that we try to respect all our neighbors and not do      any harm to any one of them. As in other parts of Bosnia      there were confrontations, armed confrontations and clashes,      in this part of Bosnia there was no war and no open conflict      between different groups of different nationalities or      faiths.       We opted for a different option here. We rather accepted      denial of our basic human rights than to hurt our neighbors      and to establish conflict. We are talking here about people      who have been peaceful and made every single effort to remain      people who respect others and try to live together. The only      blame that they receive is that they did not belong to a side      or a group of people who by all means and by all forces and      by brutal approach has tried to establish ethnically cleansed      territory.       The biggest number, the highest percentage, of the people      in this region, be they Serbs or Bosnian Muslims or      Croatians, have a desire to remain in peaceful coexistence in      this region. The Catholic Croatians in this region have shown      by their behavior that they are capable and ready to live      together, capable to live together in peace with the other      two peoples, which are namely Serbs and Bosnian Muslims.       This desire to live in peace is denied by the members of      the existing political structure, and despite all our efforts      to live the commandment of respect and love for others, to      love those who did so much evil to us, we are brutally hurt      again and again and punished for no reason, and not just from      the side of extreme nationalists, but those by international      democrats.       We ask all those who still crush our human rights: ``Why      are you doing this to us? Are we people for you? Are we human      beings for you? We ask for the basic human rights that you      enjoy. If we are guilty, we would ask you to provide it to      us, and if we are not guilty, then you are doing great      injustice to us when you are denying to us basic human      rights.''       I am taking this opportunity to tell you and to express to      all American peaceloving people, God has given you in this      country a generosity of the heart. Your land is almost like a      garden, that there are many wonderful plants and beautiful      flowers. You are a garden of different people, different      cultures, different groups and religions.       The common characteristic of all of you is the freedom and      love for peace and respect. In this country, it's especially      appreciated especially important human rights and human honor      and human dignity. These are the precious gifts to our      civilization, the gifts emphasizing diverse cultures and      multi-faced religion.       You are an ideal and an example for us, and you are a      leader for so many other people in the world. When we would      affirm similar in Banja Luka, we are punished for that. You      know that. Will you with clear conscience allow, continue to      allow, that the basic human rights are still denied in my      city and in my country? And they are being punished just      because they would like to be like you--free, human and      democratic people.       I expect an answer from you, which you have to give unto      your conscience first and then to your people and then to the      world and then hopefully to us as well.       Regardless of how you look at us and for what you think of      us, we in Banja Luka are definitely fighting. With enormous      efforts, we try to protect and restore civilization. I hope      that we will not remain alone in this effort. We hope that      we'll find friends who will support us in this effort. We      hope to find these supporters in Europe and especially here      in the United States. I am quite sure that I will not be      disappointed in this expectation.       Thank you for listening.                          ____________________
