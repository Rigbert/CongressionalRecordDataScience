Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I must say I find it very interesting here close to 10 p.m. Washington time that we have had walked to the floor less than a half an hour ago the bill that we are going to be asked to vote on tomorrow. This is likely to be the last item of business tonight. This bill is 105 pages long, and I must say I am extremely disappointed that I could not even get 20 minutes to talk about a measure that has been worked on in this Congress for several years, and now under the unusual, unusual procedure of bringing up a major bill like this with constitutional implications it is brought up under suspension, and I, as the only person in opposition here with perhaps the exception of one other are allowed 10 minutes. Mr. Speaker, I will not yield time at this point, having so few minutes myself.  Mr. Speaker, any reasonable person would ask why the silence. Why are we being silenced and not allowed to explore some of the questions that have troubled us over several years?  I listened very carefully to those that have been involved in these negotiations: the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Burton), the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo), the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell).  Frankly I was not involved in the negotiations that have been occurring here over the last several weeks. There were two meetings I think in my office where we tried to gain clarification of language that never came back, and I would like to ask the chairman of the full committee, if I might, my good friend, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble), if this bill before us, H.R. 1907, is the same bill that was voted out of the Committee on the Judiciary on May 24 of this year, 1999.  Is this the same bill?
