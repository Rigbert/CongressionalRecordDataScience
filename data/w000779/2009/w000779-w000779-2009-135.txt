President, it is not my intention to object. I simply wanted to engage in a brief colloquy with the leader.  It is my understanding, Mr. Leader, that it is your desire to move to a vote on those particular amendments you have outlined here this afternoon and this would not cut off the opportunity for Senators to continue to offer amendments. Myself and Senator Snowe--we have developed, for example, a bipartisan proposal.
