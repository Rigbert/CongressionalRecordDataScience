President, I rise today to introduce the Small Rural Hospital Program Improvement Act, which is intended to make critically important changes to Medicare payment policies for rural hospitals.  Mr. President, most hospitals in rural America serve a large number of Medicare patients. Medicare payments to these hospitals, however, are not always adequate to cover the cost of the services they provide. The legislation I am introducing today will increase Medicare payments to small, rural hospitals in Maine and elsewhere by enabling more of them to qualify for enhanced reimbursements under the Medicare Dependent, Small Rural Hospital Program.  Rural hospitals are the anchors of small towns and communities across America. Not only are they the mainstay of the local health care delivery system, but they are also often the major employers in their communities. Rural communities have unique characteristics and special needs, and their hospitals face tremendous challenges every day as they work to provide the highest quality health care to their patients in the face of sometimes discouraging odds.  Rural communities tend to have higher concentrations of elderly persons and higher levels of poverty. Rural residents also tend to have higher rates of certain health problems than people living in urban areas. For example, deaths and disabilities resulting from injury are more common, and rural residents also tend to experience higher rates of chronic disease and disability. Rural providers also face unique challenges in the delivery of health care services, given the great distances and extreme weather conditions that often prevail, particularly in states like Maine. Shortages of physicians, nurses and other health professionals make it difficult to ensure that rural residents have access to all of the care that they need. And finally, Medicare reimbursement policies tend to favor urban areas and fail to take the special needs of rural providers into account.  The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 has posed additional challenges for rural areas. Deep Medicare payment reductions and mounting regulatory requirements have damaged our fragile rural health care delivery system, and, in particular, our rural hospitals and home health agencies. While the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 did provide some much-needed relief, we should take further steps to ensure that these rural providers receive more equitable Medicare payments.  One relatively simple, but nevertheless important step we can take is to update the antiquated and arbitrary classification requirements that prevent otherwise-qualified hospitals from receiving assistance under the Medicare Dependent, Small Rural Hospital program. Under this program, small rural hospitals that treat relatively high proportions of Medicare patients qualify for enhanced Medicare reimbursements. To qualify as a Medicare Dependent Hospital, a hospital must be located in a rural area, not be a sole community hospital, have 100 or fewer beds, and have been dependent on Medicare for at least 60 percent of its inpatient days or discharges in 1987.  The requirement that the hospital must have had at least 60 percent of its hospital discharges or patient days attributable to Medicare beneficiaries in 1987 is what creates the problem. Using 1987 as a base year erects an arbitrary barrier that prevents many small rural hospitals that otherwise meet the criteria from participating in this program. As an example, despite the fact that most of the small rural hospitals in Maine treat a disproportionate share of Medicare beneficiaries, none of them currently qualifies for this program. Not a single one.  The legislation I am introducing today modifies and updates the 60 percent requirement and bases eligibility for the Medicare Dependent, Small Rural Hospital program on Medicare discharges or patient days during any of the three most recently audited cost report periods rather than fiscal year 1987. In addition, the bill would make the program, which currently is only authorized through FY 2006, permanent. According to the Maine Hospital Association, if updated in this way, nine Maine hospitals will be eligible for the program, which would make them eligible for over $9 million additional Medicare dollars.  Increasing Medicare payment rates is critically important to the hospitals in Maine. For the past several years, Maine has ranked 49th or 50th in the nation in terms of Medicare reimbursement-to-cost ratios. For example, while hospitals in some states received more from Medicare in 1996 than it cost them to provide care to older and disabled Medicare patients, Maine's hospitals were only reimbursed 80 cents for every $1.00 they actually spent caring for Medicare beneficiaries.  As a consequence, Maine's hospitals have experienced a serious Medicare shortfall in recent years. The Maine Hospital Association anticipates a $174 million Medicare shortfall in 2002, which will force Maine's hospitals to shift costs on to other payers in the form of higher hospital charges. This Medicare shortfall is one of the reasons that Maine has among the highest insurance premiums in the nation.  Maine's poor Medicare margin is not due to high hospital costs. In fact, the current system tends to penalize Maine hospitals for their efficiency. For example, at $5,232, Maine's cost per discharge is slightly under the national average of $5,241, and is well below the Northeast average of $5,517.  The legislation I am introducing today will not solve Maine's Medicare shortfall problem, but it will help to close the gap. It will also enable many more small rural hospitals across the country to benefit from this program, which will help to ensure continued access to high quality hospital care for all rural Americans.                                 ______                                       By LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Robb, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kohl,         Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Cleland):  S. 2769.
