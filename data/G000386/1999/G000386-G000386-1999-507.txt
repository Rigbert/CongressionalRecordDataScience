 President, earlier today, I introduced the Home Health Integrity Preservation Act of 1999. I am pleased that Senator Breaux cosponsored this bill, as he did when we introduced it in the 105th Congress. This legislation will be an important tool in combating the waste, fraud and abuse that has threatened the integrity of the Medicare home health benefit.  Although the majority of home health agencies are honest, legitimate, businesses, it is clear that there have been unscrupulous providers. In July 1997, the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, held a hearing on this topic. The hearing exposed serious rip-offs of the Medicare trust fund, and highlighted areas that need more stringent oversight.  In response to the hearing, Senator Breaux and I followed up with a roundtable discussion on home health fraud. The roundtable brought together key players with a variety of perspectives. Participants included law enforcement, the Administration, and the home health industry.  The roundtable yielded a number of proposals which were shaped into draft legislation and circulated to a wide variety of stakeholders. In response to comments, the draft was changed to address legitimate concerns that were raised. The result is a balanced piece of legislation that includes important safeguards against fraud and abuse of the system, but does not stifle the growth of legitimate providers.  The Home Health Integrity Preservation Act of 1999 would do the following:  It would heighten scrutiny of new home health agencies before they enter the Medicare program, and during their early years of Medicare participation.  It would improve standards and screening for home health agencies, administrators and employees.  It would require audits of home health agencies whose claims exhibit unusual features that may indicate problems, and improve HCFA's ability to identify such features.  It would require agencies to adopt and implement fraud and abuse compliance programs.  It would increase scrutiny of branch offices, business entities related to home health agencies, and changes in operations.  It would make more information on particular home health agencies available to beneficiaries.  It would create an interagency Home Health Integrity Task Force, led by the Office of the Inspector General of Health and Human Services.  It would reform bankruptcy rules to make it harder for all Medicare providers, not just home health agencies, to avoid penalties and repayment obligations by declaring bankruptcy.  This legislation is an important step in ensuring that seniors maintain access to high quality home care services rendered by reputable providers. I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort by cosponsoring this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 255       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
