President, I rise to congratulate and commend one of my constituents, Andy Robinson of Narragansett, RI. At the end of last year, Andy Robinson retired from teaching after thirty years in the classroom. This Sunday his family, friends and innumerable former students will celebrate Andy's career and the impact he has had on the lives of so many Rhode Islanders. Andy Robinson is a model public servant and I would like to take a few minutes to express my appreciation for his commitment to our community.  Born and raised in East Providence, Andy graduated from my alma mater, LaSalle Academy. After receiving his bachelors degree from Providence College, Andy became a student teacher at Narragansett Junior High School. He then took a position for three years as a social studies teacher at Burrillville Junior-Senior High School while completing his masters degree at Providence College.  In 1975 Andy accepted a job as a social studies teacher at Narragansett High School, and I doubt he imagined at the time that he would dedicate the next 25 years to forming the minds of the students attending that school. Andy worked hard to improve and broaden the social studies program at Narragansett High School. He introduced Project Close-Up, Rhode Island Project Insight, the Rhode Island Model Legislature Program, the Mock Trial Program, the Junior Achievement Applied Economics Program and the Center for Civic Education ``We the People'' Program and Constitution Competition. He also obtained a federal grant to bring the Youth and the Law Program to the School. Andy served as the Social Studies Department Chair, a member of the school Steering Committee, a member of the School Based Improvement Team, and a member of the Review Committee for National Standards in Social Studies. For his endless energy and unflagging commitment to education, Andy has received the ``Ocean State Center for Law And Citizenship Education Outstanding Law Educator'' and is named in Who's Who in American Education.  Moreover, Andy's public service did not end in the classroom. From 1968 to 1989, Andy served in the Rhode Island National Guard. He has held positions in the Narragansett Lions Club, the Narragansett Democratic Town Committee and the Eastward Look Property Owner Association. He continues to serve as a member of the Narragansett Chamber of Commerce, the Friendly Sons of St. Patrick of South Country, the Board of Incorporators South County Hospital, the Prout School Board and the Prout School Academic Affairs Committee.  Andy shares his commitment to the community with his wife Jane, who is a teacher at the Narragansett Elementary School. Together they raised two daughters, Catherine, who will soon begin serving the U.S. Army as a JAG, and Elizabeth who is carrying on the family tradition as a teacher of special education in Virginia.  Recently, Narragansett High School dedicated its yearbook to Andy Robinson. Several students wrote tributes to him and they all had common themes, students looked forward to Mr. Robinson's class, he made the material interesting and easy to learn, and he cared. Andy Robinson is an uncommon teacher. I think one student, Melissa Deluca, spoke for everyone when she wrote, ``Mr. Robinson, our teacher, our guide, my friend. Thank you.''  Andy Robinson is an inspiration not only to his students, but to all who have the pleasure of knowing him. On behalf of the citizens of Rhode Island, I want to thank Andy for his years of hard work and selfless dedication and congratulate him on a well deserved retirement.                          ____________________
