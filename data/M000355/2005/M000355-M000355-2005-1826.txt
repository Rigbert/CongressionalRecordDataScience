 President, on behalf of the majority leader, I will announce today's schedule. The Senate has convened on this ceremonial day for the purpose of considering some of the President's Cabinet level appointments. We had hoped and expected to consider the President's appointment of Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State but, unfortunately, I understand there is an objection on the other side to moving to that nomination today. So in a moment I will propound several unanimous consent agreements for the President's nominations.  Before I do, I say that if we get these agreements, there will be no rollcall votes today.                          ____________________[Page S77]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
