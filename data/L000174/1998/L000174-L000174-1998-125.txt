President, I rise today to speak about an event that has been a Vermont cultural tradition for twenty-five years. The Vermont Mozart Festival began in 1974, and through the vision of its founders, it has grown tremendously in popularity, today attracting over 17,000 advance ticket buyers for a series of 25 concerts in 16 different locations across the state.  The international acclaim of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is clearly demonstrated by the long distances loyal festival attendees travel each year. Concert-goers flock from all across the United States, Canada and even as far away as Europe to hear top-caliber musicians perform world-class compositions. These faithful return year after year to hear the works of a variety of composers, with a primary focus on the symphonies, concertos and other brilliant works of Mozart.  The festival is a tradition for the Leahy family. I was honored when the festival asked me to speak at a concert to honor its 25th anniversary. I took this opportunity to praise the musicians but also to acknowledge the dedication of the festival organizers and the expansive volunteer network, now numbering over 150. The fruits of their efforts are clear from the warm applause that bring the curtain down at the end of each performance.  Mr. President, I ask that a recent article about the Vermont Mozart Festival that appeared in the Rutland Herald be printed in the Record so that all Senators and their staff can learn more about this great Vermont tradition.  The article follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, July 5, 1998]          Festival Celebrates 25th Year With More Great Music                             (By Jim Lowe)       The Vermont Mozart Festival's 25 years of success come from      turning adversity to advantage, making the most of a      situation, according to two of its founders, Melvin Kaplan      and William Metcalfe.       When Kaplan, the festival's artistic director from the      beginning, discovered Shelburne Farms in a book of North      American barns, he got himself invited to tea with Elizabeth      Webb, the estate's owner.       ``No one living in this community 25 years ago had ever      seen it. It was a private home. It was like stepping into a      fairy tale,'' Kaplan said.       ``So I said to her, `Gee, two years from now we're going to      start a festival, and it would be wonderful to have concerts      here.' And she said, `Why don't you come and have your      concerts here?' A lot of people wouldn't have asked the      question.''       Five months before the festival opened, however, the Webb      children reduced the offer to only a few concerts each year.      ``Because of that, we turned it into doing multiple      locations, which turned out to be a big plus,'' Kaplan said.       ``I think of the concept, which is so special,'' added      Metcalfe, who conducts choral and orchestral concerts, as      well as leading the annual Gilbert and Sullivan operetta. ``I      think the concept, in my mind, is that you take advantage of      the special locations we have around Burlington, and you put      high quality music into those locations, and build programs      in a way which suits the locations. I think that makes this      festival very special.''       The Vermont Mozart Festival is celebrating its 25th      anniversary this summer with 25 concerts at 16 different      locations in 12 towns. After a special presentation of the      Peter Shaffer play, ``Amadeus,'' July 10 and 11 at      Burlington's Flynn Theatre, produced with Vermont Stage      Company and the Flynn, the festival will formally open July      12 with the orchestral concert at Shelburne Farms, including      the annual dressage exhibition. The festival actually opened      July 4 with a pre-season holiday concert at Sugarbush, and      closes Aug. 12 at Stowe's Trapp Family Meadow.       ``They've got a great theme--the whole notion of Mozart,      the greatest composer who ever lived,'' Thomas Philibon,      executive director of the Vermont Symphony Orchestra, said of      the festival's success.       ``They've been at it all those years, and they really know      how to fix up the events and make it so they can attract a      lot of happy people.''       It all started when Kaplan, a professional oboist and New      York concert manager, and his wife, violist Ynez Lynch,      bought a barn in Charlotte in 1971, and converted it into a      house. He was approached by University of Vermont Lane Series      director Jack Trevithick, UVM choral director James Chapman      and Metcalfe, who though a UVM history professor had taken      over the music department for a year. They asked him to join      them in creating a summer music event.       Thus, in 1974, under the auspices of the UVM Lanes Series,      the first Vermont Mozart Festival presented 10 concerts over      a two-week period, including the opening concert at the UVM      Show Barn, Mozart piano concertos on the Lake Champlain Ferry      performed by Beaux Arts Trio pianist Menahem Pressler, and      myriad ancillary activities. The concert in the Shelburne      Farms ballroom was the first time the Webb estate had ever      been used for a public event.       Kaplan had connections throughout the music world, and      invited some of his well-known musician friends, including      Pressler, New York Philharmonic Principal Flutist Julius      Baker, as well as his own world-touring ensembles, the New      York Chamber Soloists and the Festival Winds. Over 25 years,      the festival has attracted some of the world's greatest      musicians, including a benefit concert in 1980 by Benny      Goodman.       ``He looked like a very old man,'' Kaplan said of the great      jazz clarinetist's performance. ``He walked up on stage,      started to play, and lost 40 years. It was just      astonishing.''       The festival featured L'Orchestre Symphonique de Montreal      (Montreal Symphony) in 1989, but over the years it has      presented concerts by such famed ensembles as the Beaux Arts      Trio, the Guarneri Quartet, and the Tokyo Quartet. The      Emerson String Quartet and the Ying Quartet can thank the      festival for some of their earliest concerts. (Both are      returning this season.)       ``It becomes more like family,'' Kaplan said. ``The people      that come here come from San Francisco, Montreal, Ottawa,      Philadelphia, New York, etc. Some people come from Europe.      Almost all of them have known each other from 30 to 50 years.      It's like getting a big family back together.''       ``It's also true that we've had Vermont musicians here, and      it's still true. It's a wonderful mix from people from all      over the place,'' Metcalfe added.       Programming, too, has broadened out of necessity. The first      two years were devoted entirely to Mozart, including      symphonies, piano concertos, chamber and choral works. After      the second year, with three weeks of concerts, it was decided      to vary the programming. In addition to the 206 works by      Mozart the festival programmed over 25 years, 1,948 by other      composers have been performed.       ``In the beginning, we felt that an audience of 600 or 700      for big events was enormous,'' Kaplan said. ``When we started      to get audiences of 1,900 and 2,000, I convinced the board it      made no sense to play a Mozart symphony with just five      strings. Little by little, we've increased it so that we have      as big an orchestra as we could put on the Shelburne Farms      porch. We're stretching it a tiny bit to do Brahms Double      Concerto this year.''       Still, Mozart remains the staple, and for this year's final      concert at Shelburne Farms Aug. 1, Metcalfe will conduct his      Oriana     Singers and the Festival Orchestra in Robert Levin's new      orchestration of the Requiem. (Mozart died before the work      was completed; the version traditionally performed is by his      student, Franz Sussmayr.)       ``It's different, and I think it's really good,'' Metcalfe      said. ``Part of the Mozart Festival tradition is to introduce      new things as well as maintain continuity. It opens your      ears.''       The festival was a popular success from the beginning, with      all concerts selling out the first year, but achieving      financial stability took a while. After opening with a      $36,000 budget, the festival incurred substantial deficits      for its first three years, while under the financial umbrella      of the University of Vermont.       When UVM then dropped the festival as a financial      liability, its leaders managed to turn it to their advantage.      Previously, Burlington businessman Duncan Brown had told      Kaplan that if there was any problem with the university, he      would solve it.       ``I called him,'' Kaplan said. ``He said, `What do you      need?' I said I needed $55,000 and a secretary to do nothing      but that, and an office for her.''       Brown hired the secretary, provided space for her at his      office, and called together a meeting of a hundred of his      music-loving friends and acquaintances at St. Paul's      Cathedral.       ``Ultimately, it ended up with a bunch of people sitting      around saying they didn't want it to die. They met again, and      formed the corporation.'' Kaplan said. ``It was much better      for the festival to have a community board that was invested      emotionally and financially in the whole operation.''       Today, the festival has a budget of just over $600,000,      with a year-round full-time staff of three, two more in      summer. Ticket sales have grown from $13,917 in 1974 to      $307,316 in 1997. This year, some 17,000 tickets--6,000 more      than last year--were sold by the June 15 discount deadline.       If tickets were to pay the cost of the festival, though,      they would be $30 as opposed to the $19 charged, explained      Trish Sweeney, the festival's executive director since 1996.      Fund-raising activities make up the rest, including      individual gifts (membership), and merchandise sales, but the      largest portion is business sponsorship.       Volunteers, numbering some 160, represent the festival's      major support group. It requires 60 for each Shelburne Farms      concert. ``We have so many who are coming to every concert,      which is a blessing because they really know what they are      doing,'' Sweeney said. ``People jockey for concerts. For the      smaller ones, we have to turn people away.''       Although the festival is celebrating its 25th anniversary      this year, it doesn't have time to rest. Most of its next      season is already set, much of it based on the Paris Piano      Trio, which was so successful in the winter season's      Burlington chamber music series.       ``I think we're going to do the Beethoven Triple Concerto      on the opening concert,'' Kaplan said. ``And then on the      weekend, on the Friday, Saturday and Sunday, they'll each      play a solo with orchestra, and they'll do a trio concert in      the middle of that week.''                          ____________________
