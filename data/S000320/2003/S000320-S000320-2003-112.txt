 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for S. 300, the Jackie Robinson Congressional Gold Medal bill, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               congressional budget office cost estimate     S. 300--A bill to award a congressional gold medal to Jackie          Robinson (posthumously), in recognition of his many          contributions to the nation, and to express the sense of          Congress that there should be a national day in          recognition of Jackie Robinson       S. 300 would authorize the President to present a gold      medal to the family of Jackie Robinson in recognition of his      contributions to the nation as an athlete, business leader,      and citizen. The legislation would authorize the U.S. Mint to      spend up to $30,000 to produce the gold medal. To help      recover the costs of the medal, S. 300 would authorize the      Mint to strike and sell bronze duplicates of the medal at a      price that covers production costs for both the medal and the      duplicates.       Based on the costs of recent medals produced by the Mint,      CBO estimates that the bill would not significantly increase      direct spending from the U.S. Mint Public Enterprise Fund. We      estimate that the gold medal would cost about $25,000 to      produce in fiscal year 2004, including around $5,000 for the      cost of the gold and about $20,000 for the costs to design,      engrave, and manufacture the medal. CBO expects that the Mint      would recoup little of its costs by selling bronze duplicates      to the public.       S. 300 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and      would have no effect on state, local, or tribal governments.       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Matthew      Pickford, who can be reached at 226-2860. This estimate was      approved by Robert A. Sunshine, Assistant Director for Budget      Analysis.                          ____________________
