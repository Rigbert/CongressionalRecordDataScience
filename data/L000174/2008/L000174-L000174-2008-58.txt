They work very well, in a bipartisan fashion, to seek out the best possible people. I have a great deal of respect for both of the Senators. Because they have done that, it has made my job as chairman a lot easier. I look at the distinguished Presiding Officer from Virginia as another example because he was worked so well with the distinguished seniorSenator from that state. Again, it is a situation where there is a Democratic Senator and a Republican Senator. They have worked very closely together to try to bring the best.  I have no problem with different parties in an, obviously, political position choosing partisan positions. In the Federal judiciary, which is supposed to be outside of partisan politics, I wish more Senators and Presidents--the next President, whoever it is--would look at the model of the Senators now on the floor. I include the distinguished Senator from Virginia, the Presiding Officer, in this. Seek the best possible man or woman for these judgeships. Let those of us in legislative office take care of the partisan politics. We can do that. But let the American people, when they walk into a courtroom, say: Whether I am plaintiff or defendant or whether I am rich or poor, no matter who I am, this judge will give me a fair trial. Win or lose, I will walk out knowing I had a fair trial and it was based on the facts, not on politics.  I thank my two friends from Florida.
