 Mr. Chairman, I rose to express my appreciation on behalf of the people of Maryland for allowing us to invest in some very important projects. I will continue to take credit for those. But your budgets are the only ones that have passed, and the appropriations bills are the ones you have offered on the floor.  But let me say to the gentleman, I have been here long enough so that in 1993 I heard all the arguments from all your leadership that adopting our budget proposal would send the country to rack and ruin, would explode the deficit, explode unemployment, and create a deep recession. Dick Armey, your leader, said that, the Speaker said that, the chairman, Mr. Kasich, of your Budget Committee said that.  You are 180 degrees wrong, dead flat wrong. Exactly the opposite happened. Under a proposal that we made that you said was a massive tax increase, you never talk about of course the $250-plus billion spending cut, but we had the best economy in the history of America.
