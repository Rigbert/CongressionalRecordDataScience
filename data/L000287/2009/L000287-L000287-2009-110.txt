Madam Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Jasmine Lynn, a rising star, a wonderful daughter, and a successful student who was the victim of a senseless tragedy.  A native of Kansas City, Missouri, Jasmine attended the Lincoln College Preparatory Academy, where she was an active student, athlete, musician, and leader. Even though she was a member of the ROTC, the varsity basketball team, and the high school marching band, Jasmine found time to shine as a student. Her intelligence and academic success won her an opportunity to attend Spelman College in Atlanta, making her the first in her family to receive a college education. At Spelman, Jasmine continued to excel with a 3.8 GPA and intended to focus her academic program around psychology and pre-law studies. Jasmine had just completed a summer internship at Cerner Corp over the summer and had bought her first car. This accomplished young lady had a bright and promising future.  On September 3, the life of Jasmine Lynn was cut down by a stray bullet as she waswalking down an Atlanta street with some of her friends. Violence cuts through the heart of too many communities across America, but when a gifted young woman--simply an innocent bystander--is the victim of a senseless murder, the toll hostility and aggression take on our society becomes painfully clear.  Today, I would like to offer my deepest condolences to the Lynn family for their heartbreaking loss. The thoughts and prayers of the people of the Fifth Congressional District of Georgia are with them during this difficult and trying time. My heart goes out to Jasmine Lynn's parents, brother, family, friends, and the Spelman and Clark/Atlanta University community who also mourn her passing.                          ____________________
