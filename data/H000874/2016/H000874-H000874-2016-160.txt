 Let me discuss a number of other specific issues, if I can.  First of all, the Speaker indicated that he wanted to see legislation on the floor of the House by March 31 on Puerto Rico. As you and I both know, Puerto Rico is facing a fiscal crisis of its own. It is going to need some authority to deal with that crisis so that neither the Americans living in Puerto Rico are disadvantaged nor the children and others--whether it is through the educational system, the healthcare system, providing power, or whatever services are necessary--will not be adversely impacted.  Can the gentleman give me an idea as to what progress we are making towards seeing legislation on the floor by March 31?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank my friend for yielding.  As the gentleman knows, we are committed to addressing this issue. We have had numerous meetings and we have also had committee hearings. Even this week, Chairman Bishop and the Natural Resources Committee are hard at work to find the best path forward.  We are committed to getting this done. I will not prejudge the committee on what the solution should be, but I know they are hard at work. We continually monitor it week to week. As soon as we have it scheduled, I will notify the gentleman.
