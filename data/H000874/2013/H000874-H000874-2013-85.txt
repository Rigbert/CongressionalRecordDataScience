 We have not a matter of days, but hours left to prevent our government from shutting down. A shutdown is not a tactic; it is not a strategy. It is a failure for this country. Let us not be the country whose representatives cannot work together to fulfill the most basic function of government.  My friends across the aisle voted over 40 times to derail the Affordable Care Act without success. When do you say enough is enough, let us move on responsibly to make government work--at, by the way, your level? The President has said he would sign a bill at your level, not a negotiated level, at your level. You've won, but you can't take yes for an answer. The Senate rejected it, as they will reject this new attempt.  Instead, now is the time to try a different approach.
