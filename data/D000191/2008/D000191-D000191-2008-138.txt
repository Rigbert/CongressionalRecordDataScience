Now it has exploded, and some in the administration are recognizing that the economy is in trouble, something that middle-income America and average Americans have known for quite some time.  Finally, the President and his appointees are talking about some stimulus. But they are drawing a line. They are saying yes, we will do some stimulus, but we will not invest in America. There will be no infrastructure investment. They are saying that would be bad. So far, there's no indication either that they intend to bring any regulatory discipline to the bizarre, exotic, over-leveraged, and opaque financial markets, something that also cries out to be done.  Stimulus, yes. I believe we can reach agreement on that. It needs to be targeted toward those who have been hurt the worst: Middle-income and working families. The best way to do that, the most progressive way to do that would be through a payroll tax holiday. Nearly half of the people in this country pay more in payroll taxes than they do Federal income taxes. It's a flat, regressive tax. Forty-four percent pay more in payroll taxes than they do income taxes. Lower income Americans, seniors in particular, who work part-time jobs to augment their retirement Social Security, pay no taxes, and would not get any rebates under the President's plan. They need help too. They are struggling with higher costs of medical care, fuel, and heating like everybody else in this country.  So a payroll tax holiday would be the fairest way to get money to the people who need it the most, who would be most likely to spend the money, and provide some short-term stimulus to the economy. That is short-term. But long-term we need to reinvest in America, and it is strange the President draws a line in the sand there. It is not so strange, I guess, since the Secretary of Transportation last week, Mary Peters, recommended phasing out any Federal role, any Federal investment in our roads, bridges, highways, and transportation systems in this country. She said the financial markets will take care of that, they will lend us the money, the same financial markets that are totally in the tank and having to go overseas now, the same big firms that are borrowing money from Saudi Arabia and other state funds in order to stay afloat because of all their speculation. No. We need investment in America.  Unemployment among construction workers is up to nearly 10 percent, and nearly a million are unemployed. If we just spent $15 billion on ready-to-go and needed infrastructure projects in this country; roads, bridges, highways, water and sewer systems, we could put 712,000 people to work. That's 712,000 people. We could basically wipe out unemployment in the construction trades. But the President says no. He won't borrow money to invest in America, he will borrow some money to provide some short-term consumption.  Of course, part of the problem with that is those who won't just use it to pay bills, or essentials, which many will, will be buying things that aren't made in America any more. So that money is going to leak overseas to China when they buy that flat screen television with the $600 or $800 rebate the President is proposing.  So we need both. We need a stimulus, and that will help some if it's targeted to those most in need, but we also need a long-term reinvestment in our country. It will make us more economically efficient, it will save fuel, and it will put people to work. It's worth borrowing money to do that.                          ____________________
