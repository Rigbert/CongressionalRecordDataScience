Chairman, our highest duty as Members of this Congress is to ensure our national security, to protect our homeland and to defend our people.  We must use every tool in our arsenal--including military force--to capture, kill or disrupt international terrorists who are intent on striking the United States and our interests overseas. We must do whatever it takes to prevent the unthinkable--a nuclear, biological or chemical attack--from occurring on American soil. We must ensure that the American military remains the finest fighting force in the history of the world. And, we must succeed in Iraq--for the sake of our own national security, the stability of Iraq and the Middle East region, and our global standing and credibility.  This defense appropriations bill will help us accomplish most of our national security objectives, and I will vote for it. It provides $409 billion for defense functions for fiscal 2006, including $45.3 billion in so-called emergency spending for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan--bringing the total appropriation from this Congress for these two missions to $314 billion.  However, even though I support this bill, I believe it is simply Orwellian to call this new funding for Iraq and Afghanistan an ``emergency.'' Emergencies are unforeseen events that are difficult, if not impossible, to plan for. The idea that this administration cannot predict and budget for the costs of our on-going military efforts in both Iraq and Afghanistan is ludicrous.  Furthermore, this budgetary sleight of hand epitomizes this administration's failure to level with the American people on many aspects of this military action, as well as the unwillingness of this Republican Congress to fulfill its Constitutional duty to exercise real, effective oversight on the administration's policies.  We are simply not asking the tough questions that voters expect us to ask on national security. In Iraq, it is obvious that our mission is not accomplished, let alone succeeding. More than 1,700 American soldiers have lost their lives there. Americans account for 85 percent of the coalition forces in Iraq, but represent 98 percent of the casualties.  And, as Tom Friedman wrote last week in the New York Times:       Our core problem in Iraq remains Donald Rumsfeld's      disastrous decision--endorsed by President Bush--to invade      Iraq on the cheap. From the day the looting started, it has      been obvious that we did not have enough troops there.  Mr. Friedman added:       Almost every problem we face in Iraq today . . . Flows from      not having gone into Iraq with the Powell doctrine of      overwhelming force. We cannot even secure the two miles of      highway that separates the Baghdad Airport and the Green      Zone.  Yet, this Congress has not conducted effective oversight on the administration's refusal to heed the advice of senior military officials, who said more troops would be needed to secure Iraq; on the costs of this action; on the incompetent post-war reconstruction effort; or, on detainee abuses in Iraq, Afghanistan and at Guantanamo.  Effective Congressional oversight need not be adversarial. I believe that every American wants our Nation to succeed in Iraq. But the truth is, this administration has failed to articulate a convincing, compelling success strategy.  And, even as I vote for this defense appropriations bill today, I believe it is imperative that this Congress embrace its legislative duty, work with this administration, and ensure that such a strategy is implemented immediately. Our troops--and the American people--deserve no less.  Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would ask that Tom Friedman's column from June 15 in the New York Times be admitted into the record of this debate.                [From the New York Times, June 15, 2005]                         Let's Talk About Iraq                        (By Thomas L. Friedman)       Ever since Iraq's remarkable election, the country has been      descending deeper and deeper into violence. But no one in      Washington wants to talk about it. Conservatives don't want      to talk about it because, with a few exceptions, they think      their job is just to applaud whatever the Bush team does.      Liberals don't want to talk about Iraq because, with a few      exceptions, they thought the war was wrong and deep down      don't want the Bush team to succeed. As a result, Iraq is      drifting sideways and the whole burden is being carried by      our military. The rest of the country has gone shopping,      which seems to suit Karl Rove just fine.       Well, we need to talk about Iraq. This is no time to give      up--this is still winnable--but it is time to ask: What is      our strategy? This question is urgent because Iraq is inching      toward a dangerous tipping point--the point where the key      communities begin to invest more energy in preparing their      own militias for a scramble for power--when everything falls      apart, rather than investing their energies in making the      hard compromises within and between their communities to      build a unified, democratizing Iraq.       Our core problem in Iraq remains Donald Rumsfeld's      disastrous decision--endorsed by President Bush--to invade      Iraq on the cheap. From the day the looting started, it has      been obvious that we did not have enough troops there. We      have never fully controlled the terrain. Almost every problem      we face in Iraq today--the rise of ethnic militias, the      weakness of the economy, the shortages of gas and      electricity, the kidnappings, the flight of middle-class      professionals--flows from not having gone into Iraq with the      Powell Doctrine of overwhelming force.       Yes, yes, I know we are training Iraqi soldiers by the      battalions, but I don't think this is the key. Who is      training the insurgent-fascists? Nobody. And yet they are      doing daily damage to U.S. and Iraqi forces. Training is      overrated, in my book. Where you have motivated officers and      soldiers, you have an army punching above its weight. Where      you don't have motivated officers and soldiers, you have an      army punching a clock.       Where do you get motivated officers and soldiers? That can      come only from an Iraqi leader and government that are seen      as representing all the country's main factions. So far the      Iraqi political class has been a disappointment. The Kurds      have been great. But the Sunni leaders have been shortsighted      at best and malicious at worst, fantasizing that they are      going to make a comeback to power through terror. As for the      Shiites, their spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani,      has been a positive force on the religious side, but he has      no political analog. No Shiite Hamid Karzai has emerged.       ``We have no galvanizing figure right now,'' observed Kanan      Makiya, the Iraqi historian who heads the Iraq Memory      Foundation. ``Sistani's counterpart on the democratic front      has not emerged. Certainly, the Americans made many mistakes,      but at this stage less and less can be blamed on them. The     burden is on Iraqis. And we still have not risen to the      magnitude of the opportunity before us.''       I still don't know if a self-sustaining, united and      democratizing Iraq is possible. I still believe it is a vital      U.S. interest to find out. But the only way to find out is to      create a secure environment. It is very hard for moderate,      unifying, national leaders to emerge in a cauldron of      violence.       Maybe it is too late, but before we give up on Iraq, why      not actually try to do it right? Double the American boots on      the ground and redouble the diplomatic effort to bring in      those Sunnis who want to be part of the process and fight to      the death those who don't. As Stanford's Larry Diamond,      author of an important new book on the Iraq war, ``Squandered      Victory,'' puts it, we need ``a bold mobilizing strategy''      right now. That means the new Iraqi government, the U.S. and      the U.N. teaming up to widen the political arena in Iraq,      energizing the constitution-writing process and developing a      communications-diplomatic strategy that puts our bloodthirsty      enemies on the defensive rather than us. The Bush team has      been weak in all these areas. For weeks now, we haven't even      had ambassadors in Iraq, Afghanistan or Jordan.       We've already paid a huge price for the Rumsfeld Doctrine--     ``Just enough troops to lose.'' Calling for more troops now,      I know, is the last thing anyone wants to hear. But we are      fooling ourselves to think that a decent, normal, forward-     looking Iraqi politics or army is going to emerge from a      totally insecure environment, where you can feel safe only      with your own tribe.
