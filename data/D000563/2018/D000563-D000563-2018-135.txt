President, let me thank my colleague from Tennessee. I value his friendship and professional support on this idea. This is basic that Americans know what the cost of the prescription drugs will be. Do you know when you discover it? When you go to the cash register, that is when you discover it.  Shouldn't we know in advance? Shouldn't we know so that if Humira, which is now at $5,500 per month, goes up to $6,000--and I understand it just did--we are aware of that fact? If we can't use transparency in competition, what are the alternatives--a government mandate?
