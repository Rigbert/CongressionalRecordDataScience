 President, I rise to introduce the Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Act, calling for a new effort to combat this often deadly form of cancer. I am pleased to be joined by Senator Brownback, the Co-Chair ofthe Senate Cancer Coalition, and a strong voice on a variety of cancer issues.  This bill will renew and improve the Federal Government's efforts to combat lung cancer. It will affirm the goal of a 50 percent reduction in lung cancer mortality by 2015.  It will authorize a Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program, with interagency coordination, to develop and implement a plan to meet this goal.  It will authorize $75 million for lung cancer research programs in the National Heart Lung Blood Institute, National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, and Centers for Disease Control.  It will create a new incentive program in the Food and Drug Administration to be modeled on the Orphan Drug Act for the development of chemoprevention drugs for lung cancer and precancerous lung disease. These are drugs that could prevent precancer from progressing into full-blown disease.  It will improve coordination disparity programs to ensure that the burdens of lung cancer on minority populations are addressed.  We have made great strides against many types of cancer in the last several decades. However, these gains are uneven.  When the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971, lung cancer had a 5-year survival rate of only 12 percent. After decades of research efforts and scientific advances, this survival rate remains only 15 percent. In contrast, the 5-year survival rates of breast, prostate, and colon cancer have risen to 89 percent, 99 percent and 65 percent respectively.  A lung cancer diagnosis can be devastating. The average life expectancy following a lung cancer diagnosis is only 9 months.  This is because far too many patients are not diagnosed with lung cancer until it has progressed to the later stages. Lung cancer can be hard to diagnose, and symptoms may at first appear to be other illnesses. As a result, only 16 percent of lung cancer patients are diagnosed when their cancer is still localized, and is the most treatable.  Lung cancer still lacks early detection technology, to find cancer when it is most treatable. Mammograms can find breast cancer, and colonoscopies can find dangerous colon polyps. But there is no equivalent test for lung cancer at this time.  Under this legislation, the National Cancer Institute has clear authority to work with other institutes on this early detection research. Coordination between all branches of the National Institutes of Health, including those with expertise on lungs, imaging, and cancer will be necessary to make this long overdue progress.  Lung cancer lags behind other cancers, in part, due to stigma from smoking. Make no mistake, tobacco use causes the majority of lung cancer cases. Tobacco cessation is a critical component of reducing lung cancer mortality. Less smoking means less lung cancer. Period.  But tobacco use does not fully explain lung cancer. Approximately 15 percent of the people who die from lung cancer never smoked. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in 2007 tracked the incidence of lung cancer in 1 million people ages 40 to 79. It found that about 20 percent of female lung cancer patients were nonsmokers and 8 percent of male patients were nonsmokers.  These patients may have been exposed to second hand smoke, or they may have been exposed to radon, asbestos, chromium, or other chemicals. There could be other causes and associations that have not yet been discovered, genetic predispositions or other environmental exposures.  Dana Reeve put a face on these statistics, with her brave fight against lung cancer. Dana Reeve was a nonsmoker, and still was diagnosed with lung cancer at the age of 44. She died a mere 7 months later, leaving a young son.  Dana Reeve's story shows that smoking cannot fully explain lung cancer. Everyone in this country could stop smoking today, and yet we would still face a lung cancer epidemic. According to the Lung Cancer Alliance, over 60 percent of new lung cancer cases occur in those who never smoked, or who quit smoking.  I believe that we have the expertise and technology to make serious progress against this deadly cancer, and to reach the goal of halving lung cancer mortality by 2015.  We need this legislation to ensure that our Government's resources are focused on this mission in the most efficient way possible.  Agency efforts must be coordinated, and every part of the National Institutes of Health that may have some ideas to lend should be participating. That is what the Lung Cancer Mortality Reduction Program will accomplish.  We can do better for Americans diagnosed with lung cancer. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 332       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Lung Cancer Mortality      Reduction Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death for      both men and women, accounting for 28 percent of all cancer      deaths.       (2) Lung cancer kills more people annually than breast      cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, liver cancer,      melanoma, and kidney cancer combined.       (3) Since the enactment of the National Cancer Act of 1971      (Public Law 92-218; 85 Stat. 778), coordinated and      comprehensive research has raised the 5-year survival rates      for breast cancer to 88 percent, for prostate cancer to 99      percent, and for colon cancer to 64 percent.       (4) However, the 5-year survival rate for lung cancer is      still only 15 percent and a similar coordinated and      comprehensive research effort is required to achieve      increases in lung cancer survivability rates.       (5) Sixty percent of lung cancer cases are now diagnosed as      nonsmokers or former smokers.       (6) Two-thirds of nonsmokers diagnosed with lung cancer are      women.       (7) Certain minority populations, such as African-American      males, have disproportionately high rates of lung cancer      incidence and mortality, notwithstanding their similar      smoking rate.       (8) Members of the baby boomer generation are entering      their sixties, the most common age at which people develop      lung cancer.       (9) Tobacco addiction and exposure to other lung cancer      carcinogens such as Agent Orange and other herbicides and      battlefield emissions are serious problems among military      personnel and war veterans.       (10) Significant and rapid improvements in lung cancer      mortality can be expected through greater use and access to      lung cancer screening tests for at-risk individuals.       (11) Additional strategies are necessary to further enhance      the existing tests and therapies available to diagnose and      treat lung cancer in the future.       (12) The August 2001 Report of the Lung Cancer Progress      Review Group of the National Cancer Institute stated that      funding for lung cancer research was ``far below the levels      characterized for other common malignancies and far out of      proportion to its massive health impact''.       (13) The Report of the Lung Cancer Progress Review Group      identified as its ``highest priority'' the creation of      integrated, multidisciplinary, multi-institutional research      consortia organized around the problem of lung cancer.       (14) The United States must enhance its response to the      issues raised in the Report of the Lung Cancer Progress      Review Group, and this can be accomplished through the      establishment of a coordinated effort designed to reduce the      lung cancer mortality rate by 50 percent by 2016 and through      targeted funding to support this coordinated effort.     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE CONCERNING INVESTMENT IN LUNG                    CANCER RESEARCH.       It is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) lung cancer mortality reduction should be made a      national public health priority; and       (2) a comprehensive mortality reduction program coordinated      by the Secretary of Health and Human Services is justified      and necessary to adequately address and reduce lung cancer      mortality.
