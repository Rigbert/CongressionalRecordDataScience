We don't have that sort of power umbrella in our region of the country. I have read all about the fights in the West among all these Western States, a dozen and a half Western States: Arizona fights with California; California fights with Washington; Washington fights--it is unbelievable. So I am a little reluctant as a non-Westerner to believe anybody until we get a proper tribunal to assess whether what you are saying is correct or not. For all I know, this man put some power in another State that hurt Arizona. I don't know.  I look at the controversies out there, and I just think that this amendment targets one person and reduces their salary to one dollar without any trial, without any tribunal. It sort of reminds me of the way in which the gentleman's side of the aisle handled the firing of the chaplain and then, because we finally tried to get some justice here, he was brought on.  Mr. Chair, you don't do this to people. We have a judicial process in this country, and you have to go through the proper channels. I think we have to focus on fair ways in which to adjudicate if, in fact, there is something going on out there. I really question whether what is really going on here is a fight between Arizona and adjoining States.
