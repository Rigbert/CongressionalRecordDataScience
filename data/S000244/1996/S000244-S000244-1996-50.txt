Chairman, it is easy to say you're in favor of balancing the budget. Congress has been saying it for years. But, until recently, those of us who are willing tofollow the words with actions have not had enough votes to bring the budget under control. Now, we do. Actions speak louder than words, and this body has proven it. We made the tough choices and passed a balanced budget resolution, only to be confronted with an administration that wants to put those choices off and some colleagues who say they want to balance the budget as long as they don't have to cut any programs.  The majority of us still have responsibility for putting the Government on a path to fiscal responsibility. We still have to make those hard calls. In the area of civil science, H.R. 3322 does that. In our civil space program, this bill represents a savings of $308.7 million dollars from the President's request. It preserves and strengthens NASA's historic focus and contributions in basic science areas, such as astronomy, astrophysics, aerodynamics, life, and microgravity sciences. It reduces those programs which amount to commercial welfare, and restructures programs, such as Mission to Planet Earth, that bust the President's own NASA budget in the outyears. The administration abdicated its responsibility to maintain programs consistent with available resources when he sent two sets of books up here last month. He left the tough choices for Congress to make. We made them.  The bill fully funds the international space station and the space shuttle. The House passed a multiyear authorization of the station last year to put this program on a sound financial footing consistent with the balanced budget resolution. H.R. 3322 reaffirms the sound fiscal decisions we made last year. It also includes full funding for life and microgravity research, much of which will take place on the station and shuttle. This area of research is important in improving life on earth through new knowledge of materials and human physiology.  H.R. 3322 increases the funding for space science. This area of NASA basic research has brought us amazing discoveries from programs such as the Hubble space telescope and the Galileo probe to Jupiter. This increase preserves space science as the bipartisan priority it has always been for the Science Committee and protects if from the disproportionate cuts inflicted by the administration's outyear budget. Most of the increases are dedicated to small, focused science missions that stimulate education and drive costs down. The space science community has made the greatest strides in increasing the bang taxpayers receive for their buck by redesigning missions to be faster, cheaper, better. We need to reward success and ensure that space science does not suffer disproportionately in the President' budget. This bill does that.  The bill reduces the President's request for Mission to Planet Earth by $373.7 million, but still provides over a billion dollars and fully funds the AM-1, Landsat-7, and TRMM satellites; earth probes; and Mission to Planet Earth science, which alone accounts for $508 million. In 1992 the Science Committee concluded that Mission to Planet Earth was not a core NASA mission. Therefore, the Science Committee treated it as a discretionary program to be funded with whatever funds remained after NASA's core programs were funded. In NASA's fiscal year 1994 authorization, the Science Committee reaffirmed Mission to Planet Earth's status as a ``level of effort program that accomplishes as much as possible with whatever resources can be provided.`` Since the NASA budget is coming down, so must this discretionary program.  This year and last, several congressional witness testified that Mission to Planet Earth can be done at a lower cost by using new technology, exploiting commercial investments in earth observation, and leveraging existing environmental data bases which remain largely unanalyzed by scientists. The bill directs NASA to begin taking those steps that will shift the focus on Mission to Planet Earth to science instead of hardware.  We provide full funding for basis research efforts in aeronautics but control the rate of increase in the Advanced Subsonic Technology Program to prevent it from mutating into corporate welfare. H.R. 3322 saves $34 million from the President's request for this program within the aeronautics budget.  We fully fund the new technology programs that are vital in taking our civil space program into the next century. These include new millennium spacecraft technology and the reusable launch vehicle. These programs will lower the cost of future government civil and national security space activities. They will also provide a boost to our commercial space industry as we transfer this technology into the private sector, making it more competitive with foreign space industries which receive huge, direct, operating subsidies from their governments.  Balancing the/budget means making cuts and setting priorities, which we've done. H.R. 3322 builds on NASA's strengths and experience in basic research and fundamental science. It provides more than a billion dollars for studying this planet and the resources needed to bring the aviation industry into the next century. More importantly, it will continue NASA's accomplishments in revealing the wonders of the universe and set the stage for the future of human development of space. By passing H.R. 3322, we will enable NASA to continue achieving breakthroughs in science and keep the Government on the path toward balancing the budget.                                  1500
