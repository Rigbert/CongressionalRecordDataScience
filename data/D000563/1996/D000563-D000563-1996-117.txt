Speaker, several years ago I introduced legislation which allowed a full 100 percent deductibility of health insurance premiums for self-employed people. I represent a rural district. I represent a lot of farm families. It is very difficult for them to buy health insurance, and when they do, it is expensive, and they find that they can only deduct now 30 percent of the cost of the premiums.  The real unfairness is the fact that corporations can deduct 100 percent of the cost of health insurance premiums. Self-employed people cannot. What we do with the Democratic substitute is to address this in an honest way. I hope some of my Republican colleagues will consider breaking ranks tonight and joining in this bipartisan approach to health care reform.  Let me tell the Members what we know now. The fastest growing sector in the American economy are self-employed people, people who are starting their own businesses. If you ask them their No. 1 headache, you are going to find, to your surprise, it is health insurance; how to pay for it, how to cover your family and a few employees.  What we do in the Democratic substitute is to allow up to 80 percent deductibility over a period of several years. If Members take a look at the alternative on the Republican side, they will find they only reach 50 percent. This is a big difference for a small business.  I hope that some of my colleagues will think twice and join us. I think it is far better for us to come together, Democrats and Republicans, pass real health care reform, instead of trying to score some political victory for the Golden Rule Life Insurance Company. Let us do something for the real self-employed people who need a helping hand.
