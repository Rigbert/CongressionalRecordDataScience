Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we were joined by the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), chairman of the Committee on International Relations, which is the committee of the House with legislative jurisdiction over the American Servicemembers' Protection Act. This legislation appears as title II of this conference report. I would like to ask the gentleman to explain the background of this legislation and describe how some of its provisions are intended to work.
