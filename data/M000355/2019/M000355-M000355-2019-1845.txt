 MERKLEY. Yes.--to allow amendments when this comes to the floor? I am asking if he would allow such amendments.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say that we have had a number of bills that were brought to the floor open for amendment. One of the things we devolved into here, another unfortunate precedent, is Members objecting to time agreements on amendments from either side. So even if the majority leader calls up a bill and has it open for amendment, unless Members of the Senate in both parties will allow there to be time agreements so that we can actually have votes on amendments, it gets bogged down.  I think the complaint of my friend from Oregon is legitimate. I have been very frustrated by the fact that when Icall up a bill and open it up for amendments, I have Members on both sides preventing each other's amendments from getting a vote. I share the frustration of my colleague from Oregon, but I assure him that when I call up a bill and say that it is open for amendment, it is open for amendment. It is just that it requires Senatorial bipartisan cooperation to set time agreements to actually have such votes.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent--I think I have a UC agreement, a UC pending.
