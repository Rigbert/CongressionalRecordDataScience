 President, today, I am introducing the Health Benefits Integrity Act to make sure that most health care dollars that people and employers pay into a managed care health insurance plan get spent on health care and not on overhead.  Under my bill, managed care plans would be limited to spending 15 percent of their premium revenues on administration. This means that if they spend 15 percent on administration, they could spend 85 percent of premiums revenues on health care benefits or services.  This bill was prompted by a study by the Inspector General (IG) for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services reported under a USA Today headline in February, ``Medicare HMOs Hit for Lavish Spending.'' The IG reviewed 232 managed care plans that contract with Medicare and found that in 1999 the average amount allocated for administration ranged from a high of 32 percent to a low of three percent. The IG recommended that the Department establish a ceiling on the amount of administrative expenditures of plans, noting that if a 15 percent ceiling had been place in 1998, an additional $1 billion could have been passed on to Medicare beneficiaries in the form of additional benefits or reduce deductibles and copayments.  The report said, ``This review, similar OIG reviews, and other studies have shown that MCOs' [managed care organizations'] exorbitant administrative costs have been problematic and can be the source for abusive behavior.'' Here are some examples cited by the Inspector General on page 7 of the January 18, 2000 report: $249,283 for food, gifts and alcoholic beverages for meetings by one plan; $190,417 for a sales award meeting in Puerto Rico for one plan; $157,688 for a party by one plan; $25,057 for a luxury box at a sports arena by one plan; $106,490 for sporting events and/or theater tickets at four plans; $69,700 for holiday parties at three plans; $37,303 for wine gift baskets, flowers, gifts and gift certificates at one plan.  It is no wonder that people today are angry at HMOs. When our hard-earned premium dollars are frittered away on purchases like these, we have to ask whether HMOs are really providing the best care possible. Furthermore, in the case of Medicare, we are also talking about wasted taxpayer dollars since Part B of Medicare is funded in part by the general treasury. One dollar wasted in Medicare is one dollar too much. Medicare needs all the funds it can muster to stay solvent and to be there for beneficiaries when they need it.  I was also encouraged to introduce the bill because of annual studies prepared by the California Medical Association, CMA, called the ``Knox-Keene Health Plan Expenditures Summary.'' The March 2001 CMA report covering Fiscal Years 1999 to 2000 found a range of administrative expenditures from plans in my state from a low of 2.7 percent, Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Southern California, to a high of 22.1 percent, OMNI Healthcare, Inc.  If HMOs are to be credible, they must be more prudent in how they spend enrollees' dollars. Administrative expenses must be limited to reasonable expenses.  An October 1999 report by Interstudy found that for private HMO plans, administrative expenses range from 11 percent to 21 percent and that for-profit HMOs spend proportionately more on administrative cost than not-for-profit HMOs. This study found the lowest rate to be 3.6 percent and the highest 38 percent in California! In some states the maximums were even higher.  The shift from fee-for-service to managed care as a form of health insurance has been rapid in recent years. Nationally, 86 percent of people who have employment-based health insurance (81.3 million Americans) are in some form of managed care. Around 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are in managed care nationally (40 percent in California), a figure that doubled between 1994 and 1997. By 2010, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that 31 percent of Medicare beneficiaries will be in managed care. Between 1987 and 1999, the number of health plans contracting with Medicare went from 161 to 299. As for Medicaid, in 1993, 4.8 million people (14 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries) were in managed care. Today, 17.8 million (55.6 percent) are in managed care, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. In California, 52 percent or 2.6 million out of 5 million Medicaid beneficiaries are in managed care.  In California, the state which pioneered managed care for the nation, an estimated 88 percent of the insured are in some form of managed care. Of the 3.7 million Californians who are in Medicare, 40 percent, 1.4 million, are in managed care, the highest rate in the U.S. As for Medicaid in California, 2.5 million people, 50 percent, of beneficiaries are in managed care.  And so managed care is growing and most people think it is here to stay.  I am pleased to say that in California we already have a regulation along the lines of the bill I am proposing. We have in place a regulatory limit of 15 percent on commercial HMO plans' administrative expenses. This was established in my state for commercial plans because of questionable expenses like those the HHS IG found in Medicare HMO plans and because prior to the regulation, some plans had administrative expense as high as 30 percent of premium revenues.  This bill will never begin to address all the problems patients experience with managed care in this country. That is why we also need a strong Patients Bill of Rights bill. I hope, however, this bill will discourage abuses like those the HHS Inspector General found and will help assure people that their health care dollars are spent on health care and are not wasted on outings, parties, and other activities totally unrelated to providing health care services.  I call on my colleagues to join me in enacting this bill.                                 ______                                       By
