Mr. Chairman, here we go again; another nail in the coffin of energy independence. Another nail, in fact, adding to the unemployment rate.                              {time}  1300  If this bill was to become law, mines will be shut down. They will be shut down. And what bothers me the most is we had a bipartisan bill, actually it was passed in 2006, I believe, or 2007, that improved the 1977 Mine Safety Health Act. It was supported by everybody, that side and this side, the administration. And we have not given the time, that's less than a year and a half, given the time for the operators of these mines to even reach that requirement that we said was the right thing to do.  Now, it always amazes me. I don't think there's much coal mining in Vallejo or in the Bay Area or in Point Reyes. And I do respect the gentleman from West Virginia because he does have mining. And I've heard from his operators in that area that there's a very difficult thought process going forth with this bill. Can they operate? Because in this bill, they stop the ability for belt air, which, in fact, was put in for safety purposes, supported by the people who understand this, for diluting methane and dust levels, and this bill prohibits that. How is that improving the life of our miners? It is not.  And more than that, I want to remind people. As bad as it may appear, as very much, you know, heart wrenching when there is a death in a mine, we still have the safest mining industry in the world. China lost 6,000 people, that we know of last year in their coal mines; building one new coal fired plant a week.  And here we are, with this bill, if it was to become law, again, adding another nail in our coffin for energy independence. Coal is a solution to this terrible dependence that we have on foreign oil.  I was a little disappointed today when I saw the President ask the OPEC countries to produce more oil so we can lower the price.  Our fault in this country is we're not producing oil on our lands, which we have, and we're not producing the coal, which we have an abundance of. And I believe, when saying this under the guise of helping the miner out, we are jeopardizing their jobs, jeopardizingthe economy in this country, and driving us further into the depression which may occur.  If that does happen, I want to compliment that side of the aisle, because you haven't addressed the issue of energy. And I'm a little bit disappointed. I watched all the Presidential debates. Not even on my side, let alone that side, has anybody talked about solving the energy problem in this country. We must address that issue because our economy is based on energy that can move product. Every ship is fossilly driven. Every train is fossilly driven. Every truck is fossilly driven. Every car, everything you eat and everything you consume is delivered to you by fossil fuels.  Now, we can improve nuclear power to give us fixed power, and we can burn coal, and we can use solar, and we can use hydro. We can do all these things. But there's fixed power. And we, as a Nation, and this Congress have not got to the point where we understand if we don't do something, we keep sending the dollars abroad, there's a great possibility that this whole economy we have will implode.  I'm saying, wake up, Mr. and Mrs. America. Start asking your Members of Congress, let's do something about energy. You can't conserve yourself into a prosperity position. You've got to have new energy, new production. Yes, drilling. Offshore in California, shame on you. Offshore in Florida, shame on Florida. Offshore in Alaska, shame on Alaska. We must start developing our fossil fuels in the Rocky Mountains. We must start at the Roan Plateau, which you took off the table. The Roan Plateau, have that developed. We have to start doing what is necessary to make sure we're no longer dependent on those foreign countries that are not our friends.  So I urge a ``no'' on this bill because it's another nail in the coffin that creates in this country more weaknesses and not the ability to provide for the future generations.
