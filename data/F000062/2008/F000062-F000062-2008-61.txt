 President, today I am introducing a private relief bill on behalf of Jorge Rojas Gutierrez, his wife, Oliva Gonzalez Gonzalez and their son, Jorge Rojas Gonzalez. The Rojas family are Mexican nationals living in the San Jose area of California.  The story of the Rojas family is compelling and I believe they merit Congress' special consideration for such an extraordinary form of relief as a private bill.  Mr. Rojas and his wife Ms. Gonzalez originally came to the United States in 1990 when their son Jorge Rojas, Jr. was just 2 years old. In 1995, they left the country to attend a funeral, and then re-entered on visitor's visas. The family has since expanded to include a son, Alexis Rojas now age 15 and a daughter Tania Rojas now age 14.  Since arriving in the United States, this family has dedicated themselves to community involvement, a strong work ethic and volunteerism. They have been paying taxes since their arrival in 1990. The family has been described by their friends and colleagues as a ``model American family.'' I would like to tell you some more about each member of the Rojas family.  Mr. Rojas is a hard-working individual who has been employed by Valley Crest Landscape Maintenance in San Jose, California, for the past 14 years. Currently, Mr. Rojas works on commercial landscaping projects. He is well-respected by his supervisor and his peers.  In addition to supporting his family, Jorge has volunteered his time and talents to provide modern green landscaping and a recreational jungle gym to Sherman Oaks Community Charter School, where his two youngest children attend school.  Ms. Gonzalez, in addition to raising her three children, has been very active in the local community. She has worked to help other immigrants assimilate to American life by working as a translator and a tutor for immigrant children at Sherman Oaks Community Charter School and the Y.M.C.A. Kids after-school program.  She has also coached soccer teams, and has recently directed a Second Harvest food drive for the school. Ms. Gonzalez also devotes many hours of her time to the organization People Acting in Community Together PACT, where she works to prevent crime, gangs and drug dealing in San Jose neighborhoods and schools.  Perhaps one of the most compelling reasons for permitting the family to remain in the United States is the impact their deportation would have on their three children. Two of the children, Alexis Rojas age 15 and Tania Rojas age 14, are U.S. citizens. Jorge Rojas, Jr. has lived in the United States since he was a toddler. For these children, this country is the only country they really know.  Jorge Rojas, Jr. is currently working at Jamba Juice. He graduated from Del Mar High School in 2007 and has been accepted to San Jose City College. However, his dreams and aspirations have been placed on hold because he remains subject to deportation.  Alexis and Tania Rojas are students at Sherman Oaks Community Charter School. They are described by their teachers as ``fantastic, wonderful and gifted'' students. In fact, the principal at Sherman Oaks has described all three of the children as ``honest, hard-working academic honor students'' and has commended all of them for their on-campus leadership.  It seems so clear to me that this family has embraced the American dream and their continued presence in our country would do so much to enhance the values we hold dear. I have received 30 letters from the community in support of this family. Enactment of the legislation I have introduced today will enable the Rojas family to continue to make significant contributions to their community as well as the United States.  I ask my colleagues to support this private bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3137       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Hon. Diane Feinstein,     Post Street,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We are the Rojas Family: Jorge      Rojas, Sr., 43 years old, supervisor, Valley Crest Landscape      Co.; Oliva Rojas, 40 years old, tutor, Sherman Oaks Charter      School; Jorge Rojas 19 years old, son; Alexis Rojas, 15 years      old, son; and Tania Rojas, 14 years old, daughter.       The reason for this letter is to ask for your help on our      immigration status.       We came to the U.S.A. in 1990, there were three in the      family at that time: my wife Oliva, my son Jorge, he was l-     year and 5 months old, and myself. Years later Alexis and      Tania were born in California.       After a long immigration process we were denied to stay in      the U.S.A. and now we are facing a voluntary departure      schedule on or before April 18, 2008, in the meantime we are      asking to extend our departure until the kids finish the      school year that ends on June 13, 2008.       Our main goal is to stay in the U.S.A. as legal residents,      my kids were born here and grew up here, even my son Jorge      was too young to remember were he was born, this is all that      they have ever known. What I want the most now is that my      kids keep going with their hopes and dreams and be able to      stay in school and someday be great citizens in this Great      Country.       After several changes in immigration laws, we started a      legal process trying to get a legal residence in this      country. One day we knew thru other people that someone in      the Los Angeles area could help us out to get a legal      residence, wrongly we started a political asylum process,      that later will be an application for cancellation of      removal, we were misled, we were told that its only a way to      get a hearing with an immigration judge and because we were      in the U.S.A. for more than 10 years and we have 2 citizen      kids will be a lot easier, afterwards we found out that this      person was not a lawyer and he was a notary, whom only submit      political asylum applications and then turn everything to a      lawyers that represent us in the hearings. A lot of trips to      L.A. but one day received a call telling me that me case was      move out to San Francisco and the next hearing will be there.       At the first hearing in San Francisco the Judge instructed      me to get a lawyer that represent us in the upcoming process.      We hire a lawyer with immigration speciality, a real lawyer,      it was on March 2003. He represent us I think the best way      that he could, after almost 3 years on April 2006, we were      denied to stay and granted with voluntary departure within 60      days, this happen on April 2006.       Still we had another chance; appeal to the Court of Appeals      for the Ninth Circuit, so in May 2006, we hired another      lawyer with better knowledge in appeals. Our efforts to stay      legally here never give up.       On February 24, 2008 we received a decision from the Board      of Immigration Appeals saying that we have to leave the      country voluntary in the remaining 32 days after the final      decision that will be made on March 17, 2008.       Now our last hope is if you can help us.       We are a very close family that always been working and      doing voluntary jobs and time to the community where for 14      years we belong participating not only with our kids, we were      among parents and teacher helping.       My wife Oliva has been a soccer coach and she is involved      in the community association named ``PACT'' (Parents Acting      in Community Together), helping too in the distribution of      food with ``The Second Harvest Food Program''. Myself I was a      soccer coach too and involved in a lot of jobs done to the      Sherman Oaks Charter School, were my three kids attended.       My kids now are emotionally affected because they can not      understand all that is happening to us and of course to them,      for me is really hard to explain them.       Even so we all know the decision that had been made, we      keep on going everything; work, school and time together as a      family. We have our hopes and faith in something or somebody      that is going to help us to stay in The U.S.A.       I am pretty sure that with your help my whole family will      keep this faith, hopes and dreams going and we will be part      of this great country.       I want to say ahead that myself and my family are deeply      grateful for you time and for whatever you can do for us.       Thank you so much.                                                      Jorge Rojas.     Update on this letter                                                   March 19, 2008.       On March 17, 2008 we were granted by de I.C.E. Office with      60 days more until my kids can finish the school year, now      our voluntary departure is schedule on or before June 18,      2008. That gives us more comfort and time; hoping that you      can help us.       Thanks again for your time and help.     Jorge Rojas.                                  ____                                     House of Representatives,                                    Washington, DC, June 13, 2008.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Hart Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: In late February, staff from my      office met with Jorge     Rojas and his wife, Oliva Gonzalez Rojas in regards to their      immigration case and that of their son, Jorge Rojas Gonzalez.      After exhausting all appeals to the decision of the      Immigration Judge, the family was scheduled to depart the      United States under an order of voluntary departure to Mexico      on April 18, 2008.       My office supported their request to get an extension of      the voluntary departure order until June 18, 2008 so that the      two younger United States citizen children could finish the      school year. As of this moment the family is still scheduled      to leave the United States on June 18th. At the time of the      first meeting, my office also referred the Rojas family to      their U.S. Senators offices to inquire about the possibility      of a private bill being introduced.       Since February, my office has received many calls from      individuals supportive of the Rojas family and concerned      about their impending departure. My office was also contacted      by People Acting in Community Together (PACT), members of the      Santa Clara Interfaith Council, Santa Clara County Office of      Human Relations, YMCA, and Sherman Oaks Community Charter      School.       In addition, on March 9, 2008, the Rojas family      participated in a community forum organized by First      Presbyterian Church of Palo Alto. The Rojas family      participated on a panel which included a San Francisco      Immigration Judge, the Director of the Santa Clara County      Office of Human Relations, and one of my staff members. The      event was co-sponsored by the League of Women Voters of Palo      Alto, the Santa Clara Council of Churches, Multifaith Voices      for Peace and Justice, and El Buen Pastor, Iglesia Episcopal      Church (Redwood City). The organizers have verified that      there were a total of 115 attendees at the event, many of      whom still inquire about the Rojas family and their      situation.       It is apparent that the Rojas family is a hard-working,      beloved family that has contributed much to their community      through their volunteer work. My office has been as      supportive as possible of this family and of their efforts to      exhaust all possible avenues to remain legally in the United      States.       Thank you for your attention to this important matter.           Sincerely,                                                      Zoe Lofgren,     Member of Congress.                                  ____                                                       ValleyCrest                                        Landscape Maintenance,                                      San Jose, CA, 12 March 2008.     Re Jorge G. Rojas.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate.       Dear Senator Feinstein: Jorge G. Rojas has been working for      our company ValleyCrest Landscape Maintenance since 1994.       Not only is he a valuable member of our team but has been      instrumental in energizing the water conservation and      sustainability issues as they relate to the LEED efforts in      the Bay Area for commercial landscaping.       Jorge Rojas is a technician in Urban Construction. He      obtained his degree from Conalet Technical School in      Guadalajara.       Jorge's skills in that area will be a great loss not only      to the company, but to the state of sustainability and green      programs in Silicon Valley.       Commercial clients are seeking LEED certification for their      existing buildings and industry talent in this arena is      critical.       We at ValleyCrest urge our to consider drafting a private      bill to secure permanent residency for him and his direct      family.       Jorge is also seeking an extension from the Immigration      office to allow his American resident children to complete      their graduation.       We would appreciate your thoughtful consideration of this      request.           Sincerely,                                                        Nada Duna,     Regional Manager.                                  ____                                            Sherman Oaks Community                                               Charter School,                                     San Jose, CA, March 13, 2008.       To Whom It May Concern: I write this letter in support of      the Oliva Gonzales Rojas and her family. Many years ago she      and her husband, Jorge, left Mexico to come to the United      States. At that time their oldest son was two years old. They      have lived in the United States in California for the last      eight en years.       During that time they have consistently demonstrated their      commitment to this country, appreciating the opportunities      the United States has afforded them. In addition to their      oldest son, they have two other children--a son and daughter,      citizens of the United States. These children have      demonstrated strong academic skills, and they have shown      positive and consistent leadership. They understand the      importance of service to community.       Yesterday, Alexis, their son volunteered at Sherman Oaks,      organizing our book room and hanging posters on the wall. He      has received excellent modeling from his parents who have      donated many hours of service to our school. They have      demonstrated discipline and excellence in their work. Olivia      works at Sherman Oaks as yard duty and as a tutor. Jorge, the      father, has developed a highly successful landscaping design      business, which caters to large-scale corporations and      business parks.       Oliva and Jorge are decent people, who came to America to      live the American dream. For eighteen years they have worked      hard, rearing their children, teaching them the values of      perseverance, diligence, and sacrifice to achieve and to      thrive. Pillars of the community, the family is universally      loved and respected by all at Sherman Oaks School. It was      Jorge, who planted trees and fixed the irrigation system to      maintain the lush fields that are a mecca to our children and      their families. Oliva serves as the liaison for our school to      the neighborhood. She tutors their children, organizes      support for families in need, and integrates new immigrants      into the school. Oliva and Jorge are good people, model      citizens, and contributors to society.       With great respect, I plead with you to consider the merit      of this case. Specifically, I request that the family may      stay, at least until the end of June, so that their children      can complete this school year. Thank you for your      consideration.           Sincerely,                                                   Nancy Atkinson,     Principal.                                  ____                                                  People Acting in                                           Community Together,                                     San Jose, CA, March 17, 2008.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Post Street,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to express my strong      support for Oliva Rojas and her family and to ask for your      assistance in postponing--and we hope canceling--their order      of removal from the DOHS.       Oliva was an active PACT volunteer leader for several years      in the early 2000s and has continued to support our      organization since then. PACT is a multi-ethnic, inter-faith      grassroots organization that empowers every day people to      create a more just community.       For more than 20 years, PACT has helped ordinary people win      extraordinary victories for our community, not by speaking      for them, but by teaching them how to speak, act, and engage      in the public arena for themselves. Thousands of PACT-     trained, volunteer community leaders have worked together      across ethnic, religious and socio-economic lines to create      innovative and effective public policies that have improved      the lives of hundreds of thousands of people throughout Santa      Clara County. For example, PACT co-founded Santa Clara      County's innovative Children's Health Initiative, which      provides access to health insurance to all low-income      children in the County and has served as a model for similar      programs in twenty-three other California counties plus many      other states, as well.       Oliva was active with the PACT parent group at her child's      charter school. She put in many hours every week to help      improve the school for the benefit of all the children. She      was also a leader in the effort to fight crime, gangs, and      drug dealing in the neighborhood around the school, and      helped organize large meetings with this purpose.       I've been working for more than 15 years to involve      everyday people in the public life of their communities.      While most people feel disconnected and apathetic, Oliva is      full of hope and exudes inspiration about her community. Even      though she is new to this country, she embodies the values we      hold dear, as individuals and as a society: committed to her      family, hard working, involved in the community, participant      in the democratic process.       Our community needs Oliva and her family. We need so many      more people like her. We would be a much weaker community      without her.       Thank you for your assistance.                                                      Matt Hammer,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                                      Sherman Oaks                                     Community Charter School,                                     San Jose, CA, March 10, 2008.     Diane Feinstein,     U.S. Senator,     San Francisco, CA.       Honorable Senator Feinstein: I am writing in behalf of the      Jorge and Oliva Rojas Family and their eminent ``removal''      from the United States. I have had the good fortune to have      known the Rojas family since 1999, when Tania Rojas was in my      Kindergarten class. We did home visits that year, and I was      immediately impressed with the close family ties and      structure within the Rojas household. Tania was a fantastic      student and we had a great year. Her mother, Oliva, was a      ready volunteer for anything that she could help out with at      school, and was always an integral part of our school      community. Two years later, I had Alexis in my fourth grade      class. Another wonderful, intelligent, GATE (Gifted and      Talented) student. That year, he talked about being an      astronaut some day. And, of course, Oliva continued to do      anything and everything to help out. Always with a positive      ``can-do'' attitude and sense of humor.       Oliva started out volunteering, but because she is so      capable, she was soon hired by our school to do almost      everything! As a charter school, we have had more flexibility      in hiring than some schools. In the past, Oliva has helped      out as a substitute, an art teacher, yard duty, tutor, and      parent liaison. Students love and respect her. She is someone      who is always willing to help out where needed. She has been      a lifesaver to me, as a teacher, many times. Whether it's      making copies for me at the last minute, or helping out with      our 4th grade overnight at Sanborn Park when my partner      teacher got sick, or helping me design and build our altar      for Day of the Dead--Oliva is always there. Her     background design for the 4th grade Opera every year, is      always spectacular. She helps students with homework. She      helps our Kindergartners in our ``mid day block''. Our      structure is very different from traditional schools, and      Oliva is someone who helps make it work. She helps make      everything work at our school. I can't even imagine what our      school will be like without her here. Her own 3 children,      Jorge, Alexis and Tania are no longer students at our school,      but truly, all the students at Sherman Oaks are Oliva's kids.       Oliva soon started working in the YMCA's after school and      summer school program, where, once again, she was loved by      all who worked with her. I believe she has worked with them      for over 4 years. I am attaching this year's YMCA brochure,      which, ironically, came to my house just this week. On page 7      is a picture of smiling staff members. Center front, is Oliva      Rojas.       Every October, the Rojas family participates with my      husband with his theater group, Familia Aztlan, in their      multicultural event celebrating Day of the Dead in San Jose.      Both Jorge Sr, and Jr, along with Tania and Alexis,      participate in the parade, wielding large, life sized,      skeleton puppets. Oliva puts her creativity to use, painting      the faces of children and adults alike.       Oliva's removal from this country in mid April will put an      extreme hardship on all the students and teachers at Sherman      Oaks Community Charter School in San Jose for this school      year. As a teacher at this school for 10 years, I can      truthfully say that Oliva Rojas' position at our school      touches every single student. I can't imagine how we would      explain to our students why she was all of a sudden gone--mid      year. What could we say to explain it to them? And they will      ask.       I respectfully ask for your intervention, in whatever way      you can, to get an extension of at least until June for the      removal of the Rojas Family. Ideally, this family merits full      time, legal status in this country based on their many civic      and artistic contributions, stable family, and work ethic.      But, if this is not possible, at least, for the sake of the      students, families, and faculty of Sherman Oaks Community      Charter School, please intervene for an extension until June,      2008.       It is truly this country's loss if/when the Rojas Family is      ``removed.''           Respectfully and hopefully,                                                     Barbara Lynn,     4th Grade Teacher.                                  ____                                      San Jose, CA, March 5, 2008.       Senator Feinstein, I am writing to you because of my      concern for a co-worker and friend, Oliva Rojas. Although she      and her family have been trying to legally stay in the United      States for many years, her appeals have run out and she and      her family will be leaving on a volunteer departure on April      18th.       I am Oliva's supervisor at Sherman Oaks Elementary School      in San Jose in the Campbell Elementary School District, a      bilingual, dual-immersion school. Oliva reports to me      everyday for 2 hours and works with grades K-6 with a      specialty in Kindergarten. (She works other hours for a      different supervisor.)       I can't think of a time when I have been so disappointed in      our government. This is a family that is a vital part of our      community and Oliva is a valued co-worker. Because she is      smart, trusted, responsible and nurturing, Oliva has been      given many duties that go beyond her job description. (At one      time, we were a charter school and Oliva was even able to      substitute teach in classrooms and did a fabulous job.)      Oliva's family has always been the first to step up and take      action if something needed to be done at our school to      improve the grounds or atmosphere. They would be the first to      volunteer to help at the many gatherings we would have. Oliva      and her family are some of the most involved, unselfish      people I have ever met.       If Oliva leaves on April 18th, it would be a hardship to      not only me and her fellow coworkers, but to each and every      child she works with on a daily basis. We depend on her to be      there because she handles the children in a very special      loving way. Nobody could replace her. I have tried to fill      her position with other employees at times when she is sick      or at immigration hearings and it has not worked out. We need      Oliva to be with us throughout this school year and beyond.       I would like you to take a look at her case and help her      and her family out in this matter. Please do whatever you can      do to keep the family here in the United States.           Thank you,     Lynda Zolezzi.                                  ____                                     San Jose, CA, March 11, 2008.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     One Post Street,     San Francisco, CA.       Dear Senator Feinstein: We ask you to please urge ICE to      allow Jorge Rojas, Sr., Oliva Rojas (his wife) and Jorge      Rojas, Jr. (their 19 year old son) to remain in this country      at least till the end of this school year, June 13, so that      their U.S. citizen children, Alexis and Tania, may finish      school. In fact, I would hope that the whole Rojas family      could stay legally for the rest of their lives.       The Rojas family has been a fixture of our community in San      Jose for at least 16 years. We raised our sons, their Jorge      Jr. and our Sam, together from 2nd grade on (both are now 19      and 20 years old respectively), spending many hours together.      We were active together in People Acting Together (PACT)      successfully pushing for health insurance for all children in      Santa Clara Co. in 2000. Oliva is well-know to all children      at Sherman Oaks Community Charter School (Campbell Union      School District) due to her early volunteer work at the      school, then her paid position as an aide, and then as a YMCA      worker running after school programs.       Jorge Rojas, Sr. has been an active parent leader in the      Sherman Oaks Community Charter School neighborhood in west      center San Jose. It was Jorge, as a trained landscaping      professional, who enlisted other parents to reseed and      regrade parts of the school playground and to repair the      irrigation system when the school district had no funds to do      so. It was Jorge who led the work to plant trees from Our      City Forest in front of the school to reduce heat and glare.      It was Jorge who volunteered his weekend operating the      equipment and then doing the hand digging necessary to      install a French drainage system (6 feet deep) into holes cut      in the concrete to ensure proper drainage.       It was both Jorge and Oliva who for years volunteered to      coach soccer teams for neighborhood children after school. As      bilingual parents, Jorge and Oliva have been key to bridging      the cu1tural/language gap between neighbors in our      multicultural neighborhood and school community. If this      family leaves, they will leave a big hole in our community      which has come to depend on them for leadership, translation,      advice, hard work, and friendship. They will also leave a big      hole in the hearts of many of us who count them as close      friends.       It is tragic that a whole community would suffer such a      loss due to a legal error made by an untrained, irresponsible      ``notario'' years ago. This family has spent thousands and      thousands of dollars in an effort to overcome the error of      that notario and to legalize their status.       We ask for your assistance on behalf of the Rojas Family      and our community.           Sincerely,                                 Susan Price-Jang and Victor Jang.                                 ______                                       By
