 I recall when Prime Minister Barak was in office at the end of the Clinton years. The administration brokered a deal that Israel at that time was willing to offer and Palestine said no. It was a deal they probably could not get today.  We have seen a litany of opportunities wasted over the years, and the people who suffered as a result of it have obviously been the Palestinian people.
