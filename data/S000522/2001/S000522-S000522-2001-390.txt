Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, let mejust ask, it is my further understanding that the conferees agree to an overall level of discretionary spending that would allow veterans' discretionary spending to go as high as $26.2 billion in budget authority for fiscal years 2002, a level consistent with the Senate approved level. This level would accommodate major increases in spending for VA health care and for claims processing and could be as much as $3.6 billion above 2001. In any event, the increase would be no lower than the House-passed $1.7 billion.  Is that the chairman of the Committee on the Budget's understanding?
