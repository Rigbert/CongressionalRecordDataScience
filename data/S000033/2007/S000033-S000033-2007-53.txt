  What I wish to focus on is a front-page story that appeared in the Wall Street Journal. The headline reads: ``Republicans Grow Skeptical on Free Trade.'' What it says is:       The new Wall Street Journal/NBC poll posed two statements      to voters. The first was, ``Foreign trade has been good for      the U.S. economy because demand for U.S. products abroad has      resulted in economic growth and jobs for Americans here at      home and provided more choices for consumers.''       The second statement was, ``Foreign trade has been bad for      the U.S. economy because imports from abroad have reduced      demand for American-made goods, cost jobs here at home, and      produced potentially unsafe products.''       Asked which statement came closer to their own view, 59      percent of Republicans named the second statement, while 32      percent pointed to the first.  Back to the headline, ``Republicans Grow Skeptical On Free Trade.'' That is the Republicans.  In terms of the Democrats, earlier in the article:       Other leading Democrats have been harshly critical of trade      expansion, pleasing their party's labor union backers. In a      March 2007 WSJ/NBC poll, before recent scandals involving      tainted imports, 54 percent of Democratic voters said free-     trade agreements have hurt the U.S., compared with 21 percent      who said they have helped.  So what do we have? We have the overwhelming percentage of Republicans who are now telling us that unfettered free trade is not working for American workers.  We have the overwhelming percentage of Democratic supporters telling us free trade has not been working for the American people. Yet despite those numbers, and a growing consensus among working families in this country, what we continue to see is people in the White House, people in the Senate and the House who keep telling us how great free trade is.  Well, let me be very clear. Free trade is very good for the large multinational corporations who can throw American workers out on the street, move abroad to China and other low-wage countries, hire people there for pennies an hour, and bring their products back into this country. For those people, we concede--for the CEOs of large corporations--unfettered free trade has been a very good thing. But for the middle-class and working families of this country, for working families and poor people in Mexico and in other low-wage countries, unfettered free trade has been an unmitigated disaster.  Now, there are a lot of reasons the middle class in America is shrinking. There are a lot of reasons nearly 5 million Americans have slipped into poverty since George Bush has become President. There are a number of reasons. Certainly, one of the processes by which we as a Nation are engaged in a race to the bottom has been the unfettered free-trade agreements negotiated by the President of the United States and passed by the Congress. And by that I mean NAFTA. I mean permanent normal trade relations with China.  The reality of those trade agreements, plus other economic decisions being made by the U.S. Government, is not just that poverty is increasing, it is that median income for working-age families has declined by about $2,400 since the year 2000. It is that personal savings rates in this country are below zero, and have been below zero for eight consecutive quarters--something that has not happened since the Great Depression.  Unfettered free trade has a lot to do with the fact that over 8 million Americans have lost their health insurance since 2000, and we are now up to 47 million Americans without any health insurance.  Hunger in America is growing. The cost of college education is becoming harder and harder for middle-class families to afford. It is interesting to note that a few months ago, in a poll done by, again, the Wall Street Journal, more than two-thirds of the American people believe the U.S. economy is either in a recession now or will be in a recession next year. That is a poll from August done by Wall Street Journal/NBC News.  In my view, it is imperative that our country trade. Nobody I know of believes we should place a wall around this country. Trade is a good thing. But what we must begin doing is negotiating fair trade agreements that reflect the interests of working families in America, working families in other countries, and not just large multinational corporations and the CEOs who help write these trade agreements.  I just returned the weekend before last from a trip to Costa Rica, where I witnessed something that was really quite extraordinary. Costa Rica will be the first country in the entire world to actually have a referendum to vote up or down whether they want to enter these CAFTA agreements. I have no idea who is going to win that referendum. It looks as if it is going to be very close.  But on one side you have all of the moneyed interests. What I heard is, the ``yeses,'' the people who want that free-trade agreement, CAFTA, are spending 100 times more than the people who are in opposition. You have a media which is almost universally supportive in Costa Rica of this CAFTA agreement.  On the other side you have students, you have environmentalists, you have trade unionists, you have environmentalists, you have an extraordinary grassroots movement such that in a nation of fewer than 4 million people, a week ago, 150,000 people came out in a rally--150,000 in a nation of less than 4 million people--to express their opposition to the CAFTA agreement.  We have--especially with the fact that fast track is no longer in existence--the opportunity as a Congress to begin rethinking our trade policies, to create trade policies which create good jobs in the United States and good jobs in the countries of our trading partners, policies which benefit all of the people and not just the people on top.  So I conclude by saying, if some of my Republican friends think it is just progressives or people who are concerned about the needs of working people on this side who are concerned about trade, I suggest you go to the Wall Street Journal today, and what you will find is the vast majority of Republicans now have serious concerns about our current trade policies because they see those trade policies as being harmful to the middle class and working families of this country.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the poll from the Wall Street Journal be printed in its entirety.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 4, 2007]                Republicans Grow Skeptical on Free Trade                           (By John Harwood)       Washington.--By a nearly two-to-one margin, Republican      voters believe free trade is bad for the U.S. economy, a      shift in opinion that mirrors Democratic views and suggests      trade deals could face high hurdles under a new president.       The sign of broadening resistance to globalization came in      a new Wall Street Journal-NBC News Poll that showed a fraying      of Republican Party orthodoxy on the economy. While 60% of      respondents said they want the next president and Congress to      continue cutting taxes, 32% said it's time for some tax      increases on the wealthiest Americans to reduce the budget      deficit and pay for health care.       Six in 10 Republicans in the poll agreed with a statement      that free trade has been bad for the U.S. and said they would      agree with a Republican candidate who favored tougher      regulations to limit foreign imports. That represents a      challenge for Republican candidates who generally echo Mr.      Bush's calls for continued trade expansion, and reflects a      substantial shift in sentiment from eight years ago.       ``It's a lot harder to sell the free-trade message to      Republicans,'' said Republican pollster Neil Newhouse, who      conducts the Journal/NBC poll with Democratic counterpart      Peter Hart. The poll comes ahead of the Oct. 9 Republican      presidential debate in Michigan sponsored by the Journal and      the CNBC and MSNBC television networks.       The leading Republican candidates are still trying to      promote free trade. ``Our philosophy has to be not how many      protectionist measures can we put in place, but how do we      invent new things to sell'' abroad, former New York City      Mayor Rudy Giuliani said in a recent interview. ``That's the      view of the future. What [protectionists] are trying to do is      lock in the inadequacies of the past.''       Such a stance is sure to face a challenge in the 2008      general election. Though President Bill Clinton famously      steered the Democratic Party toward a less-protectionist bent      and promoted the North American Free Trade Agreement, his      wife and the current Democratic front-runner, Hillary Rodham      Clinton, has adopted more skeptical rhetoric. Mrs. Clinton      has come out against a U.S. trade deal with South Korea.       Other leading Democrats have been harshly critical of trade      expansion, pleasing their party's labor union backers. In a      March 2007 WSJ/NBC poll, before recent scandals involving      tainted imports, 54% of Democratic voters said free-trade      agreements have hurt the U.S., compared with 21% who said      they have helped.       While rank-and-file Democrats have long blasted the impact      of trade on American jobs, slipping support among Republicans      represents a fresh warning sign for freemarket conservatives      and American companies such as manufacturers and financial      firms that benefit from markets opening abroad.       With voters provoked for years by such figures as Pat      Buchanan and Ross Perot, ``there's been a steady erosion in      Republican support for free trade,'' says former Rep. Vin      Weber, now an adviser to Republican presidential candidate      Mitt Romney.       One fresh indication of the party's ideological crosswinds:      Presidential candidate Ron Paul of Texas, who opposes the      Iraq war and calls free-trade deals ``a threat to our      independence as a nation,'' announced yesterday that he      raised $5 million in third-quarter donations. That nearly      matches what one-time front-runner John McCain is expected      to report.       In a December 1999 Wall Street Journal-NBC poll, 37% of      Republicans said trade deals had helped the U.S. and 31% said      they had hurt, while 26% said they made no difference.       The new poll asked a broader but similar question. It posed      two statements to voters. The first was, ``Foreign trade has      been good for the U.S. economy, because demand for U.S.      products abroad has resulted in economic growth and jobs for      Americans here at home and provided more choices for      consumers.''       The second was, ``Foreign trade has been bad for the U.S.      economy, because imports from abroad have reduced demand for      American-made goods, cost jobs here at home, and produced      potentially unsafe products.''       Asked which statement came closer to their own view, 59% of      Republicans named the second statement, while 32% pointed to      the first.                             Rocky Outlook       Such sentiment suggests a rocky outlook for trade      expansion. Early in his term, Mr. Bush successfully promoted      a number of new free-trade pacts, but the efforts have      stalled, particularly after Democrats took control of      Congress last November.       Even relatively small deals are facing resistance. While      trade pacts with Peru and Panama have a strong chance of      passing in the current congressional term, deals with South      Korea and Colombia are in serious jeopardy. Some legislators      believe South Korea isn't opening its market wide enough to      American beef and autos.                              `Fast Track'       Presidential ``fast track'' trade negotiating authority has      lapsed. Without such authority, which requires Congress to      take a single up-or-down vote on trade deals, the next      president would have trouble pursuing large trade agreements,      particularly the stalled global Doha Round.       Julie Kowal, 40 years old, who works in a medical lab and      is raising five children in Omaha, Neb., said she worries      that Midwestern producers face obstacles selling beef and      autos abroad. ``We give a lot more than we get,'' she said.      ``There's got to be a point where we say, `Wait a minute.' ''       Beyond trade, Republicans appear to be seeking a move away      from the president. Asked in general terms, a 48% plurality      of Republicans said the next president should ``take a      different approach'' from Mr. Bush, while 38% wanted to      continue on his path.       In the poll, Mr. Giuliani maintained his lead in the      Republican field with support from 30% of respondents. Former      Sen. Fred Thompson drew 23% in the survey, to 15% for Sen.      John McCain, 10% for Mr. Romney and 4% for former Arkansas      Gov. Mike Huckabee. The telephone survey of 606 Republican      voters, conducted Sept. 28-30, has a margin of error of      four percentage points.       A clear majority of Republicans want more tax cuts, but      among Republicans who identify themselves as moderate or      liberal--about one-third of the party's primary voters--a 48%      plurality favored some tax increase to fund health care and      other priorities.       In part, the concern about trade reflected in the survey      reflects the changing composition of the Republican      electorate as social conservatives have grown in influence.      In questions about a series of candidate stances, the only      one drawing strong agreement from a majority of Republicans      was opposition to abortion rights.       Post-911 security concerns have also displaced some of the      traditional economic concerns of the Republican Party that      Ronald Reagan reshaped a generation ago. Asked which issues      will be most important in determining their vote, a 32%      plurality cited national defense, while 25% cited domestic      issues such as education and health care, and 23% cited moral      issues. Ranking last, identified by just 17%, were economic      issues such as taxes and trade.       John Pirtle, a 40-year-old Defense Department employee in      Grand Rapids, Mich., said he drifted toward the Republican      Party in large part because of his opposition to abortion,      but doesn't agree with the free-trade views of leading      candidates.       ``We're seeing a lot of jobs farmed out,'' said Mr. Pirtle,      whose father works for General Motors Corp. Rankled by      reports of safety problems with Chinese imports, he added,      ``The stuff we are getting, looking at all the recalls, to be      quite honest, it's junk.''                              Bush's Veto       Mr. Bush lately has sought to elevate the importance of      economic issues. Yesterday he vetoed a bill passed by      Congress that would expand funding for a children's-health      program by $35 billion over five years. He slammed what he      described as the Democrats' tax-and-spend approach during a      speech in Lancaster, Pa.       Economic advisers to Republican presidential hopefuls      acknowledge the safety scandals have made defending free      trade more difficult. ``Americans are right to be angered at      companies that take shortcuts'' in importing goods, said      Larry Lindsey, once the top economic aide in the Bush White      House and now an adviser to Mr. Thompson's presidential bid.      ``The next president has to promote free trade by playing      hardball, and to be seen doing so.''       In the Republican campaign so far, elevating populist trade      concerns has been left to the long shots. ``The most      important thing a president needs to do is to make it clear      that we're not going to continue to see jobs shipped      overseas. . . . and then watch as a CEO takes a $100 million      bonus,'' Mr. Huckabee said at a debate earlier this year.      ``If Republicans don't stop it, we don't deserve to win in      2008.''
