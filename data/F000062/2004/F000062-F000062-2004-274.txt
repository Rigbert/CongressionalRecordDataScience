 President, I rise today to offer legislation to provide lawful permanent residence status to Jose Buendia Balderas, Alicia Aranda De Buendia and Ana Laura Buendia Aranda, Mexican nationals who live in the Fresno area of California.  I have decided to introduce legislation on their behalf because I believe this family is deserving of an exception.  Firstly, an immigration judge has granted the family relief, only to have that decision overturned by the Board of Immigration Appeals. Immigration Judge Polly A. Webber heard that Jose Buendia and his wife, Alicia Aranda de Buendia, should be granted cancellations of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act. In her decision, Immigration Judge Webber stated that she felt that the Buendias 9-year-old son would face exceptional and extremely unusual hardship if the family was deported from the United States.  The immigration judge's decision was based on testimony taken from Jose and Alicia Buendia, as well as Alicia Buendia's sister, who is a lawful permanent resident. The immigration judge found that if the Buendia's son ``wanted to go to school in Mexico past sixth grade, he would have major obstacles in being able to do so, which the Court can only take as extreme hardship in terms of 2-hour transportation that may or may not be available, separation from parents, perhaps having to live in a strange environment with strange people, moving away from his relatives in the United States . . . being subjected to substandard health care, economic instability, and poor living conditions.''  Unfortunately, the Board of Immigration Appeals overturned the immigration judge's decision. In a one paragraph decision the Board of Immigration Appeals concluded ``that the respondent failed to establish the required hardship to his United States citizen son, who was age 9 at the time of the hearing.'' That one sentence was the basis for overturning an immigration judge's decision.  Secondly, Mr. Buendia attempted to legalize his immigration status but was not successful due to an unscrupulous lawyer and a misinterpretation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service concerning applicants eligibility to apply for legalization under the 19876 amnesty law.  Because Mr. Buendia has been in this country for so long, he qualified for legalization pursuant to the Immigration and Reform Control Act of 1986. Unfortunately his legalization application was never acted upon.  One reason it was not acted upon is because his attorney, Jose Velez, was convicted of fraudulently submitting legalization and Special Agricultural Worker applications. Because of the criminal conviction, all of Mr. Velez's applications were suspect. Although Mr Buendia's application under the legalization program was found not to contain any fraudulent documentation associated, here began his problems.  Mr. Buendia's legalization application was flagged under Operation Desert Deception, a large-scale investigation which targeted providers of fraudulent applicants and documentation under the legalization and Special Agricultural Workers program. Dozens of people, including INS officers, were convicted of legalization fraud, bribery or tax evasion. At the time of filing Mr. Buendia's application with the Immigration and Naturalization Service the attorney, Jose Velez, was under investigation.  Although Mr. Buendia qualified for legalization because he arrived in the United States prior to January 1, 1982 he was not able to attend his interview in 1990 due to the investigation into his attorney.  Thirdly, it took the Immigration and Naturalization Service nearly 7 years to make a finding concerning his case. He was originally scheduled to be interviewed in June of 1990 on his application for legalization. The official Memo to File by the Immigration and Naturalization Service determining Mr. Buendia's application contained no fraudulent information was not posted until January 1997.  Fourthly, in the intervening years another problem arose. An interpretation by the Immigration and Naturalization Service as to the application of the law to legalization cases such as Mr. Buendia's. Because Mr. Buendia departed the United States in 1987 to marry his wife in Mexico, the Immigration and Naturalization Service stated he was no longer eligible for legalization when it again reviewed his application in 1997. This issue was litigated in CSS v. Meese and Mr. Buendia was a class member in this lawsuit. Unfortunately this lawsuit provide unhelpful to Mr. Buendia because the end result of the litigation was a much more limited class of eligible applicants.  Finally, and of substantial importance, this family has been here for 17 years and built a life here. The Buendias own property, are hard workers, are community minded and have two children in school--one of whom is a U.S. citizen.  Mr. Buendia is a valued employee of Bone Construction. He has been employed by this cement company for the past 5 years. He has proven himself, rising to become a lead foreman. His employer, Timothy Bone, says Mr. Buendia is a ``reliable, hardworking and conscientious'' employee.  Mr. Buendia has an exemplary work history. From 1981 to 1989 he worked for Ascension Hernandez as a landscaper in League City, TX. Thereafter he moved to Las Vegas, NV where he continued to work in landscaping. In 1990 he and his family settled in Reedly, CA where he began working in construction. Knowing nothing about construction, having a background in landscaping, Mr. Buendia was disciplined and persistent in his training and is now a lead foreman for a cement construction company. Mr. Buendia is such a hard worker that he even has his own cement company, which he works on weekends.  Alicia Buendia, Jose Buendia's wife, works as a seasonal fruit packer. Cliff Peters, the owner of Wildwood Orchards where Alicia Buendia worked during the 2003 season, says she is ``a hard worker, dependable, and consistently did a good job.'' He added that work would be available to her on an ongoing seasonal basis. Mrs. Buendia has worked as a seasonal fruit packer for several years.  Their daughter, Ana Laura, is in the 10th grade at Reedley High School where she has earned a 4.0 GPA which shows she is a highly motivated student. An important consideration in this case is that Ana Laura was brought to the United States by her parents when she was only 2 years old. Ana Laura, who will be 16 years old this year, has known no other country than the United States. She believes she is an American. But now she is told she must return to Mexico, a country she has never lived in.  The Buendia's son, Jose, who was born in the United States, is in 8th grade. Like his sister, this is the only country he knows.  Ana Laura and Jose's elementary school principal speaks highly of not only the children but the Buendias. This even though the children are now in high school. Mary Ann Carousso, principal, says in an e-mail to my office, ``I can tell you that I have rarely met 2 more active, concerned, supportive parents than Alica [sic] and Jose Buendia! . . . I don't think they ever missed a parent club meeting.'' Principal Carousso also says that ``Both Jose and Alicia continued to help at our school for several years after their youngest child had graduated . . . Jose, Sr. frequently hauled chairs across a dark parking lot at 9:00 p.m. at night following a parent club meeting . . . He often talked about what parents should be doing to help the school out so that excess money didn't have to be spent on simple construction projects. Alicia is a mom who just never says no to requests for help.'' With that type of endorsement it seems to me we should be thankful to have such involved parents in our communities.  This family has embraced the American dream, and I believe they should be allowed to continue to live in this country. If this legislation is approved, the Buendias will be able to continue to make significant contributions to their community and the United States. It is my hope that Congress passes this private legislation.  I ask unanimous consent numerous letters of support our office has received from members of the Reedley community be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Bone Construction, Inc.,                                    Fresno, CA, December 16, 2003.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Thank you for responding to Jose and Alicia Buenda's tragic      story. Simply, in my judgment the Immigration and      Naturalization Service has run amok in regards to Jose's      persistent effort to properly be granted citizenship. And,      consequently, he and Alicia are being treated outrageously      unjust and ordered to be deported from Bakersfield on      December 31, 2003 for no legitimate reason, leaving behind      their two children without parental guidance and financial      support. Personally, I am embarrassed by ``the system's''      total disregard for the Buenda family and failure to      recognize their ``rights'' and exemplary citizenship. The      Buenda's story is a tragedy and someone should be held      responsible.       Jose has been employed with Bone Construction Inc., for the      past four years. He is a gentleman and model employee who has      earned the position of lead foreman. He and his family enjoy      our benefit package of health insurance and a retirement      plan. He possesses a valid social security number, work visa      and driver's license. And he has requested the appropriate      withholding taxes. Simply, he is self directed and a leader      in our organization with a very promising future.       Your response is urgently being anticipated. Jose has      turned to me for counsel. He is obviously terrified by the      order of deportation and does not know what to do in regards      to compliance. For sure, he does not want to be a fugitive.      We are working feverishly to find a compassionate ear and      immediate assistance. We are praying for a Christmas miracle.           Respectfully,     Timothy F. Bone.                                  ____                                            Wildwood Orchards,                                                  January 9, 2004.     Re Alicia A. Buendia.       To Whom It May Concern: Alicia Buendia worked in the      Wildwood Orchards packing shed during the 2003 season. She      earned approximately $10.00 per hour packing fresh fruit on a      piecework basis.       She was a hard worker, dependable, and consistently did a      good job. Work would be available to her on an ongoing      seasonal basis.           Sincerely,                                                     Cliff Peters,     Owner.                                  ____     From: Mary Ann Carousso      To:      Date: Tuesday, January 6, 2004     Subject: Jose & Alicia Buendia       Good morning, Shelly.       First, here is the information you wanted on the children.       (1) Ana ``Laura'' Buendia, Grade 10, Reedley High School      (John Campbell, principal).     Biology with Tony Rocella     Drama 2 with Erin Bray     French 2 with Gail Hutchinson     PE with Pablo Saenz     Tutorial with Pablo Saenz     Video Prod. with Noe Camacho     English with Jennifer Moore     Geometry with James Rudometkin     Jose ``Alex'' Buendia, Grade 8, Grant Middle School, (Bill      Wachtel, principal).     Homeroom with Lynn Mann     Science with Eric Thiessen     Algebra with Lee Bull     Reading/Writing with Jean Crawford     PE with Rick Furlong     Computer with Kristie Bartlett     Academic Skills with Monica Benner       Secondly, I promised to give you some notes on the      conversation we had last night. Both Laura and Alex attended      elementary school here at Jefferson School, where I am the      principal. I can tell you that I have rarely met 2 more      active, concerned, supportive parents than Alicia and Jose      Buendia! As a new principal, I appreciated the eagerness that      Jose and Alicia demonstrated in stepping up to any matter of      parental involvement! Neither of them let the language      barrier stand in the way of their VERY ACTIVE involvement at      our school. I don't think they ever missed a parent club      meeting. Alicia was at school several days a week      volunteering for whatever project I needed help on. She      attended district level meetings as our parent representative      for several years. Both Jose and Alicia continued to help at      our school for several years after their youngest child had      graduated. (I used to tease them about having more children      so I could keep them at Jefferson forever!) Jose, Sr.      frequently hauled chairs across a dark parking lot at 9:00      p.m. at night following a parent club meeting that had to be      held at our neighboring school. He often talked about what      parents should be doing to help the school out so that excess      money didn't have to be spent on simple construction      projects. Alicia is a mom who just never says no to requests      for her help. Both Ana (Laura) and Jose, Jr. (Alex) were good      students at Jefferson, whose teachers were always delighted      to see their names on their rosters at the beginning of the      year. I can't help but feel that, if anything, these 2      extraordinary parents are being punished for simply being too      honest. I want VERY MUCH to help them. I have appreciated      TREMENDOUSLY the work of Senator Feinstein's office in      assisting these great folks. My letter of support is included      in the Buendia packet. Please let me know how I can rally      support for these amazing people. I owe them that at the very      least, for their extraordinary friendship to Jefferson      Elementary School.           Sincerely,     Mary Ann Carousso.                                  ____                                S. 2036       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
