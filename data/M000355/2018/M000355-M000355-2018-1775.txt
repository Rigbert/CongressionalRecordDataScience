 President, I would like this morning to give an update to my colleagues, given the challenges associated with the weather--and also as we move toward a conclusion of the omnibus.  I have spoken to the Democratic leader. It is my expectation that we will move forward with votes today. We are hoping to move them forward on the sex trafficking bill, moving them up in the day, hopefully, to accommodate safe travel. So we will notify everyone when votes are scheduled.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
