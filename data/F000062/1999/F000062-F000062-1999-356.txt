 President, today, Senator Olympia Snowe and I are introducing a bill to guarantee that the decision of how long a patient receives care in the hospital is left to the attending physician. Our legislation would require health insurance plans to cover the length of hospital stay for any procedure or illness as determined by the attending physician, in consultation with the patient, to be medically appropriate.  The bill is endorsed by the American Medical Association, the AmericanCollege of Surgeons, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Neurology, and the American Psychological Association.  Only a physician taking care of the patient, who understands the patient's history, medical condition and needs, should make the decision as to how much hospital care a person needs. Physicians are trained to evaluate all the unique needs and problems of each individual patient. Every patient's condition varies and the course of their illness also varies. Some patients are fragile or weak. Others do not respond well to general anesthesia. Complications arise. Each patient is a unique individual with varying degrees of health.  The American Medical Association, concerned that pre-determined length of stay criteria are ``moving away from scientific, patient-focused principles of care,'' resulting in ``quicker and sicker'' discharges and poor patient outcomes, has developed patient-based discharge criteria. These criteria include considerations such as the patient's physiological, psychological, social and functional needs. The AMA criteria say: ``Patients should not be discharged from the hospital when their disease or symptoms cannot be adequately treated or monitored in the discharge setting.''  Lengths of stay should not be determined by insurance company clerks, actuaries or non-medical personnel. It is the attending physician, not a physician or other representative of an insurance company, that should decide when to admit and discharge someone.  A number of physicians and other health care providers have expressed to me their great frustration with the current health care climate, in which they feel they spend too much of their time trying to justify their decisions on medical necessity to insurance companies.  For example, Donna Damico, a nurse in a Maryland psychiatric unit of a hospital, told National Public Radio on October 1, 1997: ``I spend my days watching the care on my unit be directed by faceless people from insurance companies on the other end of the phone. My hospital employs a full-time nurse whose entire job is to talk to insurance reviewers * * * The reviewer's background can range anywhere from high school graduate to nurse, social worker or even actual physicians.''  In 1996, we addressed the problem of ``drive-through'' baby deliveries because insurance plans would only pay for one day of hospital car for childbirth. This was fraught with problems like jaundiced babies that had to be rehospitalized and mothers who developed problems which only worsened because they were sent home despite physicians' view that a mother's and baby's stability are not usually reached until the third post-partum day.  We have also been told of so-called ``drive-through'' mastectomies. Some HMO's have made mastectomy an outpatient procedure. Women who have had a radical mastectomy at 7:30 a.m. have been out on the street at 4:30 that afternoon, dizzy and weak, unable to cope with drainage tubes and disfigurement. Senator Snowe and I are introducing a separate bill to address this.  A California pediatrician told me of a child with very bad asthma. The insurance plan authorized 3 days in the hospital; the doctor wanted 4-5 days. He told us about a baby with infant botulism (poisoning), a baby with a toxin that had spread from the intestine to the nervous system so that the child could not breathe. The doctor thought a 10-14 day hospital stay was medically necessary for the baby; the insurance plan insisted on one week.  A California neurologist told us about a seven-year-old girl with an ear infection who went to the doctor feverish. When her illness developed into pneumonia, she was admitted to the hospital. After two days she was sent home, but she then returned to the hospital three times because her insurance plan only covered a certain number of days. The third time she returned she had meningitis, which can be life threatening. The doctor said that if this girl had stayed in the hospital the first time for five to seven days, the antibiotics would have killed the infection, and the meningitis would never have developed.  A 27-year-old man from central California had a heart transplant and was forced out of the hospital after 4 days because his HMO would not pay for more days. He died.  Nurses in St. Luke's Hospital, San Francisco, say that women are being sent home after only two nights after a hysterectomy and two nights for a Caesarean section delivery, both of which are major abdominal surgeries, even though physicians think the women are not ready to go home.  Lisa Breakey, a San Jose speech pathologist, came to my office and told us that she is providing home health for stroke patients she used to see in the hospital. She sees patients in their homes who have tubes in their stomach for feeding and tracheotomy tubes in their throats for breathing. These trach tubes have an inflated balloon or cuff which a family member must deflate and inflate by using a needle. Family members are supposed to suction the patient's mouth and throat before they deflate the cuff. Families, she stressed, are providing intensive care, for which they are unprepared and untrained. Bedrooms have become hospital rooms.  Another California physician told us about a patient who needed total hip replacement because her hip had failed. The doctor believed a seven-day stay was warranted; the plan would only authorize five.  Rep. Greg Ganske, a physician serving in the House, told the story of a six-year-old child who nearly drowned. The child was put on a ventilator and it appeared that he would not live. The hospital got a call from the insurance company, asking if the doctor had considered sending the boy home because home ventilation is cheaper.  These cases can be summarized in the comments of a Chico, California, maternity ward nurse: ``People's treatment depends on the type of insurance they have rather than what's best for them.''  As I have mentioned, premature discharges can increase readmissions and medical complications.  On March 23, 1998, American Medical News (according to Dr. David Phillips) reported that the ``shift toward outpatient treatment actually has come at quite a high price * * * an increased loss of lives.'' This University of California study found that medication errors are 3 times higher among outpatients than inpatients and medical personnel in outpatient care provide limited oversight of medications' side effects.  Ms. Damico, the nurse interviewed on NPR, said, ``Patients return to us in acute states because their insurance will no longer pay the same amount for their outpatient treatment * * * [They] deteriorate to the point of suicidal thoughts or attempts and need to return to the hospital.'' She cited the example of a suicidal woman whose plan denied a hospital admission requested by her physician. After the doctor told her of the denial, she took twenty 50-milligram tabs of Benadryl, was then admitted, and the plan then had to pay for hospital care, an ambulance and emergency room fees.  So not only do premature discharges compromise health, they also ultimately cost the insurer more.  Physicians say they have to fight almost daily with insurance companies to give patients the hospital care they need and to justify their decisions about patient care.  An American Medical Association review of a managed care contract (Aetna US Healthcare) found that the contract gives ``the company the unilateral authority to change material terms of the contract and to make determinations of medical necessity * * * without regard to physician determinations or scientific or clinical protocols. * * *,'' according to the January 19, 1998 American Medical News.  A study by the American Academy of Neurology found that the guidelines (Milliman and Robertson) used by many insurance companies on length of stay are ``extraordinarily short in comparison to a large National Library of Medicine database * * * And that [the guidelines] do not relate to anything resembling the average hospital patient or attending physician * * *.'' The neurologists found that these guidelines were ``statistically developed,'' and not scientifically sound or clinically relevant.  A study in the April 1997 Bulletin of the American College of Surgeonsfound that surgeons stated that the appropriate length of stay for an appendectomy is zero to five days, while insurance industry guidelines set a specific coverage limit of one day.  The arbitrary limits set by HMO's and insurance plans are resulting in unintended consequences. Some 7 in 10 physicians said that in dealing with managed care plans, they have exaggerated the severity of a patient's condition to ``prevent him or her from being sent home from a hospital prematurely.'' Dr. David Schriger, at UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, said that he routinely has patients such as a frail, elderly woman with the flu, who is not in imminent danger but could encounter serious problems if she is sent home during the night. He told the Washington Post, ``At this point I have to figure out a way to put her in the hospital. . . . And typically, I'll come up with a reason acceptable to the insurer,'' and orders a blood test and chest x-ray to justify admission.  The Post article also cited Kaiser Permanente's Texas division, which ``warned doctors in urgent care centers not to tell patients they required hospitalization,'' as one Kaiser administrator recalled. ``We basically said [to] the UCC doctors, `If you value your job, you won't say anything about hospitalization. All you'll say is, I think you need further evaluation. . . .' ''  Ms. Damico, the psychiatric nurse interviewed on NPR said, ``Our utilization review nurse gives all of us, including the doctors, good advice on how to chart so that our patients' care will be covered. . . . We all conspire quietly to make certain the charts look and sound bad enough.''  On August 2, 1998, calling it the ``brave new world of managed care,'' the San Jose Mercury News reported, ``to cut costs HMOs are shifting the burden of caring for the sick from their staff and provider networks to patients themselves and their often ill-prepared family members,'' by reducing hospital stays. ``Patients who used to be in the hospital for a week after a hip replacement now stay only three days; patients who had coronary artery bypass graft surgery are pushed out after four or five. Doctors are routinely performing operations in outpatient surgery centers, clinics or their offices, which were once done in the hospital.'' This article cited, as examples, mastectomies, knee surgery, parts of bone marrow transplants, and cancer chemotherapies.  The American College of Surgeons said it all when this prestigious organization wrote: ``We believe very strongly that any health care system or plan that removes the surgeon and the patient from the medical decision-making process only undermines the quality of that patient's care and his or her health and well-being. . . . specific, single numbers [of days] cannot and should not be used to represent a length of stay for a given procedure.'' (April 24, 1997) ACS on March 5 wrote, ``We believe very strongly that any health care system or plan that removes the surgeon and the patient from the medical decision making process only undermines the quality of that patient's care and his or her health and well being.''  The American Medical Association wrote on May 20, 1998, ``We are gratified that this bill would promote the fundamental concept, which the AMA has always endorsed, that medical decisions should be made by patients and their physicians, rather than by insurers or legislators.  . . . We appreciate your initiative and ongoing efforts to protect patients by ensuring that physicians may identify medically appropriate lengths of stay, unfettered by third party payers.''  The American Psychological Association, on March 4, 1998 wrote me, ``We are pleased to support this legislation, which will require all health plans to follow the best judgment of the patient and attending provider when determining length of stay for inpatient treatment.''  New treatments, particularly less invasive treatments, have shortened many hospital stays, but so also has pressure from insurers. Business and Health magazine reported in ``The State of Health Care in America 1998'' that ``HMOs and capitated point-of-service plans'' were associated with the lowest inpatient stays. Other studies reveal that in areas with high HMO competition, health care utilization is lower for the entire population.'' This study shows that for patients with traditional fee-for-service insurance, the average length of stay in 1995 was 4.9 days. For HMOs, it was 4.2 days. California Health Care Association data show that in my state, the average length of stay has declined from 5.70 days in 1986 to 4.45 in 1995. A study in the spring 1996 issue of Health Affairs concluded that the number of inpatient days per thousand residents is lower and has declined faster in California than the national average. The average length of stay in California in 1996 was 5.3 days, while nationally it was 6.4 days. For example, a woman getting a mastectomy in New York will stay in the hospital an average of 5.78 days, but a mastectomy patient in California is likely to stay 2.98 days. (Inquiry, winter 1997-1998).  Americans are disenchanted with the health insurance system in this country, as HMO hassles mount and physicians get effectively overruled by insurance companies. Arbitrary insurance company rules cannot address the subtleties of medical care. Three out of every four Americans are worried about their health care coverage and half say they are worried that doctors are basing treatment decisions strictly on what insurance plans will pay for.  This bill is one step toward returning medical decision-making to those medical professionals trained to make medical decisions.           summary of the hospital length of stay act of 1998  Requires plans to cover hospital lengths of stay for all illnesses and conditions as determined by the physician, in consultation with the patient, to be medically appropriate.  Prohibits plans from requiring providers (physicians) to obtain a plan's prior authorization for a hospital length of stay.  Prohibits plans from denying eligibility or renewal for the purpose of avoiding these requirements.  Prohibits plans from penalizing or otherwise reducing or limiting reimbursement of the attending physician because the physician provided care in accordance with the requirements of the bill.  Prohibits plans from providing monetary or other incentives to induce a physician to provide care inconsistent with these requirements.  Includes language clarifying that--  Nothing in the bill requires individuals to stay in the hospital for a fixed period of time for any procedure;  Plans may require copayments but copayments for a hospital stay determined by the physician cannot exceed copayments for any preceding portion of the stay.  Does not pre-empt state laws that provide greater protection.  Applies to private insurance plans, Medicare, Medicaid, Medigap, federal employees' plans, Children's Health Insurance Plan, the Indian Health Service   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.
