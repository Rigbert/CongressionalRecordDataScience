 President, I wish to pay tribute to a good friend of mine and a friend to the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Dr. John Chowning, who served as the vice president for church and external relations and executive assistant to the president at Campbellsville University, has recently retired from that post after more than a quarter century with that institution. I know he is going to be greatly missed by his colleagues, by the higher education community across the State, and by all of us who work on and care about education issues.  Dr. Chowning first became involved in fundraising for Campbellsville University in 1989. He became a member of the university's board of trustees in 1992. He served on that board for 7 years, including service as board chair. Then he became a full-time employee in 1998. He taught at the school for several years as an adjunct in the political science department and served as chair of the university's diversity committee, strategic planning, and university council.  In his various roles throughout the years, Dr. Chowning has taken the lead or been a major influence on several important issues. He established a dialogue on race to foster racial reconciliation. He led Greater Campbellsville United, an organization that strives to create opportunity for all residents of the Campbellsville-Taylor County region. He helped found the Campbellsville-Taylor County Economic Development Authority and served as its chairman.  Working with the Economic Development Authority, he led the way to create a dislocated worker program in Campbellsville when a factory in the region closed and caused jobs to leave the area. And I am proud of the work he and I did together to help create the university's Technology Training Center, a partnership with local governments and Campbellsville University to provide training to the local workforce.  The list of people who are congratulating Dr. Chowning on a remarkable career of service is long, and I am proud to add my name to that list. I am pleased by the fact that Dr. Chowning will remain on in a part-time capacity so Campbellsville University and the Commonwealth can continue to reap the benefit of his knowledge, wisdom, and experience. I want to wish him and his family the very best as he begins this new chapter.  A local publication, the Greensburg Record-Herald, recently published an article extoling Dr. Chowning's life of accomplishment. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Greensburg Record-Herald, Dec. 23, 2015]          CU's John Chowning Announces Retirement as of Jan. 1                           (By Joan McKinney)       Dr. John Chowning, vice president for church and external      relations and executive assistant to the president at      Campbellsville University and a former chair and board member      of the Campbellsville University Board of Trustees, has      announced his retirement effective Jan. 1, 2016.       Dr. Michael V. Carter, president of Campbellsville      University, with whom Chowning worked for 17 years, said,      ``John Chowning is one of the most gifted individuals I have      ever met. He is a great thinker, and he is wise in his      approach to topics across a broad spectrum.       ``John is a very good writer, an accomplished speaker,      teacher and preacher. He is detailed and is a well-read      public policy analyst on a broad array of topics.       ``We will miss him on a day-to-day basis, but we are so      fortunate he is serving in a new part-time role for the      university.''       Chowning is retiring after 26 years of service to      Campbellsville University. However, he will continue to work      part time as executive assistant to the president for      government, community and constituent relations beginning in      January 2016.       Chowning became involved in fundraising with Campbellsville      University in 1989 and became a member of the university's      Board of Trustees in 1992.       He continued on the board for the next seven years, serving      as chair in 1996 and 1997. He became a full-time employee in      February 1998.       Dr. Joseph L. Owens, who is serving his fifth term as chair      of the Campbellsville University Board of Trustees, said,      ``Dr. John Chowning is a shining example of selfless service      that has made a difference in many lives at Campbellsville      University. He is highly motivated, personable and a spirit-     filled man of God.       ``His love for the Lord is exemplified in his Christ-like      character, as well as his concern for excelling in diversity,      diplomacy and the development of bridge-building      relationships.''       Serving as executive vice president for church and external      relations and executive assistant to the president has been      ``a very humbling and rewarding career path in which God's      divine guidance has been evident in the progress CU has      seen,'' Chowning said.       He taught as an adjunct for several years in Campbellsville      University's political science department. He has served as      chair of the university's diversity committee, strategic      planning and University Council.       Chowning founded and has directed the Kentucky Heartland      Institute on Public Policy at Campbellsville University which      has hosted a wide array of speakers and forums on a host of      public policy issues.       Chowning has been involved in many endeavors at      Campbellsville University including race reconciliation, and      establishing Dialogue on Race, a project dear to his heart.      He has served as a leader of Greater Campbellsville United,      the focus of which is to help create an environment of      equality and opportunity for all residents of Campbellsville-     Taylor County and the heartland region of Kentucky.       Chowning was one of the founding members of Team Taylor      County (Campbellsville-Taylor County Economic Development      Authority) and served for several years as chair and      continues as a member of the board.       He received the Governor's Development Leadership Award in      1999 and was named Citizen of the Year for Campbellsville-     Taylor County two separate years by the Campbellsville-Taylor      County Chamber of Commerce.       Chowning was founding member of the Center for Rural      Development and former chair; founding member of the Southern      Kentucky Economic Development Corporation and former chair;      and founding member and former board member and secretary of      Forward in the Fifth education reform group.       With his work with the Economic Development Authority in      Campbellsville, he was instrumental in organizing a      dislocated worker program at Campbellsville when Fruit of the      Loom closed in Campbellsville in 1997-98.       With the support of CU presidents Dr. Ken Winters and      Carter, Chowning proposed the university's Technology      Training Center and coordinated efforts to secure funding for      the project by working with U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell.       Chowning has left his mark on Campbellsville University      with the naming of the Pence-Chowning Art Gallery, the      Chowning Art Shop, the Chowning Executive Dining Room and the      Chowning Patio.       He and his wife, Cathy Pence Chowning, have established an      endowed scholarship fund at Campbellsville University that      provides annual scholarship awards to qualifying minority      students.       In his role as a pastor, Chowning is an active member and      former secretary of Taylor County Ministerial Association and      is a member of the executive boards of Taylor County Baptist      Association and Zion District Association of Baptists.       He has led his church, Saloma Baptist Church of which he      has served as senior pastor since 1994, to become a member of      the General Association of Baptists in Kentucky, the state's      historic black Baptist state convention--one of two      historically Anglo Baptist churches to join the GABKY. He has      been active in the life of the GABKY for the past several      years.       Chowning has a master's of public administration (planning      emphasis) from Eastern Kentucky University; a bachelor of      arts in political science from Transylvania University, and      an associate of arts from Lindsey Wilson College.       ``From serving as trustee chair and vice chair and two      terms as a board member to the past 18 years in my current      role, my association with Campbellsville University has been      one of the most rewarding and meaningful affiliations of my      career,'' Chowning said.                          ____________________
