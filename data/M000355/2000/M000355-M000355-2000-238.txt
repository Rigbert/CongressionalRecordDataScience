 He lived up until a couple years ago. He lived in my hometown of Louisville, KY. His mission, toward the end of his life, was to make sure that flag etiquette was always followed. He had become an expert on the subject of flag etiquette, which is apparently quite complicated because it includes ways in which the flag can be displayed, in addition to what we are all familiar with as Boy Scouts, about folding the flag properly. He was constantly irritated and offended by ways in which well-meaning citizens groups used the flag that he felt were a violation of respect with which the flag should be treated in a category of behavior generally referred to as flag etiquette. Frankly, we were all somewhat confused in trying to do that properly.  I wonder if we would not, here in the Congress, be right back in the same soup, so to speak, as the Senator from Utah points out, in trying to determine what is and what isn't proper respect for the flag.
