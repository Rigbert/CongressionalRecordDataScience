Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Hilliard) for his contribution, not just to speak on this resolution, but his contribution over at least three, possibly four decades of service to his State, to his community and to our Nation. I thank the gentleman from Alabama.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks), my friend, one of our newer Members, but one of our most able Members.
