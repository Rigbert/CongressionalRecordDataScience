Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5363 to provide a cost-of-living adjustment for Federal judges in fiscal year 2005.  By way of background, Congress enacted the Executive Salary Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act in 1975, which was intended to give judges, Members of Congress and high-ranking executive branch officials automatic COLAs accorded other Federal employees unless rejected by Congress. In 1981, Congress amended the statute by enacting section 140 of Public Law 97-92, which requires specific congressional action to grant judges a COLA.  Mr. Speaker, the legislation before us is based on the template set forth in H.R. 3349, now Public Law 108-167. That law satisfied the section 140 requirement and thereby enabled judges to receive a COLA this past fiscal year. H.R. 5363 accomplishes the same purpose for fiscal year 2005.  H.R. 5363 will ensure that Federal judges receive a COLA when other civil servants, including Members of Congress, receive theirs. The legislation will assist in the administration of justice in our Federal courts and is otherwise noncontroversial. I urge its adoption.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
