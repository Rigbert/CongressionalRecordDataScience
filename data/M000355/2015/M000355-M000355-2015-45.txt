 REID. Yes.  Mr. McCONNELL. I am always frustrated, as I think the Democratic leader is, with the tendency to personalize political differences. Obviously we have differences on issues, but I want to second what my friend the Democratic leader said: There is nothing wrong with our personal relationship, whether it is watching Nats baseball or a lot of other things that we have discussed both personally and otherwise for literally years.  I share the Senator's frustration, I would say to my friend, over an article like that. I think there is a tendency to think you can't have political arguments without developing personal animosity, and I don't have any toward my friend, and I know he doesn't have any toward me.  I really appreciate the opportunity that he has given for both of us to kind of clear the air about the perceptions that could have been drawn by reading such an article.                          ____________________
