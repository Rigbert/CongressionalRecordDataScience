Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 3214) to eliminate the substantial backlog of DNA samples collected from crime scenes and convicted offenders, to improve and expand the DNA testing capacity of Federal, State, and local crime laboratories, to increase research and development of new DNA testing technologies, to develop new training programs regarding the collection and use of DNA evidence, to provide post-conviction testing of DNA evidence to exonerate the innocent, to improve the performance of counsel in State capital cases, and for other purposes, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                               H.R. 3214       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
