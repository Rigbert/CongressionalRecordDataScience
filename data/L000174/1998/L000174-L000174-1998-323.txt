President, the real treasure of our state of Vermont is the people who make up our special state. One whom I have known all my life is Dr. Ernest Tomasi of Montpelier. It seems from the time I was a youngster, we knew the Tomasis, and partly because like Dr. Tomasi, my mother was an Italian American who knew almost every Italian American family in the area.  Dr. Tomasi was a true hero of WWII, but like so many, rarely ever spoke about what he did. In one rare instance, he was interviewed for The Times Argus, and I ask that the article be printed in the Record.  I also want to applaud his dedication to the people of Montpelier. Many, many of those from my hometown received medical help and, when many could not pay for it, they received it as a gift from Dr. Tomasi. He was a hero abroad, but he has also always been a hero at home.  The article follows:                  [From the Times Argus, May 30, 1998]                   Montpelier Vet Recalls His Service                          (By David W. Smith)       Montpelier.-- Dr. Ernest Tomasi likes to tell the story of      the bravest act he witnessed on the European fields of battle      during World War II.       It was shortly after the invasion of the French coastline      at Normandy by American troops in June of 1944, and Tomasi      had been temporarily assigned to a medical unit with the 3rd      Battalion, 116th Regiment of the 29th Infantry Division.       Hunkered down amongst inland hedgerows--enormous earthen      barriers topped     with brush and trees--Tomasi watched a young sergeant named      Black gather together several soldiers who spoke German and      French, and climb up on a hedgerow waving Red Cross flags.       The men were shouting in three languages that they were a      medical team and were trying to bring aid to both American      and German soldiers.       Apparently they were successful, and managed to bring      wounded from both sides back for medical attention.       ``Sgt. Black, after the war, married Shirley Temple,''      Tomasi laughed.       Tomasi has a lot of stories from the years he served as a      surgeon with the 2nd Battalion of the 116th, his regular      unit. From the time they sat foot on the deadly beaches of      Normandy, all the way to Berlin, Tomasi traveled with the      soldiers, offering what medical attention he could.       Tomasi recalled helping a cow give birth, and the time he      delivered a human baby girl along the shores of the Elbe      river while nearby the crippled city of Berlin finally caved      in from the relentless attack of the Russian army.       Six years later, while working in his clinic on Barre      Street in Montpelier, Tomasi received a letter from the      German woman he helped, and a picture of that young girl.       ``Our unit liberated the first town in Germany,'' Tomasi      said with pride, although he couldn't recall the name of the      town. ``We were all sort of optimistic then.''       Tomasi, who was born and raised in Montpelier, attended      medical school at the University of Vermont, graduating in      1942.       After a year of internship in Waterbury, Conn., he flew      through a quick four weeks of field officer's training, and      was soon shipped off to England to prepare for the massive      American D-Day invasion.       While in England, Lt. Tomasi trained for the assault along      a beach called Slapton Sands, where many Americans got their      first taste of war.       ``They warned us that German torpedo boats . . . were      there. We practiced there anyway,'' said Tomasi. ``Two weeks      later, the 4th Battalion practiced there and lost 200 men.''       Not long afterward, Tomasi and his company crossed the      English channel aboard the ocean liner Thomas Jefferson, and      were soon deposited from a landing craft into the cold sea      water to half-walk, half-swim into shore. The 29th was one of      the first divisions of soldiers to attack the coast.       The captain of Tomasi's company was immediately wounded,      and had to be sent back to the ship.       ``I was the only officer there,'' Tomasi recalled. ``We      landed where we shouldn't have landed. There was a burning      building so the Germans couldn't see us, so we all got in      fine.''       Only when he tried to describe what happened on the beach,      did Tomasi run out of words, saying it was impossible to      describe it to anyone who had not seen it for themselves.       ``There were so many people there that were killed,'' he      said, ``It was terrible. We had to stay on the beach and take      care of the people.''       Tomasi remembers unique events from the war, preferring not      to dwell on the horror: He slipped easily into a story of the      time he was out at night riding in a jeep driven by a      corporal, searching for a missing sergeant.       An American tank lurched up behind them, and a gruff voice      boomed out.       ``What the hell are you doing out here, don't you know this      is no-man's land?''       It was the corporal who told Tomasi the man shouting was      General George S. Patton, who told them to return to their      unit and promised to find the sergeant himself.       Tomasi remained near Berlin until the end of the war, then      returned home to Montpelier, where he set up a practice,      raised a family and remained until the present. Tomasi's son,      Tim, currently serves on the Montpelier City Council.       He will probably walk, Tomasi said, with members of the      American Legion in the annual downtown Barre Memorial Day      Parade at 11 a.m., although Memorial Day activities don't      stir up any particular emotions for him.       ``I just think that it's nice that people take a few      minutes to remember,'' he said.                          ____________________
