Chairman, I took to heart what the gentleman said, that we should not bring bills to the floor in an ill-considered manner.  The gentleman is from the State of Indiana. As I recall, I did not receive any letters from the gentleman regarding projects in the gentleman's State or anywhere in the country relative to this bill.  Did the gentleman come before our committee to testify, or send any correspondence regarding any line item in this bill, yes or no?
