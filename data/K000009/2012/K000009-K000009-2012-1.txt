But there's another cliff tonight at midnight that should concern the millions of homeowners who have forgone their mortgage foreclosure reviews. They have a deadline of midnight tonight as reported by USA Today yesterday on the front page of the business section. It's important to millions of Americans who literally could receive up to $100,000 in compensation because of mistakes that were made by servicers in the processing of those loans.  So, I would like to tell people who might have had foreclosures facing their families in 2009 and 2010, they can call 888-952-9105 or go to the Web site IndependentForeclosureReview.com.  The Office of Comptroller of the Currency will help them review those mortgage foreclosures. Far too many Americans, millions, 4 million to be exact, have received these notices, but only a little over 300,000 have replied. Millions of people could have those mortgages reviewed and perhaps receive compensation and hang onto their houses.  Again, that phone number is 888-952-9105. Let's help the millions of Americans who have been harmed with their mortgages by irresponsible servicers.                          ____________________
