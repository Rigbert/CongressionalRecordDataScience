Chairman, I just want to remind my colleagues what this bill does is it gets it out of these temporary storage places that are along the Great Lakes and the Chesapeake Bay and rivers and streams and into one safe place. We have had a perfect record of transporting this stuff. It was not mined in the dunes of Lake Michigan. It had to get there somehow. It got there in a perfect way, without a single incident of exposure or release of radioactive material. We think that that can continue as we get it out of the dunes and off of the shores of these environmentally sensitive areas to one safe place.  I just want to close on this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote no. The result of this amendment is pointless delay. I want to give one example.  The amendment would require the Department of Energy to perform a risk assessment before it provided funds to emergency response teams for public safety training. It is redundant. We do not need a risk assessment for items like that, and this amendment, if it was adopted, would require that every action would require a risk assessment.  It is too much. We do not need it. The bill is designed to be safe in the transportation of this material. It will be so.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. LaHood). The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Nevada [Mr. Ensign].  The question was taken, and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it                             Recorded Vote
