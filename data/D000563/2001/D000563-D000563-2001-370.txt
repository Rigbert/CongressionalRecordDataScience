President, I seek recognition in morning business to follow up on the issue raised by the Senator from Nevada. I can't think of a bigger issue in terms of the people I represent in the State of Illinois.  A lot of families in Illinois who rely on natural gas to heat their homes saw dramatic increases in their heating bills this past winter. Families of very modest means who budgeted very carefully found their heating bills for last winter were $1,000 to $1,500 higher than they had been in the previous year. Very little explanation was forthcoming. A lot of families just had no choice.
