President, I rise to commemorate the 82d anniversary of the Armenian Genocide.  In the 1930's, someone questioned Adolph Hitler about the possible consequences of his plan for the systematic elimination of the Jews. Hitler seemed to believe that there would be none. He allegedly responded, ``Who, after all, today remembers the Armenians?''  One of my constituents, Noyemzar Alexanian, remembers. On a spring morning in 1915, when she was 6 years old, the Kurdish calvary surrounded her village. They rounded up all the men and teen-aged boys, tied their hands with rope, took them to a distant field and stabbed them to death. Her father escaped to a neighboring village but was soon discovered. Noyemzar says she remembers her father being led away while her mother cried for help. This little 6-year-old girl then ``watched the white shirt of her father as he was led up a mountainside by the soldiers. The white shirt became a dot, and then it was gone.'' Noyemzar's father was stabbed to death. Over the next few years, as she was shuttled from the houses of strangers to orphanages, Noyemzar lost her two sisters. But still she did not lose hope. After several years, she and the remaining members of her family escaped to Cuba. She later settled in Rhode Island with her husband, Krikor, another refugee from Armenia. Noyemzar Alenanian is now 88 years old, and every day she remembers.  Mr. President, old and young around the world today remember the Armenian holocaust. We remember that on this date in 1915, the Ottoman Empire and the successor Turkish nationalist regime began a brutal policy of deportation and murder. Over the next 8 years 1.5 million Armenians would be massacred at the hands of the Turks and another 500,000 would have their property confiscated and be driven from their homeland. Engrossed in its own problems at the time, the world did little as the population was devastated.  Despite having already undergone such terrible persecution and hardship, the people of the Armenian Republicstill suffer today. The peace talks recently concluded in Moscow regrettably made no progress toward the resolution of the Karabagh conflict. Turkey continues to blockade humanitarian aid to Armenia.  However, the Armenian people look hopefully to the future. Their quest for peace and democracy continues to inspire people around the world. Armenians who have emigrated to other countries, especially those in my home State of Rhode Island, bring their traditions with them. They enrich the culture and contribute much to the society of their new homelands.  The continuing reports of the recent atrocities committed in Bosnia reaffirm the importance of our commitment to always remember the Armenian genocide. As long as hate and intolerance are a part of our world, we must be vigilant. We must stand as witnesses to protect people from persecution for the simple reason that they are different.  I hope to visit Armenia in the near future. I wish to see the treasures of that land firsthand and pay tribute to the indomitable spirit of the people of Armenia. Until that time, I want to ensure the Armenian community that we remember. Menk panav chenk mornar.                          ____________________
