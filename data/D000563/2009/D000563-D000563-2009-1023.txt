President, I urge my colleagues to take a close look at Senator Mitch McConnell's amendment, which is next up to be considered. Particularly, I ask you to turn to page 3 of this amendment. You will find in the first paragraph on page 3 a troubling requirement which Senator McConnell will make of this administration.  What Senator McConnell is asking is that 60 days from the passage of this bill and every 90 days thereafter, the President of the United States provide to Members of the Senate and the House:       a current summary of the evidence, intelligence, and      information used to justify the detention of each detainee      listed under paragraph (1) at Naval Station Guantanamo Bay.  It is not enough for Senator McConnell to ask for the identity of these people, the countries they are from, the likelihood they will be transferred to some other place, the likelihood they might be engaged in terrorism, he is asking for the President to disclose the work product of the prosecutors who are holding these detainees and determining whether a criminal case can be brought against them. For whatearthly purpose? Why would we possibly want to jeopardize the prosecution of someone who may be guilty of terrorism or a crime threatening the United States? To satisfy our curiosity? I think it is a mistake.  I will tell my colleagues, if it is sent to us even in classified form, it might be leaked. In addition, if a trial should follow, one of the first discovery motions from any defendant is this information: Judge, if the President can share this information with 535 Members of Congress, the defendant should be able to see the information as well. Why would we possibly want to jeopardize a prosecution to satisfy the curiosity of the Senator from Kentucky, or any Senator for that matter?  This paragraph should have been stricken. The rest of it you may find good or bad, but this is a dangerous paragraph.  I reserve the remainder of my time.
