Dr. Harris, thank you for that very insightful--and I would say brilliant--defense of not just the unborn, but the newly born, and your very logical argument as to how this is already being extended in what is euphemistically called after-birth abortion to those, like Dr. Gosnell's victims, who have been born and then are killed.  I would point to my colleagues, before going to Mr. Stutzman, that one of the clinic individuals who was actually killing these children--this came out in testimony at the trial--said that when he heard the child crying, it was like an alien.  Children cry when they're being killed--and in this case, a very painful--as you pointed out, pain-capable children are at least 20 weeks gestational age. Many of these kids were 23, 24, 25, even higher. As we've learned from the grand jury, as well as from these proceedings, some of these children were as old as 30 weeks gestational age--very, very large children, very mature children, but no different than the child who just a few weeks and even months before, same child, just a little more mature and, as you said, worthy of protection always.  I'd like to yield to Mr. Stutzman.
