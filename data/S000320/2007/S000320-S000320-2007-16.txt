 President, I want to speak on the pending bill before the Senate for a few minutes.  This is the second day of consideration of the fiscal year 2008 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill. This bill funds the Departments of Commerce and Justice, NASA, and the National Science Foundation. Given the extremely diverse subject matters contained within this bill's jurisdiction, we must entertain a wide range of amendments on the Senate floor. This has been true in the past and is true again this year.  Chairwoman Mikulski and I are currently reviewing a substantial list of amendments and are working with various Members and staffs to determine appropriate resolutions to the list of amendments. I ask Members to come to the floor to discuss with the chairwoman and myself your concerns so we can move this critical funding bill forward.  We hope and expect to finish this bill no later than mid-day tomorrow, but to accomplish this we will need every Senator's help.  It is Monday afternoon and we can move some things tonight and get this bill moved tomorrow with the help of a lot of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  I yield the floor.
