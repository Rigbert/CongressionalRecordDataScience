Mr. Speaker, today on the 243rd birthday of the U.S. Army, I take the opportunity to congratulate the Monmouth County, New Jersey, Chapter of the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) which has been designated as the AUSA's ``Best Chapter 2017.''  The designation represents the second year in a row that the Monmouth chapter has clinched this national top honor.  The award, given primarily for leadership and distinguished accomplishments in the service of U.S. Soldiers, Army civilians, and their families, was presented at the AUSA's Annual Meeting & Exposition held last Fall at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C.  During the opening ceremony of the 2017 association meeting--attended by more than 5,000 members and guests--AUSA Monmouth Chapter President Col. Samuel Fuoco (USA Ret.), Secretary Mrs. Ellie Smith, and Mr. Frank Brogna, of the Monmouth County Sheriff's Office were all presented the ``Best Chapter 2017'' banner by AUSA President & CEO Gen. Carter F. Ham (USA Ret.), and AUSA Vice President, Lt. Gen. Patricia E. McQuistion (USA Ret.).  Also, Mrs. Catherine C. ``Kit'' Roache, the Monmouth Chapter's Vice President of Programs and Community Partners, received the AUSA ``2017 Major General Anthony J. Drexel Biddle Medal,'' awarded to the individual who has most contributed to the advancement and mission of association for the year.  Additionally, Chapter President Fuoco was presented with the AUSA ``Greatest Reserve Component Increase--2017'' streamer, for the greatest increase in membership.  Mr. Speaker, these awards are not lightly given or earned. The AUSA Monmouth Chapter was bestowed with these honors due to its extremely active and tireless work in supporting the U.S. Army and AUSA. The chapter has constantly supported our service members--Active and Reserve, past and present--through educational activities and raising money for many causes like support for New Jersey veterans and retirees, scholarships for JROTC high school students, the Fisher House Foundation, and their Service Dog initiative.  Chapter members and community partners regularly welcome new Army commanders at the nearby Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. The chapter has supported Honor and Remember Flags for Gold Star Families who have lost a loved one in combat, and the New Jersey Run for the Fallen. It helps foster Veteran Service Organizations (VSO) training, and works to build civilian support in Monmouth County by participating in many educational, business and charity events.  Mr. Speaker, the Monmouth County AUSA chapter takes to heart and gives all they have to live up to their inspiring motto: ``A Voice for the Army--Support for the Soldier.'' Given its current leadership and unyielding drive to serve in a manner consistent with its roots in the United States Army, there is little doubt that the chapter's ongoing work will lead to consideration for another banner in 2018 and in the years ahead.  I thank all the members of the AUSA Monmouth Chapter for their continued hard work, dedication, commitment and outstanding contributions in the service of America's men and women in uniform.                          ____________________
