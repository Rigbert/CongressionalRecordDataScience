 Speaker, this country has a $4.6 trillion national debt, and the leadership in Congress is proposing major cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' programs, student loans, Head Start, nutrition programs, and millions of dollars in cuts in programs that Americans all over this country desperately need.  Within that context, how in God's name could the Congress last night vote to expand the B-2 bomber program and spend another $1.5 billion per airplane for another 20 planes? This despite the fact that the Pentagon has said they do not need the planes, they do not want the planes.  Would it not be a good thing if the elderly and the young and the sick had friends in this Congress to the degree that the B-2 bomber does?                          ____________________
