President, I rise in support of an amendment that is to be offered by Senators Specter and Harkin relative to the tobacco settlement funds and the question of Federal recoupment.  First, let me say that I have been involved in the tobacco issue on Capitol Hill for almost as long as I have been here. As a Member of the House of Representatives, I introduced legislationto ban smoking on airplanes, and I have addressed this issue from so many different angles that I believe I have some knowledge on the subject.  Having said that, I have to tell you that I stand here in admiration of the 42 State attorneys general who had the political courage and foresight to file these lawsuits against the tobacco giants in an effort to recoup some of the money that had been spent on tobacco-related disease and death in their States. In my own home State, our attorney general, Jim Ryan, was one of those. I have saluted him privately and I do it publicly. I am happy they did this. The money they have recouped is going to be an important resource for the State of Illinois and all of the other States.  In addition, they have forced the tobacco companies to make some major changes in the way they sell the product. Perhaps, we will see--I hope in the not-too-distant future--a decline in the number of young people who have become addicted to tobacco products. It is truly a frightening statistic to consider the impact on America's public health when you consider the percentage of high school students, and even younger, who are taking up smoking. But now that we have recovered money from the tobacco companies, the debate now is how it should be spent. I have tried to come up with a reasonable approach to it. I salute my colleagues, Senators Specter and Harkin, for what I consider to be a reasonable approach as well.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be shown as a cosponsor of the Specter-Harkin amendment.
