 I see the Senator from Wisconsin, so I am only going to take 2 or 3 minutes at this point.  A number of Senators have asked some of the areas where this changes. We had a separate, bipartisan, bicameral negotiation, and we shaped and changed the legislation as originally proposed by the Attorney General and the administration. I will speak at greater length as we go on.  We improved security on the northern border, the 4,000-mile wonderful border between our country and Canada, another democratic nation. The State of the Presiding Officer borders Canada, as does mine. It is just a short drive from the Canadian border. Many members of my wife's family came from Canada. We have always had historic and economic ties with Canada. Partly because we have taken so much for granted, we have also shortchanged this relationship. We should look at the border for our sake and for the sake of Canada. We have greatly improved security on the northern border by adding better technology, more Customs and INS agents. That helps.  We added something the administration did not include--money laundering. I learned as a prosecutor--and most Members know this--if you want to learn something, follow the money. If you want to stop terrorism, one way is to cut off the money supply.  Third, we have added programs to enhance information sharing in coordination with State and local law enforcement, grants for local governments to respond to bioterrorism, to increase payments to families of fallen firefighters, police officers, and other public safety officers. That is important.  Cooperation is necessary. The mayor of New York City, Mayor Giuliani, called me saying the police commissioner has justifiable concerns about the previous lack of cooperation from the Federal Government in their own antiterrorism efforts, although New York City has one of the best antiterrorist units in the country. The mayor of Baltimore has called, as have other mayors.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Washington Post op-ed piece by Robert D. Novak in today's paper entitled ``Same Old FBI.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              Same Old FBI       Behind the facade of cooperation following the Sept. 11      attacks, less than amicable relations between New York Mayor      Rudolph Giuliani and the FBI have further deteriorated.      According to New York City sources, the mayor has engaged in      more than one shouting match with FBI Assistant Director      Barry Mawn.       It's the same old problem because it's the same old FBI.      Newly appointed, much acclaimed Director Robert Mueller makes      little difference. The bureau refuses to share information      with local police agencies. It won't permit security      clearances for high local officials. Law enforcement officers      around the country say that attitude lent itself to      catastrophe on Sept. 11 and could permit further disasters.       Last Friday in Washington, Mueller--amiable and agreeable--     sat down with big city police chiefs and promised things will      get better. The chiefs doubt whether Mueller or Tom Ridge,      the new homeland security director, can change the bureau's      culture, described to me by one police chief as ``elitist and      arrogant.'' Efforts to enlist members of Congress into      pressing for reform find politicians awed by the FBI      mystique.       The FBI's big national security section in New York City      long has grappled with the New York Police Department. ``the      FBI's attitude has been that if you need to know, we'll tell      you,'' one New York police source told me. That ``need''      never occurs, with the FBI adamant against any local anti-     terrorism activity. The locals, in turn, complain about the      feds failing to follow important leads.       Giuliani is not venting his outrage in this time of crisis,      but sources report a high private decibel level by the mayor.      The complaint to Mawn is that the NYPD is out of the loop,      its senior officers not even granted security clearances.       Such complaints are common across the country, but only a      few police chiefs speak publicly--notably Edward Norris of      Baltimore (who complained in congressional testimony),      Michael Chitwood of Portland, Maine, and Dan Oates of Ann      Arbor, Mich.       Chitwood's experience is most bizarre. He was infuriated to      learn that the FBI knew of a visit to Portland by two Sept.      11 hijackers but did not inform him. When his police pursued      a witness of that visit, the FBI threatened to arrest the      chief. ``I ignored them,'' Chitwood told me. Has cooperation      with the bureau improved? ``Not a bit,'' he said. Only      Tuesday he learned from reading his local newspaper about a      plane under federal surveillance parked at the Portland      airport for seven weeks.       Oates is familiar with the FBI, having tried to work with      the feds during 21 years with the NYPD before retiring this      year to go to Ann Arbor. As a deputy chief who was commanding      officer of NYPD intelligence, he describes the FBI as      ``obsessed with turf.''       Closing doors to police officers particularly infuriates      Oates. ``The security clearance issue is a tired old excuse      that allows the FBI not to share,'' he told me. ``They should      hand out 10,000 security clearances to cops around the      country.'' Oates and other police chiefs believe Sept. 11      might have been averted had the FBI alerted local police      agencies about a Minnesota flight school's report of an Arab      who wanted instructions for steering a big jet but not for      landing or taking off.       Police chiefs would open the FBI to the same probing of      decisions and actions that they routinely perform after the      fact. They     also would like the same rules for the bureau that govern      most of the nation's police departments. In the FBI, nobody      takes the fall for blundering.       A promise that things will change in the FBI was implicit      in Director Mueller's remarks to city police chiefs last      Friday. Philadelphia Police Commissioner John Timoney,      another NYPD veteran who is more cautious in his criticism of      the feds than his former colleague Oates, sounded skeptical      after the meeting. ``I'm hopeful,'' he told me, but he would      make no predictions.       What he hopes for is the safety of the American people. The      police chiefs of America want a top-to-bottom cleaning of the      FBI that will require leadership from the Oval Office. If      George W. Bush doubts the urgency, he should talk to Rudy      Giulianai.
