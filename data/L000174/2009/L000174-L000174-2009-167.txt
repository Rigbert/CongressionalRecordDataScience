President, if information is power, then an informed public is certainly an ingredient that helps make government work better and more responsively for the people.  I have always had a keen interest in technology and the Internet, so it has been encouraging to see the commitment and skill that the Obama administration has invested in applying information technology to the functions of government. One of the clearest examples of this has been in the innovative release of data about funds appropriated under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act--the so-called economic stimulus package. It is all the more encouraging to see the way these efforts have spawned complementary initiatives by private foundations and entrepreneurs.  As a Vermonter I am especially proud that a project called ThisWeKnow.org became a top-three finalist in the Apps for America 2: The Data.gov Challenge, sponsored by The Sunlight Foundation, which asked contestants to produce Web applications to showcase the benefits of sharing Federal Government data with the public. ThisWeKnow.org, along with the other two finalists, showcased their Web sites this week in the Nation's Capital, at the Gov 2.0 Expo Showcase.  ThisWeKnow.org was selected as one of the three finalists out of 47 applications submitted. ThisWeKnow.org was built by GreenRiver.org and Intellidimension of Brattleboro, VT, to empower citizens to enter in their locations and to explore data related to their communities from across Federal agencies. Their site offers citizens one-stop shopping for information available to them about their own towns, States and communities.  The public's right to know is a cornerstone of our democracy. By using technology, a site such as this can provide citizens with access to data that is relevant to them and that can enable and encourage them to make informed decisions. This site is designed to make what was once a difficult and time-consuming process into a faster and more streamlined experience.  ThisWeKnow.org was designed and developed by Michael Knapp, managing director of GreenRiver.org, and Derrish Repchick, vice president of Product Development at Intellidimension, who are in Washington to attend the Gov 2.0 events this week. Although they did not win the grand prize, we congratulate them for all of their hard work and their public spirit, and encourage them to continue their efforts to promote a more accessible and open government.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a September 8 article from The Brattleboro Reformer be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:             [From the Brattleboro Reformer, Sept. 8, 2009]                        Your Government, Online!                        (By Howard Weiss-Tisman)       Brattleboro.--Michael Knapp thinks the government can do a      better job of getting data into the hands of average      Americans.       Knapp, who is Managing Director of GreenRiver.org, a      Brattleboro software development company, believes that      social change will come after more citizens learn more about      their government and he's got a plan to make that happen.       GreenRiver.org, along with Intellidimension, another      Brattleboro high tech company, is one of three finalists in a      national competition to help the U.S. government revamp how      it gets information into the hands of the public.       The two Southern Vermont companies joined together to      design a Web site that would make it easier for citizens to      access the thousands of pages of data that the various      government agencies produce every year.       And the two small Main Street firms, which went up against      46 other mostly larger and more heavily financed companies      from all over the United States, now have a chance to meet      with some powerful Washington insiders to change how      government information is delivered to the public.       ``Too much data produces nothing but noise. But if we can      get information into people's hands that is presented well      and clearly and accurately people will make more informed      decisions,'' Knapp said from his office overlooking the      Connecticut River. ``We're trying to help people make      connections, so they can start to take control of their      communities.''       Knapp and his cohorts entered the Apps for America contest,      which is sponsored by The Sunlight Foundation, a non-partisan      Washington group dedicated to increasing government      transparency.       The Brattleboro companies developed their Web site,      ThisWeKnow.org, that allows the user to enter a location in      the search engine.       Reports from across the government that have recorded      information on that location are gathered and the user can      compare, for instance, a town's cancer rate with the toxic      chemicals released by nearby factories and political      contributions to area lawmakers.       Knapp said all of the various government agencies issue the      reports and put out press releases occasionally on the data,      but the Web site ``takes the middleman out of the information      presentation. Instead of the agencies controlling the      story,'' Knapp said, ``you get to tell the story.''       Intellidimension Vice President of Product Development,      Derrish Repchick, said the two companies put in weeks worth      of work developing the site. They are flying to Washington      next week to present their site, and Vivek Kundra, the Obama      Administration's Federal Chief Information Officer, is      expected to check out the work of the three finalists.       ``It was a huge amount of data we had to work with. It was      a challenge,'' said Repchick, who was responsible for the      back end of the Web site where all of the data is accessed.      ``It was also fun and it gets some pretty important eyeballs      on you.''       Knapp is a big fan of what the Obama Administration has      done to make government more transparent but he said there      are still countless amounts of information out there that      should be more readily available.       The winner of the contest will not necessarily win a      government contract but Knapp said the contest and his site      is one more way to get every citizen in the country to      realize that it is their government and the fastest way to      implement change is by getting them the information they need      to demand it.       ``We didn't do this for the money,'' Knapp said about the      $10,000 prize that will go to the winner. ``We want to break      down all the separate silos of information and have people      make connections. We did this because we believe technology      can make a better future for everybody.''
