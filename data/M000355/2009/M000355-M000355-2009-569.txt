 President, I say to my good friend from New York, through the Chair, I believe the new President could not have made a better selection for Secretary of State. Senator Clinton has had a unique career in the Senate, actually having only been here 8 years, but nevertheless a candidate for President of the United States who came very close. She had fabulous public service before that as First Lady for 8 years. She has clearly made a difference throughout her life, and I expect she will do the same again.  I told her on the floor privately, I am particularly enthusiastic about her selection as Secretary of State because I think she will be the first Secretary of State in the history of the United States who has actually been to Hazard and Pikeville, KY. That should give her an extra edge in this new responsibility which she is about to assume.  I say to the Senator from New York, we will be anxious to work with her on some of the issues for which we shared a passion during her years as Secretary of State. I know she will do an outstanding job. She has been a credit to the Senate and will be one of the Nation's outstanding Secretaries of State.
