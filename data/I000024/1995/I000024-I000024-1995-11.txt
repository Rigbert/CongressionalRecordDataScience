President, for a point of clarification, the Senator from Connecticut was accurate when he talked about the three resolutions, or votes that we will be having today. But he did not mention the order that they will be in. At 12:30 today we will be voting on H.R. 2606, which is the Hefley bill that was passed in the House of Representatives.  I want to suggest that I have quite a lengthy statement that I wanted to make. But I will withhold that statement, and only make a comment on 2606 which will be coming up in 40 minutes from now.  I will read this very briefly. It merely says ``prohibits the use of Department of Defense funds for deployment on the grounds of United States Armed Forces in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a part of the peacekeeping operation.''  So that is clearly what the Constitution gave the power to Congress to do.  When the Senator from Connecticut characterized the resolution, I think it must be a little inaccurate to say how enthusiastic they are. I, finally, 2 minutes ago, received a copy of this. I did not have it before. It states ``notwithstanding reservations expressed about President Clinton's decision to deploy United States Armed Forces to Bosnia and Herzegovina.''  That is kind of the preamble. So it is does not sound like to me what I would interpret as enthusiastic.  Last, Senator Feingold so accurately described what our constitutional rights were in this body, and what the President's were. He quoted Louis Fisher, who I think we all consider to be a foremost authority on the Constitution, wherein he said:       The framers knew that the British King could use military      force against other countries without legislative      involvement. They gave to Congress the responsibility for      deciding matters of war and peace. The President, as      Commander in Chief, was left with the power to ``repeal      sudden attack.''  In fact, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record, this article by Louis Fisher.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Dec. 2, 1995]                       What Power to Send Troops?                           (By Louis Fisher)       Washington.--There seems to be an impression that President      Clinton has constitutional authority to send troops to the      Balkans without first obtaining approval or authority from      Congress. But the case for Presidential power is not so open      and shut.       The Framers knew that the British king could use military      force against other countries without legislative      involvement. They gave to Congress the responsibility for      deciding matters of war and peace. The President, as      Commander in Chief, was left with the power to ``repel sudden      attacks.'' He has no general power to initiate military      action. This principle was an axiom of republican government.       In 1787, James Wilson said the checks-and-balances system      ``will not hurry us into war'' and that ``it is calculated to      guard against it.'' He said: ``It will not be in the power of      a single man, or a single body of men, to involve us in such      distress.''       The Framers deliberately separated the powers of the purse      and sword. To Madison, in 1793, those who were to ``conduct a      war'' could not be safe judges on whether to start one.       NATO does not authorize offensive actions or general      peacekeeping activities. The North Atlantic Treaty of 1949      was a defensive pact, intended to contain the Soviet Union.      The treaty's parties were ``resolved to unite their efforts      for collective defense'' and ``resist armed attack.'' None of      these conditions exists in Bosnia.       To argue that NATO authorizes Mr. Clinton to act as he      likes is to argue that the President and the Senate, through      the treaty process, can eliminate the House's war power.      Treaties do not amend the Constitution. One argument is that      Mr. Clinton sponsored the talks, put our prestige at risk and      thereby committed us to using force. Are constitutional and      legislative processes skirted so easily?       In 1969, after the Vietnam buildup, the Senate passed a      resolution challenging the President's right to commit the      nation without first obtaining Congressional approval. Passed      with strong bipartisan backing, it states that whenever our      forces are used on foreign territory, or there is a promise      to assist a country by using our military, such commitments      result ``only from affirmative action taken by the executive      and legislative branches.'' This resolution has no legal      effect, but it articulates a constitutional principle      violated by President Lyndon B. Johnson and now threatened by      President Clinton.       It might be argued that the ``war power'' is not involved      because Mr. Clinton will use American forces for peace, not      war. ``America's role will not be about fighting a war,'' he      said. He said he refused ``to send American troops to fight a      war in Bosnia,'' and ``I believe we must help to secure the      Bosnian peace.''       Mr. Clinton has already authorized air strikes against the      Serbs. He now intends to send ground troops. By making an      ``overwhelming show of force,'' he says, ``American troops      will lessen the need to use      force.'' Note the word ``lessen.'' Anyone who takes on our troops, he      said, ``will suffer the consequences.''       Whenever the President acts unilaterally in using military      force against another nation, the constitutional rights of      Congress and the people are undermined.
