Speaker, I rise to publicly apologize to Leader McCarthy for a remark I made to myself that was picked up by the House microphone yesterday.  It was said out of frustration and anger, it was wrong, and I have apologized privately to Mr. McCarthy, who I believe is a man of integrity in this House.                          ____________________
