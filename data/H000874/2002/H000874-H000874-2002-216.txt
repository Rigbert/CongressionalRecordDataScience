Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of the concurrent resolution.  I was pleased to serve with Jerry Solomon during 18 years of my service here in the House that we overlapped. He was a passionate advocate of the positions he held. He was a Marine, in the best tradition of the United States Marines, of which he was a member until the day he died. He was a fighter for the issues that he believed in, but he was also a friend.  He had a good word for almost all on this floor and even in passion and anger he could turn to you with a smile and with a wink and say, we differed on this issue but we serve the American public, and we shall do so together.  It was enjoyable to serve with Jerry Solomon. It was appropriate that the bill, of which the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Linder) spoke, was passed, because Jerry was such a fighter, not only for that facility but for veterans generally. And he was a strong supporter of Ronald Reagan, whom we just set aside a time to honor.  So I am pleased to rise on behalf of this measure and urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
