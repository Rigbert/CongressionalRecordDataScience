Not now.  Then, getting into the nuclear, it is one of the things I think no one is going to argue with. You are not going to resolve the energy crisis unless it has a strong nuclear component. I think you are going to have some amendments coming up on this bill that certainly are supported by Senator Warner, who is a cosponsor of the bill, that say we need to dramatically increase our nuclear capacity in America. I have been saying that for a long time.  If you look at European countries where there are not problems right now, in the European countries, actually 80 percent of their energy comes out of nuclear energy. In our country it is about 20 percent. I would say any kind of correction of this problem is not going to take place unless we have the nuclear plants.  The study that was referred to, the one that said only 2 cents a year, that is assuming we have an increase of 260 nuclear plants--it is wildly optimistic, impossible, can't be done. Nonetheless, that is what is being discussed. Nuclear energy is a very important part of our mix. It is going to have to be in the future.  I would say this: If I were on the other side of this bill, and I were trying to get this bill passed, I would welcome the opportunity to have that discussion on the nuclear amendment that will be offered by more than one person, but certainly offered by even the author of the bill, Senator Warner.  I see the Senator from Iowa has arrived, and I think he is scheduled to speak for up to 30 minutes.
