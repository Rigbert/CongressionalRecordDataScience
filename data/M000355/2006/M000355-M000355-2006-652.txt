 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:45 a.m., Tuesday, June 13. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate proceed to a period for the transaction of morning business for up to an hour, with the first 30 minutes under the control of the majority leader or his designee and the final 30 minutes under the control of the Democratic leader or his designee; further, that following morning business, the Senate then resume consideration of S. 2766, the Defense authorization bill, as under the order. I further ask that the Senate stand in recess following the vote on the previously ordered amendment until 2:30 p.m. to accommodate the weekly policy luncheons and the official photograph for the 109th Congress.
