 President, I will set the record straight. This is not just Southern California Edison or PG There is virtually no creditor ordebtor that is in support of the Wyden amendment. Not even the Bonneville Power Administration has written a letter in support of this amendment. There is a reason why they are not in support of this amendment. Once you create a preferred class of creditors, you prompt the breaking of the dam and other creditors will force an involuntary bankruptcy.  If that happens, it is the wrong chapter. It is chapter 7. It is disillusion. It means the utilities get out of the business of distributing power.  This is why this amendment is so dangerous. If the Senator can show me some of these authorities that think this kind of change of bankruptcy law in the middle of what is an extraordinarily precarious situation is a good thing, I may relent.  I have introduced about a dozen letters, not just from Southern California Edison but from creditors, big and small. One of the rumors on the street is that many of the renewable power generators--the wind and solar generating firms for example--are most concerned and would therefore press bankruptcy should this amendment pass.  To get involved in the State's healing process is extraordinarily dangerous. That is my argument. I am not sure simply extending the time obviates the argument I am making. I have virtually every one of these letters that say in so many words, don't force them to exercise their rights to push these companies into bankruptcy. That is what this amendment does.  I find it very hard when my distinguished colleague says it is just one utility advocating against his amendment. It is not. It is the big generators, the small generators, it is virtually everybody involved in this situation who says, let us try to work it out with the State. Let the State buy these transmission lines. That will inject billions to pay creditors.  If you vitiate or abrogate it by creating a preferred class of creditor, you will encourage other creditors to push for bankruptcy. There are literary hundreds of creditors, huge banks, small banks.  I understand the Senator is trying to do something for his State. I understand that. It is incomprehensible to me to think the Bonneville Power Administration isn't going to get paid back. I believe they will. I believe if you amend bankruptcy law to provide for it, you simply cause a reaction from the other creditors that I think can be devastating.  That is the sum and substance of my argument. I have tried to indicate that with a large number of letters. I regret if anyone thinks this is just one utility advocating against this amendment. It is not. It is virtually the entire creditor community.
