President, as the chairman of the subcommittee and the manager of the bill knows very well, in September 1999 the Department of Justice sued the tobacco industry to recover federal costs associated with diseases caused by smoking. The suit alleges that the tobacco companies engaged in a campaign since 1953 to defraud and deceive the American public regarding the dangers of smoking disease and death, despite the fact that the companies were aware of these health effects.  This case continues to be pending before the courts. Last year, a U.S. District Court judge dismissed some counts of the lawsuit but upheld the government's right to sue the tobacco industry under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. That portion of the case is still pending. Discovery is underway, and the judge has set a trial date for the year 2003.  There were a number of press reports that indicated some uncertainty of the Department of Justice about this lawsuit. The Attorney General has indicated that he was going to personally review the lawsuit and determine whether or not to vigorously pursue it.  Just last week, the Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division at the Department of Justice testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the suit is proceeding as planned. I presided over that testimony.  I inquire of the chairman of the subcommittee, the manager of this important appropriations bill, whether it is his intent and understanding that amounts provided for the Department of Justice in this appropriations bill are available for conducting this lawsuit against the tobacco companies.
