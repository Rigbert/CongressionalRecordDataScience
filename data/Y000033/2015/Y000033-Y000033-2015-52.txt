Mr. Speaker, this bill is a good piece of legislation. I want to thank Mr. Mullin for bringing it up.  While we are on the subject, I would like to talk about the necessity of ICWA, the Child Welfare Act of this Congress past which I was a sponsor of.  The gentleman is here. So we won't talk about ICWA today. We will just let Mr. McClintock get in here and make his statement. Eventually, Mr. Speaker, I will talk about the foster care homes, the need for volunteers, so we don't have 300 children in my State staying with State supervision instead of adopted. So we will talk about that later.
