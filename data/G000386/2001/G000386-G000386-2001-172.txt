 President, as chairman of the Senate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I rise today to compliment the men and women of the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA. As chairman, I have watched these American heroes work day and night on the front lines of the struggle against international drug trafficking.  DEA's mission is to identify, target, and dismantle the most powerful drug syndicates operating around the world that smuggle their poison into American communities. These syndicates are far more powerful and violent than any organized criminal groups that American law enforcement has yet encountered. Unlike traditional organized crime, these 21st century crooks operate globally with transnational networks to conduct illicit enterprises simultaneously in many different countries.  The drug traffickers whom DEA faces pose nothing less than a foreign threat to the national security of the United States. International trafficking groups today have at their disposal the most sophisticated communications technology and their arsenal includes radar-equipped aircraft, advanced weaponry, and an army of workers who oversee the drug business from the source zones to the urban areas and rural locations within the United States. These drug traffickers reach even into my home State of Iowa, in America's heartland. Local, rural police and sheriffs departments must now deal with international organized crime.  All of this modern technology and these vast resources enable the leaders of international criminal groups to build organizations that, together with their surrogates operating within the United States, reach into all parts of America. The leaders of these crime groups use their organizations to carry out the work of transporting drugs into the United States, and franchise others to distribute drugs, thereby allowing them to remain beyond the reach of American justice. Those involved in international drug trafficking often generate such tremendous profits that they are able to corrupt law enforcement, military and political officials overseas in order to create and retain a safe haven for themselves. DEA's focus on international trafficking organizations makes that agency a critical and effective weapon in countering this threat to our way of life, here and abroad.  The threat posed by Colombian drug traffickers is particularly dire. The international drug syndicates headquartered in Colombia, and operating through Mexico and the Caribbean, control both the sources and the flow of many dangerous drugs into the United States. The vast majority of the cocaine entering the United States continues to come from the source countries of Colombia, Bolivia, and Peru. For the past two decades--up to recent years--criminal syndicates from Colombia ruled the drug trade with an iron fist, increasing their profit margin by controlling the entire continuum of the cocaine market. Their control ranged from the wholesale cocaine base production in Peru, Bolivia, and Colombia, to the cocaine hydrochloride, HCL, production and processing centers in Colombia, to the wholesale distribution of cocaine on the streets of the United States.  In response to this threat, the DEA carries out cutting-edge, sophisticated investigations like Millennium and White Horse which have led to the dismantling of major portions of the most significant drug trafficking organizations operating not just out of Colombia, but throughout the world. DEA's accomplishments could take hours to review in detail, but let me mention just a few here today.  In 1999, Operation Millennium successfully targeted major traffickers who had previously operated without fear of capture or prosecution in the United States, believing that only their low-level operatives were at risk. This enforcement operation effectively demonstrated that even the highest level traffickers based in foreign countries could not manage drug operations inside the United States with impunity. Operation Millennium was made possible by direct support from the governments of Colombia and Mexico, and underscore the importance of cooperation among international drug law enforcement agencies.  In November 2000, DEA, FBI, and U.S. Customs culminated an 18 month investigation targeting a multi-ethnic, transnational MDMA, Ecstasy, and cocaine distribution organization, following up on enforcement action by Dutch police in the Netherlands. The investigation, known as Operation Red Tide, was a textbook example of the new multi-agency, multi-national law enforcement cooperation needed to thwart organized crime in the 21st Century. As a result of this cooperative effort, 1,096 pounds, 2.1 million tablets, of MDMA, the largest single seizure of the drug in history, were seized by U.S. Customs agents. The head of the organization, Tamer Adel Ibrahim, fled the U.S. after the seizure, but was quickly traced to Mexico and then to Europe by the multi-agency team. Ibrahim, along with others, were arrested and 1.2 million tablets of MDMA were seized by the Dutch National Police.  Cases similar to Operation Red Tide exemplify the unprecedented level of international law enforcement cooperation in effect today. The investigation targeting the transnational MDMA and cocaine trafficking syndicate was a cooperative effort by the U.S. law enforcement agencies, as well as the Dutch National Police/Regional Team South, Mexico's Fiscalia Especializad Para La Atencion De Delitos, FEADS, the Israeli National Police, the German Federal Police, Bundes Kriminal Amt, the Cologne, Germany Police Department, the Duissburg Germany Police Department, the Italian National Police and the French National Police.  This investigation is extremely important because MDMA, Ecstasy, is a new threat with a potential to cause great damage, especially to America's youth. Operation Red Tide has ensured that a large volume of ecstasy that would have made it into the hands of our youth never hit the streets. It has sent a strong message to the traffickers that the United States and DEA is leading a global response to the drug threat.  Last December, the DEA, again together with U.S. Customs and the FBI, completed Operation Impunity II, resulting in 82 arrests and the seizure of 5,266 kilograms of cocaine, 9,708 pounds of marijuana, and approximately $10,890,295 in U.S. currency. Impunity II follows earlier successes dating back to 1996 in Operation Limelight and Operation Impunity I--and was the result of the outstanding coordination between Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials and prosecutors across the country.  Operation Impunity II was a multi-agency law enforcement program that targeted a wide ranging conspiracy to smuggle thousands of pounds of cocaine and marijuana from Mexico, across the southwest border into Texas, for distribution throughout the United States. The organization placed managers in the United States and retained the organizational command and control elements in Mexico. In addition to remnants from the Carrillo-Fuentes organization, U.S. agents learned that some members of the Mexican Gulf Cartel had also become associated with the organization, including Osiel Cardenas-Guillen, allegedly a former Gulf Cartel lieutenant.  You may remember that Cardenas-Guillen is also charged with assault on an FBI agent and a DEA agent in Matamoros, Mexico, on November 9, 1999. Clearly this operation sends a clear signal that if traffickers threaten or harm a federal agent, they will not get away with impunity.  In January of this year, Operation White Horse targeted a large scale heroin trafficking organization, directed by Wilson Salazar-Maldonado, which was responsible for sending multi-kilogram quantities of heroin from Colombia to the Northeastern United States via Aruba. The investigation was conducted jointly by the Colombian National Police, DEA Bogota, Curacao, Philadelphia and New York, and the Special Operations Division. This investigation resulted in 96 arrests, as well as the seizure of multi-kilograms quantities of heroin and cocaine, weapons and U.S. currency.  DEA remains committed to its primary goal of targeting and arresting the most significant drug traffickers in the world today. Their successes include not only the operations I just mentioned, but also the historic destruction of the Cali and Medellin Cartels. DEA meets the ultimate test of bringing to justice the drug lords who control their vast empires of crime, which bring misery to so many nations. As we sustain a relentless assault against drug traffickers, we must insist that these drug lords be arrested, tried and convicted, and sentenced in their own countries to prison terms commensurate with their crimes, or, as appropriate, extradited to the United States to face justice in U.S. courts. I hope other Senators will join with me in acknowledging the fine work by DEA, and in supporting their efforts in the future.                          ____________________
