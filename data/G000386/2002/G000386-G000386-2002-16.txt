 I would note that following the hearing and our letter to the Committee on Governmental Affairs, we worked closely with that Committee and with the Administration to develop text that would keep intact the commercial functions of the Customs Service. That text has evolved. I note that the bill now before the Senate provides, as a general matter, for the transfer of Customs Service functions and personnel to the new Department of Homeland Security. Notwithstanding that, authorities vested in the Secretary of the Treasury relating to customs revenue functions are to remain with the Secretary of the Treasury unless delegated to the Secretary of Homeland Security. My understanding is that this exclusion from transfer pertains to authorities now exercised by the Secretary of the Treasury to issue revenue regulations developed by the Customs Service, and authority to provide oversight and supervision of the Customs Service in this area, especially with regard to policy matters.
