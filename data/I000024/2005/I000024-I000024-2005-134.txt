Ideally that is what I would prefer in a second-degree amendment. But in trying to accommodate a system that has worked pretty well, that criteria is acceptable to me. Let's don't talk about liberal and conservative. Let's talk about just programming. Forget about what is liberal and what is conservative. If a concept is popular enough that it has 1 million listeners, then that should qualify for consideration for our troops to listen to. That is my point.
