 That is why I bring it here. I legitimately bring it here because I am not trying to cut out x number of dollars to take it away from the Defense Department, I am only asking my colleagues to choose the necessity of 12 additional generals in the Marine Corps versus the needs of modernization and a lot of other needs of the military and have the money spent on those needs that Secretary Perry has put forth.  So I hope that you will agree with me that even though this does involve the priority of money within the Defense Department, and that makes it an appropriations issue, as I see it, I say to my distinguished colleague from South Carolina, I do not want to withdraw it at this point.
