It's not missed on me. I am pleased to join the gentleman from Georgia, my friend Mr. Dreier, and so many others who I know will speak.  I've had the privilege of serving in this institution since 1981, so I will soon be in my 32nd year of serving in this institution. For all of those years, I have served with Jay Pierson. For all of those years, he has been a presence on this floor. For all of those years, he has been like so many members of our staff--a number of whom we see here on the floor with us today--a critical component of the success of this institution. David Dreier said that sometimes we do not have peace and harmony and good order on the floor of this House. He's absolutely correct on that. All of us know it.                              {time}  1930  For that, we as Members are responsible, not our staffs.  Jay Pierson has worked on the minority side and on the majority side, the Republican side of the aisle. But like so many of our staff, they work not for a party but for an institution created by our Founders to be the people's House, the House that is most responsive to the people because we are elected every 2 years. We're closest to the people in that respect. We need to seek their affirmation on a biennial basis, and they send to this House their neighbors, people whom they ask to come and reflect their views.  Jay Pierson has been, for the 30-plus years I've served with him in this House, my friend. He's been somebody whom I respect, someone who treated us all with respect and was willing to help all of us irrespective of what side of the aisle on which we serve. Since 1978, Jay Pierson has been an intimate and an important part of the House of Representatives.  Jay, I want to thank you. I want to thank you for your friendship. I want to thank you for your always-present civility, helpfulness, good humor, and advice and counsel. Few in this House know as much about this House as you do; and, therefore, on your retirement, we will miss you. But we wish you Godspeed, good health, and much success in the days to come.  Thank you, good friend.
