President, Henry Bellman was one of the finest men I have ever served with. I valued his friendship too. We traveled to Vermont and we traveled out to his home and elsewhere.  Today as we head into the August recess, the Senate considers another nomination for a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench, Timothy D. DeGiusti for the Western District of Oklahoma, a well-qualified nominee with the support of both home State Senators.  When we confirm the nomination we consider today, the Senate will have confirmed 26 nominations for lifetime appointments this year, 4 more than were confirmed in all of 2005 with a Republican chairman and Republican majority and 9 more than were confirmed during the entire 1996 session.
