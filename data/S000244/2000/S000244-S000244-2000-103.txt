Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the Federal Reports and Elimination and Sunset Act of 1995 calls for the sunset of all periodic reports submitted to Congress by the executive branch. Congress has extended the sunset date of these reports until May of this year.  The committee on science highlighted nearly 100 reports relevant to its jurisdiction from the thousands scheduled for sunset. Out of that group, 30 were considered to be important to the committee's oversight responsibilities and have been incorporated into H.R. 3904. These reports serve a useful purpose within the agency themselves as a part of their internal review and evaluation process. The agency reports exempted under H.R. 3904 originate from NASA, the National Science Foundation, NOAA and others.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3904 is a bipartisan effort of the Committee on Science to maintain a fundamental oversight tool. I urge its adoption.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
