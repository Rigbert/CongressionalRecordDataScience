President, I wholeheartedly agree with the Senator from Wyoming. I have to say also that the people of Oklahoma, a lot of times--say you are reading these polls, and people are saying, well, we really do not want to balance the budget yet; let us wait until the President gets back; we do not want to be too harsh. There is a myth that is floating around that we are going to be cutting Medicare when in fact we are saving Medicare, and without our doing that, according to his own board of trustees, Medicare would go under.  I believe that when I go back, as I do every weekend, to Oklahoma and I talk to what I refer to--and it has offended several people in this Chamber--as real people, they tell me that they do not want us to back down. They say that this is our opportunity to have a balanced budget.  I can stand on the floor of this Senate and say in my honest opinion this is the last opportunity probably in my lifetime that we will have to have a balanced budget. And if we cave in now, we are not going to be able to have it. I do not think we will have another chance. And I think the President has every intention of having us cave in because he has a lot of discretionary programs he wants to keep funding. He is holding on to the past with white knuckles, to the last 30 years of reckless spending that has brought us where we are today, and he is trying to use the very sensitive argument that we cannot do this to all these people, that there are all these programs that are going to be cut, which are not going to be cut.  I would say that if you want to make a moral issue out of this, the moral issue is to go ahead with this, with the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which passed in this Chamber and they passed in the House of Representatives, and get this passed because if we do not do it, we know what we are subjecting our future generations to. Many Members in this body are much younger than I am, and they have young families. I have grandchildren coming up now. One is due any minute now. If we do not change the trend that we established in the 1960's and that has continued until today, a person born today is going to have to pay 82 percent of his or her lifetime income just to service the Government.  I do not think that is what we want. I know that is not what the American people want. But some people just do not want to change. Some people refuse to look at the elections and the postelection analyses and polls that said very distinctly that the American people in November 1994 voted for a change, a change from the Great Society programs of the 1960's that have been perpetuating themselves and growing ever since then. So I think this is the last chance we have.  This is our last stand. I encourage the negotiators to keep that in mind. I am talking about Republicans and Democrats. It is too important to future generations.                         U.S. Troops in Bosnia  It is ironic now that we have two things that are going on that are very, very critical to all of America, not just this budget matter that we have been talking about--and the distinguished Senator from Wyoming is right when he draws the attention to the significance of what is going on--but something else is happening, too. My frustration, which I have expressed in the Chamber every day for the last several days, is that while the President is out rejoicing in his new posture of being the international peacemaker in Belfast and other places, time is going by and American troops as we speak are being sent to Bosnia. It goes all the way back to 2\1/2\ years ago when this President made a decision to do airdrops into Bosnia. I can remember serving in the other body at that time and asking the question: You are doing airdrops. How do you know that the stuff you are dropping is going to the good guys instead of the bad guys? And the response in that committee meeting was: ``Well, we do not know.'' There was a hesitation. This was the military talking: ``I am not sure that we know who the good guys and the bad guys are.''  I think if you take any snapshot in the history of Bosnia over the last 500 years, you could come to the conclusion legitimately that the Serbs are the bad guys or the Croats are the bad guys or even the Moslems are the bad guys. If you look at what has happened in the last week over there, people have been killed, tortured; there have been uprisings. I read from several articles yesterday of the hostile area and what is happening over there.  The mayor of a town not far from where the Senator was when he was over there said, speaking in behalf of the people--we hear a lot of the military, of the three known factions and of the rogue groups that are over there but these are civilians--he says, ``We will still fight, and if the multinational force tries to drive us from our homes or take away our right to defend ourselves, there will be no authority on Earth, including the Serbian authorities, that can stop us. We will not leave, we will not withdraw, and we will not live under Moslem rule.''  This is coming from an area that is going to be under Moslem rule if this initial peace accord would take place. And you have another big group, too, not just those who have found happy homes and feel that they ought to be able to stay in those homes. You also have what I have been stating as 3 million, but I know the conservative figure is 2 million, refugees that we can identify in those areas, and they are scattered throughout Bosnia. We have heard from all of the sources--our Embassy people, the military people, U.N. people, Gen. Rupert Smith, the British general who is in charge of the U.N. forces in Bosnia, as we speak--that more than 50 percent of these 2 million refugees, under the plan that we have here, will not be able to return to their homes.  What does a refugee want to do? If you have peace, it means you get to go home. More than half of these will not get to go home. So you are going to have new rogue elements rising up.  Just this morning in the newspapers--I will just read one part of an article here that said, ``The worst problem though is likely''--keep in mind this is an article that showed this morning 10 more American soldiers showed up. There are only 10. I understand that is not a very large number. But tomorrow it will be 10 more, the next day 10 more; then larger and larger numbers will be coming because that is the President's plan, as he hides over in Europe and allows more and more of our soldiers to go over to put us in a position where we have to support him to send ground troops in.       The worst problem though is likely to be minefields. There      are believed to be millions of mines of all shapes and sizes      in the Tuzla region. There are mines everywhere. And neither      side has maps. We have to move one centimeter at a time.  This is a quote from the lieutenant colonel who works directly under General Haukland, the Norwegian general that I talked to in Tuzla. He also said that in the past 3 weeks his men have demined nearly 300 yards of road. Heavy snowfall will only complicate the problem. This is the very ground that I stood on 3 weeks ago in the Tuzla area. There are only two Members of Congress who went up into that area, Senator Hank Brown from Colorado and myself. We stood there. And I can tell you that there are mines there. These reports are accurate. That is where we are going to be having some 25,000 Americans up in that region.  Yesterday we showed a map--and I said, I do not know who did the negotiating for the United States of America--where we ended up with the northeast sector, the most hostile area. But that is where we are. And we are there very clearly today.  So, that is what we are faced with. And I think it is time to draw some other lines, too. I know that the President is over in Europe right now, believing that we are going to end up being able to vote to support his program.  Let me just serve notice to the U.S. Senate at this time, there are not going to be any free rides on this deal. A lot of people are saying, well, let us have a weak resolution or wait until we have so many troops over there and say we are going to support our troops. Sure we are going to support our troops. But now is when we can make a decision and say, ``Mr. President, you are wrong. We do not want you to send ground troops into Bosnia.''  There is going to be a recorded vote. We might as well know it. By the way, I went back and did some research just this morning. If you remember back in 1991, when George Bush was President of the United States, George Bush wanted to send troops into the Persian Gulf. We all recognized that we did have strategic interests in the Persian Gulf. Our ability to fight a war was dependent upon our protecting those interests in the Persian Gulf.  There are no strategic interests in Bosnia. But I would like to read some things. I am reading this for one reason; that is, that there was a lunch that took place just a couple days ago where the President talked to the Democrats of this Senate. And the word I got is they are all going to line up, that they all agreed that they would support the President in sending ground troops in.
