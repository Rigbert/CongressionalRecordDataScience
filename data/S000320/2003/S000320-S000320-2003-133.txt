 President, on July 31, 2002, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, FERC, issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to create a one-size-fits-all template for electric markets referred to as ``standard market design,'' SMD.  The SMD rule would bring about numerous sweeping changes, the degree and consequences of which are still being assessed. The proposed rule would require customers to pay for transmission facility upgrades caused by new generators, even if the customer does not need or use the power from those generators.  FERC's proposal would also usurp State authority to obligate utilities to serve customers, set generation reserve margins, centrally control generation dispatch, and set rates for retail transmission service. FERC's proposed rulemaking will effectively eliminate a State's ability to make decisions on issues specific to their State. Such sweeping changes to the energy industry should only be made after careful consideration of all potential consequences. After hearing these concerns, FERC promised a white paper to speak to the many concerns of myself and many others.  On April 28, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released its long-awaited white paper on Wholesale Power Markets and Standard Market Design. I and others had hoped that the release of that paper would signal a shift in the approach that the Commission has been taking with respect to the ``federalization'' of electricity regulation and markets. Disappointingly, despite some modest changes in approach, the Commission and Chairman Pat Wood have decided to move away from a partnership with the States toward Federal domination of the electricity system and electricity regulation.  In the document, the Commission reasserts its authority to regulate the terms and conditions of retail transmission, mandates the formation of Regional Transmission Organizations, and limits State authority to protect existing native load customers from the loss of transmission rights. The paper promises more ``technical conferences'' and consultation with the States, but does not change the premise upon which the Commission's Standard Market Design, ``SMD'', Notice of Proposed Rulemaking rests--that the States and regions serve only as adjuncts to the Commission as it devises new wholesale market rules that directly impinge upon retail markets.  In light of the Commission's white paper and the Senate's intention of quickly addressing energy policy, my colleagues and I present legislation today to ensure the concerns of my constituents and the constituents of my colleagues are addressed. This crucial legislation will ensure that States maintain their jurisdiction over retail utilities, that native load customers can be assured of reliability of service, that customers are not forced to socialize the cost of new transmission developed in their area but intended for other regions, and finally the legislation will prohibit the FERC from implementing its current SMD rule nor any rule that is of similar substance.                                 ______                                       By
