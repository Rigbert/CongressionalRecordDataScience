President, I rise in support of S. 1382, the ental holdings1Total= 000>Department of Defense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004, as ental holdings1Total= 000>reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations. I take a moment to ental holdings1Total= 000>talk about the urgent need for the non-line of sight cannon and to ental holdings1Total= 000>commend the actions the Senate Appropriations Committee has taken to ental holdings1Total= 000>meet this key need.ental holdings1Total= 000>  We have heard testimony from the most senior members of the Army ental holdings1Total= 000>uniformed and civilian leadership that organic Army indirect fire is ental holdings1Total= 000>one of the most urgent needs in today's military environment.ental holdings1Total= 000>  When Congress agreed to allow the Department of Defense to terminate ental holdings1Total= 000>the Crusader program last year, it did so with the explicit ental holdings1Total= 000>understanding the Crusader technology would be used to form the basis ental holdings1Total= 000>of a new lighter, more easily deployable non-line of sight cannon, ental holdings1Total= 000>which would be ready no later than 2008.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Indeed, during the last session we enacted law to that effect, and ental holdings1Total= 000>also stipulated that development of the non-line of sight cannon would ental holdings1Total= 000>be undertaken as part of the Army's Artillery Systems Demonstration and ental holdings1Total= 000>Validation program element, which is the only place within the budget ental holdings1Total= 000>that cannon artillery research and development is funded.ental holdings1Total= 000>  The designation of the non-line of sight cannon as a congressional ental holdings1Total= 000>special interest by the Senate Appropriations Committee goes even ental holdings1Total= 000>further than last year's legislation to ensure that this need is met. I ental holdings1Total= 000>ask the chairman to comment on the need for this further step.ental holdings1Total= 000>
