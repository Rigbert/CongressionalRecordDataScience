Chairman, I yield myself 7 minutes.                              {time}  2030  Mr. Chairman, this amendment adds $416 million to the bill for title I grants, $600 million to the bill for Head Start, $400 million to the bill for the 21st Century After School Centers, and adds $417 million to the bill for child care development block grants.  Mr. Chairman, before I start, I want to respond to a couple of the allegations that have been made from the other side. First of all, that somehow we are forced to do this. I want to say first to the chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter), who rises on the floor and says, gee whiz, we are forced to do that, and if the rest of us are responsible we will have to live within these limits. Let me tell my colleague something I learned a long time ago, and that is to not accept the premise of those who are arguing against me.  The premise of the gentleman is incorrect, Mr. Chairman. It is irresponsible to accept the parameters that have been placed on this bill. It is irresponsible to the children that I am going to talk about and the families that I am going to talk about to live within the parameters of the bill.  Why do we have those parameters? Not because they are in a rule, not because they were given to us by some extrinsic force, they are in the rule because of the majority party's tax cut. Now, they may not like that, but that is the fact. That is the fact.  Now, let me tell my colleague from California, who talks about fiscal responsibility. A, I support defense; B, I supported the welfare reform; and, C, as the gentleman knows, I supported the balanced budget amendment. But the fact of the matter is I did so with the premise that we would keep sufficient revenues to meet our responsibilities.  The most fiscally irresponsible administration in the history of this country was under Ronald Reagan. Hear me now. Here are the facts. Back in 1950, 125 percent of GDP we were in debt. That came down. It came down to less than 23 percent, 24 percent. It flattened out for a few years and then, guess what happened on Ronald Reagan's watch? It went through the ceiling, and added $4 trillion to the debt.  Do not preach to this side of the aisle about fiscal responsibilities, my colleagues. At no time did we have the votes to stop a Ronald Reagan veto of spending. At no time. This is Ronald Reagan's spending. It was not a question of fiscal responsibility, it was what he wanted to spend the money on. He wanted to spend the money on defense. I happened to think he was right.  Where he was not right was doing the same thing my colleagues are doing this year. He wanted to cut and did cut revenues precipitously. But he did not have the courage of his tax-cutting convictions, because the courage of his tax-cutting convictions would have been to cut spending. But he did not want to do that because he may have paid a political price for it.  Now, let me tell my colleagues what this amendment does, quickly. We add, as I said, $416 million for title I. The conference agreement on the Republican budget resolution requires $7 billion in cuts, or 6 percent below the fiscal year 2000 level, last year's level. Premising large tax cuts on unrealistic spending cuts makes the conference agreement a fiscally unsound and risky budget plan.  That is why we are here, Mr. Chairman. I am offering an amendment today to fix a few of the problems. We do not have offsets within this bill because the offset premise that the gentleman from Illinois wants us to accept would be incorrect for us to do, because it is irresponsible for the gentleman to have forged, well, the gentleman did not do it, he did not vote for it, and we admire the gentleman for that, but the fact of the matter is many of the gentleman's colleagues did. They fashioned these numbers. My amendment, as I said, adds a total of $1.8 billion.  Now, that sounds like a lot of money. But let it not surprise anybody that that figure is approximately the figure that has already been adopted by the Republican majority in the Senate. So if we are irresponsible, I guess our colleagues in the Senate over there are as well.  We ask for increases for title I funding. Head Start, 21st Century After School Centers and the child care and development block grant. The four parts to my amendment do this: Adds $416 million, as I said, to title I.  Now, that $416 million means that 650,000 children in America who qualify for services, and who are not now getting it, 650,000 disadvantaged children, will get services if my amendment passes. That is not paper, that is not rhetoric, those are real kids from real families who need help to compete in this world economy. Is the tax cut more important than those 650,000 kids?  We add $600 million to Head Start, a program everybody says works, making the total increase for fiscal year 2001 equal to $1 billion. That is an additional 50,000 low-income children who will be served and 3,000 infants and toddlers who will be served. That is 53,000 children. This is not about rhetoric and numbers, this is about real kids.  We add $400 million to the 21st Century After School Centers. We all know that crime is up after school. Why? Because kids do not have families at home. This amendment will allow 900 additional communities above the gentleman's bill to establish 3,000 centers serving 1 million children. Is that irresponsible, I ask my chairman? Is it fiscally responsible to tell those 1 million kids to get out on the street; that we do not have enough money in the richest Nation on the face of the Earth to provide them with those centers? Those children, 1.6 million children, will be denied service because of the Republican tax cut.  Lastly, we add $417 million for the bill for child care and development block grant for 2001 funding. Eighty thousand more children will be served if we pass this amendment.  My colleagues, we are talking about real kids here and programs that work. The chairman says and said in the committee when we marked this bill up that he thought this funding is okay. He told me that I was probably right, that we probably need to do this, but that we cannot do it because of the constraints. Those constraints are self-imposed.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
