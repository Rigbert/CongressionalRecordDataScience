 President, I rise in strong support of the conference report to accompany H.R. 3009, the Trade Act of 2002 and urge my colleagues to support cloture and final passage of the bill.  This bill is the product of over a year and a half of intense negotiations, discussion, and debate among Republican and Democrats in both Houses of Congress. Because of these efforts, the Trade Act strikes a solid and balanced compromise among a number of key issues and competing priorities. It is a product which should receive broad support here in the Senate today.  The Trade Act of 2002 renews Trade Promotion Authority for the President for the first time in almost a decade. Through a spirit of compromise, Democrats and Republicans were able to break the deadlock of TPA and reach a balanced compromise on a number of key issues.  For example, for the first time TPA contains a negotiating objective on labor and the environment. Negotiators are directed to seek provisions in trade agreements requiring countries to enforce their own labor and environmental laws. These negotiating objectives also recognize a country's right to exercise discretion and establish its own labor and environmental standards without being subject to retaliation.  The bipartisan TPA provisions also contain carefully balanced provisions on investment, which preserve the fundamental purpose of the investor-state dispute settlement procedures while ensuring that they are not subject to abuse. The TPA provisions preserve the ability of the United States to enforce our trade remedy laws which help combat unfair trade practices.  Finally, they contain unprecedented consultation procedures which ensure meaningful and timely consultations with Congress every step of the way, without curtailing the President's ability to negotiate good agreements.  In short, the Bipartisan TPA bill provides the President with the flexibility he needs to negotiate strong international trade agreements while maintaining Congress' constitutional role over U.S. trade policy. It represents a thoughtful approach to addressing the complex relationship between international trade, worker rights, and the environment. And it does so without undermining the fundamental purpose and proven effectiveness of Trade Promotion Authority procedures. It is an extremely solid bill which I am proud to support.  I would like to include some material for the Record which provides some background on how we got to where we are today.  Today we are on the verge of passing this critical bill and sending it to the President's desk for his signature. I want to recognize Chairman Baucus' strong efforts during the recent House-Senate conference on the Trade Act. I think they were key to our success.  I would now like to briefly outline two other provisions in the bill--Trade Adjustment Assistance and the Andean Trade Promotion Act.  First on TAA. The Trade Act reauthorizes and improves Trade Adjustment Assistance for America's workers whose jobs may be displaced by trade. I think the TAA provisions in the Trade Act are a vast improvement over the legislation that passed the Senate. The Senate TAA bill would have entirely rewritten existing law. In doing so, the Senate bill added a number of new, costly definitions, time-lines and ambiguous administrative obligations. The Trade Act removes these burdensome and ill-advised changes.  Unlike the Senate bill, the Conference Report simply amends and builds upon existing law. It adds new provisions which help to actually improve the TAA program while maintaining its linkage to trade. The TAA provisions in the Trade Act consolidate the TAA and NAFTA-TAA programs, thereby establishing a uniform set of requirements. It triggers immediate provisions of rapid response and basic adjustment services and streamlines the petition approval process.  The act also reduces by one-third the time period in which the Secretary must review a petition. At the same time, the TAA provisions drastically scale back the number of workers who can be eligible for TAA, thereby ensuring that only those workers who are truly impacted by trade and in need ofretraining are eligible for assistance. The Trade Act includes a 65 percent health insurance tax credit, and presents a firm, clear alternative to expanding Medicaid and over government run health insurance coverage.  In short, the Trade Act improves the Senate passed TAA bill and represents a more balanced approach to ensuring that workers displaced by trade get the assistance and training they need to quickly re-enter the workforce and compete in the international environment.  There is another extremely important provision in the Trade Act that I would like to briefly mention, and that is the Andean Trade Promotion and Drug Eradication Act. This provision will help eradicate drug trafficking in the Andean nations by helping to create new employment opportunities for the citizens of Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia and Peru. It is a vital piece of legislation for our Andean neighbors and a critical tool in our effort to fight drug trafficking.  The intent of the Andean Trade Preference Act, from the beginning, was to advance our efforts to combat illegal drug production and trafficking. It was then and is now not so much a trade initiative as it is an effort to assist important allies in a critical fight. The nations of Latin America expect us to continue to stand by their side as we fight the scourge of drugs. They have paid a high price to aid us in this effort. It is a battle we cannot afford to lose. So we cannot fail to do our duties as legislators and provide them with the support they need with this important legislation.  Before I conclude, I want us to step back and take a look at the big picture.  I will be the first to admit that this bill is not perfect. There are provisions in this bill which I do not support and there are many items I wish were in the bill that are not. But all in all it is a good, fair, and balanced package. It deserves our strong support, especially in this changing international environment.  International trade has long been one of the most important foreign policy and economic tools in our arsenal. It was a key component of our post-World War II international economic strategy. For over fifty years international trade contributed to stability and economic growth throughout the world. It helped to lift the nations of Europe and Asia out of the ashes of World War II. And it helped America experience unprecedented prosperity here at home. International trade can play a similar role at the beginning of the twenty-first century. But our nation must have the tools to lead. This bill will make a difference. Nations around the world are waiting for our call and our leadership.  Today, the eyes of the world are on the Senate. We cannot let them down. I urge my colleagues to support the conference report, vote for cloture and final passage of the bill.  I ask unanimous consent to print the information I earlier referenced in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:Transcript Excerpt From the Mark-up of the Trade Adjustment Assistance                      Bill S. 1209--December 4, 2001OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHARLES E. GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM IOWA       Senator Grassley. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.       Obviously, I will repeat some of the things that I said the      other day.       The Chairman. It does not have to be obvious. You can      change.       Senator Grassley. Well, these are things that I think we      need to remind ourselves of, particularly the bipartisanship      of this committee.       When this mark-up began last week, I stated that I support      Trade Adjustment Assistance. I do not support it, though, in      the partisan way that this legislation has been advanced.       Now, you took time during your statement to show how there      had been cooperation among Republicans and Democrats to deal      with some things that ought to be in Trade Adjustment      Assistance.       So, my remarks in regard to the partisan way are related to      the bill containing provisions from the Democratically-passed      stimulus package that makes sweeping and permanent changes to      our health care system. Just as my colleagues on the other      side failed to work in a bipartisan fashion on economic      stimulus, they have followed the same course again on these      health provisions for Trade Adjustment Assistance.       These things should be taken up as part of our      consideration of health programs and not be mixed with, or at      least on the stimulus package, Trade Adjustment Assistance.       I think we have a situation here, as I said a week ago,      where we have got two very good bills. I think when we      finally get a Trade Adjustment Assistance bill, unless, for      instance, it were to have these health care provisions in it,      you have got a bill that will pass the Senate almost      unanimously.       I think that we would have a situation, if we got trade      promotion authority out of here, and one that I think would      be very much a bipartisan bill, would pass the Senate      overwhelmingly, not unanimously or near-unanimously like      Trade Adjustment Assistance might.       But when you are going to bring these bills to the floor of      the Senate where there is not an arrangement for both to go,      whether they go together or go separately, we have a      situation where there are two very popular public policy      decisions that could be on the Senate floor that could pass      by big margins. But one will not pass without the other. That      is not a whole lot different than when Trade Adjustment      Assistance first came in to public policy 40 years ago. They      kind of came in together.       So I want to say, again, that we must not lose sight of the      importance then of renewing the President's trade promotion      authority this year. I know that some members of this      committee believe that we should act only after the House has      acted on this very important piece of legislation.       But it appears to me that this is a criteria that is      selectively applied. All you have to do is look at what we      are doing this morning, marking up Trade Adjustment      Assistance legislation before the House has acted. We also      marked up fast track legislation in 1997 before the House      acted, and it was strongly bipartisan, that the committee      approved, with only one dissenting vote.       So making a committee vote on renewing the President's      trade negotiating authority contingent with House action is      not in accord with recent action of this committee, including      what we are doing here today.       In addition, Mr. Chairman, I believe, and many members of      this committee believe, that Trade Adjustment Assistance      ought to be considered in tandem with legislation to renew      the President's trade negotiating authority.       This is not a new idea. When President Kennedy first      designed the Trade Adjustment Assistance program in      the 1960s, he specifically stated that adjustment      assistance was integrally linked to the Kennedy      Administration's overall efforts to reduce barriers to      foreign trade.       That linkage was explicitly stated in President Kennedy's      message to Congress when he announced that the first Trade      Adjustment Assistance program was to be part of the Trade      Expansion Act of 1962.       Here is what he said in 1962: ``I am also recommending as      an essential part of the new trade program that companies,      farmers, workers who suffer damage from increased foreign      import competition be assisted in their efforts to adjust to      that competition.''       Ever since President Kennedy created the linkage between      trade expansion and Trade Adjustment Assistance, that linkage      has been maintained, both by Democrat and Republican      administrations.       The linkage between Trade Adjustment Assistance makes      sense. It made sense when President Kennedy designed the      Trade Adjustment Assistance program in 1962, so consequently      it makes sense today. It ought to be preserved. I will oppose      any efforts to sever the historic linkage between trade      expansion and Trade Adjustment Assistance.       Finally, Mr. Chairman, I again regret that we cannot get to      a vote by a date certain on the President's most important      trade policy initiative. As I said last week, we should not      call it trade promotion authority for the President because,      quite frankly, we are talking about trade promotion authority      for America.       That is because America will win if we can realize the      promise of opening new markets for our farmers, ranchers, and      workers. But America will also lose, our farmers, ranchers,      and workers will lose, if our effort to renew the President's      trade negotiating authority gets bogged down in partisan      bickering.       I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans alike, to      work with me on trade promotion authority for America. We can      do this. We must do it. We must do it in a bipartisan way, in      the great and enduring tradition of this committee.       I also might add that today is the day in which we are      going to start applying tariffs and other trade provisions to      the Andean Pact nations, because the Andean Pact lapses      today. I think that that is an example of our committee being      a little late from time to time on very important pieces of      trade policy that we should really push.       I think we ought to take into consideration that nations      that this committee expressed last week need our help, almost      unanimously--in fact, it was probably a unanimous vote--that      we move ahead with the Andean Pact.       It is too bad that we have not moved quickly enough so that      these nations continue to be helped, as they have been helped      under the Andean Pact, and as we would expand the Andean Pact      legislation to do even greater good for those nations to help      themselves.       Quite frankly, it is only trade and it is not going to be      aid that moves the economies of these nations along. It is      really a missed opportunity now that, after all these years      of     having the preferential treatment of imports from the Andean      Pact nations because we felt that it was very necessary to      help them to help themselves, which is what trade does, that      now there is going to be a greater cost, consequently less      trade. Obviously, the economies of these countries are going      to be hurt.       These are the very same countries that we feel we ought to      be helping, because that's where we need to strengthen their      economy so that they are not so dependent upon the drugs that      they produce that are coming to our country, and a lot of      other reasons as well, but that is a very important one for      our country.       So, I hope we have a very aggressive trade agenda, we move      forward. The most important one is trade promotion authority      for the President, regardless of what happens in the House of      Representatives, because I do not think that the Senate is      irrelevant on this issue of trade promotion authority.       I yield the floor.       The Chairman. Thank you very much, Senator. I agree with      you on the Andean Trade Preferences Act which has passed this      committee, and hopefully can be brought up and passed on the      floor this year.       The bill is now open for amendment.       Senator Hatch?       Senator Hatch. Mr. Chairman, is it appropriate for me to      offer my amendment?       The Chairman. Absolutely.       Senator Hatch. All right. I will offer on amendment that      will add trade promotion authority language to the Chairman's      mark. In addition, my amendment would substitute the      Chairman's mark's TAA language with the administration's      Trade Adjustment Assistance proposal.       Traditionally, the Finance Committee has played a      leadership role in forging major bipartisan consensus      legislation in the areas of importance to the American      public. Mr. Chairman, you and Senator Grassley both rose to      that occasion in the tax bill earlier this year. Time and      time again, this committee stepped up to the plate in      difficult areas.       For example, we took the lead in 1997 in the Balanced      Budget bill and even found a way to weave the Children's      Health Insurance program into that critical legislation.       I take exception to the view that the prudent course is for      this committee to wait and see what the House does on TPA.      With all due respect, I simply do not agree with what the      Chairman said last week, that it would be a waste of time of      this committee and the whole Senate if we were to take up      fast track legislation prior to the House action.       Frankly, I am not sure that there is any better use of time      of this committee and the Senate than in trying to reach a      compromise on trade legislation that can help jump-start our      stagnating economy.       America is fighting a war against terrorism, and we are      fighting this war in the midst of a deepening economic      recession. As the unemployment statistics climb, it would      seem wise to aggressively pursue trade policies that help to      create new jobs for Americans.       We know that over the last decade, exports have accounted      for between one-quarter and one-third of U.S. economic      growth. We know that these export-related jobs pay about 13      to 18 percent higher than the average U.S. wage.       Mr. Chairman, I do not know about the farmers in Montana,      but in the Utah Agricultural Committee they have told me      that, in no uncertain terms, that community wants to see TPA      pass, because one in three farm acres go for exports. They      want to ship even more of their products overseas.       In my view, it was unfortunate that we let Ambassador      Zoellick go to Doha last month without the mandate that TPA      would have given the U.S. delegation. Economists estimate      that the next WTO trade round could bring an additional $177      billion in benefits to the United States. So, it is in our      national interests for U.S. negotiators to be leaders in      bilateral and multilateral trade initiatives.       Now, given these facts and circumstances, many of us just      do not understand how timely consideration of TPA legislation      continues to elude the committee's attention.       My amendment is simple. It has two features. First, my      amendment would have the committee adopt the same TPA      language that the committee reported to the Senate floor back      in 1997. Second, I would amend the amendment I filed last      week to replace the Chairman's mark on TAA with the      administration's Trade Adjustment Assistance proposal.       Now, with respect to trade promotion authority, I think      that my colleagues who served on the committee will recall      the provisions of old S. 1269 of the 105th Congress. There      was broad bipartisan support for this measure. It was adopted      by the Finance Committee on a voice vote.       Now, this amendment consists of carefully constructed      language. Twice, it has survived cloture votes on the Senate      floor, by a 69 to 31 vote on November 4, 1997, and by a 68 to      31 vote a day later.       Why do we not simply adopt this non-controversial support      of 1997 language again today? For example, we have heard all      year about the importance of labor and environment      provisions.       Here is what the 1997 bill and my amendment says on that      score. My amendment says, ``It is the policy of the United      States to reinforce the trade agreements process by promoting      respect for ``workers'' rights by seeking to establish in the      International Labor Organization a mechanism for the      systematic examination of, and reporting on, the extent to      which ILO members promote and enforce the freedom of      association, the right to organize and bargain collectively,      a prohibition on the use of forced labor, a prohibition on      exploitative child labor, and a prohibition on discrimination      in employment.'' What is wrong with that language?       With respect to the environment, my amendment calls for      ``expanding the production of goods and trade and goods and      services to ensure the optimal use of the world's resources,      while seeking to protect and preserve the environment and to      enhance the international means for doing so.'' So, this      amendment addresses both labor and the environment, and it is      no wonder why it was so broadly supported back in 1997.       Now, I have been around here long enough not to be totally      shocked if my amendment is not adopted today. But I do want      to leave my colleagues across the aisle with the message that      I am prepared to listen to your concerns and work with you in      good faith across the aisle to fashion compromise bipartisan      TPA legislation that will get the job done.       I think that the bipartisan legislation put forward by      Senators Gramm and Murkowski might also serve as a good      vehicle to get us off the dime. Instead of sitting around      waiting for the House to act, why do we not send the House      and the American public a strong message that the Senate      intends to pass both trade promotion authority and Trade      Adjustment Assistance as soon as possible?       The political reality may be that both of these measures      may have to pass, or both may fail. We can accept failure for      either of these measures. While I do not believe that it      should be necessary to tie these two pieces together in one      bill, there are certain advantages of doing so. The      suspension of production by Geneva Steel in Utah last month,      the largest steel mill west of the Mississippi, has      underscored to me the importance of Trade Adjustment      Assistance, among other things.       For over 1,400 steelworkers and their families, the future      is not clear. Unfortunately, they can benefit from some help.      I want to commend Senator Rockefeller for his efforts on      behalf of the steel industry at the ITC.       With respect to Trade Adjustment Assistance, I am offering      the administration's proposal. We have with us at the table      Mr. Chris Spear, Assistant Secretary for Policy at the      Department of Labor, to discuss the details of the proposal.      But I want to make a few points about this part of my      amendment.       The administration's TAA proposal is a focused, balanced,      and revenue-neutral approach. It expands eligibility for      shifts in production benefits to workers displaced by shifts      in production to countries in which the U.S. enters into a      new trade agreement, thereby preserving the nexus between      trade and assistance.       Recognizing that it makes no sense to maintain two similar,      yet separate, TAA programs, the administration's proposal      consolidates administration of the TAA program and the NAFTA      TAA program. It modifies current requirements for training      waivers, specifying five conditions under which training      requirements may be waived.       Finally, perhaps the most innovative feature of the      administration's proposal is the creation of a trade      adjustment account option pilot program to offer the option      of a limp sum payment in lieu of traditional TAA benefits.       The bottom line for American workers and their families has      to be for Congress to successfully open up new markets for      U.S. goods for the new trade agreements that TPA legislation      will help spawn, and to help displaced workers through TAA.       The American people want us to work together to help solve      our Nation's problems. That is what we did with the counter-     terrorism legislation. That is what we will do with the      bioterrorism legislation that Senators Frist, Kennedy, Gregg,      and many of the others of us are developing. I hope that this      committee can meet the challenge we face in fashioning both      TAA and TPA legislation, and that is what this amendment      attempts.       So, I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for making this      rather lengthy statement, but I sure hope we can pass this      amendment.       The Chairman. Thank you, Senator. Any comments?       Senator Grassley. Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this      amendment to renew the President's trade promotion authority.      Senator Moynihan said, when this bill was approved three or      four years ago, that it was, in his words, ``an extraordinary      agreement.''       Many of my colleagues who were on the committee four years      ago will recall that the 1997 bill was passed by the      committee before the House acted, with broad bipartisan      support. There was just one dissenting vote, as I recall.       It enjoyed equally strong bipartisan support on the floor.      The motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed was      approved by a vote of 69 to 31. This model of bipartisan      trade legislation should serve as our model today.       Because it was passed by such a wide and convincing      bipartisan margin just four years ago is not enough to      dismiss this bill by saying that times have changed. Trade      negotiating authority for the President was as controversial      then as it is now. The choices in front of us in 1997 were as      tough and as challenging then as they are now. The importance      of the United States' leadership in trade policy was as      important in 1997 as it is now.       Let us again reaffirm what Senator Moynihan said in 1997.      This is an extraordinary     agreement and it is worthy of continuation of this      committee's historic heritage of bipartisanship in U.S. trade      policy. I urge my colleagues to again vote in favor of this      legislation by adopting this amendment.       In regard to the amendment that Senator Hatch has of      connecting Trade Adjustment Assistance to it, as I stated in      my opening comments, this is also in regard to a tradition      that was started with trade promotion authority during the      Kennedy Administration.       So I would like to say a word on the administration's TAA      proposal because I think the administration has been unfairly      criticized in the last few days in the press about its      proposal and I would set the record straight.       A tremendous amount of effort has gone into developing the      administration's proposal. The administration put together a      working group consisting of four cabinet-ranked officials,      Secretaries Chao, Evans, and O'Neill, as well as Ambassador      Zoellick. They developed this proposal.       Countless hours were spent drafting and refining a proposal      that makes some very positive changes in our Trade Adjustment      Assistance laws. They also did this in a very responsible      way, from a budget point of view, that is. Rather than throw      money at the program, they came up with a revenue-neutral      approach that represents a serious and very reasonable      compromise.       So, I commend the administration this morning for their      outstanding work that has gone not their Trade Adjustment      Assistance proposal. That is part of Senator Hatch's      amendment. It is an excellent proposal and I think it      deserves the consideration of this committee and the support      of this committee.       The Chairman. Any further discussion?       Senator Breaux. Mr. Chairman?       The Chairman. Senator Breaux?       Senator Breaux. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Once      again, I think we have proved that we all can play great      defense, but the problem is, how do you get an offense      together? You cannot win unless you can score.       I think that we are in a situation now where our Republican      colleagues can prevent us from passing the Trade Adjustment      Assistance Act, and we can prevent them from passing fast      track.       But I really question whether that is what we should be      doing. We should be passing things and getting things done      instead of just playing defense and blocking each other.       The House, I take it, is going to take up fast track on      Thursday and there is a real question of whether they are      going to pass it or not. It is very controversial over her.      The Chairman has made a decision that, let us wait to see      what our colleagues are going to do over in the other body.       If they pass the bill over there--which is questionable,      but I think they will probably put it together and get it      done--I think the Chairman has indicated that he is willing      to move forward on fast track over here and do both together.       Now, here it is, 11:00. We know that we are, I think, not      going to get anything done all day long in our committee.      That it unfortunate. It would seem that we could get some      kind of an agreement to see what the House is going to do,      take both of them up, and pass both of them. I mean, that is      what I would like to see done.       I am for fast track authority for this President, the last      President, and the next President. I think they ought to have      it. I think it is absolutely needed. I think the Trade      Adjustment Assistance bill is also very important. We have      got a situation where people need help, and this is a proper,      appropriate federal response.       So, it is unfortunate that the defense is going to win.      Defense is going to win this game today. That is pretty      clear. But I just suggest that there ought to be a way to      bring these concepts together and get both of them done. I      think that after Thursday when the House does it, is the      appropriate and proper time to do it. I am for fast track.      But I think I am certainly going to follow the leadership of      the Chair and say, let us wait and see what the House does.      That is just a practical way to handle it.       Thank you.       The Chairman. I might say also to my good friend from Utah      that it is my intention to bring up fast track before the      committee if, and when, the House passes the bill. Now, the      vote is scheduled for Thursday over in the House. I, frankly,      question the advisability of pressing for a fast track vote      here at this time in this amendment. This bill is going to      lose. That might have some adverse effect on the House vote,      I do not know. But I would just urge, therefore, the Senators      to withdraw the amendment because our goal here is to pass      both fast track and Trade Adjustment Assistance.       Now, the Chair will schedule a fast track mark-up next      week. Not the end of next week. It is in good faith, next      week, so that we could consider this bill. I think it is      unlikely that fast track will reach the floor of the Senate      this session. Highly unlikely. But, as I have said time and      time again, if the House dose pass fast track, I will move      it.       Senator Breaux. Yes, certainly.       Senator Breaux. I think the Chairman makes a good point. I      would say to our Republican colleagues, to Senator Hatch in      particular, we know what is going to happen with this vote. I      think, if we have a fast track vote in this committee today,      with the very fragile coalition we have in the House, this      could be a signal to the House members that the Finance      Committee killed it. I think that would be terrible for those      who wanted to get it passed. We all know what is happening. I      think it is a major point that it should be done.       But the House is on a string about whether they have enough      votes to pass this. Those who are opposed to it over there,      and some of them are Democrats, will use this vote in this      committee to help get the bill killed in the House, and      therefore prevent it ever coming up in the Senate. You have      made your point. Do not push it to a vote because it sends a      terrible signal. I think the Chairman is right on target on      that point.       Senator Kyl. Mr. Chairman?       The Chairman. Senator Kyl?       Senator Kyl. If I could, just in response to that. I do not      understand something here. I guess I have not been on the      committee long enough. But if we are all for fast track, why      is the vote going to lose?       The Chairman. Because this is a vote for another fast track      bill. It is not even on the fast track that is before the      House. It is totally different.       Senator Kyl. If one ways it is totally different, then      nobody in the House should take anything from a vote on this      particular provision.       The Chairman. Well, but we all know that sometimes the way      results are written up by the press and around, and different      people interpret things different ways, I just think it is      inadvisable for us to do this.       Senator Kyl. I cannot believe the press would not write      this--       The Chairman. I cannot either, but sometimes it happens.       I might say, too, the House has twice defeated fast track      and it was withdrawn a third time. So, that is a very      legitimate question of whether the House is going to pass      fast track.       Senator Hatch. But would it not be comfortable if we did?       The Chairman. If I might continue.       Senator Hatch. I am sorry. I apologize.       The Chairman. I do not think we should waste our time here.      That is, if the House does not vote fast track this week,      then I think it is inadvisable for us to act this week, and      with so few days remaining.       Senator Grassley. Did you say in your previous statement,      the one befoe now, that you would have a mark-up next week on      fast track?       The Chairman. If the House passes fast track. Yes. If the      House passes fast track, I will have a mark-up next week on      fast track.       Senator Bingaman. Mr. Chairman?       The Chairman. Senator Bingaman?       Senator Bingaman. I wanted to also just say a word about      the other aspect of Senator Hatch's amendment. As I      understand it, is to adopt the Trade Adjustment Assistance      proposal the administration has made.       Senator Hatch. Right.       Senator Bingaman. I think that would be a major mistake and      a major disappointment for a lot of workers around the      country. The truth is, it is revenue-neutral. That means that      we are essentially saying that we will be spending no more on      Trade Adjustment Assistance in the future than we have spent      in the past.       Benefits will not be improved in any of the respects that      we are intending to in the bill that we are currently trying      to proceed with the mark-up on. There will be no assistance      to communities.       There will be no assistance to secondary workers. There      will be no extension of benefits from 52 to 78 weeks for      those who are trying to get training to go into other lines      of work. I think that would be a major disappointment for a      lot of people. So, I hope very much that, on that ground      alone, we would turn down the amendment that the Senator from      Utah has offered.       Senator Grassley. I do not know exactly what the author of      the amendment will do. But I would hope that, with the      statement by the Chairman that he will mark up next week if      the House passes a bill, conversely, that this will give some      encouragement to the House of Representatives to move forward      and pass it because we have a commitment then that this is      not going to be bottled up in this committee. That does not      mean what is going to happen on the floor of the Senate, but      at least it will not be bottled up here by the Chairman. That      might encourage the House to move forward with it.       I yield.       Senator Hatch. If I could just ask, before I make this      momentous decision. I have listened to my colleagues.       The Chairman. Careful.       Senator Hatch. I am very considerate of my colleagues most      of the time, I think. But could I ask Mr. Spear to tell me      why Senator Bingaman is not right? I mean, I know why, but I      would like to hear it from you.       Mr. Spear. Well, Senator, there are some significant      differences.       Senator Hatch. You can be a little more diplomatic. You do      not have to refer to Senator Bingaman. [Laughter].       Mr. Spear. There are some significant differences in the      two proposals and I would be remiss if I did not say that the      administration is grateful to have had the opportunity to      work collaboratively with staff on both sides of the aisle      for several months now.       I think since May, when we first started discussing ways to      improve the program, we each had different solutions to that.      I think both proposals tried to get at the same goal, just in      different ways.       I think, in terms of secondary workers, COBRA care,      extended income support, these     are all significant things that are items that stand out in      the Chairman's mark that are not present in the      administration's proposal.       The administration worked very hard, based on three GAO      reports and a recent IG report in the Department of Labor to      improve its program. I do not recall any income      recommendations made in those reports that would justify      bolstering more money in the program to enhance the      performance.       I think what we tried to do is to increase performance, to      get results, stress training, which is mandatory under the      program, and make certain that people get placed as quickly      as possible. I think that is the goal of the program. I think      the administration's mark gets to that point.       Senator Snowe. Mr. Chairman?       The Chairman. Senator Snowe?       Senator Snowe. Thank you. Mr. Chairman.       I hope that we could sever these issues because I do think      it is extremely important to move ahead on the      reauthorization of the Trade Adjustment Assistance.       But, more than reauthorization, it is an expansion on the      program itself based on the need and tailored to some of the      issues that have been developed as a result of so many      displaced workers. The demands have been extraordinary on the      program, so obviously we need to do far more in providing      needs to displaced workers.       It does include health care provisions, although I do not      agree with the provisions that are in this legislation,      particularly. I did support the original provisions that were      included in Senator Bingaman's bill. Hopefully we will get      back to that, because I think 75 percent, based on this      legislation, is unprecedented.       But, in any event, I do think we need to go forward with      this legislation, and based on changes. I know I have worked      with the administration as well and they have been commenting      on a number of issues, and I have worked with the Chairman      and Senator Bingaman, who have been very responsive to some      of my issues as well.       I do think that we have to expand the program to include      secondary workers, as well as a program for farmers and      fishermen, increasing the amount of money available for      retraining. In my State of Maine, we have lost thousands      and thousands of manufacturing jobs. In just the last few      years, there have been more than 7,000 workers in my State      that have depended upon the Trade Adjustment Assistance      program.       So, it is not only necessary to move forward with this      program, but also to move forward in a way that reflects and      accommodates the additional issues that need to be addressed      through this reauthorization process that provides a far      better benefit to displaced workers, reflects the realities      of the workplace in making sure they have that kind of      support.       In addition, I do think it is critical to provide support      to communities. Obviously, when manufacturing plants or any      plants are closed down in a community in small towns like in      my State, clearly it has a reverberating effect throughout      the community.       So, we have to identify those firms that had a direct, and      in some cases indirect, relationship with the plant that      closed that really does present a hardship in the particular      community. I think we also have to provide additional support      for retraining, as has been recommended in the legislation      before us.       I would hope that we would separate these two issues. I am      not sure where I am on the trade promotion authority. That is      something that I am certainly going to reflect upon. I do      think that we should mark up that legislation and have a      date-certain commitment if the House of Representatives does      move forward in this legislation this week.       I do think that that is going to be important to address in      the final analysis, and I am prepared to work on that      legislation this month as well, Mr. Chairman and Ranking      Member Senator Grassley, who I know is a strong supporter of      the trade promotion authority. Thank you.       Senator Hatch. Mr. Chairman?       The Chairman. Senator Hatch?       Senator Hatch. Mr. Chairman, I would like a vote on this.      But I can see which way the vote is going to go and there is      no reason to put anybody through that.       Would the Chairman commit to a good-faith effort to, if the      House does not pass this or they do not act on this, to      bringing this up after the first of the year?       The Chairman. Senator, I think we all favor fast track. We      all want a fast track that is fair and responsible to      American people. I think that a vote today reporting out TAA      sends a very strong positive signal for expanding trade, and      I hope we pass that bill out today.       With respect to your specific question, in the event the      House does not pass fast track this session, then next year I      will, at the earliest possible time, look for a time when we      can take up in the committee and have a mark-up on fast      track. I cannot give a specific date because next year is      next year.       Senator Hatch. Sure.       The Chairman. It is just hard to tell what the timing is      next year. But I do think that it is appropriate for us to      try to take it up.       Now, on the other hand, if the House vote is very negative,      then it might make sense for us to wait a little longer, or      maybe speed it up. It is hard to tell.       Senator Hatch. Or we might have to lead on.       The Chairman. You just have my attention, that I will bring      up fast track as early as practical within a reasonable way,      because we all want to get fast track passed in a way that      makes sense.       Senator Hatch. All right. Well, I have listened to my      colleagues. It is apparent that it would be basically      defeated for a variety of reasons here today, so I will      withdraw the amendment and listen to my colleagues.       The Chairman. I thank the Senator.
