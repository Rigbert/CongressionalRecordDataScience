 The gentleman mentioned advanced solid-state lighting. It is my understanding that Philips has indicated that a small investment in manufacturing technology to improve the mechanisms as far as the construction and manufacturing of these lightbulbs would allow them to bring back jobs that are currently outsourced overseas. If we make that investment, and I hope we do, I certainly would want to join with other colleagues to see if, in fact, Philips Electronics is good to their word. But at this point I would state my objection.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
