 President, only 48 years old, a veritable dynamo, exuding ideas and proposals, knowing his words commanded attention from the humblest abode to the White House itself, Duane Garrett seemed to have it all.  With a loving family, legions of friends, the respect and admiration of the lowly and highly placed alike, Duane appeared boundlessly blessed.  Lawyer, businessman, political adviser, art and stamp collector, sport savant, historian for the San Francisco Giants, fishing boat skipper--no one could fillet a salmon with such aplomb--radio talk show host, television commentator, Duane was a talented universalist--the proverbial Renaissance man.  Serious and thoughtful in his political analysis, witty and full of fun in conversation, a tenacious fighter for what he believed, yet practical and down-to-earth in his judgments, Duane was a true prodigy.  A giving man, always surprising friends with a gift--a stamp to a collector, a baseball card from a hero of long-ago to a young fan--but as only the generous can, Duane brushed aside gratitude. ``It was nothing. Just thinking about you,'' he would say.  And he would mean it because he gave from his heart.  With him, everything was done with enthusiasm born of interest in people and intensified by an endless curiosity about our world and our place in history.  He took to the microphone of his talk show with the same unrestrained gusto as he would enter a private conversation with an old friend.  He never held back. He always gave his all. He drew unselfishly from his knowledge and experience. Widely read and deeply thoughtful, he cut quickly and expertly to the heart of issues.  Certainly, I benefited from this ability as he advised me over the years, most recently as the cochair of my campaign for the U.S. Senate.  His candor could be counted upon. His word was his absolute bond. His thought was as rich and inventive as any person I know.  Also, he was a good friend, a person of great warmth and compassion. His mere walking into a room brought a brightness and warmth.  His bearish looming over a podium at a political dinner--and he was master of ceremonies at countless of them for me--was sure to give instant vibrancy to festivities. He was a master not only of long range ideas and concerns, but of the moment.  Actually, when his many talents and attributes are added together, the sum seems larger than life.  That makes his loss all the greater.  A giant who suddenly, without hint or warning, silences himself inevitably conjures a mystery.  But even in death there can be no detraction from what he contributed to life, no diminution of his love for Patty and his daughters, Laura and Jessica; no devaluation in the worth of the counsel and friendship he gave, or of the affection and respect he received in return.   While we may never learn or understand why this ebullient man should end his life, we can never subtract from his accomplishments.  We may never fathom the why of death, but we shall always be thankful for the fullness of his life.  Outwardly, Duane was the epitome of confidence and elan, seemingly so impregnable. Whatever pain he felt, or doubts he had, remained concealed behind the customary lift of his head and broad smile.  What drove him to that final, solitary walk on the Golden Gate Bridge may elude us, but what we shall always know is his love for his family and his zest whenever he was on the other end of the phone, or sitting in the living room or booming his opinion on radio or television.  His life is what matters. His death is mere punctuation that makes clear the substance and meaning that came before.  Indeed, Duane seemed to have it all, and for those of us who knew him he endlessly seemed to give his all.  So very much alive, so bursting with ideas, so expressive, so reaching out to help others, Duane, even now that he is gone, reverberates in our mind in endless reminders of the vigor and principle he brought to politics and other endeavors.  Campaign manager, advisor, counselor, invariably shrewd and insightful, always helpful, thoroughly unselfish, unfailingly available and generous with his time, Duane Garrett was always there.  And always shall he be.                            ____________________
