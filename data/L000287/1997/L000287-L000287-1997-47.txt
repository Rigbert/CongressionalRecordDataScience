Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend and my colleague, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia [Ms. Norton], for calling this special order tonight. I know some time ago the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia had planned to hold a special order, but because of the schedule of the House, we are doing it tonight.  So Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague in paying tribute to a noble spirit, Dr. Betty Shabazz. I felt a profound sense of loss when I learned of her death. Betty Shabazz stood tall as a wife, a mother, and a friend.  As a matter of fact, I knew Malcolm and got to know her husband fairly well. I first met him on the night of August 27th, 1963, 34 years ago, here in the city of Washington on the eve of the march on Washington. The last time I saw her husband alive was in Nairobi, Kenya, in October 1964, at the New Stanley Hotel.  Malcolm and Betty together represented something deep and good about the very best of America. Betty Shabazz stood tall as a wife, as a mother. She stood tall as a woman of courage, pride, and with a great sense of dignity.  As I said before, at the age of 28, Betty Shabazz suddenly lost her husband, Malcolm, to an assassin's bullet. With few resources, she began to raise her six daughters. With determination she pursued and achieved a doctorate degree in education. With a deep sense of compassion and an abiding faith, Betty Shabazz continued Malcolm's work.  On February 21, 1965, I say to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton, my friend and colleague of long standing, I remember very well, we were driving back from Macon, GA in south Georgia on the way to the city of Atlanta, and then on our way to Selma, when weheard on the radio that Malcolm had been assassinated by an assassin's bullet.  As the gentlewoman stated so well, Betty was pregnant with twins as she witnessed the murder of her husband. Just a week earlier the family home had been firebombed, and as the wife of a controversial public figure, worry and concern for the well-being of her family had become part of Betty's life.  So on this day, we are here to honor the life of a remarkable woman, an extraordinary person. Ghandi, the great teacher of the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence, once said that there was a soul force in the universe which, if permitted, would flow through us and produce miraculous results.  In the life of Betty Shabazz we can find that soul force, a power to transform tragedies into great victory. By her quiet and courageous example, Betty Shabazz fought tragedy with love and compassion. She did not become bitter or hostile after the murder of her husband. Instead, Betty picked herself up and raised six lovely daughters. As their mother, she got involved in their lives. She passed on to them the great legacy of their father.  Betty not only had the ability but also the capacity to grow and to learn. Perhaps that is why she became an educator. That is why she had the capacity and the ability to reach out to others. She had the ability and the capacity to inspire. That is why I think we are here today. In her professional life as an administrator of Medgar Evers College in New York City, Betty Shabazz encouraged young people to study and to strive for their very best.  I would say to the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia [Ms. Norton], Betty Shabazz touched so many with her strength and kindness. I know on so many occasions she made me laugh. Being with Betty was always joyful, sharing funny stories or something we saw in the audience, or something we read about or something we saw during the Congressional Caucus weekend. I will never, ever forget her sweet and wonderful smile; just being in her company, being in her presence.  I have a photograph of Betty with Mrs. King and Dr. King's sister, Christine King Farris, and they are all smiling, sharing some story. Sometimes we never know how powerful, how influential a person is until we miss them or do not see them. Maybe we will never know.  Betty, through her courage, was able to supply all of us with faith and hope. She had the ability to be able to see good or goodness in all humankind. With one more river to cross, I wanted Betty to survive, to beat the odds. Even as she struggled to overcome and to recover from the extensive burns on her body, she held onto life longer than many had expected.  Yes, this is the life of a remarkable American woman, of a beautiful woman with iron will and strong determination. Betty Shabazz has left us. I would like to think that she is now in a better place, and at long last she has been reunited with her beloved Malcolm. Tonight our hearts and our sympathies go out to her family and her friends. We will all miss her, but the great example of her life leaves us sweetly blessed with a profound sense of hope.  So tonight I say to you, Betty, thank you. Despite great challenges, defeats, and difficulties, you, Dr. Betty Shabazz, walked through life with soul force. You had the ability, you had the capacity, to produce great results. You will be missed. As a Nation and as a people, we will not forget your gifts to all of us and to all humankind.  Again, I want to thank my friend and my colleague, the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia [Ms. Norton] for bringing us together tonight to participate in this special order.                              {time}  2030
