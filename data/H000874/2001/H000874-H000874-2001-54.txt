Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this motion to recommit. I am a strong supporter of the contracting community. I have a very vibrant contracting community in my district. They perform an invaluable service for the defense of this Nation, in my case, for the United States Navy.  The gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Andrews) have stated it well. What we want is we want a competition which will produce the best product for the best price. What this amendment that the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bonior) is adding simply says that in the competition we will not exclude Federal employees who were doing the job now. If they lose that competition, the job will be contracted out as it ought to be.  On the other hand, if they win the competition, and the competition shows that the Federal employees can do it cheaper and better, then it ought to be done in-house because that is what the taxpayer would want.  I think that is good for America. I frankly think it is good in the final analysis for contractors, and it clearly is fair to our Federal employees.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time in support of the motion to recommit.
