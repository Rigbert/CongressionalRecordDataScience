 I come from a State, as do many other Members, where many folks are finding it extremely difficult this year to pay for their home heating fuel costs because, as we all know, costs are soaring.

As you know, Mr. President, the LIHEAP program has been an enormously successful program in providing help to many Americans in paying their heating bills, especially the senior citizens.  So what this amendment would do--and I will talk at greater length about it tomorrow--is provide $924 million in increased LIHEAP funding because we need that funding now.
