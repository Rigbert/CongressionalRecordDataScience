President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Illinois in reintroducing the Conserve by Bike Act to recognize and promote bicycling's important impact on energy savings and public health.  With America's dependence on foreign oil, it is vital that we look to the contribution that bike travel can make toward solving our Nation's energy challenges. The legislation we are reintroducing today would establish a Conserve by Bike pilot program that would oversee pilot projects throughout the country designed to conserve energy resources by providing education and marketing tools to convert car trips into bike trips. Right now, fewer than 1 trip in 100 nationwide is by bicycle. If we could increase this statistic to 1\1/2\ trips per 100, we could save over 462 million gallons of gasoline per year, worth nearly $1 billion.  While more bike trips would benefit our energy conservation efforts, additional bicycling activity would also help improve the Nation's public health. According to the U.S. Surgeon General, fewer than one-third of Americans meet Federal recommendations to engage in at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity 5 days a week. Even more disturbing is the fact that approximately 300,000 American deaths a year are associated with obesity. By promoting biking, we are working to ensure that Americans, young and old, will increase their physical activity.  In my home State of Maine, citizen activists have led the way in encouraging their fellow Mainers to use bicycling as an alternative mode of transportation. Founded in 1992, the Bicycle Coalition of Maine, BCM, has grown substantially in its first decade plus of operation. In 1996, when BCM hired its current executive director, Jeffrey Miller, the organization had 200 individual and family memberships. Today, it has over 1,700. For a State of less than 1.3 million residents--many of them elderly--BCM's broad membership is especially impressive.  Over the years, this group has advocated increased bicycle access to Maine's roads and bridges, organized the first ``Bike to Work Day'' in our State, initiated bicycle safety education in our classrooms--teaching more than 60,000 schoolchildren in over 500 Maine schools--and produced ``Share the Road'' public service announcements for television stations statewide, among numerous other accomplishments.  No matter how energetic, committed, and organized BCM and other bicycle activists are, however, these groups cannot accomplish their mission alone. There is an important role for Government to play in encouraging more individuals to make bicycling their alternative mode of transportation. In Maine, BCM has built strong, active partnerships with local governments and the State's Department of Transportation. These key relationships have benefitted bicyclists throughout Maine and, in doing so, have encouraged more Mainers to ride their bikes on a regular basis. Indeed, more than 4 percent of Maine's commuters currently bike or walk, ranking the State 14th in that category nationwide. I believe the Federal Government needs to become more engaged in encouraging bicycling as a means of alternative transportation, and the Conserve by Bike Act would contribute to the worthy goal of convincing more Americans to travel by bicycle.  The Senate is already on record in support of this bill. In the previousCongress, during consideration of the Energy bill, identical legislation was accepted by voice vote as an amendment. I urge my colleagues to maintain their support for the Conserve by Bike Act.                                 ______                                       By
