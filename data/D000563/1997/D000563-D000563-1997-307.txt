President, people often ask their elected officials, ``If smoking is so dangerous, why does Congress subsidize tobacco?'' Today, my colleagues Senator Gregg of New Hampshire and Senator Lautenberg of New Jersey are joining me in introducing legislation that will give my colleagues an answer to this question.  The Tobacco Subsidy Reduction Act of 1997 ends the largest direct federal subsidy of tobacco. Specifically, this legislation prohibits the federal government from offering crop insurance or providing crop insurance subsidies for tobacco. For consistency, it also prohibits payments for tobacco under the Non-Insured Disaster Assistance Program, an alternative risk management program created in the 1996 Farm Bill for crops not eligible for the crop insurance program. I ask that the full text of the legislation appear in the Record following my statement.  Tobacco growing and processing is one of the most lucrative industries in America. To protect their profits despite the health dangers of their product, tobacco growers created the ``no net cost'' price support program. But a variety of taxpayer subsidies to tobacco remain, including crop insurance, extension services, and other programs assisting tobacco production and sales.  Last year, the federal government spent $98 million on tobacco-related subsidies and programs. These costs include $68 million for crop insurance losses beyond the premiums tobacco farmers paid, and $11 million for overhead costs of administering the crop insurance program for tobacco crops. This year, federal tobacco-related subsidies are estimated to amount to $67 million, including $48 million related to crop insurance.  In an era of tight budgets, there are better uses for this money. It makes no budgetary sense to subsidize a crop that causes an enormous amount of disease, disability, and death.  This amendment will not affect the tobacco price support program, so it will not drive any tobacco farmers out of business. It will merely get the federal government out of the business of paying for these specific subsidies for this deadly crop.  Cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products kill more than 400,000 Americans every year of cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses. These products also disable hundreds of thousands of other Americans through emphysema and other respiratory illnesses. It's time to take another step toward getting the federal government out of this business.  I invite my colleagues to cosponsor the Tobacco Subsidy Reduction Act and tell their constituents that they are working to cut government tobacco subsidies.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 643       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 to establish standards for relationships between group health plans and health insurance issuers with enrollees, health professionals, and providers; to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.               the patient access to responsible care act  Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I am introducing this bill in an effort to protect the vast majority of patients in this country. Currently, in order to control the cost of health care, managed care organizations often place limits on the delivery of necessary medical services. I believe American families must be guaranteed basic health rights when dealing with HMOs and managed care providers. The bottom line in medicine must be the health of the patient, not the profits of any given company. This legislation, the Patient Access to Responsible Care Act, will meet this obligation.  With this Act, I seek to establish basic protections for patients and health care providers in order to ensure the best medical care for patients. I envision these basic provisions giving Americans a set of health rights, in the form of a Patients' Bill of Rights, when dealing with HMOs and other health insurance plans. These rights include:  The Right to Choose Your Own Doctor. This bill will allow patients to select their own doctors within their plan and change their selection of doctor as the patient feels necessary. It also gives patients, who are in managed care-only health plans, the option to see doctors outside their HMOs for an additional fee.  The Right to Quality Health Care. This legislation will ensure that doctors are not prohibited or limited in any way from discussing a patient's health status, treatment options or any other medical communications. It also stops HMOs from using financial incentives for doctors to deny or limit care to patients. We must make sure that health care decisions are based on sound medical criteria and not the financial bottom line.  The Right to Justice. This Act closes loopholes in current law that allow the vast majority of health insurance plans to escape legal responsibility for decisions causing needless injury or death to a patient. Currently, self-insured managed care plans cannot be held liable for a patient's wrongful death or personal injuries resulting from plan policies even when those policies directly contributed to the patient's death or injury. This is wrong and this bill would guarantee that if HMO policies hurt patients, the HMO will be held accountable for their actions.  In addition, within a patient's health plan, this bill guarantees patients can quickly and easily appeal adverse decisions by their manage care plans. We've heard too many horror stories of patients who have been denied treatment by a health plans' policy. In addition, the appeals process is too bureaucratic and lengthy, sometimes resulting in tragic consequences. We must always put the quality of patient care first.  The Right to Full Disclosure. This bill also provides that health insurance plans make available to each patient a list of what health care is covered, what are the plans costs and profits, and how much is the plan spending on marketing and other non-medical costs. This is a sort of ``truth-in-lending'' statement for health plans.  When I first considered introducing this Patients' Bill of Rights, I was concerned about how prevalent a need there was for this type of legislation. I quickly found numerous instances where patients were suffering adverse outcomes from poor medical decisions made by managed care companies. The most publicized recent case is Corcoran versus United Health Care. In this case, Ms. Corcoran, a Louisiana woman with a high risk pregnancy, was admitted to a hospital under her physician's orders. She was discharged from the hospital after her health plan refused to pay for her care. The health plan would only authorize a visiting nurse to check on the woman at home. At one point, when the nurse was absent, the unborn child went into distress and died. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit ruled that the woman had no right to sue the HMO for damages because the insurance plan was governed under ERISA laws. These laws preempt state insurance laws allowing patients to seek due process. Americans cannot expect health care with this type of managed health care.  As I said before, there are numerous instances where managed care is revealed to be ruled by a company's profits. In New York, a diabetic developed an infection in his foot that had become gangrenous and had spread all the way to his groin. Almost his entire leg was infected and the blood vessels clogged. His doctor, a cardio-vascular specialist, feared that the gentleman could lose his foot if treatment was not initiated immediately. So, as a responsible physician, he admitted his patient to the hospital where he was immediately treated with intravenous antibiotics to combat the infection. Once in the hospital, the gentleman's HMO contacted the doctor to find out how long he anticipated the hospital stay would be. Since the man had clogged blood vessels and had to undergo a vascular bypass in order to be treated, the doctor estimated a stay between 10 and 15 days.  Upon learning this, an HMO official went to the gentleman's hospital room, and without even notifying the doctor, told the man that ``he could watch Oprah and be treated as well from home with a visiting nurse.'' The gentleman's doctor repeatedly argued with the HMO that it was not medically safe to release his patient from the hospital. But, with fluid still draining from his wounds and the doctor still protesting against the early discharge, the gentleman was sent home just a week after being admitted. The next day, the HMO sent a nurse--not a cardiovascular specialist or even a doctor, but a nurse--to his home to evaluate his condition and to show his wife how to change the dressing covering his wounds. With this state of affairs, the man eventually required surgery. With the early discharge and the lack of responsible care on the part of the HMO, the surgery had to be postponed because the patient's blood had become too thin to safely perform surgery.  In Georgia, a 2-year old boy was suffering from a high fever which did not respond to medication. His parents followed the insurance company's instructions for pre-authorization of emergency room care and attempted to drive 42 miles to the preferred hospital. The couple passed five emergency rooms along the way. Before they could reach the preferred hospital, their son went into cardiac arrest and stopped breathing. The child slipped into a coma, developed gangrene in his extremities, and subsequently lost his arms and legs to amputation.  In California, a young girl was diagnosed with Wilm's tumor, a rare childhood kidney cancer. The families new HMO required that the girl's surgery be performed by a surgeon within the managed care plan. None of the plan's surgeons had any experience with Wilm's tumor. The family chose to use an expert surgeon outside of the plan who had a proven track record with this type of tumor. The surgery was a success and the child has fully recovered. However, the HMO denied coverage for going outside of their system causing the family to enter a 2 year legal battle with the plan. In the first ever enforcement action against an HMO for a patient complaint, the state imposed a $500,000 fine against the plan for denying appropriate medical care.  In Colorado, a 75-year old woman was diagnosed with Kidney Cancer, but her plan refused to authorize surgery to remove the kidney and tumor of such an elderly woman. The plan only relented and allowed the surgery to be performed when a Congressman finally intervened on her behalf. The lady's cancer is now in full remission.  In Texas, a 17-year old Texas girl was critically injured in a head-on car crash that left her with severe head trauma, a broken back, a crushed pelvis, and numerous other injuries. Sheeventually pulled through, but her health plan refused to pay $40,000 of her hospital bill because her family had not received ``prior authorization'' for her emergency admission to the hospital--even though the hospital was a preferred provider for the plan.  These stories are not isolated incidents. They do not happen just in New York and Georgia, but across the nation. They speak for the thousands of patients across the country who have been denied access to the responsible care they need and deserve.  Mr. President, I believe it would be beneficial for my colleagues if I summarized what rights this bill will provide for patients across the country and how this bill meets those rights.  First of all, we are trying to increase patient access to plans and doctors. Patients, including those in under served inner-city and rural areas, are ensured their choice of doctor within the plan. The bill will ensure that health plans have enough doctors to guarantee this choice. Patients will also have access to any specialist required by their medical condition within the plan. In addition, patients are to have emergency health care without the burden of seeking prior approval from their health plan.  Also in this Act, patients will have an expanded choice of health care providers inside and outside of the network. People can either go through the network, or choose a plan that allows them to go out of the network, although at a higher cost. They will be allowed to select their own personal doctors within their plan and change their selection as the patient feels necessary. Patients will also be given the option to choose a health insurance plan that covers health care options not offered in the network. The managed care plan would reimburse the costs of these services based on rates consistent with those negotiated under the plan. Patients would be responsible for any remaining costs.  This bill will include a prohibition on gag rules. Patients are ensured that the health plan will not in any way limit doctors from discussing the patient's health status, treatment options or any other medical communication. Health plans can not offer any incentives, financial or otherwise, for doctors to deny or limit any health care.  In addition, this Bill of Rights forces HMOs to be responsible for their decisions. Currently, HMOs can not be held liable for wrongful death or personal injury suffered by the medical decision making policies of the plan, action may only be brought against the doctor and the hospital. Even if the HMO or the plan had in place a policy which directly contributed to death or injury of a patient, they are protected. This bill changes that by ensuring that managed care plans are held responsible for any medical decisions that they make. This bill says that if you make a medical decision, no matter who you are, you will be responsible for your actions. ERISA was never intended to be used as a shield for health plans providing negligent medical care. Also, there will be a provision providing due process on patient appeals claims made to their heath plans. Within the plan, patients will be guaranteed the ability to quickly and easily appeal adverse decisions.  The act will establish an information disclosure provision allowing patients to make informed decisions about which health plan would be best for them. This is a sort of ``Truth in Lending'' statement for HMO's. Every health plan will be required to disclose information about plan benefits, appeals procedures, plan performance measures, history of patient satisfaction, as well as the number and type of health care providers participating in the network. Based on this information, patients will be guaranteed the ability to make informed decisions about the quality of their health care and the managed care companies they choose from.  In addition, there will be doctor and patient protections from discrimination. The provision allows any doctor who meets a clear set of standards the opportunity to be a member of any managed care plan. In addition, patients will not be discriminated against based on their personal background or preexisting conditions, such as long-term and costly diseases.  Mr. President, we have an obligation to set minimum health care standards in the private sector to protect American families and ensure they have access to quality health care. We cannot allow the profits of the company to get in the way of patient health.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.
