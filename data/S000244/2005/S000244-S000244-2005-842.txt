Chairman, I rise in support of the Berman-Delahunt amendment. All it does is require a report to Congress on data mining by agencies.  Let me say why this is important. At the end of the last decade, before 9/11 and before the PATRIOT Act was even considered, the FBI had set up a data-mining operation that went far beyond criminal and intelligence investigations and compromised the privacy of literally millions of Americans, and this was done without the knowledge of the Congress of the United States, and it was only as a result of the fact that it did not work and they wasted all of this money that the Congress found out about it.  So I think that before any of the agencies go down this route, there ought to be at least a tip-off to the Members of Congress. I grant the Members that the amendment probably is not properly drafted and we can fix this in conference, and I appreciate the commitment of the chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence to do that, but I do not think we should turn it down and send a message to the agencies that they can data mine all they want and we are not going to do anything about it.
