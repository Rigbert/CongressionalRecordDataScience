Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time to close.  Mr. Chairman, this has been a long day, a long night, and an early morning. I think the quality of debate, for the most part, has been very good. I think there has been respect on not only both sides of the aisle, but there has been a bipartisanship of action. On behalf, I think, of all of us, I want to congratulate the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Meehan) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays). Whether we agree or disagree with either one of them, they have fought a long and good fight. They have kept the faith with their principles and their premises, and I think that they have acted in the highest traditions of legislators seeking to put forward policies to make their country better. I, on behalf of all of us, want to thank both the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Shays) and the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Meehan) for their work.  We now end this debate. As I said at the beginning, if we adopt this amendment, we essentially start over. At least eight times we have made a determination not to do this. This is the ninth time. Let us once again say that we are prepared to move. We are prepared to act. We are prepared to take a step in reforming campaign finance reform. We are prepared to take a step to raise the confidence of Americans that their representatives, their government, their policies that are adopted by all of us are theirs.  This is an historic night. Rarely do we have the opportunity to vote on such significant historical change. I ask my colleagues to vote ``no'' on Ney-Wynn and to vote ``yes'' for final passage of Shays-Meehan.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a substitute offered by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the ayes appeared to have it.                             Recorded Vote
