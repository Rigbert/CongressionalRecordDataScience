Speaker, I am pleased to introduce today the Aquaculture Employment Investment Act. This bill is based upon legislation I sponsored last Congress with my colleague from Massachusetts, Representative Studds.  Aquaculture represents a promising economic development opportunity for the State of Rhode Island. At the turn of the century, Rhode Island shellfishermen harvested so much shellfish from Narragansett Bay that this harvest would be worth almost $1 billion at today's prices.  The bill I am introducing today attempts to foster economic growth and create jobs by encouraging aquaculture development in our lakes and coastal areas. The Aquaculture Employment Act amends the Coastal Zone Management Act [CZMA] to authorize grants to States to formulate, administer, and implement strategic plans for marine aquaculture. This provision would enable States like Rhode Island that have no comprehensive plan for aquaculture development to get started in the process of creating jobs and economic development through aquaculture.  The legislation also creates a grant program modeled after a shellfish seeding program operating in Nantucket. Under this program, funds would be made available to States to expand ongoing projects relating to aquaculture, such as the State quahog transplant operations. By transplanting clams from high bacteria areas of Narragansett Bay to clean areas of the Bay, the clams are given the opportunity to clean themselves and eventually be ready for harvest.  This is not to say that development of a marine aquaculture industry will be easy. Difficult issues such as private use of public resources, conflicts with other coastal user groups, and the development of streamlined regulatory and permitting requirements will have to be addressed.  Other nations around the world have already recognized the potential of aquaculture and the important role that government can play in developing this industry. The governments of Japan, Norway, and Chile are supporting aquaculture development programs, and giving their citizens the opportunity to reap the accompanying economic rewards. In fact, these countries are exporting their aquaculture harvests of fish and shellfish to America.  This bill calls for a modest commitment of Federal resources, but it does not take a large Federal investment to join marine aquaculture and economic development. I urge my colleagues to join with me in support of its passage.                          ____________________
