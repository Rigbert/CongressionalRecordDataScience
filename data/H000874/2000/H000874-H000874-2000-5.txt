Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, very frankly, the majority party has put a kinder, gentler face on what it has done over the last 8 months. That kinder, gentler, principled face is the face of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), the chairman of our Committee, the Committee on Appropriations; and like the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey), I have no quarrel with the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young).  The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) said the Democrats were not included in the appropriations process, in the Committee on Appropriations, in the Commerce, Justice, State.  I will say, on my committee, that the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) and I dealt together openly. The shame of it was that the Republicans on the Committee on Appropriations were not always included in the appropriations negotiation. That is one of the problems, one of the significant problems.  Mr. Speaker, 9 days ago, the majority whip, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) came on this House floor and made some interesting and, I believe, incredible statements. He said this Congress, the 106th Congress, is one of the most productive Congresses in recent history. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) said that flipping through a document that apparently listed bills that were approved by this Congress and signed into law by President Clinton. I did not see that document, none of us did.  Mr. Speaker, there is one thing that I can tell my colleagues with certainty, there was no meaningful patients' bill of rights in it. There was no Medicare prescription drug benefit in it. There was no targeted tax relief in it. There was no real campaign finance reform in it; and there was no school modernization, class-size reduction, and teacher quality initiative in that document. No, not one of those pressing critical issues which show on my colleagues polls and our polls as being the Americans focus.  As a matter of fact, my colleague, the gentlewoman from Maryland (Mrs. Morella), has an ad running today on TV that I saw this morning that she is for patients' bill of rights, for school construction, for campaign finance reform; the only thing that ad lacked was a tag line of vote Democratic.  The bills that the majority in this Congress has refused to pass could go on and on.  Then, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) charged, and again I quote, ``We remain here today because some people simply will not support the principles of fiscal discipline.'' Hooey. I am pretty sure he was not talking about the Members on this side of the aisle, but now we know the truth.  Those are precisely the people who should have been listening. If nothing else, this do-nothing 106th Congress has finally debunked the myth of the free-spending Democrat and unmasked the fiscally irresponsible Republicans and who they are.  This majority has wasted the last 2 years trying to enact a tax scheme that would drain the entire projected budget surplus over the next decade and threatened to eat into that portion of the surplus set aside for Social Security and Medicare.  Mr. Speaker, now, they are loading up spending bills at funding level over and above what the President requested in his budget.  As the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt), my good friend, pointed out earlier this week, the nine appropriations conference reports to date provide outlays that exceed the President's 2001 budget by $11.4 billion. None of them could pass. None of them could get to the President without the majority party's support.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) also noted that the 106th Congress is on track to increase spending on nondefense appropriations, and we ought to listen to this. We ought to listen to this figure, and I see the gentleman from Western Maryland, (Mr. Barrett), my colleague, that the majority is going to pass, yes, the President can veto and my colleagues can say, gee, whiz, we could not get our way. I understand that.  Mr. Speaker, I am talking about what my colleagues are going to pass and send to him.  The gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Spratt) noted that the 106th Congress is on track to increase spending on nondefense appropriations at the fastest growth rate, 5.2 percent, since the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 was enacted. The House is going to pass, not the President is going to sign and propose, the House is going to pass the largest increase in domestic discretionary spending since 1974.  Since enactment of the Budget Act, nondefense appropriations have grown an average of 2.1 percent when Republicans controlled the House, and only 1.2 percent, half of that, per year when Democrats controlled the House. That does not comport with the facts that my colleagues would like to portray. Those are the facts, and my colleagues can check with your CBO on whether I am inaccurate.  So tell me, who needs a lecture on fiscal discipline? I do not think there is a soul in this House who does not understand why our budget process is broken down this year and why this eighth continuing resolution is necessary.  The Republican majority insisted, not the appropriators, not the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations or the 13 cardinals, insisted on passing a phony budget resolution last spring that turned our appropriations process into a sham.  As The Washington Post stated, and I quote, ``The Republicans continue to insist on a make-believe fiscal policy. The familiar fable is that they can cut taxes, finance the boomers' old age and increase defense and selected other spending while maintaining fiscal discipline.''  Mr. Speaker, it cannot be done. It has not been done, and it is a shame.                              {time}  1000
