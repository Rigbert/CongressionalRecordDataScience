 President, let me read briefly from a letter from Bayer. Bayer uses tremendous quantities of energy, and it relies extensively on natural gas and oil as both fuel and feed stock. It has had a 300-percent surge in the open market cost of natural gas since early in 2000.  The letter goes on to say:       Volatile crude oil prices have increased the cost of      feedstock by as much as 100 percent.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            Bayer Corporation,                                    Pittsburgh, PA, April 2, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write on behalf of Bayer, the      world's largest producer of both synthetic rubber and      polyurethane systems and a major U.S. exporter with more than      23,000 employees in the United States.       Please act promptly to advance a comprehensive national      energy policy and strategy that promotes high environmental      standards and a diverse, flexible energy supply at globally      competitive prices.       Our polymers and chemicals businesses use tremendous      quantities of energy and rely extensively on natural gas and      oil as both fuel and feedstock. In this way, our $10 billion      U.S. company is representative of a major segment of the      economy. The $460 billion business of chemistry is the      largest exporting sector in the country, accounting for ten      cents out of every dollar in U.S. exports. At Bayer      Corporation, one out of every five jobs depends on our $2      billion export business. We cannot fight with both hands tied      behind our back, one already tied by the strong dollar, now      the other by high energy costs.       The 300-percent surge in the open-market cost of natural      gas since early in 2000 has dramatically affected business.      Volatile crude oil prices have increased the cost of      feedstock by as much as 100 percent.       Passing these costs along to our customers in the      appliance, automotive, construction and other markets is not      a viable, long-term solution. Rather it is a bleak, zero-sum      game for the U.S. economy.       We are doing our part by aggressively pursuing policies to      conserve energy and otherwise raise efficiency through      measures such as co-generation. Even so, we need your help in      bringing about a rational approach to the energy needs of the      world's largest, single-nation economy.       I urge you to please speak out on this matter and act      immediately.       Please do not hesitate to contact me if you would like      additional information about Bayer's perspective on energy      policy.           Sincerely,                                                Helge H. Wehmeier,                            President and Chief Executive Officer.
