Speaker, lobbying reform needs to be enacted now. If there is any delay, it may be another 40 years before anything gets done.   The United We Stand organization has written all of us that amendments on this bill should be opposed so that lobbying reform does not get caught up again in legislative gridlock. My colleagues Smith, Bryant, Canady, Frank, and others have argued passionately and convincingly that amendments would only mean that once again the enemies of lobbying reform would prevail. This is why I chose to oppose any amendments to this legislation.  I do want to emphasize, however, that under any other circumstances, I would support the Fox amendment to prohibit lobbyists from giving gifts to Members of Congress. Already, as of January 1, 1996, Members will be prohibited from accepting gifts, and we ought to make this a two-way street.  Additionally, I would strongly support Representative English's amendment which would impose a lifetime ban on the Secretary of Commerce and the Commissioner of the International Trade Commission from lobbying for a foreign interest.  Representative Canady has promised that these amendments will be brought up in a second piece of legislation. I intend to be a part of the effort to move these amendments and will work for their passage.  While I think there are many ways to further improve lobbying reform legislation, it is time to end the gridlock on lobbying reform. The time is now. The place is here. At long last, let's send a lobbying reform bill to the President.
