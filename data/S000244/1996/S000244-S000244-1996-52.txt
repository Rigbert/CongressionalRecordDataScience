Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Sam Gibbons, who has distinguished himself over the past 34 years in the House of Representatives through outstanding service to the people of the United States.  Mr. Gibbons is a World War II hero who parachuted into Normandy on D-day as part of the 101st Airborne. After serving his country in the war, he began his political career while practicing law.  Mr. Gibbons entered the Florida State House in 1952; 6 years later, he was elected to the State senate. For the past 34 years, hehad admirably served in the House of Representatives for the Tampa area.  Mr. Gibbons' legislative successes include floor-managing President Lyndon Johnson's antipoverty package, which contained Head Start and other programs.  Throughout his years in public service, Sam Gibbons has been an unwavering advocate for the least fortunate in our society. He has admirably remained true to his values and principles even in the face of sharp opposition and criticism.  On behalf of the citizens of Wisconsin's ninth district, we thank Mr. Sam Gibbons for his outstanding service.
