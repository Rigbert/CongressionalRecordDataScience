 1790. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to increase the penalties for the manufacture, distribution, and possession of marijuana, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.               THE ENHANCED MARIJUANA PENALTY ACT OF 1996 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we are losing the battle against illegal drugs. All indicators point to a dramatic surge in drug use, especially by our most vulnerable citizens--children.  The President's 1996 drug strategy sent to Congress just a few weeks ago contains some very disturbing information:  Marijuana use is back on the rise, and among young people between the ages of 12 and 17, the use of marijuana has almost doubled between 1992 and 1994. One of every three high school seniors now smokes marijuana;  The number of heroin-related emergency room episodes in 1993 was double what it was in 1988, and for cocaine, emergency room episodes in 1994 were the highest ever;  Methamphetamine, once confined to the West and Southwest, is a scourge spreading across the country, including my own State of Kentucky. Last year, law enforcement officials seized five methamphetamine labs in Kentucky; in 1994, there were no such seizures;  Unless we tackle the drug problem anew, we risk producing a new generation of drug abusers. And the consequences of drug abuse are frightening: the spread of diseases like hepatitis, TB and HIV; social deviancy; lost productivity at the workplace; and a lot more crime, in particular violent crime.  Our Nation's drug problem is compounded by a lax attitude within segments of the enforcement agencies responsible for our antidrug laws. Recently, the Los Angeles Times reported that Immigration and Customs officials are handing out get-out-of-jail-free cards and letting drug dealers go unprosecuted.  Non-United States nationals are sent back to Mexico instead of being prosecuted. And, American citizens are being let go if it's their first offense or if the quantities of drugs aren't big enough. So, one pusher with 32 pounds of methamphetamine was set free and another with 37,000 quaaludes. One American was stopped at the border with 53 pounds of marijuana in January, 51 pounds in February and 41 pounds in May. He's only being prosecuted for this third offense, although he has a criminal history going back four decades.  It's not surprising that a President whose policy is ``don't inhale'' gives us a ``don't enforce'' antidrug policy.  This is simply unacceptable. It's evidence of an administration AWOL--absent without leadership.  Today, I am introducing a bill to increase the penalties for trafficking in marijuana, a drug that poses a grave threat to our young people. It is commonly known that marijuana impairs short-term memory, core motor functions and the ability to concentrate. But it also has long-term devastating effects:  Marijuana use causes chronic bronchitis, acute chest illness, heightened risk of pulmonary infection and lung disease;  Prenatal exposure to marijuana causes impaired intellectual ability in young children; in shorthand--low IQ babies; and  THC, the principal psychoactive ingredient, has been found in lab rats to be addictive.  And, who is smoking marijuana? Kids, more of them and at younger ages. The number of 12- to 17-year-olds using marijuana increased from 1.6 million in 1992 to 2.9 million in 1994. As the chart shows, more 8th, 10th, and 12th-graders are smoking marijuana and there is no indication that this trend is going to be reversed anytime soon.  A surprising fact is that more children smoke marijuana than have smoked five packs of cigarettes, as the second chart reveals. Five-point-seven percent of 12- to 15-year-olds report smoking cigarettes, but 6.6 percent report smoking marijuana. For older teens even more are smoking marijuana--20.5 percent smoke cigarettes and 26.1 percent smoke marijuana.  That is an astounding statistic: Teens are less likely to smoke cigaretts than marijuana, and fewer teens say smoking marijuana is risky. As young people soften their attitudes toward drugs, usage increases.  Not only is marijuana harmful in and of itself, but it is considered a gateway drug. Teenagers who use marijuana are 85 times more likely to use cocaine. Sixty percent of children who smoke marijuana before age 15 move on to cocaine.  My bill is very straightforward. It enhances the penalties for trafficking in marijuana. Current law creates a disparity in the mandatory minimums for heroin, cocaine and marijuana. My bill will eliminate the disparity by lowerng the threshold for the mandatory minimum sentences for refined marijuana. The third chart reflects the disparities.  Currently, an individual has to be caught with 1,000 kilos of marijuana, with a street value of as much as $10 million, in order to get the 10-year mandatory minimum. For cocaine, the threshold quantity and street value is much lower--only 5 kilos with a value between $420,000 and $750,000. For heroin, the threshold is 1 kilo, with a street value of $1.2 million. And growing 1,000 marijuana plants gets you the same 10-year mandatory minimum.  My bill will bring the threshold quantity for refined marijuana into line with the other drugs by lowering it from 1,000 kilos to 100 kilos for the 10-year mandatory minimum and from 100 kilos to 10 kilos for the 5-year mandatory minimum.  The bill also directs the Sentencing Commission to conform its guidelines to this change.  Last summer, this Sentencing Commission effectively lowered the penalties for marijuana trafficking, for quantities less than the thresholds for mandatory minimums. It's time we reversed that misguided action and this bill will ensure that the Sentencing Commission does just that.  Some will argue that prosecutors have more pressing matters than to chase every marijuana dealer selling as little as 10 kilos. As the Los Angeles Times reported, Federal prosecutors in southern California don't think it's worth their effort to prosecute for quantities of less than 125 pounds, an amount that should get a drug trafficker about 3 years in a Federal prison.  But I would argue just the opposite. Marijuana is doing irreparable harm to our kids and we've got to put the people who sell to our children out of business and behind bars. Ten kilos of marijuana is 22 pounds, with a street value of about $100,000. That amount of marijuana will reach a lot of teenagers in small, but harmful quantities.  Mr. President the time has come to admit that we have a serious marijuana problem among our teens. I say it's worth protecting the future of our children by locking up the pushers. Let's toughen the penalties and send a message to the drug dealers that we won't tolerate it anymore. And let's tell Federal prosecutors it's their job to send these outlaws to prison. What can be worth more than saving our next generation?  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1790       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Enhanced Marihuana Penalty      Act of 1996''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds that--       (1) the number of children in the United States between 12      and 17 years of age using marihuana increased from 1,600,000      in 1992 to 2,900,000 in 1994, which constitutes an 80-percent      increase;       (2) currently, one-third of all high school seniors smoke      marihuana;       (3) the perception of the dangers of using marihuana is      declining among youthful marihuana smokers;       (4) scientific research has demonstrated that--       (A) marihuana impairs short-term memory, core motor      functions, and the ability to concentrate;       (B) THC, the principal psychoactive ingredient of      marihuana, may cause drug dependency;       (C) regular marihuana use may cause chronic bronchitis,      increased frequency of acute chest illness, heightened risk      of pulmonary infection, and lung disease; and       (D) prenatal exposure to marihuana may cause impaired      intellectual ability in young children;       (5) children between the agency of 12 and 17 who use      marihuana are 85 times more likely to use cocaine than      children who do not use marihuana;       (6) there are 39,000,000 children in the United States who      are younger than 10 years old, and neglect of our Nation's      marihuana problem will lead to the creation of a new      generation of drug abusers, prone to criminal and other      socially deviant behavior; and       (7) existing penalties for trafficking in marihuana are      inadequate to deter those who sell marihuana to our Nation's      most vulnerable citizens.
