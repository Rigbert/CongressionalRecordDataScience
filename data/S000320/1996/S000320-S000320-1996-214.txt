 President, this amendment amends section 636 of the bill which provides authority for agencies to provide assistance to agents who secure liability insurance. This amendment will provide this authority to the State Department if it chooses to provide the same assistance to special agents of the Department of State's Diplomatic Security Service.  It is my understanding that it has been cleared on both sides of aisle.
