 Sure, you can do things more cheaply, but the idea and the bedrock of Davis-Bacon is we pay skilled workers a living wage that is the prevailing wage in the local area. The committee has never passed an amendment gutting Davis-Bacon, despite many attempts on the committee. I feel that this would, unfortunately--the way the gentleman has just phrased it, says it is silent on the issue--undermine Davis-Bacon, and, therefore, I would oppose the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
