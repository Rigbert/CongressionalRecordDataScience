 President, I rise today to state that I object to proceeding to the consideration of two executive nominees to the Department of Justice. The first nominee is Mr. Christopher A. Wray, who is nominated to be the assistant attorney general of the criminal division at the Department of Justice. The second nominee to which I object is Mr. Jack Landman Goldsmith III, who is nominated to be assistant attorney general, office of legal counsel at the Department of Justice.  I have placed holds on these individuals because I have numerous outstanding issues that have yet to be resolved by the Department of Justice. More specifically, I have several outstanding written requests before the Department of Justice. Some of these requests are more than 6 months overdue. In addition, I am presently working with the Department of Justice to overcome a number of procedural issues directly affecting my ability, as a member of the Judiciary Committee to, among other things, conduct oversight of the Department of Justice, and the Federal Bureau of Investigations.                          ____________________
