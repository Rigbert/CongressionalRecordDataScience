President, 2 minutes ago the distinguished Senator from Utah had made the suggestion, another unanimous consent request, that Senators bring up things even if Senators were not available on the other side of an issue to speak, and that that Senator be given equal time on Monday or sometime prior to the vote. I might ask the Chair, is there such a unanimous consent pending? Am I perhaps stating it too broadly?
