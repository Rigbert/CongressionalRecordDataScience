 President, I wanted to take a moment to note my vote for the amendment offered to H.R. 5441 by Senator Vitter. Senator Vitter's amendment would prohibit the U.S. Customs and Border Protection from using funds to prevent individuals from importing a prescription drug from Canada that complies with the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDCA.
