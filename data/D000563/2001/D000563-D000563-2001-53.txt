FITZGERALD. I would rather yield at the end, I say to my colleague, my good friend from Illinois.  State securities laws could come into play if there are airport bonds that are issued. If they had the effect of interfering with this, could they be overridden?  There are other States that are in this position, in fact, that have some State laws in this area. I have a chart. This chart was actually prepared for a different bill, H.R. 2107. That was an attempt by Congressman Lipinski in the House to preempt local and State laws regarding airport approval processes.  I believe there are a total of 26 States that have some control to give approval to local airport projects. Of course, Illinois is one of them, and all these other States--in fact, Mr. President, some of your neighboring States--Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Missouri, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Alaska, Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Tennessee, Alabama, Mississippi--they all have some State laws in this regard to regulate airports. In my judgment, it is a bad precedent for the Federal Government to begin overriding those laws. Perhaps some of those people in those State legislatures and some of the local permitting authorities know something about their local projects and we in Washington should not be substituting our judgment for their judgment.  I do not think it is a good idea we come in and blow out the laws of the State of Illinois that have been enacted by people duly elected to serve and represent their interests. We would be obliterating the say of the people in the Illinois General Assembly by enacting this measure.  Again, the mayor could have gone to the legislature to pass this plan, but he did not want to or he could not, so he came to Congress to wipe out the State's legislature law. At the heart of this legislation, more than anything else, is really an attack on the Illinois General Assembly, if you want my opinion.  If we turn to section 1(e) of the bill, this section indicates there is a fear on the part of the proponents that the mayor's expansion proposal will violate national air quality standards. Therefore, what this language does in section 1(e) of the bill is it will force the U.S. EPA to rewrite and weaken environmental regulations to keep them at the same strength by having some other industry in Illinois pay for it. Either that or it would just cause them to weaken their regulations altogether.  Section 1(e) reads as follows:       If the Administrator determines that construction or      operation of the runway redesign plan would not conform,      within the meaning of section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act, to      an applicable implementation plan approved or promulgated      under section 110 of the Clean Air Act, the Environmental      Protection Agency shall forthwith cause or promulgate a      revision of such implementation plan sufficient for the      runway redesign plan to satisfy the requirements of      section 176(c) of the Clean Air Act.  What does that mean? It means if Mayor Daley's runway redesign plan violates the Clean Air Act, then the EPA must weaken the Clean Air Act so the plan no longer violates the Clean Air Act, or they must, through their crediting process, put the burden on some other industry. Not many industries in Illinois are aware of that.  Right after that, we have section 1(g) that, again, refers to the ``south suburban airport.'' It says:       The term ``south suburban airport'' means a supplemental      air carrier airport in the vicinity of Peotone, Illinois.  Again, there is no definition. Is that a 6-runway or a 10-runway airport? We do not know. There have been different proposals, so I do not think this language is necessarily well done.  Section 2 of the bill is on phasing of construction. This bill suggests that, in fact, the city would be forbidden from beginning construction of the sixth runway until 2011. What that means is that prior to 2011, there will not be six parallel runways at O'Hare.  We have seven runways at O'Hare today. Prior to 2011, there will only be five parallel runways? Will we have less capacity at O'Hare until the sixth runway is finally built in 2011? It raises interesting questions. Western roadway access, again--and I had this colloquy with my colleague from Illinois. He disputes this, but I believe the language would require that the airport revenues be made available to pay for western public roadway access and revenues of the airport.  As the Presiding Officer would know, having been the chairman of Goldman Sachs, one of our country's leading investment banking firms, the revenues of the airport would include all their revenues, whatever source derived, whether passenger facility charges or airport improvement funds. They could apparently use airport improvement funds to help with the roadway project.       The Administrators shall not consider, and shall reject as      incomplete, an airport layout plan submitted by Chicago that      includes the runway redesign plan, unless it includes public      roadway access through the western boundary of O'Hare to      passenger terminal and parking facilities.  I do believe that roadway access would help with O'Hare. The problem is right now we have to build another terminal out there on the western side for it to be truly as valuable as it should be. There is a question as to where this roadway would go. It would be a massive roadway. Would it take out several villages, such as Elk Grove and other villages, in the area?  In fact, Mr. President, we have some maps that show some of the surrounding communities. We see the problems we get into when we start a massive plan such as this in a congested urban and suburban area.  That western ring road would be on the western boundary of O'Hare. It would go from I-90 presumably on the north down somewhere to Irving Park Road on the south.  I will point out that Elk Grove Village is there. The largest industrial park in the entire Nation is right abouthere. If this road goes through, it would take out perhaps 20 percent or more of the largest industrial park in the country. I do not favor that.  If they wanted to do the western access on airport property, I think I would favor that, but I would not favor this. Will we give Federal impetus to something that nobody in this body was intending, perhaps not even sponsored the language, and that is the destruction of a large portion of Elk Grove Village, IL?  I know Elk Grove Village, IL, very well. I represented that area when I was in the State senate. I represented the northwest suburbs. I know the mayor of Elk Grove is very concerned about losing the tax base in his village and hundreds of wonderful, strong businesses that use the industrial park.  There is a large section on noise mitigation, and I will address that section as well. There seems to be an attempt to address the noise concerns that would be created by this expansion program, but I think there is a trick. If we look at section (4)(b)(1), it says:       Approval by the administrator of an airport layout plan      that includes the runway redesign plan shall be subject to      the condition that noise impact of aircraft operations at      O'Hare in the calendar year immediately following the year in      which the first new runway is first used, and in each      calendar year thereafter, will be less than the noise impact      in calendar year 2000. The administrator shall make the      determination required by this section.  The trick is they are comparing today's fleet with a much quieter fleet in the future. It is not an apples to apples comparison. The apples to apples comparison would be to take the future fleet at the current level of operations and to compare that future fleet at the future level with the current level with the future fleet. So it gets complicated. What they are doing is clever but misleading.  I say to my constituents who are worried about that issue, there is not a lot to help them with their concern of the disruption in their life caused by this massive expansion plan. Of course, this expansion is in a very congested urban and suburban area with hundreds of thousands of people living in and around there, most of whom--our phones have been ringing off the hook--are opposed to this plan, but the Senate is being asked to approve this plan tonight.  I apologize for that because I do not think this is an appropriate bill, the Defense appropriations bill, and I regret that we have to be debating this specific issue tonight.  Section 5 of the bill pays lipservice to the south suburban airport issue. It says:       The administrator shall give priority consideration to a      letter of intent application submitted by the State of      Illinois or a political subdivision thereof for the      construction of the south suburban airport. This      consideration shall be given not later than 90 days after      final record of decision approving the airport layout plan      for the south suburban airport has been issued by the      administrator.  This has been billed and portrayed in Illinois as legislation that would actually move the ball forward with respect to the third airport. I suggest to my colleagues this language, in fact, kills the third airport in the south suburbs. The reason I say that is any airport funding for the south suburban airport would be, one, soaked up by the massive expansion at O'Hare and, two, all this language requires is the administrator give consideration to a letter of intent submitted by the State of Illinois.  The FAA is already going to consider the letter of intent submitted by the FAA. We do not need this language. They are already going to consider it. Maybe it would speed it up a little bit, but that is about all. There is no guarantee the third airport would be approved. In fact, I believe the justification for the third airport would vanish in light of the massive expansion of O'Hare. Again, the whole premise for the third airport was it is not feasible to expand O'Hare.  Make no mistake about it, everyone in Illinois should know this language is a Peotone killer. It is a backdoor way of ensuring the third south suburban airport will never be built in the State of Illinois.  There is no justification--no cost-benefit analysis would suggest the FAA should approve that plan once the massive expansion of O'Hare has been approved.  The next section, section 6, is a section I think should be of special concern to every Member in this body from every State in this country. This is the section that would require the Federal Government to construct this massive plan at O'Hare, which I have said I do not want, many Members of Congress in my State do not want, and the State legislature will not approve. The Senate will be asked to pay for it as a Federal project. That would be nice if the Chair would, for instance, give me his airport funds from Newark Airport to pay for this project, except I do not want this project.  I think every Member in this body should think long and hard whether they want their airport improvement funds to be sucked up by a massive O'Hare expansion plan, a $13 billion plan at least, in my judgment, something that I do not even want in my State, that is very controversial in my State.  What this language says is:       On July 1, 2004, or as soon thereafter as may be possible,      the administrator shall construct the runway redesign plan as      a Federal project, provided (1) the administrator finds,      after notice and opportunity for public comment, that a      continuous course of construction of the runway redesign plan      has not commenced and is not reasonably expected to commence      by December 1, 2004.  I am not sure whether those are the exact dates they are going to want, but that is the language Senator Durbin shared with me, and I appreciate that. He did not spring this language on me. He shared this with me. I called him yesterday and I asked him to fax the language he wanted to introduce in the conference committee. I compliment him for not taking me by surprise and for disclosing his intentions as to the conference report.  What that means is if there has not been a continuous course of construction on the runway redesign plan, then the Federal Government, the FAA, the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administrator, shall take this project over and shall construct a runway redesign plan as a Federal project. So all the taxpayers and all the other States would pay for it.  I love it when the Senate gives money to my State. Our State has not gotten its fair share of Federal funds over the years. I think we are doing a lot better. Thanks to the leadership of the Speaker of the House, who is from Illinois, we are doing better in that regard in recent years. I enjoy it when my colleagues are generous with money for my State, but this is a project I do not support. So I ask, please, do not take money out of your airports and deprive them of revenue to put into a project in my State that I do not support.  One of the interesting parts of this whole thing is if we go back to section (1)(c) of Senator Durbin's language, the first thing this bill really does is it preempts the Illinois Aeronautics Act.  The interesting thing about the bill, it goes on to say the city of Chicago shall not build the runway redesign plan, and if for some reason they did not, the Federal Government will step into its place and do it. But it can delegate those responsibilities, then, back to the city of Chicago.  Interestingly, under our State law, municipalities such as city of Chicago don't have any authority except from State law to operate its airports. That is where the city of Chicago gets its authority to operate O'Hare. They have it from the Illinois Aeronautics Act. But this Federal bill would obliterate the Illinois Aeronautics Act. How would Illinois or Chicago have the authority to even have the airport? Would O'Hare airport or the city of Chicago become a Federal reservation? It is not clear. Very unusual language, in my judgment.  I am sure the proponents, especially United and American, have a lot of employees, a lot of contractors and subcontractors, a lot of people who do work for them.  They have influential directorships, they are very active and involved in the community in Chicago. This is a bonanza for them because it blocks a third airport for generations to come and they would be assured, in my judgment, of not having any effective competition in the Chicago market from any other long-haul carriers for as long as the eye can see, as far as we can see into the future. In my judgment, this is not in the interests of the general public.  Once the legislature's granted authority is obliterated by this Federal legislation, then interestingly the city has no authority to build. The city would lose its legal authority to contract for an airport, so this is very curious language. That would point out that is exactly why we shouldn't be acting in the Senate as though we were the Illinois State Legislature. You get these problems, unintended consequences, when you start rewriting the Illinois Aeronautics Act or preempting it at the Federal level. You get all sorts of unintended consequences. It is not a good idea, in my judgment, to come in and rewrite a State act, especially on a Defense appropriations bill at 8:30 in the evening on Friday night when we should be debating defense amendments.  We have our troops on the ground in Afghanistan. This, clearly, isn't the appropriate forum to debate the propriety of the Illinois Aeronautics Act. Let the State legislature take up the Illinois Aeronautics Act when they get back into session next January.  Then if you go on--and the language is many pages long--if you go to the end, they do have the provision I support and that is keeping Meigs Field open in Chicago. I don't know if the President has ever flown in or out of Meigs Field, but it is a beautiful airport on the Chicago lakefront. The business community loves that airport. People are able to fly right into the heart of downtown Chicago. They are right in the city and can easily get to a meeting. It is a great general aviation airport. There is a provision that would do something to assist keeping Meigs Field open. I support that. It was regrettable the city of Chicago wanted to close Meigs Field.  I always thought that was a mistake. Meigs Field has handled as many as 50,000 flight operations a year. If it shuts down, you will put those flights into Midway and O'Hare--a large number of them, anyway--which will add to congestion at Midway and O'Hare.  I have always felt closing Meigs Field was inconsistent with alleviating air traffic congestion in the Chicago area. I was disappointed the city wanted to close it.  This backroom deal we are being asked to codify, which is under 48 hours old, and no specifics or financing or details or studies have been released to the general public back in Illinois, has been portrayed in the press as keeping Meigs Field open until January 1 of the year 2026. It appears to give it another 25 years. But they have a provision in here that would allow the Illinois General Assembly to close Meigs Field in 6 years.  Now, is this not odd? On the one hand, they take away, obliterate the State statute passed by the Illinois General Assembly, passed by all the State representatives and State senators in Illinois and enacted into law by the Governor, we are asked to obliterate one act, but on the other hand, we are writing a law that the State legislature in Illinois would have to comply with, and that is they can't shut Meigs Field down prior to January 1, 2006. But after January 1, 2006, Meigs Field could be shut down by the Illinois Legislature. In fact, it says in section (7)(4)(b):       The administrator shall not enforce the conditions      specified in subsection (a) if the State of Illinois enacts a      law on or after January 1, 2006, authorizing the closure of      Meigs Field.  So we are at the Federal level granting the State of Illinois the authority in Federal statute to close Meigs Field. However, we are taking away the Illinois General Assembly's authority to have anything to do with O'Hare. It is wildly inconsistent. There is no principle behind what they are doing. That is what you get with a backroom deal that is the product of people saying: I will scratch your back if you scratch mine.  We are being asked to put a secret backroom deal into Federal law.  Now, I get to the final section on judicial review. That is section 8. It says that what this is designed to do, as I read it--and I have to say I have not yet looked up title 49, United States Code, subtitle VII, part A, but I have a feeling what this is meant to do is basically to cut off the right of trial and to deprive anyone who would question this backroom deal; they would never get their day in court. So this section 8 curtails the judicial review and says you never get your day in court. If you want to challenge this deal, that is tough luck. What happens is you won't get a right of trial in the district court. You will have to go right to a court of appeals and the FAA will control all the facts below and you will get 20 minutes in a court of appeals and that is it.  This is a way of cutting off anybody who may object to this, cutting off their right to use their legal rights they might have. Those rights would be curtailed.  Going back to the safety issue, I have great concerns. I am concerned that two sets of parallel runways in the proposal of the new design at O'Hare would be too close together. My understanding is--and we only have what we know from news accounts because no details are released--there has not ever been a formal plan submitted to the FAA or to the State, so we don't have all the details. We have maps that have appeared in newspapers and the like. It is everybody's best guess as to what is in the backroom deal we are being asked to codify into Federal law tonight. But it looks, from what I understand of the information available to me, that these two sets of parallel runways on which they would like to have simultaneous takeoffs and landings would be only 1,300 feet apart. The FAA regulations require ordinarily, without a waiver, a 4,300 foot separation between runways.  Now, the problem with that is if a plane is landing in one direction and another taking off in another direction and a plane turns here, it could hit a plane coming into another runway. We are not cutting down the margin of error.  I can understand why they can't make a 4,300 foot separation between runways on this airport land in Chicago. They don't have enough room. O'Hare's footprint is only about 7,000 acres. They would try to take 500 homes in the city of Bensenville and displace those people and bulldoze their homes. They would be moving some roadways. Mr. President, you and other Senators might be paying for that out of your airport improvement funds under this language.  But the problem is they are trying to jam too much in here. There are only 7,000 acres. A newer airport--the third, south suburban airport in a location known as Peotone in Will County south of Cook County where Chicago is located--would be on 24,000 acres. There would be plenty of room to have parallel runways. They would be appropriately spaced.  We also talked about in addition to the runways being too close together, several of these--I don't know how far the distance is between 927-L, the arriving runway, and the south 927 runway. I don't know what that would be. I haven't even seen press accounts of what that would be. Again, there is no formal plan. All of these seem awfully close together.  In my judgment, we could be working against ourselves by going forward with a plan such as that. God forbid. If there ever were a problem that resulted by packing too many runways in too close, we would have made a horrible mistake.  Some Members of this body may believe they are capable of passing on the safety of a runway design plan. But I certainly can tell you that I don't have that expertise, and I suspect none of us really has the kind of engineering background and experience that would require. Maybe somebody here has that expertise, but I don't think so. That is why I don't think it is appropriate for us to enact into law a runway design plan. Never before has Congress, to my knowledge, enacted into Federal law a runway design plan. We allow this to go through a vetting process. We allow people to study and vet and test, and we get input from air traffic controllers, from pilots, from experts, and from engineers. They are the ones who need to come and give us their views on the propriety of such a layout.  You shouldn't be called upon, Mr. President, as the Senator from New Jersey, at a quarter to 9 on a Friday night, to decide whether this is a good runway design plan. Maybe it is, but maybe it isn't. Do you believe we can guarantee to the people of this country that in fact this is a safe design plan? I had an air traffic controller in my office this week who told me he had grave concerns that he thought this was an unsafe plan.  In fact, I have a letter, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record, dated November 30, 2001, from the facility representative of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     National Air Traffic Controllers Association,                                         Chicago O'Hare Tower,                             Chicago, Illinois, November 30, 2001.     Hon. Peter Fitzgerald,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Senator Fitzgerald, as requested from your staff, I have      summarized the most obvious concerns that air traffic      controllers at O'Hare have with the new runway plans being      considered by Mayor Daley and Governor Ryan. They are listed      below along with some other comments.       1. The Daley and Ryan plans both have a set of east/west      parallel runways directly north of the terminal and in close      proximity to one another. Because of their proximity to each      other (1200') they cannot be used simultaneously for      arrivals. They can only be used simultaneously if one is used      for departures and the other is used for arrivals, but only      during VFR (visual flight rules), or good weather conditions.      During IFR (instrument flight rules, ceiling below 1000' and      visibility less than 3 miles) these runways cannot be used      simultaneously at all. They basically must be operated as one      runway for safety reasons. The same is true for the set of      parallels directly south of the terminal; they too are only      1200' apart.       2. Both sets of parallel runways closest to the terminals      (the ones referred to above) are all a minimum of 10,000'      long. This creates a runway incursion problem, which is a      very serious safety issue. Because of their length and      position, all aircraft that land or depart O'Hare would be      required to taxi across either one, or in some cases two      runways to get to and from the terminal. This design flaw      exists in both the Daley and the Ryan plan. A runway      incursion is when an aircraft accidentally crosses a runway      when another aircraft is landing or departing. They are      caused by either a mistake or misunderstanding by the pilot      or controller. Runway incursions have skyrocketed over the      past few years and are on the NTSB's most wanted list of      safety issues that need to be addressed. Parallel runway      layouts create the potential for runway incursions; in fact      the FAA publishes a pamphlet for airport designers and      planners that urge them to avoid parallel runway layouts that      force taxiing aircraft to cross active runways. Los Angeles      International Airport has led the nation in runway incursions      for several years. A large part of their incursion problem is      the parallel runway layout; aircraft must taxi across runways      to get to and from the terminals.       3. The major difference in Governor Ryan's counter proposal      is the elimination of the southern most runway. If this      runway were eliminated the capacity of the new airport would      be less than we have now during certain conditions (estimated      at about 40 percent of the time). If you look at Mayor      Daley's plan, it calls for six parallel east-west runways and      two parallel northeast-southwest runways. The northeast-     southwest parallels are left over from the current O'Hare      layout. These two runways simply won't be usable in day-to-     day operations because of the location of them (they are      wedged in between, or pointed at the other parallels). We      would not use these runways except when the wind was very      strong (35 knots or above) which we estimate would be less      than 1 percent of the time. That leaves the six east/west      parallels for use in normal day-to-day operations. This is      the same number of runways available and used at O'Hare      today. If you remove the southern runway (Governor Ryan's      counter proposal), you are leaving us five runways which is      one less than we have now. That means less capacity than      today's O'Hare during certain weather conditions. With good      weather, you may get about the same capacity we have now. If      this is the case, then why build it?       4. The Daley-Ryan plans call for the removal of the NW/SE      parallels (Runways 32L and 32R). This is a concern because      during the winter it is common to have strong winds out of      the northwest with snow, cold temperatures and icy      conditions. During these times, it is critical to have      runways that point as close as possible into the wind.      Headwinds mean slower landing speeds for aircraft, and they      allow for the airplane to decelerate quicker after landing      which is important when landing on an icy runway. Landing      into headwinds makes it much easier for the pilot to control      the aircraft as well. Without these runways, pilots would      have to land on icy conditions during strong cross-wind      conditions. This is a possible safety issue.       These are the four major concerns we have with the Daley-     Ryan runway plans. There are many more minor issues that must      be addressed. Amongst them are taxiway layouts, clear zones      (areas off the ends of each runway required to be clear of      obstructions, ILS critical areas (similar to clear zones, but      for navigation purposes), airspace issues (how arrivals and      departures will be funneled into these runways) and all sorts      of other procedural type issues. These kinds of things all      have to go through various parts of the FAA (flight      standards, airport certification etc.) eventually. These      groups should have been involved with the planning portion      from day one. Air traffic controllers at the tower are well      versed on what works well with the current airport and what      does not. We can provide the best advice on what needs to be      accomplished to increase capacity while maintaining safety.      It is truly amazing that these groups were not consulted in      the planning of a new O'Hare. The current Daley--Ryan runway      plans, if built as publicized, will do little for capacity      and/or will create serious safety issues. This simply cannot      happen. The fear is that the airport will be built, without      our input, and then handed to us with expectations that we      find a way to make it work. When it doesn't, the federal      government (the FAA and the controllers) will be blamed for      safety and delay problems.           Sincerely.                                                    Craig Burzych,                     Facility Representative, NATCA--O'Hare Tower.
