Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that when the House adjourns today pursuant to this order, it adjourn to meet at 11 a.m. on Monday, December 26, 2005, unless it sooner has received a message from the Senate transmitting its adoption of House Concurrent Resolution 326, in which case the House shall stand adjourned sine die pursuant to that concurrent resolution.
