  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate proceeds to the bill, it be limited to energy-related amendments only; further, that the amendments be offered in an alternating fashion between the two sides; I further ask unanimous consent that the bill remain the pending business to the exclusion of all other business, other than privileged matters and other matters that the two leaders might agree upon.  Before the Chair rules, I would say to the other side that what this would do would be to allow us to have a debate on this issue consistent with the way we have dealt with this issue in the past, when it was not even the biggest issue in the country, as it is now, entirely consistent with the traditions of the Senate on matters of this magnitude.  I would say to my good friend from Nevada, what are we afraid of here? Why should we not be spending our time dealing with the most important issue in the country?  So, Mr. President, that is the consent request I proffer.
