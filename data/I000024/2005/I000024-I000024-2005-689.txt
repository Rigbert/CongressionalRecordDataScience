I observe we talked about this ``above the line/below the line.'' We plowed this furrow several times. However, when you get in conference, there are things that can be done. I can assure the Senator the State of Texas will be well represented in conference. I am sure we will hear proposals, and there will be some give and take in all areas.  Of course, we will be dealing with another whole body over there, so it is hard to predict what will come out. But we will try to get to it expeditiously and see that Texas--as I say, they will be well represented. I think we all understand that.  We are now waiting. We are, as I said before, down to about seven amendments.
