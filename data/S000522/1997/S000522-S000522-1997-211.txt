I thank my very good friend [Mr. Livingston], the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations, for yielding.  Mr. Chairman, just to respond briefly, nobody is holding any funds or money hostage. This is all about fundamental human rights and protecting the precious unborn children while simultaneously providing family planning.  Mr. Chairman, I want to make it very clear that the House will today consider two diametrically opposed pieces of legislation on family planning. While each is designed to release fiscal year 1997 family planning funds by March 1, that is where the similarity ends.  The Clinton resolution, introduced by request by the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Armey]--and I would note for the Record that Mr. Armey does not support the resolution--is strongly pro-abortion in its effect. Make no mistake about it, the consequence of approving the Clinton resolution is a fat payday for abortion providers. So please be fully aware of the unavoidable fact that if you vote for House Joint Resolution 36, you further empower, strengthen, and tangibly aid and abet the abortion industry overseas.  Know that a ``yes'' vote on House Joint Resolution 36 pours hundreds of millions of U.S. taxpayer dollars into organizations that have made the toppling of pro-life laws and policies in the developing countries their mission and their explicit goal. And know that once that they have succeeded in overturning those laws that protect the unborn child, once they have eviscerated the constitutional protections that are currently in place, these are the same folks who jump in with both feet to set up the abortion mills.  Who we subsidize, Mr. Chairman, not just what we subsidize, but who we subsidize does matter. It should matter greatly to each of us not just what an organization does with our specific donation, but the rest of their agenda as well. It is a package deal. This is especially important because money is fungible. What we give to a group immediately frees up other non-U.S. funds that can be used and in this case are used for performing and aggressively promoting abortion.  In recent months the Clinton administration has said that it does not promote abortion overseas. Oh, if that were only true. During Mr. Clinton's first term, my colleagues know and I know that his office pushed hard for an international right to abortion. At the 1994 U.N. Population Conference in Cairo, and especially at the preparatory meetings, known as PrepComs, leading up to the conference, the administration mounted a full court press for an international right to abortion.  A State Department March 1994 action cable sent to every U.S. ambassador and mission abroad prior to that meeting instructed our envoys to lobby their host governments with these instructions:       The United States believes that access to abortion is a      fundamental right. The United States delegation will be      working for stronger language on the importance of access to      abortion services overseas.  In a speech at the second PrepCom for the Cairo Conference, Tim Wirth said much the same thing, how they were going to be pushing abortion. And in a keynote address at the 1994 meeting of the Population Cooperating Agencies, Brian Atwood, the administrator of AID, said, and I quote,       While obstacles cannot be removed overnight, this      administration will continue to stand for the principle of      reproductive choice, including access to abortion.  I say to my colleagues of the House, those so-called obstacles that Mr. Atwood was referring to are right-to-life laws and constitutional provisions that protect unborn children in approximately 100 countries in the developing world. Virtually all of Central and South America protect their kids from abortion. These are construed by the administration to be obstacles.  These abortion power plays, these overt pro-abortion initiatives, so far have been largely repudiated by the developing world, but they have had some successes. Poland and South Africa recently flip-flopped and went from pro-life to pro-abortion. So there is now a dual strategy: When the overt strategy failed, another strategy was employed.  For the last 4 years the administration has relied on a parallel track, a more sophisticated covert means designed to accomplish that end. They have used surrogates, nongovernmental organizations like the International Planned Parenthood Federation based in London, and the Pathfinder Fund and others to do the lion's share of the dirty work to nullify pro-life laws and to set up abortion mills the world over.  This past Tuesday I asked our very distinguished Secretary of State, Madeleine Albright, an official for whom I have great respect, whether she was aware of the 1992 International Planned Parenthood Federation abortion manifesto called Vision 2000, a global strategic plan that Planned Parenthood adopted and have been implementing ever since to promote abortion in every corner of the world. The Secretary, known for her candor, admitted she never heard of it.  IPPF, by the way, has received more than $70 million from the U.S. taxpayers, courtesy of this administration, so it seems to me that the Secretary of State and all of us should know what IPPF is all about. Again, it is not just what they do with ``our'' money, it is what their agenda is all about.  I urge Members to look at this document. This is their marching orders in the developing world. Do not just say our money is not going to be used. Other money then gets used to bring down these right-to-life laws. Let me just quote briefly from it.  The Vision 2000 strategic plan says, and I quote, that they will ``bring pressure on governments and campaign for policy and legislative change to remove restrictions against abortion.'' Can anything be more clear? Pressure governments. Campaign for abortion on demand. And we are providing many, many millions of dollars to this group.  Fred Sai, who is the former chairman of International Planned Parenthood, put it very succinctly when they passed this IPPF strategic plan. He said,       Now, for the first time, the IPPF strategic plan, Vision      2000, which was unanimously adopted at the Members' Assembly      in Delhi, outlines activities at both the Secretariat and FPA      level to further IPPF's explicit goal of increasing the right      of access to abortion.  Who we support and subsidize does matter.  IPPF has an elaborate plan and plans of action, as they call them, to promote abortion in every country of the world, including Central and South America where, again, they protect their unborn children. They have plans to decimate the pro-life laws in Africa, the Muslim countries in the Middle East, and several Asian countries who also legally protect their children from the abortionist's knife.  A vote for the Clinton resolution empowers the abortion industry to continue and expand these efforts to eradicate pro-life laws. Eliminate a law in Poland and a whole generation of kids are put at risk. Eliminate a law that protects them in South Africa or any other country, and an entire generation of kids are put at risk of abortion on demand.  I would respectfully submit that the only responsible pro-life action today is a ``no'' vote on the Clinton resolution and a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 581, the Smith-Oberstar-Hyde bill.  I truly believe that if we stand on the human rights principle of safeguarding human life today, the administration will ultimately do the right thing, provide family planning money, but do so with pro-life safeguards.  I was very encouraged by the statement made this past December by Phyllis Oakley, assistant secretary for population, when she appeared before my subcommittee. I chair the International Operations and Human Rights Subcommittee. Secretary Oakley, who is the point person for population for the administration said, and I quote:       The United States does not promote abortion and does not      support the performance of abortion.'' She said, ``That is      clear. We have stated it over and over again. I can assure      you that remains our fundamental policy.  I therefore respectfully submit that the competing resolutions before the House today put Secretary Oakley's statement concerning this fundamental policy to the test. If the administration persists in promoting abortion by way of surrogates, the Clinton denials of promoting abortion will be exposed as wholly disingenuous and untrue.  Mr. Chairman, I urge a ``yes'' vote on H.R. 581 as introduced by the gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Oberstar] and the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde] and myself. This pro-life, pro-family planning bill releases the entire $385 million appropriated for fiscal year 1997 on March 1 for family planning, but, again, it does it with the pro-life safeguards.  As a matter of fact, in fiscal year 1997 the administration will have significantly more to spend on family planning with our bill, not with the bill before you or the resolution, but with our bill.  Total cash on hand for population in fiscal year 1997, as this chart shows you, with carryover funds from 1996, will be $713 million with our bill. It will be only $543 million with the Clinton resolution. That is clear; that is undeniable. Yes, the money will be spent eventually, but the issue that the Clinton administration is making is that money delayed is money denied. We will frontload the whole thing, giving you the entire pot of money for family planning, but do so with pro-life safeguards.  I think it is very, very significant for Members to know that these safeguards are nothing new; they were in effect. People have talked about the Helms amendment today. The Helms amendment in the 1980's was found to be infirm. Yes, it stopped direct funding, but there were loopholes. The pro-abortion groups simply took their own money, which was freed up by our contributions, and used it for abortion promotion.  Let me just again say that the pro-life safeguards of the Mexico City policy were in effect during the Reagan and Bush years as a way to fully fund family planning without promoting abortion. The Mexico City policy is both pro-family planning--and we make it clear in our bill--and pro-life.  Specifically, the safeguards say this: We will condition funds only to those organizations that will not perform abortions except in the cases of rape, incest, and life of the mother. We restrict funds to those organizations that will not lobby, that will not become the network in Peru or Brazil or any of these other countries bringing down their pro-life laws.                              {time}  1245  Mr. Chairman, they are extensions of U.S. foreign policy. We give money to them. When they are talking to a legislator in one of these countries they do not say, ``Are you doing that with U.S. money or are you doing that with your own money?'' They are an extension of our policy. Since we are the megacontributors and donators to them, what they do reflects directly upon us here in the United States.  If Members want to promote abortions, say it. This Mexico City policy makes it very clear that there ought to be a wall of separation between the two.  Let me also point out that during the years that the policy was in place, in excess of 350 family planning organizations, including Planned Parenthood affiliates in 57 States or countries, accepted the conditions. Some of the more extreme pro-abortionists in IPPF went ballistic over that, and even censured IPPF Western Hemisphere for doing that. But I believe they showed that they wanted to do family planning. They did not want to be part of this big push for abortion. Vote ``no'' on the Clinton resolution, and please vote ``yes'' on H.R. 581.
