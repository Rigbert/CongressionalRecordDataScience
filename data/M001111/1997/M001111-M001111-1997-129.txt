  The concerns we have continuously raised about the bill we are debating is who decides when that woman or man, father or mother, gets to take that time--whether the employer decides or they do.  When it is your child's conference time at school, your employer cannot say, or probably will not say to you, ``You can take your conference time next week.'' You need to go to them as an employee and say, ``My child's conference is next Thursday at 10 o'clock. I need to take an hour to go visit with my child's teacher.''  Let me ask the Senator from Minnesota, the option that I am offering that allows 24 hours off a year for parents to participate with their child, in your opinion, would that give employees the ability to have some control over their time and their ability to participate with their families?
