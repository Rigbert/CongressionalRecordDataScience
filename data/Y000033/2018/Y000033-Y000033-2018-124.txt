Mr. Speaker, I rise today in memorial to a dedicated husband, proud father, pioneer of aviation and entrepreneurship, and importantly, a great Alaskan. On December 7, 2017, Alaska lost one if its hardest working and most dedicated fathers, Mr. Cliff Everts.  Cliff Everts is a keepsake original forged from rare earth. He matriculated from New York but had the spirit of an Alaskan Wolf, the business acumen of a Rockefeller, and the fortitude of a Sourdough. His smile could light up a room and his sense of humor warmed any room he happened to grace. In thinking of that astounding smile and infectious laugh, I am reminded of one of his famous quotes and something he said the last time I saw him ``Dude, that was sick!'' It's how he lived his life.  In reflecting upon Cliff's many accomplishments and his life, one could go on for days about all he did. I can speak to his service to his customers and how he always found a way to deliver cargo ranging from reindeer to homebuilding materials (beat that Home Depot), or start a business to sell ice cream to Alaskans! He did so at the best price with the best service to those customers. I can speak to all of his service to the community. How much he cared for Alaskans and loved Alaska.  However, what gives me the most pleasure and puts a massive smile on my face, is Cliff's dedication and his love for his wife and six children. Whenever anyone asked what made Cliff happy or what made Cliff such a success, it was always his family. He always shined when he talked about them and you could see how he would glow whenever he thought about them or saw them in person. You just do not find that in most people but you always knew it with Cliff.  Suffice to say that Cliff will live in infamy in our hearts and souls. I hope that Cliff's family and especially his wife Betty can take comfort in the bond they have with him; always. I hope the precious memories the family has of their precious Cliff will one day bring them comfort, and that they will come to find, in the lovely words of Hugh Orr:  ``They are not dead who live in lives they leave behind. In those whom they have blessed, they live a life again, and shall live through the years eternal life, and shall grow each day more beautiful, as time declares their good, forgets the rest, and proves their immortality.''  Please join me in expressing our heartfelt appreciation for Cliff and our sympathies for his wife, Betty; son, Robert Everts and his wife Paula; his daughters, Melanie Moyer; Debbie Baggen; Karen Wing; Vicki Parrish and her husband Albert; and Susan Hoshaw and her husband Don; 16 grandchildren; 11 great-grandchildren; and so many close, cherished family and friends.                          ____________________
