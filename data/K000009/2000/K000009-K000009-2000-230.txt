Mr. Chairman, I know the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) has tried to be understanding in prior years in the measures that we have brought forward. So in the spirit of that, I would hope that during the conference committee that the gentleman would give consideration to working with our subcommittee to see if we cannot find a way to incorporate the spirit of this in some of what is done.  I would humbly withdraw this amendment this evening knowing full well that the farmers of America deserve a better turn than we are giving them tonight.
