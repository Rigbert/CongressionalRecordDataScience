 President, today I rise in remembrance of a fellow Iowan who has fallen in service to his country in Iraq. Specialist Seth Garceau died on the 4th of March after being seriously injured by a roadside explosive on the 27th of February. A member of the Iowa Army National Guard Company A, 224th Engineer Battalion, Specialist Garceau is survived by a mother, Lori, a father, Rick, and a sister, Tess.  Seth Garceau grew up in Oelwein, IA, and enlisted in the Iowa Army National Guard in 2000 while he was still in high school. Seth graduated from Oelwein High School in 2001 and was mobilized for Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2004. Officials announced on the 5th of February that Specialist Garceau will be promoted posthumously to the rank of Sergeant.  Former President Calvin Coolidge once said, ``No person was ever honored for what he received. Honor has been the reward for what he gave.'' Seth Garceau has given his life, that greatest of gifts, and for that, we shall forever honor him. I offer my most sincere sympathy to his family and friends who have felt this loss most deeply. May we always remember Seth with respect and admiration. For his life and the sacrifice he made, he deserves no less.                          ____________________
