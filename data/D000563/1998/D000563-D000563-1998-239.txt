President, today I introduce a private relief bill, under the Immigration and Nationality Act, that would grant Nizar and Hassan Sweilem permanent residence in the United States. Nizar and Hassan Sweilem are natives and citizens of Lebanon. They are also brothers.  The Sweilem brothers have lived in Des Plaines, Illinois for fourteen years and have made the most of this opportunity to obtain a first-class education in this country. Nizar recently earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of Illinois at Chicago. Hassan earned a B.S. in Political Science and is completing a degree in Computer Science also at the University of Illinois.  Both Nizar and Hassan were born in Beirut, Lebanon. They entered the United States as children in August of 1983 to visit relatives. When they entered the United States, they were accompanied by their mother, and their maternal uncle. Their uncle returned early to Lebanon and was killed two weeks later when a rocket destroyed the Sweilem family home.  In April of 1984, because of her brother's murder and her own fear of persecution, Leila Sweilem applied to the INS for asylum in the United States without the assistance of counsel. Nizar and Hassan Sweilem were included in their mother's application since they were her minor children. Since 1984, the Sweilem brothers have been pursuing the right to live legally in the United States as permanent residents.  In 1985, the INS denied the Sweilems' request for asylum and initiated deportation proceedings against the family. Leila, Nizar and Hassan renewed their application for asylum in their hearing before an Immigration Judge, but those requests were denied. The Sweilems appealed that decision, but before any decision was issued, the Attorney General designated nationals of Lebanon eligible for Temporary Protected Status on account of the extreme level of violence created by the Lebanese civil war. TPS for citizens of Lebanon continued until March of 1993.  In August of 1993, Hassan and Nizar asked that their asylum appeal be reinstated and that their case be remanded to allow them to apply for suspension of deportation. In November of 1994, Hassan and Nizar applied for suspension of deportation. While their application was pending, Congress passed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Responsibility Act in September of 1996. This law retroactively made Nizar and Hassan ineligible for suspension of deportation and left them with no alternate remedy. The 1996 Act eliminated suspension of deportation and established a new form of relief entitled cancellation of removal that required an applicant to accrue ten years of continuous residence as of the date of the initial notice charging the applicant with being removable. Despite the fact that at that time the Sweilem brothers had twelve years of continuous residence in the U.S., the time accrued after the denial of their mother's initial asylum request does not count.  Last year, this Congress recognized that these new provisions could result in grave injustices to certain groups of people, so in November of 1997, the Nicaraguan and Central American Relief Act granted relief to certain citizens of former Soviet block countries and several Central American countries.  That law allowed several hundred thousand Central Americans and former Soviet Union or Warsaw Pact countries, who came to the U.S. during the civil strife of the 1980's to adjust to permanent resident status under more lenient hardship rules that existed prior to the 1996 change. The U.S. had allowed Central Americans to reside and work here for over a decade, during which time many of them established families, careers and community ties. If Nizar and Hassan Sweilem were citizens of Nicaragua, El Salvador Guatemala or any of the former Communist countries of Eastern Europe, they could continue to pursue their applications for suspension of deportation. The fact that they are citizens of Lebanon makes them ineligible for relief.  Nizar and Hassan Sweilem have lived in the United States for almost 15 years, since they were 12 and 14, respectively. They have taken full advantage of their educational opportunities and are more than capable of caring for themselves. The brothers will face undue hardship by returning to Lebanon, as evidenced by their uncle's murder. The Sweilem brothers' extended family now resides in the United States, and the brothers have strong ties to the local community. My office has received numerous lettersfrom the community on their behalf, including a letter from the Director of Graduate Studies at the University of Illinois. They have no family left in Lebanon and have never visited it in the last 15 years.  The Sweilem brothers have spent more than half their lives in the United States. At every step, the Sweilems took American law at its word: they always attempted to follow the law only to have Congress suddenly pull the rug out from under them. I think this is an injustice and these two brothers from Lebanon deserve the same relief that we gave people from Nicaragua, El Salvador and Czechoslovakia. Mr. President, I ask you and my fellow colleagues to support these Lebanese brothers by giving them permanent residence status and not depriving them of the opportunity to become United States citizens.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2305       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.),      Nizar Sweilem and Hassan Sweilem shall be held and considered      to have been lawfully admitted to the United States for      permanent residence as of the date of enactment of this Act      upon payment of the required visa fees.     SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Nizar Sweilem      and Hassan Sweilem, as provided in this Act, the Secretary of      State shall instruct the proper officer to reduce by the      appropriate number during the current fiscal year the total      number of immigrant visas available to natives of the country      of the aliens' birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration      and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)).                                 ______                                       By
