President, the Senate today is considering the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. I believe this legislation is not appropriate energy legislation and also not responsible fiscal policy for the United States, as we face a Federal deficit of $8.4 trillion and looming cuts to many vital programs that the Federal Government must support. Next week we will begin to take up the Defense appropriations bill for this year. As we consider that bill, we will discover huge unmet needs to finance the current operations of our military. If we diminish the Federal Treasury, our ability to respond to that issue and a host of other issues will be contemporaneously diminished.  This legislation would mandate that almost 38 percent of revenue from Federal resources generated by new leases in new areas of production made available by this bill will be given to four Gulf Coast States. Revenues that currently would be provided to the Treasury for the benefit of the Nation as a whole will be diverted to four States. This bill, if passed, will cost the Federal Treasury billions of dollars over time. I am not alone in my opposition to this legislation. Taxpayer advocates and environmentalists share my concerns. I ask unanimous consent that the text of several letters be printed in the Record expressing these concerns.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Taxpayers for Common Sense,                                                    July 24, 2006.       Dear Senator: Taxpayers for Common Sense Action (TCS      Action), a non-partisan budget watchdog organization, urges      you to oppose S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act      of 2006. TCS Action is alarmed by provisions in the bill      which alter existing federal-state revenue sharing provisions      for royalty payments. Royalty payments represent the second      largest source of federal revenues after federal taxes. These      provisions will siphon off billions of dollars that would      have gone to the Treasury, further straining the nation's      fiscal health.       TCS Action is not opposed to off-shore oil and gas      exploration and development. However, federal waters are      owned by all U.S. taxpayers and the public has a right to      receive a fair return for the resources they own. Oil and gas      resources located within federal waters should not be      converted into cash cows benefiting only four Gulf coast      states. Gulf coast states currently receive significant      royalty payments from waters within 6 miles of their      coastline. In fact, under current policy, Louisiana received      nearly a billion in revenue from oil and gas royalty payments      from 1986-2003.       This legislation would dramatically deplete federal revenue      generated by leases in lease sale 181 and 181 south and all      leases that are issued after enactment of the bill. Currently      royalties from these waters would return entirely to the      federal government. Moreover, lease sale 181 would likely be      opened in the next several years regardless of this      legislation. Despite attempts to disguise this legislation as      a revenue generator, opening these tracts of off-shore waters      under the proposed royalty-sharing provisions with the four      Gulf coast states would have detrimental long-term effects on      the federal budget. The Administration has also raised      similar concerns to changes in revenue-sharing on current      leases and their cost to federal taxpayers.       With the federal debt mounting and oil and gas prices      nearing record highs, reducing the federal earnings on our      natural resource royalties does not make fiscal sense. We      urge you to vote against the S. 3711 and return some fiscal      sanity to our nation's energy policy. If you have any      questions, please contact Autumn Hanna at (202) 546-8500.           Sincerely,                                                      Steve Ellis,     Vice President of Programs.                                  ____                                League of Conservation Voters,                                                    July 24, 2006.     Re oppose S. 3711, the so-called Gulf of Mexico Energy          Security Act of 2006.       Dear Senator: The League of Conservation Voters (LCV) is      the political voice of the national environmental community.      Each year, LCV publishes the National Environmental      Scorecard, which details the voting records of Members of      Congress on environmental legislation. The Scorecard is      distributed to LCV members, concerned voters nationwide, and      the press.       LCV urges you to oppose S. 3711, the so-called Gulf of      Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. This backward-looking      legislation fails to address our energy problems, raids the      federal treasury, and threatens our coastal economies and      ecosystems with pollution and oil spills.       Opening more of our coastlines to drilling is clearly not      the answer to our energy problems, especially given that      eighty percent of offshore oil and gas resources are already      open to drilling, and oil companies currently hold more than      4,000 untapped leases in the Gulf of Mexico. Instead of      despoiling our shores and perpetuating our dependence on oil,      Congress should pursue faster, cheaper, and more      environmentally friendly solutions, including making cars and      trucks go further on a gallon of gasoline and increasing our      use of clean, renewable energy such as wind and solar power.       Unfortunately, rather than using American ingenuity to      advance a new energy future that benefits both the economy      and the environment, S. 3711 continues to promote failed      policies of the past. It opens eight million acres of      Florida's Gulf Coast waters to offshore drilling rigs,      including more than six million acres that are currently      protected by the bipartisan moratorium on offshore drilling      that has been in place for twenty-five years. S. 3711 would      also divert tens of billions of dollars in offshore drilling      revenues from the federal treasury and give the money to just      four states. If the Senate were to pass S. 3711, it would      pave the way for a conference with H.R. 4761, the even more      harmful House-passed bill that would lift the moratorium on      offshore drilling for all of our coastlines across the      country.       We urge you to protect our coasts, our environment, and our      economy by voting NO on S. 3711, and instead supporting real      solutions to our energy problems. LCV has scored votes      related to energy policy and coastal protection on numerous      occasions in the past few years, and the Political Advisory      Committee will strongly consider including votes on this bill      in compiling LCV's 2006 Scorecard. If you need more      information, please call Tiernan Sittenfeld or Nat Mund at my      office at (202) 785-8683.           Sincerely,                                                   Gene Karpinski,     President.                                  ____                                                  Sierra Club,                                                    July 25, 2006.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the nearly 800,000 Sierra Club      members, I urge you to defeat The Gulf of Mexico Energy      Security Act, sponsored by Senator Domenici, and instead      fight for energy solutions that will save American families      money and cure our addiction to oil.       The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act, S. 3711, will open      an area the size ofthe State of Maryland to new oil and gas      drilling, approximately 8 million acres in the Gulf of      Mexico. This bill would also repeal parts of the offshore      drilling moratorium that has protected America's coast for      more than 25 years. It would also divert 37.5 percent of the      revenues from new oil and gas drilling in the     Gulf to just four states, costing the Federal Treasury nearly      $20 billion over the next 20 years.       Not only does this bill lift the moratorium on drilling in      the eastern Gulf of Mexico, it jeopardizes every other      coastal state. The House has already passed an expansive      drilling bill that puts the entire Atlantic and Pacific      coasts on the chopping block. If the Domenici bill passes the      Senate it will certainly get much worse in a House-Senate      conference committee, putting our wetlands, marine      environments, beaches and coastal economies at risk.       The Sierra Club strongly supports permanent protection for      our beaches and coastal waters. Our coasts provide essential      habitat for fish and wildlife, a detination for thousands of      vacationing families each year, and the economic lifeblood      for thousands of tourism and fishing communities.       The Domenici drilling bill continues to lead America away      from smart energy solutions. It is estimated that drilling      off of Florida's coast would only bring 47 days of oil and 4      months of natural gas, and we wouldn't see any of it for at      least 7 years. There are faster, cheaper, cleaner and      longerterm energy solutions like energy efficiency and clean,      renewable energy that will start saving families and      businesses money today.. We do not need to sacrifice our      beaches and coastal waters to meet America's energy needs.       Thank you for consideration of our recommendations. If you      have questions, please feel free to contact Athan Manuel at      202-548-4580.           Sincerely,                                                        Carl Pope,     Executive Director.                                  ____                            Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund,                                                    July 25, 2006.     Re oppose S. 3711, the budget-busting offshore drilling bill.       Dear Senator: The Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund is an      independent organization committed to giving conservation      issues a political voice on Capitol Hill and around the      nation. The Action Fund publishes an annual Conservation      Report Card which highlights the voting records of Members of      Congress on legislation vital to protecting our nation's      wildlife and wild landscapes for future generations.       Protection of marine life in the outer continental shelf is      one of Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund's highest      priorities. S. 3711, the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act,      would dismantle the 25 year bipartisan offshore drilling      moratorium by opening 6 million acres of currently protected      waters in Florida's Gulf coast to oil and gas development.      The Action Fund urges you in the strongest possible terms to      oppose S. 3711, which will most likely be included in the      next Conservation Report Card.       The eight million acres proposed for oil and gas      development in the Gulf of Mexico are home to more than 20      species of whales and dolphins, five species of sea turtles,      dozens of fish species and hundreds of species of birds. All      would be put at risk of collision and exposure to the routine      pollution associated with oil and gas drilling if S. 3711      were to pass. An oil spill would further devastate our marine      wildlife.       While the bill would threaten our marine wildlife and      coastal economies, it would do nothing to lower oil or      natural gas prices; it will simply feed our country's      unsustainable addiction to oil. From enforcing strict      conservation measures to making our cars go farther on a      gallon of gas, Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund supports      faster, cleaner, cheaper solutions than oil and gas drilling      to meet our energy needs.       I further urge you to oppose S. 3711 so that a conference      report with HR 4761, the House-passed offshore drilling bill      authored by Rep. Richard Pombo (R-CA), never sees the light      of day. The House bill lifts the entire offshore drilling      moratorium nationwide, and Rep. Pombo has made clear that the      House intends on using the conference process to add as many      of the House bill's provisions to the Senate bill as      possible. We oppose S. 3711 in its own right; a conference      with the House bill would be disastrous.       Thank you for your consideration in this matter.           Sincerely,                                              Rodger Schlickeisen,                                                        President.
