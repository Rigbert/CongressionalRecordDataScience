 Madam Speaker, today the House considers a bipartisan bill designed to improve the juvenile justice system in America. H.R. 863, as amended, was favorably reported out of the Committee on the Judiciary by voice vote.  The bill authorizes the Department of Justice to award up to $500 million a year for the next 3 fiscal years to States and localities that agree to implement a system of graduated sanctions for juvenile delinquency. Such a system imposes sanctions on juvenile offenders for every delinquent act they commit, from the very first act, and increases the intensity of the sanctions with the severity of the offense.  This bill would replace the current unauthorized block grant program that was created in the fiscal year 1999 appropriation bill for the Departments of Commerce, Justice and State. The block grant program of H.R. 863 is more flexible for the States than the current unauthorized grant program. This bill does not require a grant recipient to spend a certain percentage of the funds on specified purposes. This is not a one-size-fits-all program. Rather, the States that qualify by implementing graduated sanctions may use the grant money where they need it to improve their juvenile justice systems.  Further, the new block grant programs would not place a mandate on the States. A State or locality may qualify even if its system of graduated sanctions is discretionary. However, those juvenile courts that do not impose graduated sanctions must report at least annually to the applicable State or locality as to why graduated sanctions were not imposed in all such cases.  This bill affords States and localities the flexibility and discretion necessary to improve their juvenile justice systems.  Madam Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
