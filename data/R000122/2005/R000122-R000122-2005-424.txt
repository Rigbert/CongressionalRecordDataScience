President, I would like to spend a few moments talking about an issue of great concern, and that is transit security. I know my colleagues are working as we speak. I will be working with them--the Senator from New Hampshire; the Senator from West Virginia; my colleague, Senator Shelby from Alabama--to raise the amount of resources devoted to transit security.
