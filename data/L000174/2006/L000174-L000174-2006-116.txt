Mr. President, I am confused by this. It was my understanding the Senator from Vermont had up to 45 minutes specifically reserved, not from anybody else's time, but from his own time, on the Specter-Leahy, et al., amendment, and a total--out of which the 45 minutes would have to come--of 1 hour on the bill. Is that incorrect?
