President, I want to take a few moments to discuss the deteriorating situation in Zimbabwe. Over the past several months, we have all watched with alarm as President Mugabe has placed his desire to remain in power above the best interests of his own people. In the process, Mr. Mugabe's government has destroyed the rule of law, contributed to food shortages, committed violations of human rights, and wrecked the economy--causing unemployment to rise to more than 60 percent.  The issue has received most of the attention is land reform. There is no question that land reform is badly needed to ensure long-term prosperity in Zimbabwe. As late as 1999, the process appeared to be moving in the right direction: Zimbabwe had presented a detailed plan for the inception phase of a land reform effort, the World Bank had made a $5 million pledge to assist with the resettlement of poor farmers, and several bilateral donors, including the United States, made pledges of assistance.  However, in an attempt to deflect attention from a failing economy, a misguided military intervention in the Congo, widespread government corruption, and a host of other domestic problems, President Mugabe decided to support the sudden occupation of large farms. In the wake of this ill-conceived policy, several farmers have been killed, the independence of the judicial system has been seriously undermined, and agricultural production has been sharply reduced, contributing to widespread food shortages throughout the country.  As the land seizure crisis continues, other forms of harassment and political violence in Zimbabwe--carried out primarily by members of the ZANU-PF party against members of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), journalists, and other critics of the government--have steadily escalated. A number of recent events clearly indicate that the situation is a risk of spiraling out of control: the MDC office in Bulawayo was invaded and burnt down with a petrol bomb, as the police stood by and watched; there are reports that MDC members have been illegally taken into custody and tortured; the government announced the humanitarian organizations will not be permitted to distribute food aid in rural areas where it is acutely needed; and after two journalists were arrested, the minister of information compared the international media to terrorists and began notifying foreign journalists that they would not be allowed to work in the country for the foreseeable future.  There are also serious concerns about the upcoming Presidential election scheduled for early next year. As a Gallup poll shows President Mugabe running behind MDC candidate Morgan Tsvangirai, many outside observers believe that Mr. Mugabe and ZANU-PF will stop at nothing to remain in power, and are engaged in activities to undermine the democratic process and illegally alter the outcome of the election. In addition to the campaign of harassment and violence against MDC supporters, the government has prevented non-governmental organizations from carrying out voter education campaigns and has refused to allow observers from international organizations, including the European Union, to monitor the elections. Moreover, the government is pushing through electoral reforms that will effectively withhold absentee ballots from Zimbabweans living abroad, with the exception of diplomats and soldiers, and require voters to present proof of residency. These are measures that could eliminate thousands from the voter rolls.  Because of the serious situation in Zimbabwe, I have joined with Senator Feingold and sponsored a provision which was included in FY 2002 Foreign Operations Appropriations Conference Report that requires U.S. executive directors to international financial institutions to vote against loans, except those for basic human needs or democracy-building purposes, to the Government of Zimbabwe, unless the Secretary of State determines and reports that the rule of law has been restored.  I would also like to point out that earlier this session the House and Senate passed S. 494, the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001, and I look forward to President Bush signing it into law, as soon as possible. S. 494 contains several provisions similar to section 560 in the Foreign Operations Conference Report, although section 560 does not provide waiver authority.  Mr. President, I continue to strongly support the Administration's request for assistance to Zimbabwe for health care programs, strengthening civil society that is not affiliated with the ruling party, peace corps activities, and humanitarian purposes. However, therequest for funds to restart the International Military Education and Training is premature, and would send the wrong message at this critical juncture.                          ____________________
