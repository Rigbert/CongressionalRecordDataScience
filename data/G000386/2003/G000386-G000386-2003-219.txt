 President, I ask unanimous consent that following passage of S. 1, the bill be held at the desk; further, when the Senate receives from the House the companion measure to S. 1 the Senate proceed to its consideration, all after the enacting clause be stricken, and the text of S. 1 as passed be inserted in lieu thereof; the bill then be read a third time and passed with the motion to reconsider laid upon the table; further, that the Senate then insist on its amendments and request a conference with the House, and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees with a ratio of 5 to 4; finally, with that action, I ask unanimous consent that passage of S. 1 be vitiated and the bill be placed back on the calendar.
