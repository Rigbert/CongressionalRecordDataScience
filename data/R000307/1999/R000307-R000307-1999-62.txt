President, it is my understanding that the Cochran amendment had--I apologize to my friend and colleague because I don't have the specifics of the Cochran amendment here, and I should. Staff has informed me that there was $350 million for livestock payments at the discretion of the Secretary, and we provided $250 million. I am making an assumption, but most of the problems we are experiencing now are in the Senator's area in regard to hog producers.  In talking with Secretary Glickman today, I don't think we can make a determination yet as to where most of that money would go--the extra $100 million, if in fact we can call it extra. Well, it goes from $350 million to $250 million. It went to crop insurance, and it went to adding $100 million more on the disaster side. It was a matter of priorities.
