 The last thing I would ask the gentleman: Am I correct that the agreement that was reached between our parties, which led to the passage of the Budget Control Act in a bipartisan fashion, does not reflect the substance of that agreement as it relates to the discretionary spending number for fiscal year 2013? Senator McConnell is quoted, as you know, as saying that that was an agreement that was reached and that he expected it to be pursued.  I want to make it clear that he was not referring to the action of the Budget Committee, but he was referring to the agreement on the discretionary number.  Am I correct that the agreement that was reached, in order to get a bipartisan vote on the Budget Control Act, which we passed, which made sure that this country did not default on its debts for the first time in history, am I correct that that number is not the number that is reflected in the budget?  I yield to my friend.
