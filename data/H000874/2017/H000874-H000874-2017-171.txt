 With respect to the appropriations process, as the gentleman knows, there are 12 discrete appropriation bills dealing with national security and domestic spending. Can the gentleman tellme whether or not we still intend to consider, on a timely basis, discretely, that is, one at a time, the 12 appropriation bills?  I don't think any of them have been marked up as of this point in time. Obviously, not having a budget would preclude that from happening. I understand that. But, as the gentleman knows and I know from experience of serving on the appropriations process, frankly, it was at the beginning of this month, historically, that we would start to mark up appropriation bills, with the intent to use much of June and July for the purposes of passing appropriations bills so that we might send them to the Senate for consideration and have some chance of getting them done prior to the expiration of the fiscal year on September 30.  Does the gentleman anticipate that we will be considering separately the 12 appropriation bills between now and the August break?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The gentleman will be happy to know that Appropriations has already held 47 hearings dealing with FY 2018, so, as we receive the President's budget and are able to ask questions of the OMB Director, we will continue to move forward. But it is our intention always to go through regular order and, in all cases, if possible, individually, down onto the floor.
