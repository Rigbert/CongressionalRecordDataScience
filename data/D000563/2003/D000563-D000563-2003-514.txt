President, I thank my colleagues for joining us in this floor debate, and I hope others will tomorrow, and I am sure they will. It is worth noting that the State of Mississippi, faced with the circumstances described by my colleague and friend, Senator Lott, decided to do what each State has the right to do, and that is establish its own standards of recovering for noneconomic losses.  It is my understanding they have established a schedule that starts at half a million dollars and, over a period of 10 or 15 years, goes up as high as $1 million or $1.2 million. That has been done by the State of Mississippi, as it could be done by any other State. What we are considering here is what we will do on a national basis.  I was wondering if the Senator from Kentucky would help me understand the portion of the bill relative to what he described as flexibility in terms of States rights.  Would the Senator be kind enough to yield, without me yielding the floor, to engage him in a dialog about this State flexibility? Is that permissible under the rules of the Senate? I direct that request through the Chair.
