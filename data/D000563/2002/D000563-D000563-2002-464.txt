These individuals are being honored for their outstanding devotion to the effort to enrich the lives of people with developmental disabilities in Illinois.  These recipients have displayed a strong sense of humanity and professionalism in their work with persons with disabilities. Their efforts have inspired the lives of those whom they care for, and they are an inspiration to me as well. They have set a fine example of community service for all Americans to follow.  These honorees spend more than 50 percent of their time in direct, personal involvement with their clients. They are not primarily managers or supervisors. They are direct service workers at the forefront of America's effort to care for people with special needs. They go to work every day with little recognition, providing much needed and greatly valued care and assistance.  It is my pleasure to acknowledge the contributions of the following Illinois direct service professionals: James Adams, Louise Adams, Sue Bailey, Chequel Banks, Sharon Brand, Gwen Condon, Dawn DeLeon, John Ferro, Jenny Hoffman, Orrin Holman, Chau Le, Veronica Mayweather, Paul McPherson, Herminia Ortiz, Isabelle Ptak, Kay Quinn, Sarah Redner, Dorothy Rendleman, Robin Roux, Edward Schultz, Jenny Schwartz, Barbara Stroud, and Sandy Verschoore.  I know my fellow Senators will join me in congratulating the winners of the 2001 Direct Service Professional Award. I applaud their dedication and thank them for their service.                          ____________________
