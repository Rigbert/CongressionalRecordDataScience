 I will answer it again.  I was against it when President Bush was in favor of it. I have been consistently against closing Guantanamo all along the way, no matter who the President was. At least you could say this about President Bush: He didn't put a date on it before he had an idea what he was going to do with them. And that is the core issue here.
