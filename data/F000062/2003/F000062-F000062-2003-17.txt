 President, today's vote to pass the Healthy Forests legislation is a major bipartisan victory. This is not just because it is the first major forest bill in 27 years.  Much more significantly, we have nourished the middle ground in the forest debate that is so often lost in the partisan rhetoric.  We actually can create good rural jobs, protect our communities, and restore our forest environment at the same time.  Let me repeat this: we can create rural jobs, protect our communities, and take action to restore the health of our forests at the same time.  Ever since I cosponsored the Herger-Feinstein Quincy Library Group Act 5 years ago, I have been working to bring together the rural, forest-dependent communities--rather than unnecessarily dividing them.  This bill goes a long way to that end throughout the West and the Nation.  There are many people who deserve credit for this bill, but there are a few Senators in particular to whom I want to give special thanks. Senators Pete Domenici and Larry Craig were the best bipartisan allies I could ever ask for in terms of how they approached this issue.  Even though they are in the majority, Senators Domenici and Craig realized that a forestry bill needed a bipartisan coalition. They worked in good faith with me and Senator Wyden from start to finish, and I am deeply grateful for it.  I also want to thank Senator Cochran, the chairman of the conference on this bill, for his leadership throughout the process. Senator Cochran ably and skillfully represented the Senate position in the negotiations. I particularly want to emphasize that his staff conducted the conference in a fine and fair manner throughout, and it's a credit to his leadership.  There are many others Senators who played critical roles in this process, including Senators Crapo, Kyl, Lincoln, McCain, Baucus, and Bingaman.  I finally want to thank Senator Wyden, the ranking member on the Forestry Subcommittee of the Energy Committee. He is as good a ranking member and as good a leader on forestry as the Democrats could ever have.  I also want to say that I second his views on the meaning of the different parts of the bill in his statement today. As the two principal Democratic negotiators of this bill, he and I are in complete accord as to the meaning of its contents.  This legislation H.R 1904, approved by a House-Senate conference committee today is very similar to a bill passed by the Senate last month, with priority given toward removing dead and dying trees and dangerously thick underbrush in areas nearest communities as well as targeting areas where insects have devastated forests. This is especially important in California, where hundreds of thousands of trees have been killed by the bark beetle, creating tinderbox conditions.  While the recent wildfires in Southern California have been contained, these deadly fires consumed a total of 738,158 acres, killed 23 people, and destroyed approximately 3,626 residences and 1,184 other structures. Clearly, we must do everything we can to avert such a catastrophe in the future. The National Forest Service estimates that 57 million acres of Federal land are at the highest risk of catastrophic fire, including 8.5 million in California, so it is critical that we protect our forests and nearby communities.  More than 57 million acres of Federal land at the highest risk of catastrophic fire, including 8.5 million in California. In the past 5 years alone, wildfires have raged through over 27 million acres, including nearly 3 million acres in California. It is critical that Congress acts to protect our forests and nearby communities.  The House-Senate agreement both speeds up the process for reducing hazardous fuels and provides the first legal protection for old growth in our nation's history.  Let me describe what the legislation would do.  Critically, it would establish an expedited process so the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior can get to work on brush-clearing projects to minimize the risk of catastrophic wildfire.  Up to 20 million acres of lands near communities, municipal watersheds and other high-risk areas can be treated. This includes lands that have suffered from serious wind damage or insect epidemics, such as the bark beetle.  We made an important change to the bill's language in section 102(a)(4) in the conference report. In the Senate-passed bill, the insect and disease exception was related to infestations, whereas in the conference bill, the exception has been clarified to apply only where there is a presence of an epidemic of insects or disease. By its own terms, an insect or disease-related event of ``epidemic'' proportions is different from ``endemic'' insects and disease, which are present in a naturally functioning forest ecosystem.  Under the final bill, only epidemics are given special treatment. This is an important distinction.  A total of $760 million annually for hazardous fuel reduction is authorized by the legislation, a $340 million increase over current funding.  At least 50 percent of the funds would be used for fuels reduction near communities.  The legislation also requires that large, fire-resilient, old-growth trees be protected from logging immediately.  It mandates that forest plans that are more than 10 years old and most in need of updating must be updated with old growth protection consistent with the national standard within 2 to 3 years.  Without this provision in the amendment, we would likely have to wait a decade or more to see improved old-growth protection. And even then there would be no guarantee that this protection--against the threat of both logging and catastrophic fire--would be very strong.  In California, the amendment to the Sierra Nevada Framework that is currently in progress will have to comply with the new national standard for old-growth protection.  Let me explain how the agreement improves and shortens the administrative review process and makes it more collaborative and less confrontational. It is critical that the Forest Service can spend the scarce dollars in the federal budget in doing vital work on the ground, rather than being mired in endless paperwork.  The legislation fully preserves multiple opportunities for meaningful public involvement. People can attend a public meeting on every project, and they can submit comments during both the preparation of the environmental impact statement and during the administrative review process. I guarantee you the public will have a meaningful say in these projects.  The legislation changes the environmental review process so the Forest Service still considers the effects of the proposed project in detail, but can focus its analysis on the project proposal, one reasonable alternative that meets the project's goals and the alternative of not doing the project, instead of the 5-9 alternatives now often required.  In the highest priority areas within 1\1/2\ miles of communities, the Forest Service need only study the proposed action and not alternatives. There is no relaxation from current law, however, in how closely the Forest Service must study the environmental effects of the project it is proposing to undertake.  The legislation replaces the current Forest Service administrative appeals with an administrative review process that will occur after the Forest Service finishes its environmental review of a project, but before it reaches its decision. This new approach is similar to a process adopted by the Clinton administration in 2000 for review of forest plans and amendments to those plans. The process will be speedier and less confrontational than the current administrative appeal process.  Next I want to turn to judicial review. I want to emphasize that cases will be heard more quickly under the legislation and abuses of the process will be checked, but nothing alters citizens' opportunity for fair and thorough court review.  Parties can sue in Federal court only on issues raised in the administrative review process. This is a commonsense provision that allows agencies the opportunity to correct their own mistakes before everything gets litigated.  Lawsuits must be filed in the same jurisdiction as the proposed project.  Courts are encouraged to resolve the case as soon as possible.  Preliminary injunctions are limited to 60 days, although they can be extended if appropriate. This provision sends a signal to courts not to delay important brush-clearing projects indefinitely unless there really is a good reason to do so.  The court must weigh the environmental benefit of doing a given project against its environmental risks as it reviews the case.  In closing, I want to say that my colleagues and I have been trying to come to an agreement on a forest bill for several years. We finally broke through the deadlock.  I am deeply pleased that we are enacting this legislation to give the residents of southern California and elsewhere a better chance against the fires that will come next time.
