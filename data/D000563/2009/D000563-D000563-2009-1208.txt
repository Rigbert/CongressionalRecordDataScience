President, in the midst of the worst recession in 75 years, with hundreds of thousands of Americans losing their jobs and their homes, 51 Members of the Senate believe our highest priority is to give a generous tax break to the wealthiest people in America. Many of these same Senators have been wailing for weeks about deficits but obviously believe deficits do not count when it comes to tax breaks for the wealthy.  At this point, it is clear they would move forward with these tax breaks for the wealthiest people in America. My amendment is simple. It creates a point of order. It says we should help struggling Americans first. Before we give an additional $100 billion in tax breaks to the superwealthy, we must first give at least as much in tax relief to Americans earning less than $100,000. It will be tax relief beyond that already included in this budget resolution.
