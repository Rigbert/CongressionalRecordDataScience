A plane carrying 97 passengers crashed in Russia, including Polish President Lech Kaczynski; First Lady Maria Kaczynski; Ryszard Kaczorowski, who led a government in exile during the Communist era; Jerzy Szmajdzinski, the Deputy Speaker of Poland's Parliament; Aleksander Szczyglo, the head of the National Security Bureau; Adrrzej Kremer, the Deputy Minister of foreign affairs; Franciszek Gagor, the Army Chief of Staff; along with the president of Poland's National Bank, and a host of other public servants, including Anna Walentynowicz, the brave worker and opposition activist whose dismissal at the Gdansk shipyard in 1980 started the strike that led to the formation of solidarity.  All modern leaders of the Polish nation, they were mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, proud Poles all, now lost to this life but not to history.  But yet again, the Katyn forest embraces the collective tragedy of Poland's precious leaders. In the most morbid of ironies, the doomed plane was flying to Russia to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre, when more than 22,000 Polish officers and leaders were murdered at the hands of Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Army in and around that forest during World War II. Their bodies were buried and the truth hidden for seven decades. That is the truth of their slaughter. That history still must be made whole.  As the former President of Poland, Lech Walesa, stated, the crash marked ``the second disaster after Katyn. They wanted to cut off our head there, and here the flower of our nation has already perished,'' he said,  ``Buttons,'' a poem by Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert, written in memoriam of the Katyn massacre, contains one stanza which captures this modern-day tragedy as it does this Polish tragedy of 70 years ago for which it was originally penned.  ``When only the metal buttons of the soldiers remain as they work their way to the Earth's surface from below, after decades where history has been masked. Now again a bird flew over, a cloud is passing, a leaf is dropping, a mallow grows, heavens above are filled with silence; the Katyn forest smokes with fog.''  However, as the smoke and fog clears the Katyn forest this time, Poland will stand and prevail as a stable democracy. After this tragedy, Poland again will be led by valiant Poles and will not be occupied by foreign nations.  After an unimaginable loss of leadership such as this, a lesser country would crumble, but not Poland. As the Polish expression reminds us, ``So long as we are alive, there will be a Poland.''  The nation of Poland is free and strong today. Against a backdrop of oppression, partition and heartbreak, it has emerged as one of the most freedom-loving, vibrant countries in Europe.  The United States stands in solidarity and support of her ally during this time of sorrow and mourning. The House of Representatives will honor the souls who were lost last week and remember those who were killed 70 years ago with a Special Order tomorrow.  We extend our condolences to the friends and families of those who perished, to the people of Poland, to the nation of Poland, and to the people of Polish heritage throughout the world.  This is a terrible catastrophe that brings to mind the many tragedies that have befallen Poland in the past. Yet, as we mourn, we must remember and honor what the Polish people have endured and overcome. They will do so again. We hold them in highest respect. And even through our tears, we can see clearly that Poland's best days are still ahead.                          ____________________
