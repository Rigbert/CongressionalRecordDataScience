 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Kelley Williams, Ryan Driscoll, and Patrick Webster, high school students from Vermont. They were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Patrick: Our topic was on gun control, and as Ryan's going      to tell you, we have four specific things we think need to be      improved on gun control.       Ryan: We think that Congress should increase regulations      by: having a 6 month waiting period; no sales to persons      under 25; there should be more safety features on guns; there      should be required gun education programs.       (Dialogue with alternating speakers): If nothing's done      about this rising problem, the ownership will continue to      increase from the current estimated 150 million to 175      million firearms.       The ATF estimates that there are 52 million handguns      circulating in the U.S., and 2 million more bought each year.       About 2 million handguns were manufactured in the U.S. in      1989.       It's estimated that 135,000 students each day now carry      guns to school.       One out of six pediatricians have treated a young gunshot      victim.       80% of homicide victims knew their killers as a relative or      friend?       Of 12,000 men and women who have committed suicide, nearly      60% used handguns.       We've got some statistics that we're going to put on the      overhead. The first one shows the amount of gun distribution      and how much it's gone up from 1988-91, and it's still      rising.       The second graph shows that guns are becoming more and more      commonplace in today's society. This is from a school in Los      Angeles, from students, showing: people carrying guns in the      last 30 days, carrying guns to school in the past year, if      they've shot a gun at someone, if they were shot in the past      year, or if they know someone who has been killed or injured      by gunfire.       The most important fact to us Vermonters: over 41% of gun      accidents in Vermont involved handguns.                          ____________________
