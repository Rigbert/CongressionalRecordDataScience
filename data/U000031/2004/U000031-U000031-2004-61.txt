Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Dr. Diether Haenicke who today received the 2004 Red Rose Citation for outstanding community service from the Rotary Club of Kalamazoo, Michigan. A dedicated and selfless individual, Diether has tirelessly served and greatly impacted the quality of life of countless individuals throughout the state of Michigan.  During his distinguished service as president of Western Michigan University from 1985 to 1998, Deither inspired and impassioned students and colleagues alike. For many years I have looked upon Diether not only as a voice of knowledge and insight, but also as a friend. Despite his retirement, he continues to be an active voice in the community.  Diether spent a career devoted to extensive charity and loyalty to local individuals and the community as a whole. Whether one looks at his service and leadership at the Kalamazoo Institute of Arts, as commissioner of the Education Commission of the States, or on the Board of Trustees for Bronson Methodist Hospital, Diether has a long history of benefiting the communities of Southwest Michigan.  Since 1945, the Rotary Club of Kalamazoo has annually presented the Red Rose Citation to outstanding members of the community, and I can think of no one more fitting to receive this great honor than Diether. I extend my very best wishes to Diether and his family.                          ____________________
