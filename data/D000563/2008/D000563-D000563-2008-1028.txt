President, I say to the majority leader, it appears now that the Senate has to work its will. When the Judiciary Committee proposal was suggested, it didn't pass. When the Senator from Kentucky offered his cloture motion for his side, it didn't even have a majority vote. It had 48 votes in support, let alone the 60 that were required. I don't think we can expect to impose our will on this body. The Senate has to work its will. We could have considered a lot of amendments in the time we have lost so far in debate.  I say to the majority leader, how can we be held responsible for this law expiring if it is the Republicans who opposed extending the law? You have offered repeatedly to let them extend the law. They have said no.
