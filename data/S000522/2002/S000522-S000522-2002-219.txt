Mr. Speaker, next year there will be 700,000 more unique veteran patients in the VA health care network than were projected just 1 year ago. And as our veteran population continues to age andmedical costs continue to skyrocket, we can expect to see this trend continue for most of the decade.  As chairman of the Committee on Veterans Affairs, I have been working with my colleagues to ensure that next year's budget meets the documented needs of our Nation's 25 million veterans.  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to say that, under the leadership of the budget chairman, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle), the budget resolution that comes to the floor will not only maintain our sacred commitments, but will actually expand vital health care for our veterans.  The VA's budget will grow to a record $56.9 billion, including a whopping 12 percent increase in VA health care. That is $2.8 billion for veterans' health care.  It is a good budget, and I commend the chairman, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle), for crafting this outstanding budget to our Nation's veterans.                          ____________________
