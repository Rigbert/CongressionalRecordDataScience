This truly remarkable softball team accomplished extraordinary feats during their undefeated season. For their great ability and skill, as well as their tremendous dedication and hard work, these outstanding young athletes are to be congratulated.  On July 12, 2009, the Crown Point Bulldogs 8 and Under Girls Softball team won the National Softball Association's Indiana State Championship. They went undefeated with a record of 4-0 in the tournament. The team then went on to win the National Softball Association World Series, with a record of 5-1. This victory marked the first World Series Championship in Crown Point history.  The people of Crown Point as well as the community of Northwest Indiana can be proud of this successful and talented softball team. The team consists of: Maggie Ballentine, Kari Bauner, Hannah Bond, Madelyn Elish, Gracie Frazier, Skylar Hekkel, Hailey Herbert, Brooke Manhatton, Mallory McMahon, Caitlyn Phillips, Emma Van Prooyen, and Megan Van Prooyen.  Madam Speaker, I would like to once again extend my most heartfelt congratulations to the members of the 2009 Crown Point Bulldogs 8 and Under Girls Softball Team, as well as head coach Kevin Frazier, assistant coaches Mike Manhatton, Shawn Ballentine, and Matt McMahon, and all of the community, including parents and caregivers, who have instilled in this team the desire to succeed, as well as the great value and discipline found in sports activities. I look forward to watching their future athletic achievements as they continue to rise to the top.                          ____________________
