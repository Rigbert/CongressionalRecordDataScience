President, I know the distinguished chairman of the committee and the distinguished ranking member of the committee want to look at this amendment. Because I am suppose to be at several places, I am not shackled to my desk on the floor as they are. I did want to get the amendment offered. I thank them for their courtesy in giving me time to do so. I urge the Senate to support this important oversight and reporting amendment.  I yield the floor.
