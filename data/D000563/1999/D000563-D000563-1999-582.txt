President, I rise today to share a letter I received from my constituent, Ms. Shirley Roney of Bonnie, Illinois. Ms. Roney shared with me a letter she wrote to President Clinton on behalf of her grandmother, Vaneeta Allen. This ``Letter from a Nursing Home'' reminds us of some of the important issues many American families face every day.  Long-term care is a serious concern for many elderly and disabled Americans. Too many of our citizens face losing everything they have worked their whole lives for, just so they can pay for nursing home care. Medicare was not designed to provide coverage for long-term care, and long-term care insurance is often unavailable due to preexisting medical conditions, or it is out of financial reach for seniors. We must continue to explore other options to assist those like Vaneeta Allen who must rely on nursing home care.  This letter does not have all of the answers, but we will never have the answers if we lose sight of the struggles and simple dignity of people like Mrs. Allen.  I ask the letter be printed in the Record.  The letter follows:                                                   March 30, 1999.       Dear President Clinton: for the past four months my      grandmother has been in a nursing home. This has been a very      ``troubling time.'' I have spent the past four months      learning about the way we have failed to adequately provide      for those who built this country.       Actually this ``Letter from a Nursing Home'' came to me in      the middle of a sleepless night when I was struggling to      figure out some way to help my mom (grandmother) keep her      home. It would have broken her heart to lose her home.       It came to me that the least I could do was express her      feelings in words on paper. I was also her Power of Attorney.      I wrote the letter on the 14th and before I could mail it,      we, the family were called to her bedside. She died on March      18.       So I changed it from ``Letter from a Nursing Home'' to      ``Letter from Heaven'' and read it as a eulogy at her      funeral.       I appreciate the way you have always during your presidency      tried to guarantee the rights our fathers fought for to all      Americans.     Shirley Roney.                                  ____                       Letter From A Nursing Home                                                   March 14, 1999.     President William J. Clinton,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: My name is Vaneeta Allen. I will be 93      years of age on August 11, 1999, and for most of my adult      life, I have lived independently in a house I have owned.       My dad was a sharecropper. When I was a child, we never      owned our own home. It was my dream to own a home when I grew      up. I was the second of nine surviving children, the first      girl. I wanted to be a schoolteacher but had to quit school      at 13 to go to work to help support myself and my brothers      and sisters. The year was 1919.       When my children were little we lived through the Great      Depression and we celebrated when Franklin D. Roosevelt      raised the minimum wage so we could make as much as $1 a day      in the factory.       And finally, we bought for $5 an acre a little farm      southwest of Bonnie and moved ourselves and our two surviving      children into a 2-room house. We built on two bedrooms and a      bathroom and a kitchen. There, we, my husband and I, spent      our working years. The year was 1941.       And we sent our son and son-in-law off to war. There in      that home I stood with my ears to the radio listening to the      troop movements as our sons marched across Europe, afraid we      would lose our sons and maybe our country. Our sons saved our      country. And my son came home, but our son-in-law was nearly      killed in the Philippines and spent the rest of his short      life as a totally disabled veteran in and out of veterans'      hospitals. Our son was killed in a car crash on April 12,      1951, at 25 years of age.       Our family bought its citizenship with blood shed on two      foreign soils. But it was the price of liberty. We taught our      grandchildren, half of whom were fatherless and half of whom      were the children of a totally disabled father that the great      price they had paid was not in vain.       We taught them about the greatness of America and how all      men and women could live free.       In the early 60s, we were forced to sell our farm to the      government so they could build Rend Lake there. It was the      end of our farming years anyway and we needed to move away      from the farm. But our grandchildren cried because they      didn't want to leave that farm.       We built and moved into a home in Bonnie, a mile and a half      from our farm. And there we, my husband and I, lived together      until his death in 1981, and I lived until late October 1998,      when I was hospitalized after a fall and nearly died.       Now they tell me I cannot live independently. But I dream      every day of going home just one more time. Now, not by      choice, I am living in a nursing home. I have a nice room and      I am surrounded by others who are just like me. But those of      us who still are of sound mind want just to go home again.       When my husband and I retired, we thought we had adequate      savings. But inflation and high medical costs have taken all      of     my savings. Perhaps I lived too long, but still I want to      live.       Last year my total income from social security was $6,984,      but I managed to keep my home and pay my bills with that. The      only other income I had was less than $100 from renting some      land. This year my monthly income from social security per      month is $582. My checkbook total is now around $1500.       The cost of the nursing home is about $92 per day much of      which goes to medical costs, not for expensive paid help. If      anything, there needs to me more money for paid help.       I have been given two options to pay--either sell my home      and give up any hope of ever returning or get Public Aid      Assistance. In the hope of returning home, I applied for      Public Aid. Since my total income is $582 month, out of that      I must pay, to keep my home, electricity and gas $74, water      and sewer $25, trash pick up $15, house insurance ($367 per      year) or $32 per month. I also have paid and want to continue      to pay $103 per month for a medicare supplement.       That leaves $334 out of my social security to pay the      nursing home. And you know what is worse of all, I am made to      feel like a failure because I cannot pay out of pocket      $36,000 to $40,000 a year for a nursing home. And there are      thousands, maybe millions of me throughout this country.       Once we could borrow money on just our good names. Now our      homes have become the price of our aged care. Soon I fear      there will be a ``For Sale'' sign in my front yard and the      inexpensive treasures of my life will be divided or      discarded.       I take no comfort in that I am just one of many of this      nation's older citizens who once put a strap around our      waist, put our hands to the plow and took this great      agricultural nation from a horsepowered economy to the      richest most plentiful nation in the world who can put a man      on the moon at will.       Must we, the elderly, who helped build this country, have      to live to see ourselves stripped of our most prized      possessions, our homes, our dignity, our freedom and our      pride?       I know that you and Congress are about to embark on a      debate on Social Security and Medicare and other issues that      affect those of us who still survive though in our 90's. I      hope these debates will go beyond just economics and      statistics and look into the faces of those of us who make up      this population. We are more than statistics. We all have a      story to tell. Once we were all children. Most of us have      children and grandchildren and great grandchildren.       Once you wrote in a letter to my granddaughter Shirley      Roney ``I have worked throughout my life to empower people      who historically have been excluded from political, economic      and educational opportunities. I remain committed to      achieving that goal.''       In that particular letter you were speaking of racial      relations. I believe you when you say you have done these      things. I hope that in the remaining two years of your      presidency, you will be able to finish what you have started      in the areas of empowering all people who have been excluded      from the opportunities for which our sons fought to guarantee      to all Americans.           God Bless,     Vaneeta Allen.                          ____________________
