Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership and extraordinary efforts on behalf of all of the employees of the legislative branch. I know her deep concern for the Architect's office, which is a sort of hybrid of the legislative branch. I appreciate very much the gentlewoman giving credit to a lot of other people, but she has been the spark plug on this issue and the engine behind it.  I wanted to also say that Liz Dawson of our committee was extraordinarily helpful in getting us to this point, as well as the other staffers that were mentioned.  And more importantly, I know that the employees of the House and of the Architect's office and others on Capitol Hill appreciate the gentlewoman's work.
