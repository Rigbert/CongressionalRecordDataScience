And I just say that I cannot quite understand how we could get so many different versions of answers from this nominee. That is troubling to me. It concerns me. And I think it raises the question of whether or not he was coached in terms of avoiding or trying to avoid expressing his personal point of view.  I see other colleagues in the Chamber seeking recognition at this time. I have spoken earlier, and I will just say, before closing, I hope that those following this debate will understand the historic nature of the debate. What is at stake here is the question of the constitutional authority and responsibility of the Senate when it comes to the advice and consent given on judicial nominees.  We believe, on this side of the aisle--at least many of us do--that Miguel Estrada should be more forthcoming, should give us his writings so we can understand what is in his mind and what he would bring to this bench so we would have better answers to the basic questions we should ask every nominee from every President. To do otherwise is to relegate us to a minority status in terms of our major responsibility under the Constitution.  I yield the floor.
