President.  I regret that we are on such a tight constraint, because I think this is the most significant issue this Senate will be addressing certainly this year. We are talking about the lives of American citizens.  As one who is from Oklahoma and can see what type of terrorist devastation can take place, and realizing that the devastation in Oklahoma was one-thousandth of the power of the smallest nuclear warhead known, it is a very scary thing.  I believe right now--I don't think there is a Senator here who doesn't believe this--that there could very well be a missile headed our direction as we speak. It is not a matter of a rogue nation learning how to make missiles to deliver the weapons of mass destruction that we know they have. It is a matter of just getting that technology and those systems from a country that already does. China is such a country.  China fully has missiles that can reach Washington, DC, from any place in the world. We have no way in the world of knocking them down. We know that China is trading technology systems with countries like Iran--countries that would not hesitate to use missiles against us.  I wish I were speaking last, because there are going to be some things said about the exorbitant costs of such a system. We can complete a system to protect us against a limited missile attack for about $4 billion. In the case of our AEGIS ship system, we have 22 AEGIS ships that have the capability of knocking down a missile, but not an ICBM. We have a $50 billion investment in that system, and for only $4 billion more we could have that system to protect Americans.  I hope that people will give consideration to this resolution. I think it is the most significant resolution we will be considering this year.  I ask unanimous consent that three items pertaining to this matter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            [April 15, 1998]           Pakistan's First Test of Its New Ballistic Missile          (By Rahul Bedi, New Delhi and Duncan Lennox, London)       The first test of Pakistan's new ballistic missile, the      Hatf 5 or `Ghauri', took place on 6 April. Statements from      the Pakistani government said that the missile has a maximum      range of 1,500km, a payload of 700kg and a launch weight of      16,000kg.       Some earlier statements had implied that the `Ghauri' might      also be used as the basis for a satellite launch vehicle.       Currently described by government officials as ``a research      effort for the time being'', its indigenous development and      research status means that ``no international sanctions or      regimes apply to its development or production''.       Claims that the missile was tested over land are confusing      as the length of Pakistan's territory does not allow for the      range attributed to `Ghauri'. Other reports have indicated      that the missile was test launched from a location near      Jhelum in northeast Pakistan to the area southwest of Quetta,      a range of about 800km to 1,000km, which would agree with the      reported flight time of around eight minutes.       An earlier secret test of the `Ghauri' missile in January      was reported by the Islamabad News, which said that further      tests would be made before a public demonstration of the      missile on 23 March. The ``secret'' test probably refers to a      static motor firing and systems check-out, and is unlikely to      have been a flight test.       The `Ghauri' missile was not displayed during Pakistan's      National Day parade on 23 March. A missile similar to the      Hatf 1 short-range missile was the only ballistic missile      displayed.       Pakistani official statements are limited to the maximum      range, payload and launch weight. From the pictures released,      the missile is similar in shape to the earlier Hatf 1 design,      which is also similar to the Chinese M-9 (CSS-6/DF-15). The      launch weight of 16,000kg makes `Ghauri' much heavier than      the M-9, which has a launch weight of 6,000kg. This would      appear to support the payload weight quoted for `Ghauri' of      700kg over the maximum range of 1,500km.       It appears to be a scaled-up Hatf 1 single or two-stage      solid-propellant missile that may use some Chinese      technologies. The missile shown does not bear any resemblance      to the Chinese CSS-2 (DF-3), which uses liquid propellants      and has a launch weight of 64,000kg.       An alternative option might be that `Ghauri' is based on      the Chinese CSS-5 (DF-21) and CSS-N-3 (JL-1) ballistic      missile design, which has a launch weight of 15,000kg, a      payload of 600 kg and a maximum range of between 1,700km and      1,800km. The CSS-N-3 SLBM version entered service in 1983 and      the CSS-5 in 1987.       The Iranian `Shahab 3' ballistic missile project has a      similar range and payload to `Ghauri', and, although the      Iranians have never quoted a launch weight for `Shahab 3', it      might be in the 16,000kg bracket.       `Shahab 3' is believed to be an Iranian-developed single-     stage liquid-propellant ballistic missile, based on North      Korea's `Nodong 1' design, and a series of motor tests were      reported last year.       It is not clear whether Pakistan and Iran have shared      missile technologies, but their development approaches appear      to have followed relatively similar lines and in similar      timescales.       Unconfirmed reports have suggested that Pakistan and Iran      may have received either missiles or technologies associated      with the Chinese solid-propellant M-11 (CSS-7/DF-11) and M-9      programmes, and it is to be expected that there might have      been some assistance given both ways.                                  ____               [From the Daily Oklahoman, Sept. 8, 1998]                         Vulnerable and at Risk       Recently, U.S. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Tulsa, asked Gen. Henry      H. Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to comment      on a new report questioning U.S. readiness to deal with a      long-range missile attack. The general's response was      illuminating, particularly so in light of North Korea's      subsequent test of a missile capable of carrying nuclear      warheads.       Inhofe raised the issue after release of the Rumsfeld      Commission Report, warning a missile threat may come sooner      than many in the U.S. government think. The panel said it's      possible an enemy could develop a ballistic missile program      in a way that would give the United States little or no      warning before an attack.       In fairness, Shelton and the joint chiefs answer to Bill      Clinton, so it's not surprising they echo his      administration's soft-line on missile defense.       Shelton reiterated to Inhofe that the chiefs don't think a      real threat is near. They believe the United States should      continue to     comply with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and they      support Clinton's ``3-plus-3'' plan for a national missile      defense. The policy calls for three years of development with      another three years for deployment--if a missile threat is      identified. ``We remain confident that the Intelligence      Community can provide necessary warning of . . . an ICBM      threat,'' Shelton wrote.       Inhofe points out that U.S. intelligence was surprised by      India's nuclear testing this summer and considered attacks on      embassies in Africa unlikely. As for the ABM treaty, Inhofe      says it ``reinforces the discredited policy of mutual-assured      destruction at a time when the U.S. is being targeted by      numerous potentially undeterrable rogue states and      terrorists.''       Inhofe's ally on missile defense, U.S. Rep. Floyd Spence,      R-S.C., cut to the dangers of the Clinton administration's      ostrich-like approach to missile defense in an interview with      Frank Gaffney, director of the Center for Security Policy.       ``The first warning of a heart attack is a heart attack,''      Spence said. ``The Clinton administration's response to all      this is that we are working on a system and we are going to      experiment for about three years. And if the threat arises,      we will decide at that time whether or not to deploy. My God,      the threat is right now here, this minute, this moment, not      some time in the future.''       The Oklahoman urges Inhofe, Spence and other patriots in      Congress to hold hearings highlighting America's      vulnerability to missile attack.       Bold action is needed to counter Clinton's idle approach to      defending the U.S. against a grave and growing threat.                                  ____             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 8, 1998]                             Shooting Stars       ``Nothing in life is so exhilarating as to be shot at      without success,'' Winston Churchill once famously said.      Perhaps. But the Japanese might have a different take, having      now had North Korea fire a missile over their heads. In a      world where Pathan tribesmen with rifles have been replaced      by rogue states with ballistic missiles, Churchill would have      been the first to argue that the leader of the free world      needs more going for him then the other guy's bad aim. To      wit, a missile defense.       If the events of the past few weeks have taught us      anything, it is that the bad guys out there--Saddam Hussein,      Kim Jong II, Osama bin Laden and the like--are not kidding      when they threaten to blow up Americans. What we don't yet      know is just how many of them have the capability to follow      through on their threats, though recent tests by both North      Korea and Iran confirm that some are not that far away. We      shouldn't have to wait until a missile lands in Times Square      to find out.       Unfortunately that is precisely what Democratic Senators      have been doing. Back in March, GOP Senator Thad Cochran      introduced a bill calling for the U.S. ``to deploy as soon as      is technologically possible an effective National Missile      Defense System capable of defending the territory of the      United States against limited ballistic missile attack.''      When the motion to move it to the floor for debate and      amendments came up, it fell just one vote shy of the 60      needed. All 41 opposed were Democrats. While bin Laden bombs,      the Democrats filibuster.       They have a chance to redeem themselves when the      reintroduced petition comes up for a vote tomorrow. Events      since the March 13 filibuster have tragically underscored      just how irresponsible a move it was: India and Pakistan have      exploded nuclear bombs; Iran and North Korea have tested      ballistic missiles; Saddam Hussein has forced U.N. inspectors      to a standstill; and bin Laden blew up two American embassies      in Africa.       Indeed, it has lent a prophetic tone to the findings of the      Rumsfeld Commission, a team of defense experts which in July      warned that America's enemies could deliver a ballistic      missile threat to the U.S. within five years of any decision      to acquire such a capability. More ominously, the Rumsfeld      report warns that ``during several of those years, the U.S.      might not be aware that such a decision has been made.''       In face of these tangible threats, the continued Democratic      preference for arms control agreements in the bush over real      defense capabilities in the hand is baffling. And our guess      is that an American public that has now watched North Korea      and seen for itself some of bin Laden's handiwork also would      be a hard sell. We wouldn't be surprised, then, if these      developments, coupled with a President suffering from a      severe loss of moral authority, might lead some of these      Democrats to consider whether they want to continue to block      debate about ways to protect Americans--especially the 13      Democratic Senators up for re-election which follow:                           Up for Re-election       Democratic senators who voted against closure on the      American Missile Protection Act of 1998.

Harry Reid, Nevada.       Ron Wyden, Oregon.       Source: Coalition to Defend America.       Bill Clinton might have his own second thoughts. It is      worth asking whether Mr. Clinton could even have taken the      limited action he did against sites in Afghanistan and the      Sudan had bin Laden somehow managed to buy a missile of his      own--or pay the North Koreans or Iranians to shoot one off      for him.       Likewise, could George Bush have prosecuted the Gulf War if      Saddam Hussein had had a missile capability? As Mr. Clinton      has had impressed on him, just four or five warheads in hands      like Kim Jong II's pose a far more immediate and practical      threat to American lives and interests than the 2,000 or so      in the Russian arsenal. Especially given North Korea's      willingness to sell its missiles to anyone with cash.       Providing an American President with the wherewithal to      shoot down a ballistic missile on its way to an American city      shouldn't be a partisan issue. But if the Democrats decide      again to make it one in the coming vote, that would be a      persuasive Republican argument for a filibuster-proof      Republican Senate. If we ever get a missile defense system      this country needs, we may owe more to Monica Lewinsky and      Osama bin Laden than we do to our Democratic Senators.
