Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside County, California are exceptional. Lori Stone will be retiring from the March Joint Powers Authority after a distinguished career that spanned over 20 years.  Lori began working with the March Joint Powers Authority (JPA) in 1994 after stepping forward to utilize her local knowledge of military base reuse. She has served as the Executive Director of the JPA since being promoted in 2006. In addition to the 365-acre airport, the JPA oversaw the development of the 1,200-acre Meridian Business Park and over 600 acres of land for future development. Lori described her early days with JPA as a ``learn as you go'' process because of the lack of precedent with local, state, and federal agencies. Over the years, Lori has forged relationships with the Air Force, Army, Federal Aviation Administration, Navy, and the Department of Veterans Affairs to assist in furthering the goals of the JPA, March Air Reserve Base, and the Inland Empire region.  Lori has amassed a large and impressive list of accomplishments while working as Executive Director of the JPA. She successfully advocated for the passage of federal legislation to authorize a land swap between the Army, Navy and JPA allowing for the redevelopment of an area of March Air Reserve Base to be more comprehensive. Lori helped expand the local foreign trade zone outside of the JPA boundaries to help enhance the region's economic tools. Additionally, Lori spearheaded the US Vets project, securing investments of over $10 million and locating 7.5 acres for the project. The undertaking will serve more than 100 homeless veterans and their families.  In light of all that Lori has done for the Riverside County community and the March Joint Powers Authority, it is only fitting that she be honored for her many years of dedicated service. Lori's tireless passion for our military and public service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our community. I am proud to call her a fellow community member, American and friend. I add my voice to the many who will be congratulating Lori on the celebration of her retirement.                          ____________________
