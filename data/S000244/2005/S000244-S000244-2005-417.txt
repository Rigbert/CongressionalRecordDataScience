Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, the manager's amendment simply makes clear that private roads and those that are open to the public, free or by toll, and flood control facilities are covered under the exceptions of the bill. It also includes a savings clause making clear that nothing in the legislation shall be construed to affect the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, which requires the Federal Government to pay the displacement costs of those adversely affected by the Federal Government's use of eminent domain.  The manager's amendment also incorporates into the bill's sense of congress section some language provided by the Resources Committee regarding the effect of the abuse of eminent domain on irrigation and reclamation projects and on public lands.  I urge my colleagues to support the improvements made by this manager's amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
