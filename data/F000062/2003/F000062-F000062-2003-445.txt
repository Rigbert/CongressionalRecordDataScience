 President, I am pleased to introduce the ``Privacy Act of 2003.''  This legislation would establish, for the first time, a comprehensive national system of privacy protection.  It would: require companies to gain consumers' written consent prior to selling their most sensitive personal information including personal health information, financial information, Social Security numbers, and drivers' license data; and require companies to provide consumers' notice and an opportunity to refuse to allow their less sensitive personal information to be sold.  Simply put, this legislation would give consumers more control over how their personal information is used.  The personal information of today's consumer is too vulnerable to abuse. With access to sensitive data so widely available--often just at the touch of a keyboard--it is easy to understand why identity theft has become one of the country's fastest growing crimes.  Recent statistics on the growth of identity theft suggest we have no time to waste in protecting personal privacy.  Identity theft is the number one consumer complaint reported to the Federal Trade Commission. American consumers filed approximately 163,000 identity theft complaints with the FTC in 2002. Fully 43 percent of all the complaints the FTC receives are about identity theft.  An estimated 700,000 cases of identity theft occur each year. The average victim spends an average of 175 hours over a two-year period clearing off an average of $17,000 fraud off their credit reports.  My own State, California, has more victims than any other state. The FTC recorded 30,738 identity theft cases last year from California consumers alone.  While modern technology has increased the threat to personal security and privacy, the protections for individual privacy have not kept pace. Our country's privacy laws form an incomplete and inconsistent patchwork.  For example, Americans enjoy the highest level of privacy protection concerning the names of the movies they rent at a video store. But, at the same time, it is perfectly legal to sell another person's Social Security number over the Internet.  The Privacy Act would establish a Federal privacy standard that adjusts the level of privacy protection according to the sensitivity of the information at issue.  The legislation provides the highest level of protection for a person's most sensitive data--personal financial data, health data, driver's license information, and Social Security numbers.  For this sensitive data, the bill gives the individual ultimate control over whether or not his or her information is shared. If an individual does not actively decide to permit sharing of personal data, the data is not disclosed.  Specifically, this legislation tightens the privacy provisions of the Financial Services Modernization Act, commonly known as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. Under Gramm-Leach-Bliley, a bank can share a customer's personal information with other companies so long as it gives consumers notice and the right to opt-out of the data sharing.  The problem with opt-out is that most people toss out their privacy notices from banks along with the rest of the unrelenting pile of commercial solicitations they receive. Since the passage of Gramm-Leach-Bliley, banks have sent out over one billion privacy notices.  According to available published information, fewer than 5 percent of bank customers have opted out of sharing their personal information, and for many financial institutions, the response rate has been less than one percent.  It is not surprising that consumers do not respond overwhelmingly to these notices, since, by some estimates, the average American household received a dozen of these notices. A consumer should not have the burden of constantly monitoring how his or her most sensitive personal information is shared with other companies.  Accordingly, the Privacy Act prohibits the sale or disclosure of sensitive personal financial information to third parties unless the consumer affirmatively consents or opts in.  This legislation also toughens Federal financial privacy laws for affiliate sharing and joint marketing. An affiliate is a company that is linked by common ownership with another company. Under Federal law, a bank can share with affiliates or joint marketing partners regardless of whether the consumer wants this information shared.  The Privacy Act of 2003 would require that banks give consumers the option of opting out of the sharing of their personal financial information with the bank's affiliates or joint partners.  Some banks argue that affiliates are just branches of an organization, and a bank should for efficiency purposes be able to share data within the entire organization. In an era where a bank had one or two affiliates, that might be true.  But, now, some companies are so big that if a customer has no control overaffiliate sharing, then the customer is unable to prevent the disclosure of their data to hundreds of companies. For example, in recent testimony before Congress, U.S. PIRG reported that Citibank has 2,761 affiliates, Key Bank had 871 affiliates, and Bank of America has 1,576 affiliates.  Similarly, a customer must be able to restrict a bank's sharing of personal information with its joint venture partners if the customer wants to maintain control over his personal information.  I would also like to describe several other key components of the financial privacy section.  The bill prohibits banks from denying a customer a financial product or financial service just because the customer chooses to not disclose his personal information to third parties, affiliates, or joint venture partners. However, the bill does allow banks to offer incentives to customers to encourage them to permit the sharing of their personal information.  Additionally, the bill permits banks to disclose, but not sell, personal information to third parties for vital public interest purposes such as identifying or locating missing and abducted children, witnesses, criminals and fugitives, parents delinquent in child support payments, organ and bone marrow donors, pension fund beneficiaries, and missing heirs.  Just as with financial data, personal health data deserves the most stringent privacy protections.  The recently adopted Department of Health and Human Services privacy regulations set a basic opt-in framework for disclosure of health information. But more can be done to protect patient privacy.  The regulations only prohibit ``covered entities''--namely health insurers, health providers, and health care clearinghouses--from selling a patient's health information without that patient's prior consent.  Meanwhile, non-covered entities such as business associates, health researchers, schools or universities, and life insurers are not subject to this opt-in requirement, except through contractual arrangements.  This legislation would preserve the privacy of health information wherever the information is sold. Any business associate, life insurer, school or non-covered entity trying to sell or market protected health information would, like covered entities, have to get the patient's prior consent.  Drivers' license data also is given the strongest level of protection under this bill.  With its recent amendments, the Driver's Privacy Protection Act, DPPA, offers some meaningful protections for drivers privacy.  For example, under the DPPA, a State Department of Motor Vehicles must obtain the prior consent, Opt-in, of the driver before ``highly sensitive information''--defined as the driver's photograph, image, Social Security number, medical or disability information--can be disclosed to a third party.  However, loopholes remain. Other sensitive information found on a driver's license deserves equal protection.  The Privacy Act would expand the definition of ``highly sensitive information'' to include a physical copy of a driver's license, the driver identification number, birth date, information on the driver's physical characteristics and any biometric identifiers, such as a fingerprint, that are found on the driver's license.  Thus, this bill would ensure consumers have control over how their motor vehicle records and driver's license data are used.  I would like to take a moment to highlight the Social Security number section of the privacy bill, which reflects over four years of negotiation with Senator Hatch, Senator Gregg, Senator Grassley, Senator Baucus, and other Senate colleagues. I have also introduced this section as a stand-alone bill, Senate bill 228.  It is crucial to protect Social Security numbers because the numbers are the key to a person's identity. Many identity theft cases start with the theft of a Social Security number. Once a thief has access to a victim's Social Security number, it is only a short step to acquiring credit cards, driver's licenses, or other crucial identification documents.  Not surprisingly, members of the public have flooded our Federal agencies with pleas for assistance. Reports to the Social Security Administration of Social Security number misuse have increased from 7,868 in 1997 to 73,000 in 2002--an astonishing increase of over 800%.  The Feinstein/Gregg compromise bars the sale or display of Social Security numbers to the public except in a very narrow set of circumstances.  Display or sale is permitted if the Social Security number holder consents or if there are compelling public safety needs.  Government entities will have to redact Social Security numbers from electronic records that are readily available to the public on the Internet.  Moreover, State governments will no longer be permitted to use the Social Security number as the default driver's license number.  The legislation, however, recognizes that some industries rely on Social Security numbers to exchange information between databases and complete identification verification necessary for certain transactions.  Thus, the bill directs the Attorney General to develop regulations allowing for the sale or purchase of Social Security Numbers to facilitate business-to-business and business-to-government transactions so long as businesses put appropriate safeguards in place and do not permit public access to the number.  Recognizing that not all personal information merits the same restrictions, the bill permits businesses to collect and sell nonsensitive personal information, e.g., name, phone number, address, to third parties so long as they give customers notice and the opportunity to opt-out of the sale.  The opt-out standard for non-sensitive information means that if a person fills out a warranty card, signs up for a computer service, or submits an entry for a sweepstakes, the business must notify him before it sells his personal information to other businesses or marketers.  This framework guarantees basic privacy protections for consumers without unduly impacting commerce.  To further minimize the regulatory burden of these privacy rules, the bill sets up a safe harbor so that industries and industry-sponsored seal programs which have already adopted Notice-and-Opt Out information policies, will be exempt from the regulatory requirements of the legislation.  To ensure uniformity of the laws across all 50 states, the bill preempts inconsistent state laws regarding the treatment of non-sensitive information.  A jumbled patchwork of State privacy laws helps neither businesses nor consumers. Consumers will have confused expectations about what information is protected.  Another distinguishing characteristic of the Privacy Act of 2003 is that it protects the privacy of information regardless of the medium through which it is collected.  Other privacy proposals have tried to confine privacy legislation to the Internet.  These proposals unfairly discriminate against high technology users. Put simply, companies and other entities can misuse personal information from off-line sources just as easily as with on-line sources.  For example, telemarketers who besiege consumers with phone calls during the dinner hour do not typically get customer information from the Internet. Much of the identifying information used to make these calls comes from consumers filling out and mailing back warranty and registration cards.  Regardless of how information is collected, it should get equal protection.  This legislation codifies steps Congress can take to protect citizens from identity thieves and other predators of personal information.  It restores to an individual more control over his or her most sensitive personal information such as Social Security numbers, health information, and financial information. It also sets reasonable guidelines for businesses that handle our personal information every day.  A byproduct of our information economy--personal information is much more vulnerable to exploitation than ever before.  Every American has a fundamental right to privacy, no matter how fast our technology grows or changes. Aperson should be able to have control over how their most sensitive personal information is used.  But our right to privacy only will remain vital, if we take strong action to protect it.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the legislation be printed in the Record.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact the Privacy Act of 2003.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 745       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

TITLE II--SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER MISUSE PREVENTION     SEC. 201. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The inappropriate display, sale, or purchase of social      security numbers has contributed to a growing range of      illegal activities, including fraud, identity theft, and, in      some cases, stalking and other violent crimes.       (2) While financial institutions, health care providers,      and other entities have often used social security numbers to      confirm the identity of an individual, the general display to      the public, sale, or purchase of these numbers has been used      to commit crimes, and also can result in serious invasions of      individual privacy.       (3) The Federal Government requires virtually every      individual in the United States to obtain and maintain a      social security number in order to pay taxes, to qualify for      social security benefits, or to seek employment. An      unintended consequence of these requirements is that social      security numbers have become one of the tools that can be      used to facilitate crime, fraud, and invasions of the privacy      of the individuals to whom the numbers are assigned. Because      the Federal Government created and maintains this system, and      because the Federal Government does not permit individuals to      exempt themselves from those requirements, it is appropriate      for the Federal Government to take steps to stem the abuse of      social security numbers.       (4) The display, sale, or purchase of social security      numbers in no way facilitates uninhibited, robust, and wide-     open public debate, and restrictions on such display, sale,      or purchase would not affect public debate.       (5) No one should seek to profit from the display, sale, or      purchase of social security numbers in circumstances that      create a substantial risk of physical, emotional, or      financial harm to the individuals to whom those numbers are      assigned.       (6) Consequently, this title provides each individual that      has been assigned a social security number some degree of      protection from the display, sale, and purchase of that      number in any circumstance that might facilitate unlawful      conduct.
