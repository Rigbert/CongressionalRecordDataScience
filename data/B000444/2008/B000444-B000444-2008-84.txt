 I believe the Bunning amendment is well intended, but I think the irony is the Bunning amendment fails to understand what it was that was intended at the first effort to bring forward PEPFAR and get this underway.  As I said, we had a number of nations that needed help badly denying the need for help because they viewed it reflected so negatively on them as a people and as a nation. So we did a lot of things the first time around that now, in the clear light of day, and much broader need, and the fact that PEPFAR and the world Global Fund is being embraced by the rest of the world, that actually acts as an impediment if we went back to Senator Bunning's proposal.  So at the appropriate time, 5 o'clock, I am going to suggest again that my colleagues support a ``no'' vote. We will have an up-or-down vote on this amendment and vote no on the Bunning amendment, which would quite frankly eviscerate, literally eviscerate the President's initiative.  I will conclude by saying, I am often critical of the President and his foreign policy and his aid programs, et cetera. But the President of the United States, George W. Bush, deserves great credit. If the President did nothing else in his administration, this is justification enough for his legacy to be looked back on favorably because of the phenomenal and dramatic impact this initiative has had and will have in the rest of the world.  I yield the floor.
