President, the amendment pending before us now is the Portman amendment proposed by the Senator from Ohio. We spoke about it yesterday.  First, let me recognize that he is trying to assist the Army in modernizing the Stryker, which is a very critical piece of equipment. But I want to reiterate some of the concerns I have about the amendment. I know Senator Portman will be here shortly to make a final comment on the amendment.
