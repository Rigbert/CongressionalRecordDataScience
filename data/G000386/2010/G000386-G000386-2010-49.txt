  We are on a bill now on the Senate floor that is supposed to create jobs. Hopefully, this bill will create jobs. But it is kind of small compared to what this Congress could do by passing the biodiesel tax credit. It should have been passed before December 31 last year. Senator Baucus and I put together a bipartisan bill to do it in February. That bill was delayed by the majority leader, so we are back here again for a third time, trying to get attention to jobs. This biodiesel tax credit will immediately put 20,000 more people back to work, and 2,000 in my State of Iowa.  I hope we will suspend the rules and create jobs for sure because those jobs were there before December 31 and they will be there on September 17 if we pass this amendment.  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
