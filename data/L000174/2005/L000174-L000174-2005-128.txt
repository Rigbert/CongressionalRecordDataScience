President, I commend my colleagues across the aisle who are attempting to address the treatment of detainees in U.S. custody, despite resistance from members of their own party and the strong opposition of the White House. I know Senator Graham has worked closely with Senator McCain and others to give our troops the clear guidance they need to effectively detain and interrogate enemy prisoners, and I commend him for that. The legislative branch has not met its obligation of oversight and policymaking in this area. For months, Senator Graham has been prodding the Congress to take action. He is one of the few members of his party to forcefully speak out on the need to change the administration's policies.  While I support Senator Graham's efforts on these issues, I cannot support his amendment to strip Federal courts of the authority to consider a habeas petition from detainees being held in U.S. custody as enemy combatants.  The Graham amendment would deny prisoners who the administration claims are unlawful combatants the right to challenge their detention. At no time in the history of this Nation have habeas rights been permanently cut off from a group of prisoners. Even President Lincoln's suspension of habeas was temporary. The Supreme Court has held numerous times that enemy combatants can challenge their detention.  Many of my colleagues across the aisle argue that terrorists do not deserve access to our Federal courts. This argument would be far more persuasive if all of the detainees at Guantanamo Bay were terrorists. Unfortunately, many of them are almost certainly not. Numerous press accounts have quoted unnamed officials who believe that a significant percentage of those detained at Guantanamo do not have a connection to terrorism. And yet they have been held for years without the right to challenge their detention in a fair and impartial hearing, a situation that does significant harm to our Nation's reputation as a leader in human rights and which puts our own soldiers at risk.  Filing a writ of habeas corpus is often the detainee's only opportunity to openly challenge the basis for his detention. Providing detainees this right is not about coddling terrorists--it is about showing the world that we are a nation of laws and that we are willing to uphold the values that we urge other nations to follow. It is about honoring and respecting the principles that are part of our heritage as Americans and that have been a beacon to the rest of the world. Allowing a detainee to file a habeas petition provides legitimacy to our detention system and quells speculation that we are holding innocent people in secret prisons without any right to due process.  Some Members of the Senate have argued that these prisoners should be tried in the military justice system. I think that we could all agree on such a course if the administration had worked with Congress from the start and established with our approval procedures that are fair and consistent with our tradition of military justice. I introduced a bill in the 107th Congress to do just that. So did Senator Specter. The fact is, that the system that has been established by the administration to try individuals held at Guantanamo is not a system that reflects our values. It does not give due process or independent review.  Everyone in Congress agrees that we must capture and detain terrorist suspects, but it can and should be done in accord with the laws of war and in a manner that upholds our commitment to the rule of law. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on detainee issues in June. At that hearing, Senator Graham said that once enemy combatant status has been conferred upon someone, ``it is almost impossible not to envision that some form of prosecution would follow.'' He continued, ``We can do this and be a rule of law nation. We can prove to the world that even among the worst people in the world, the rule of law is not an inconsistent concept.'' I agree with Senator Graham, but I strongly believe that in order to uphold our commitment to the rule of law, we must allow detainees the right to challenge their detention in Federal court.  As Chairman Specter noted on the floor last week, there are existing procedures under habeas corpus that have been upheld by the Supreme Court that do not invite frivolous claims, and that are appropriate. Senator Graham's amendment would not only restrict habeas in a manner never done before in our Nation, but, as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee said last week, it would open a Pandora's box.  The chairman is right. He spoke forcefully again this morning about the danger of such court stripping efforts. We must not rush to change a legal right that predates our Constitution. Creating one exemption to the ``great writ'' only invites more. The Judiciary Committee has jurisdiction over habeas corpus and it should have the first opportunity to review any proposed changed carefully and thoroughly. Although congressional action on theissue of foreign detainees is long overdue, we must not act hastily when the ``great writ''--something that protects us all--is at stake.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from the deans of four of our Nation's most prestigious law schools that articulates the dangers of adopting the Graham amendment.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                November 14, 2005.       Dear Senator Leahy: We write to urge that the Senate adopt      the amendment of Senator Bingaman removing the court-     stripping provisions of the Graham Amendment to the      Department of Defense authorization bill. As professors of      law who serve as deans of American law schools, we believe      that immunizing the executive branch from review of its      treatment of persons held at the U.S. Naval Base at      Guantanamo strikes at the heart of the idea of the rule of      law and establishes a precedent we would not want other      nations to emulate.       At the Guantanamo Naval Base, the Government has subjected      foreign nationals believed to be linked to Al Qaeda to long-     term detention and has established military commissions to      try a small number of the detainees for war crimes. It is      entirely clear that one of the Executive Branch's motivations      for detaining noncitizens at Guantanamo was to put their      treatment beyond the examination of American courts.       The Supreme Court rejected the Government's claim in Rasul      v. Bush that federal habeas corpus review did not extend to      Guantanamo. The extent of the rights protected by federal      habeas law is now before the Federal Court of Appeals for the      D.C. Circuit. Another challenge has been filed to the      authority of the President, acting without congressional      authorization, to convene military commissions at Guantanamo.      Just last week the Supreme Court announced that it would      review the case, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld.       The Graham Amendment would attempt to stop both of these      cases from proceeding and would unwisely interrupt judicial      processes in midcourse. Respect for the constitutional      principle of separation of powers should counsel against such      legislative interference in the ongoing work of the Supreme      Court and independent judges.       Unfortunately, the Graham Amendment would do much more.      With a minor exception, the legislation would prohibit      challenges to detention practices, treatment of prisoners,      adjudications of their guilt and their punishment.       To put this most pointedly, were the Graham Amendment to      become law, a person suspected of being a member of Al Qaeda      could be arrested, transferred to Guantanamo, detained      indefinitely (provided that proper procedures had been      followed in deciding that the person is an ``enemy      combatant''), subjected to inhumane treatment, tried before a      military commission and sentenced to death without any      express authorization from Congress and without review by any      independent federal court. The American form of government      was established precisely to prevent this kind of      unreviewable exercise of power over the lives of individuals.       We do not object to the Graham Amendment's procedural      requirements for determining whether or not a detainee is an      enemy combatant and providing for limited judicial review of      such decisions. This kind of congressional structuring of the      detention of military prisoners is long overdue, and it      highlights the absence of congressional regulation of      standards of detainee treatment and the establishment of      military commissions. Curiously, the Graham Amendment      recognizes the need for judicial review of the determination      of enemy combatant status, but then purports to bar judicial      review of far more momentous commission rulings regarding      determinations of guilt and imposition of punishment.       We cannot imagine a more inappropriate moment to remove      scrutiny of Executive Branch treatment of noncitizen      detainees. We are all aware of serious and disturbing reports      of secret overseas prisons, extraordinary renditions, and the      abuse of prisoners in Guantanamo, Iraq and Afghanistan. The      Graham Amendment will simply reinforce the public perception      that Congress approves Executive Branch decisions to act      beyond the reach of law. As such, it undermines two core      elements of the rule of law: congressionally sanctioned rules      that limit and guide the exercise of Executive power and      judicial review to ensure that those rules have in fact been      honored.       When dictatorships have passed laws stripping their courts      of power to review executive detention or punishment of      prisoners, our government has rightly challenged such acts as      fundamentally lawless. The same standard should apply to our      own government. We urge you to vote to remove the court-     stripping provisions of the Graham Amendment from the pending      legislation.     T.
