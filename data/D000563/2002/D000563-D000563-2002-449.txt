 The Dorgan/Grassley amendment would limit the amount of direct and counter cyclical payments to $75,000 annually, limit marketing loans and loan deficiency payments to $150,000 annually; and provide a husband and wife allowance of $50,000 annually. Also, I might add, individuals who earn more than $2.5 million in adjusted gross income (net) would not be eligible for payments.  In short, the proposal would reduce the ceiling on annual crop payments to individual farmers from $460,000, under current law to $275,000. Furthermore, the amendment is expected to save approximately $1.2 billion over 10 years.  The savings of this amendment would go to important things like: funding for nutrition by raising the standard deduction for food stamp eligibility; farm profitability with emphasis on small and moderate sized farms; risk management for producers of specialty crops that currently have no coverage; and research for programs that provide competitive grants for biotech, genomics, food safety, new uses, natural resources.  In short, the Dorgan/Grassley amendment would level the playing field with regard to the distribution of farm subsidies, and prevent many of the nation's largest farms from getting a lion-share of the federal subsidies.  Thank you, I urge all of my colleagues to support the Dorgan/Grassley amendment.
