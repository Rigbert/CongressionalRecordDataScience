If someone owned a daycare facility and hired, without any background check and without adequate investigation, an employee with a long criminal record of being a sexual predator, someone hired this person to work in a daycare center and that employee then harmed one of the children at the daycare center, I think the Senator from Rhode Island and I would agree that many would argue that daycare center was negligent, it had a responsibility it did not meet, and that this daycare center should be held responsible, even in court, for the harm that came to the child.  The example that the Senator from Rhode Island used was a gun manufacturer, who hired employees with long criminal records, including felonies, that had guns stolen out of the manufacturing plant by some of these employees with criminal records, and the guns were then used on the street to harm innocent people.  In the second example we have used--not the daycare center but the gun manufacturer--this bill would say you can sue the daycare center because they didn't do a background check on the employee who molested the children, but you can't hold the gun manufacturer liable for hiring employees with a criminal record, putting guns on the street and killing innocent children.
