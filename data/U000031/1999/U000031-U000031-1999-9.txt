Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  I would just like to respond to the gentleman from Colorado that in Michigan we have more traffic that crosses the Ambassador Bridge than goes to Japan in terms of exports, and in fact at the Ambassador Bridge some 24,000 vehicles cross that bridge every day, over a thousand vehicles an hour, and giving an optimistic estimate of about 2 minutes per border crossing if this system became implemented. It has been estimated that this would result in 17 hours of delay for every hour's worth of traffic. We cannot stand that, and the Midwest cannot stand that, and that is one of the reasons why we are pursuing this motion to instruct the conferees to try and repeal section 110 and allow a vote to do so.
