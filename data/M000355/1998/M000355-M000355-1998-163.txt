 President, I ask unanimous consent a letter to Secretary Albright on the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 1998.     Hon. Madeleine K. Albright,     Secretary of State, Department of State,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Albright: We are writing to bring to your      attention the very troubling issue of the United States      assisting foreign entities which promote an agenda hostile to      the interests of our country. We cite the example of the      Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation (PBC), which has been      benefitting from U.S. assistance while engaging in a campaign      in support of violence and hatred against the United States,      our ally Israel, and the goal of peace in the Middle East.       As you well known, U.S. foreign assistance programs are      designed to promote democratic ideals and respect for human      rights. U.S. agencies which have distributed U.S. assistance,      however, have failed at times to determine beforehand if the      organizations they are funding promote these basic ideals. In      the specific case of the PBC, it is apparent that neither      USAID, which has provided hundreds of thousands of dollars      via interagency agreements to engage in programs with the PBC      and other media outlets, nor USIA/USIS Jerusalem, which has      been the recipient of much of the funding, has assessed the      value of these programs for U.S. interests in the Middle      East.       Despite its awareness of the PBC's activities and the      resulting harm to U.S. interests, USIA committed the U.S. to      pay for two TVRO satellite dishes for the PBC's use in      exchange for their commitment to use seven hours of Worldnet      broadcasting a week. Although we commend efforts to further      the reach of Worldnet, we are concerned that the PBC's letter      of acceptance for the equipment does not stipulate which      programming will be shown and during what time periods. In      essennce, we provided the PBC with equipment that could be      used to import broadcasts from Iraq, Iran, Libya and other      nations hostile to the United States in exchange for a      commitment to show a sporting event at 3:00 a.m.       It is our belief that the U.S. should support a free and      independent media around the world. As USIA/USIS has      recognized, however, the PBC is the official broadcasting arm      of the Palestinian Authority, which is engaged in a campaign      to restrict a free press and promote violent progaganda. The      PBC consistently broadcasts programming that attempts to      undermine all the United States seeks to achieve in the      Middle East.       Madame Secretary, we ask you to formulate a clear U.S.      policy to terminate U.S. taxpayer support for the PBC, while      encouraging programs that promote genuine press freedoms by      supporting independent journalists. We will be working in the      Senate to implement such a policy and feel that a unified      response on this important issue is warranted.       We thank you for your consideration of this issue and look      forward to working with you to advance U.S. interests in the      Middle East more effectively.
