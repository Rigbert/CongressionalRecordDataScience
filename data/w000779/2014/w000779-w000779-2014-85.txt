President, on Monday, the Finance Committee reported S. 2260, the Expiring Provisions Improvement Reform and Efficiency (EXPIRE) Act of 2014, and S. 2261, the Tax Technical Corrections Act of 2014.  At the time that the bills and accompanying reports were filed, the statements of the Congressional Budget Office, required under section 402 of the Budget Act, were not yet available, and, in each case, the committee report indicated that the statements would be provided separately.  I ask unanimous consent to have the CBO statements printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2014.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Chairman, Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for the Tax Technical      Corrections Act of 2014.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Logan      Timmerhoff.           Sincerely,                                             Douglas W. Elmendorf,                                                         Director.       Enclosure.     Tax Technical Corrections Act of 2014       The Tax Technical Corrections Act of 2014 would make      various clerical corrections, clarifications, and conforming      and other technical changes to the Internal Revenue Code.      Those provisions that the bill would modify were originally      enacted in a variety of laws, including the American Taxpayer      Relief Act of 2012, the American Recovery and Reinvestment      Act of 2009, and the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. In      addition, the bill would repeal many elements of the Internal      Revenue Code that are not used in computing current taxes and      thus are obsolete.       The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)      estimates that the bill would have no budgetary effect.      Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending or      revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply.       JCT has determined that the bill contains no      intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in      the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Logan      Timmerhoff. The estimate was approved by David Weiner,      Assistant Director for Tax Analysis.                                  ____                                                    U.S. Congress,                                  Congressional Budget Office,                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2014.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     Chairman, Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for the Expiring      Provisions Improvement Reform and Efficiency (EXPIRE) Act.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Barbara      Edwards.           Sincerely,                                             Douglas W. Elmendorf,                                                         Director.       Enclosure.     Expiring Provisions Improvement Reform and Efficiency          (EXPIRE) Act       Summary: The Expiring Provisions Improvement Reform and      Efficiency (EXPIRE) Act would reinstate and extend certain      expired and expiring tax provisions through December 31,      2015; most of the provisions expired on December 31, 2013,      and would be retroactively reinstated, but a few are      scheduled to expire on December 31, 2014. In some cases those      provisions would be extended and amended. The bill also would      make several additional changes to tax law.       The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT)      estimates that enacting the bill would reduce revenues by      about $81.3 billion over the 2014-2024 period. A small      portion of those estimated reductions in revenues, less than      $0.1 billion over the period from 2014 to 2024, results from      off-budget (social security) revenues. CBO and JCT also      estimate that the bill would increase direct spending by $2.8      billion over the 2014-2024 period.       On net, JCT and CBO estimate that enacting the bill would      increase deficits by about $84.1 billion over the 2014-2024      period. Pay-as-you-go procedures apply because enacting the      legislation would affect revenues and direct spending.       JCT has determined that the provisions of the bill contain      no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in      the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA).       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated      budgetary impacts of the bill are shown in the following      table.

Congressional Budget Office and staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.Note: Details may not add to totals because of rounding; * = between -$50 million and $50 million.       Basis of estimate: JCT provided the estimates of all      provisions except one dealing with outlays of certain rum      excise taxes. The estimates reflect an assumed enactment date      of July 1, 2014.       Extensions of individual tax provisions: The individual      income tax provisions would reduce revenues by $17.0 billion      and increase outlays by $0.1 billion over the 2014-2024      period, JCT estimates. Those amounts include, among others,      the extension of provisions that allow:       Individuals to claim state and local sales taxes as an      itemized deduction in lieu of state and local income taxes in      calculating their individual income tax liability; JCT      estimates that the revenue reduction would total $6.5 billion      over the 2014-2024 period.       An exclusion from gross income for the discharge of      indebtedness on a principal residence; JCT estimates that the      revenue reduction would be $5.4 billion over the 2014-2024      period.       Individuals to claim the refundable health coverage tax      credit, which JCT estimates would reduce revenues by $28      million and increase outlays for refundable tax credits by      $106 million over the 2014-2024 period.       Extensions of business tax provisions: The business tax      provisions would reduce revenues by $50.4 billion over the      2014-2024 period, JCT estimates. In addition, CBO estimates      that outlays would increase by $0.3 billion over the 2014-     2024 period. Those amounts include, among others, provisions      that allow:       Businesses to qualify for both additional first-year      depreciation of 50 percent of the basis for qualifying      property and additional expensing (that is, immediate      deduction from taxable income) for qualifying property under      section 179 of the Internal Revenue Code. JCT estimates that      those provisions would reduce revenues by $101.8 billion over      the 2014-2015 period, and increase revenues by $95.7 billion      over the 2016-2024 period, with the net effect of reducing      revenues by $6.0 billion over the 2014-2024 period.       Businesses to claim the research tax credit, which JCT      estimates would reduce revenues by $16.0 billion over the      2014-2024 period. The provision would extend the credit in      effect in 2013 in modified form.       Certain foreign subsidiaries that engage in banking,      financial, and related businesses to defer taxation of      certain income until it is repatriated to the U.S. parent      corporation; JCT estimates that the provision would reduce      revenues by $10.4 billion over the 2014-2024 period.       The Treasuries of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands to      receive increased payments relating to excise taxes on rum      manufactured in those places as well as rum imported from      other countries. CBO estimates that those payments, which are      recorded in the budget as outlays, would total $336 million      over the 2014-2024 period.       Extensions of energy tax provisions: The extension of the      energy tax provisions would lower revenues by about $19.6      billion over the 2014-2024 period. The provision with the      largest effect on revenues--reducing them by an estimated      $13.3 billion over the 2014-2024 period--would extend to the      end of 2015, the date by which construction must begin in      order for renewable power facilities to be eligible for the      electricity production credit or the investment credit in      lieu of the production credit.       Debt collection contracts: The bill would require the      Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to contract with private      collection agencies to collect payments of certain tax      liabilities. JCT estimates that the provision would increase      revenues by $4.8 billion over the period from 2014 to 2024.      The IRS would retain up to 25 percent of the amount collected      by the private collection agencies to pay for the services of      those collection agencies. In addition, up to an additional      25 percent would be retained by the IRS to fund a program of      personnel hiring and training related to tax compliance, and      to administer the contracts with private collection agencies.      As a result, direct spending would increase by $2.4 billion      over the 2014-2024 period.       Other provisions: JCT estimates that the remaining      provisions in the bill would increase revenues by $1.0      billion over the 2014-2024 period. The provision with the      largest effect on revenues would allow the Treasury      Department to levy up to 100 percent of a payment to a      Medicare provider to collect unpaid taxes; JCT estimates that      the provision would increase revenues by $0.8 billion over      the 2014-2024 period. JCT also estimates that a provision      that would apply penalties to tax preparers who fail to      exercise certain due diligence requirements for claims of the      refundable child tax credit would reduce outlays for      refundable tax credits by $40 million over the 2014-2024      period.       Pay-as-you-go considerations: The Statutory Pay-As-You-Go      Act of 2010 establishes budget-reporting and enforcement      procedures for legislation affecting direct spending or      revenues.
