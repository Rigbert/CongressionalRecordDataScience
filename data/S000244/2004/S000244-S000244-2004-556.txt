Speaker, on October 5, 2004, the Committee on the Judiciary filed its report on H.R. 4453, the ``Access to Rural Physicians Improvement Act of 2004.'' At that time, the Committee had not received a Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for the bill, and it filed the report with a committee cost estimate as provided in clause 3(d)(2) of Rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives. Subsequently, the Committee received the CBO cost estimate on H.R. 4453, and I am submitting it here for the record.                                                 October 15, 2004.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 4453, the Access      to Rural Physicians Improvement Act of 2004.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Mark      Grabowicz, who can be reached at 226-2860.           Sincerely,                                              Douglas Holtz-Eakin.       Enclosure. Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate H.R. 4453, Access to Rural      Physicians Improvement Act of 2004, As passed by the House of                    Representatives on October 6, 2004       CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 4453 would result in      no significant net cost to the federal government. The act      would affect direct spending, but we estimate that any      effects would be insignificant. H.R. 4453 contains no      intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in      the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would impose no costs on      state, local, or tribal governments.       Until June 1, 2004, foreign students attending medical      school in the United States were permitted to remain here      after graduation if they agreed to work for at least three      years in certain regions considered to be underserved by      physicians or if they accepted employment with certain      federal agencies. That program was limited to 30 individuals      a year for each state that participated in the program. Under      current law, such individuals must return to their native      countries. H.R. 4453 would make several changes to that      program and would reestablish it through June 1, 2006.       Based on the participation of foreign medical students in      those employment programs in recent years, CBO expects that      the act's provisions would affect no more than 2,000 persons      annually. The Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services      (CIS) would collect fees to provide work permits for those      individuals. CIS fees are classified as offsetting receipts      (a credit against direct spending). The agency is authorized      to spend such fees without further appropriation, so the net      impact on CIS spending would be insignificant.       The CBO staff contact for this estimate is Mark Grabowicz,      who may be reached at 226 2860. This estimate was approved by      Robert A. Sunshine, Assistant Director for Budget Analysis.                          ____________________
