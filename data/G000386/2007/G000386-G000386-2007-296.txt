 President, the issue is the level of civil and monetary penalties. If the fines are nothing more than the cost of doing business, you can't change behavior and you can't deter bad behavior. My feeling is the levels in this underlying bill are not high enough to get the attention of the drug companies. After all, if a company does what it is supposed to do, a drug company doesn't need to fear any penalties. It is that simple.  I ask my colleagues to support my amendment so it has real teeth.
