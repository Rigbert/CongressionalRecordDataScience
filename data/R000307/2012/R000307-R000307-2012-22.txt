President, on behalf of Chairwoman Stabenow, myself, Senator Thune, and every farm organization and commodity group in America, I rise in opposition to this amendment. It will impact every single producer in the program, not those that exceed this arbitrary limit or ``rich producers.'' The rest will pay higher premiums when they are out of the program because that is what happens with an insurance pool.  I have no doubt, just as sure as I am standing here and the Senator from Oklahoma is sitting there and contemplating this, that under this amendment we will soon return to the days of low crop insurance participation, multibillion-dollar ad hoc disaster programs, just as in the 1990s--$36 billion over 10 years, $11 billion in 1 year. These are a disaster to plan, to legislate, and to implement.  If you are for these ad hoc disaster programs, you better hide for at least 6 weeks in your office. We just passed two where you are hiding for 2 and 4. Now you are going to have to hide in your office for 6 weeks. Don't hide in your office for 6 weeks. Vote no.
