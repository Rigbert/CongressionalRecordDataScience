  Mr. President, while I am pleased that we are voting today on three judicial nominees and I am supporting them, I am concerned about those whom we are not voting upon--in particular two fine nominees from California.  I am also concerned about what appears to me to be a plan to force the splitting of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit by crippling its ability to do its work.  Ten of the twenty-eight judgeships on that court are now vacant--36 percent of the bench.  I will ask unanimous consent that a table showing the status of each vacancy within the ninth circuit be place in the Record following my remarks.  I believe that proponents of the ninth circuit split wish to keep these seats vacant as long as possible, so that the vacant judgeships can then be transferred to the new twelfth circuit, and filled by judges who they hope will be more in line with their own political philosophy.  Unfortunately, this plan is substantially impairing the ability of the ninth circuit to do its job, and impeding justice for the millions of Americans who live within the ninth circuit --creating what the Honorable Proctor Hug, chief justice of the ninth circuit, has called a vacancy crisis.  The time has come for the Senate to end this death by attrition, and act upon these nominations, so that the ninth circuit can get on with its work.  These votes we are taking today will clear out all the judicial nominees who remain on the executive calendar, except for three, two of whom, as I have mentioned, are from California  These two nominees, Margaret Morrow and Anthony Ishii, have had their nominations pending longer, both in the Senate and on the floor of the Senate, than have two of the three nominees upon whom we are voting today.  Margaret Morrow was first nominated almost a year and a half ago, onMarch 18, 1996. She was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee on June 27, 1996, but the Senate failed to take further action upon her nomination before we adjourned.  She was nominated again in the beginning of this year, and favorably reported by the committee again on June 12, 1997.  Anthony Ishii was nominated on February 12, 1997, and has been on the floor since July 10.  In contrast, Christopher Droney and Janet Hall were nominated on June 5, 1997, and have only been on the floor since July 31.  So while I am happy that we are acting upon their nominations, I hope that we will soon act upon the older nominations of Margaret Morrow and Anthony Ishii.  Let's bring their nominations up, debate them if necessary, and vote them up or down.  I urge the distinguished majority leader to do this, I thank the chair, and I yield the floor.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent a table regarding the ninth circuit vacancies be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the table was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                Vacancy                               Nomination   Court and vacancy created by--            Reason              date               Nominee              date   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------           NINTH CIRCUIT                                                                                                                                                                                                        CCA:                                                                                                              Breezer, Robert R................
