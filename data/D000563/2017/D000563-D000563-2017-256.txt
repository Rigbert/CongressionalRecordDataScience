. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. The motion is supported by Senator Blumenthal.  Over the past few months, I have met with many heroes in the disability community, including a woman in Illinois who has a 23-year-old son with autism. She told me that Medicaid allows her son to be at home and function independently.  She told me that, without Medicaid, her son would have to be in a facility she couldn't afford.  You know what else all of these advocates and fighters tell me? They tell me that the Republican healthcare repeal proposals--all of which decimate the Medicaid Program in order to give tax breaks to the wealthy--would be devastating for people with disabilities.  Medicaid is a lifeline for 11 million people with disabilities. It is the core of our commitment to care for them, and it helps us meet our basic obligations as a society.  That is why my motion to commit would instruct the Finance Committee to report out a bill--within 3 days--that protects children and adults on Medicaid with disabilities from increased costs and fewer benefits.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Motion to Commit With Instructions       Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the      Committee on Finance with instructions to report the same      back to the Senate in 3 days, not counting any day on which      the Senate is not in session, with changes that--       (1) are within the jurisdiction of such committee; and       (2) ensures no individuals with disabilities on Medicaid      lose benefits, have reduced provider payments for services      furnished to them, or have any increase in out-of-pocket      costs.
