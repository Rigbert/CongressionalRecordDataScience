Mr. Speaker, our guest chaplain for the morning is the Reverend Doug Tanner. Doug Tanner is a Methodist minister, native of the great State of North Carolina, a man of great faith, a man of dedication, a man of commitment.  Doug Tanner was inspired by God Almighty to do what I call get in the way. Somehow and some way he was touched, not just by the spirit of history, but by the spirit of the Almighty to find a way to bring Members together, both Democrats and Republicans, both Members of the House and Members of the Senate. Doug was inspired to become the founding father ofFaith and Politics. Through this organization, through this effort, he has been a blessing to many of us.  So, Reverend Doug Tanner, we want to thank you for being here today, but we want to thank you for helping all of us to become better people of faith.  Many of our colleagues may not know that many of us get together with you from time to time to put our faith in action. You have led many of us to go back to Alabama and visit the historic sites of the civil rights movement; to go to Tennessee and do likewise; to go to Farmville, Virginia; to go to South Africa. Again, we want to thank you for helping us to be reconciled to others.  When historians pick up their pen and write about this period during this part of our congressional lives, they will have to say that the Reverend Doug Tanner made a lasting contribution to the cause of justice, to the cause of freedom, and made each one of us better human beings and better legislators and better individuals of faith. I thank the Reverend.                          ____________________[Pages H4797-H4798]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]               WELCOMING REVEREND W.
