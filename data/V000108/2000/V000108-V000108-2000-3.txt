Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I rise for two purposes. The first is to add my voice to that of the gentleman from California (Chairman Packard) and to acknowledge to my colleagues that there is an agreement as far as the changes that were made on energy and water. It obviously is now included in part of the underlying legislation. I would ask for their support.  The second point I would make is that I believe that the bill relative to the Veterans Administration, Housing, Urban Development, and Related Agencies also deserves our support, and will congratulate the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh), as well as the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. Mollohan), for their work.  Again, I do urge my colleagues to support this legislation.
