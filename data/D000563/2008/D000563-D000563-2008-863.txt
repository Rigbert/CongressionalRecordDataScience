It sounds like a great idea if you happen to be in the lucky 7,000 club. This lucky 7,000 club that will be benefitted by Senator Kyl's amendment will have a great outcome. It appears that everyone loses--I take that back. Everyone but China and Japan and other countries will be losers in this proposal by the Senator from Arizona. Is that correct?
