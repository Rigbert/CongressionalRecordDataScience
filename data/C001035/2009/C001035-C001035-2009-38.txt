President, prior to Senator Reid offering his proposal, the pending business before the Senate was an amendment I offered earlier this week, which was designed to promote better transparency, accountability, and oversight within our government.  I am deeply disappointed that a procedural tactic will be invoked to prevent an up-or-down vote on my amendment, which is designed to bring the proliferation of czars under the normal process.  The amendment I proposed would have ensured that the 18 new czar positions appointed by this administration could be held accountable to Congress and to the American people. The proliferation of czars under the current administration to manage some of the most complex and important issues facing our country has created serious problems in oversight, accountability, and transparency. It is of great concern to me that these positions circumvent the congressional requirements foroversight. They circumvent the constitutional process by which the Senate is supposed to give advice and consent to major policy positions within our government.  I have a list of the 18 new czar positions that have been created by this administration. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 Czars        Positions in the Executive Office of the President (10)       Central Region Czar: Dennis Ross.
