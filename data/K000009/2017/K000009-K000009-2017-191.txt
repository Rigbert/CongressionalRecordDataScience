Speaker, let me be clear: between 1933 and 1945, 14 million unarmed men, women, and children were murdered in Eastern Europe. These bloodlands were where most of Europe's Jews lived and where Hitler's and Stalin's imperial plans overlapped. Of the 14 million human beings who were killed, at least 6 million were Jewish souls. Their carnage was the largest in human history.  Thus, the brevity of the Trump administration's statement was surprisingly and unusually short and general--only about 100 words. When the White House was asked about these glaring omissions, multiple officials in the new administration at the White House merely confirmed ``the statement was no mistake.''  The Trump White House statement chose not to explicitly acknowledge the deaths of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust. This is atypical of any former President of our country. Moreover, the Trump statement implies that the recognition of the death of Jews during the Holocaust would come at the exclusion of other groups. The tone of those remarks takes the reader in the direction of denying the suffering of the Jewish people.  For the President not to mention Jews is a terrible omen.  So let us go through some history. The term ``holocaust,'' arising from World War II, has come to mean annihilation of Jewish persons. From 1933 to 1945, those Jewish souls who perished in Europe totaled at least 6 million human beings. Between 2.7 million and 3 million Jews were murdered in Nazi-run death camps. In the USSR, 1,340,000 Jewish deaths were ordered by Joseph Stalin. At least 1.5 million of the victims forcibly killed by Hitler and Stalin were children.  Cumulatively, this carnage represented about two-thirds of the 9 million Jews who had resided in Central Europe. By way of explanation, for the 8 million Christians and others who were also murdered, the term generally used to describe their carnage is martyrdom. As an example, in Poland, 3 million Catholic Christian Poles were martyred by Nazi and Soviet killing machines.  The Holocaust also included Stalin's mass executions and forced starvationand relocation of Soviet prisoners of war to fight in horrendous places like the Battle of Monte Cassino after being marched through the Middle East. Many of them were buried in Tehran.  Stalin also perpetrated a massive post-war ethnic and religious cleansing of Jews and non-Jews. As Hitler and Stalin fought for control of the European continent, over 14 million innocent people--these aren't soldiers I am talking about. This was in addition to the 14 million--women, children, and men who were civilians died in their vastly evil plunder. Millions of Eastern Europeans were trapped between the two most murderous regimes in not only European history, but human history: Nazi Germany and Communist Soviet Union.  As an aside, I found it chilling that President Trump's top adviser, Steve Bannon, in an address to the Vatican in 2014, referenced in a most troubling line of thought the name of Julius Evola and his murderous movement.  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record excerpts of an article entitled ``This is How Steve Bannon Sees the Entire World,'' which is also available at www.buzzfeed.com.                     [From BuzzFeed News Reporter]             This Is How Steve Bannon Sees the Entire World                          (By J. Lester Feder)       Donald Trump's newly named chief strategist and senior      counselor Steve Bannon laid out his globalist nationalist      vision in unusually in-depth remarks delivered by Skype to a      conference held inside the Vatican in the summer of 2014.       Bannon: I think it's a little bit more complicated. When      Vladimir Putin, when you really look at some of the      underpinnings of some of his beliefs today, a lot of those      come from what I call Eurasianism; he's got an advisor who      harkens back to Julius Evola and different writers of the      early 20th century who are really the supporters of what's      called the traditionalist movement, which really eventually      metastazied into Italian fascism. A lot of people that are      traditionalists are attracted to that.       One of the reasons is that they believe that at least Putin      is standing up for traditional institutions, and he's trying      to do it in a form of nationalism--and I think that people,      particularly in certain countries, want to see the      sovereignty for their country, they want to see nationalism      for their country. They don't believe in this kind of pan-     European Union or they don't believe in the centralized      government in the United States. They'd rather see more of a      states-based entity that the founders originally set up where      freedoms were controlled at the local level.       I'm not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that      he represents, because he eventually is the state capitalist      of kleptocracy. However, we the Judeo-Christian West really      have to look at what he's talking about as far as      traditionalism goes--particularly the sense of where it      supports the underpinnings of nationalism--and I happen to      think that the individual sovereignty of a country is a good      thing and a strong thing. I think strong countries and strong      nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors, and      that is really the building block that built Western Europe      and the United States, and I think it's what can see us      forward.
