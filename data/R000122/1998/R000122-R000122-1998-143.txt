President, I rise today to formally introduce legislation that would amend the Internal Revenue Code to deny tobacco companies any tax deduction for their advertising and promotional expenses when those ads are aimed at America's most impressionable group, children.  This bill addresses a key element in our ongoing public debate on tobacco: the industry's ceaseless efforts to market to children. My legislation can stand on its own, or can easily be incorporated into a comprehensive tobacco bill. With or without congressional action on the state attorney generals' tobacco settlement, it is time for Congress to put a stop to the tobacco industry's practice of luring children into untimely disease and death.  I am pleased to be joined today in introducing this legislation with Senators Boxer and Chafee, and I urge the rest of my colleagues to join us in this effort to protect America's children.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1755       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Health      Preservation and Tobacco Advertising Compliance Act''.     SEC. 2.
