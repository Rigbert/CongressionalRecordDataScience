President, I also tell my colleague from Vermont that the distinguished senior Senator from Alabama once noticed a Vermont flag flying here. And the distinguished Senator from Vermont and I have both been to Antarctica and have flown Vermont flags. I commented that that is what has been done with it. It has been flown in Antarctica, the South Pole, the coldest spot on Earth.  The distinguished Senator from Alabama looks up and says, ``From what I hear from Vermont, the flag probably felt right at home.''                          ____________________
