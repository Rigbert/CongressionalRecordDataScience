President, for the most part, this has been a substantive debate. Actually, it has been a necessary debate. Now, partisans on the other side of the aisle at times have tried to smear anyone who has voiced concern about this nomination, notwithstanding that anyone who listened to the statements of those of us who oppose this nomination know that each of us has praised the journey Alberto Gonzales and his family have taken.  I am a grandson of immigrants who came to this country not even speaking the language, so I have unbounded respect for all that he and his family have accomplished. In fact, I am the first Leahy to get a college degree; my sister is the second. So I applaud anybody who takes such a journey.  On Tuesday, the Senate heard from Senators Feinstein, Schumer, Kennedy, Mikulski, Dayton, and Stabenow. Yesterday, the debate on this side of the aisle included eloquent and powerful statements by Senators Byrd, Durbin, Jack Reed, and Jeffords, all stating their reasons for opposing this nomination on the merits. No one should be accusing these Senators of doing anything except their constitutional duty. Today, we heard as well from Senators Dodd, Obama, Cantwell, Bingaman, Johnson, Levin, and Feingold. Each has spoken from conviction. They are voting their conscience.  We have also made time to hear from one of our newer Democratic Senators, Mr. Salazar of Colorado, regarding the assurances and commitments he has obtained from the nominee and on which he is relying in his vote. I also note that today he returned to the Senate floor to make another important statement that rejected those who have tried to play a divisive ethnic card. He spoke about the true meaning of diversity and our national journey toward equal rights for all. Senator Salazar spoke to me before he spoke on the floor. I commend him for what he has done. I thank him for his remarks. It is what I would have expected from a man of his integrity and quality.  Senator Biden observed during the confirmation hearing that none of us came to that hearing having determined to vote against the nomination. In fact, most of us, I would say, if not all of us on the Democratic side of the aisle in the Judiciary Committee came there assuming we were going to vote for him. We listened. We asked questions. We sought answers. We weighed the record.  It was not an easy decision for any of us. Each of us would have liked to have supported the first Hispanic nominee to be Attorney General. We each made a decision on the merits of the nomination. We did not ignore his judgments that contributed to the scandals in the war against terror and the mistreatment of detainees around the world. Some have said that some of those positions were embarrassing. They were a lot more than embarrassing; they were a complete scandal.  When this nomination was announced last year, many of us were inclined to support Judge Gonzales. But as the confirmation process unfolded, one by one, members of the Judiciary Committee began to have doubts. Many were troubled by the nominee's refusal to engage with us in an open discussion of his views on a wide range of issues.  I was particularly concerned because I had actually sent to him and to the Republicans in the committee a number of the questions I was going to ask so he would have plenty of time to prepare to answer. Instead, he did not answer.  For some, the key question was how Judge Gonzales interprets the scope of Executive power and his belief that the President possesses authority to ignore our laws when acting as Commander in Chief. No President of the United States can ignore our laws, no President of the United States is above the law any more than any of us are above the law. For others, the tipping point was the nominee's continued adherence to flawed legal reasoning regarding torture, a stubborn commitment betraying seriously poor judgment. Finally, and deeply troubling to many of us, is the nominee's lack of independence from the President.  In the end, after serious consideration of the record, each of us arrived at the same conclusion: In good conscience, we could not vote for this nomination.  Now, some have talked about the legal memos he was involved in as legal niceties. Well, Mr. President, torture is not a legal nicety, especially if you are the person being tortured. Those of us who have been in the military or who have had members of our family in the military have always hoped we would hold to the highest standards so we could demand that other countries do the same.  It is wrong for partisans to castigate Senators for debating this nominationand for considering the critical role this nominee played in the development of legal policies that were kept hidden for a couple years, but when they were brought forward by the press, not in answer to questions by Members of Congress--the press did our work and brought them forward--those so-called legal niceties could not stand the light of day.  Consistent with my oath of office, the commitment I have had to the people of Vermont for over 30 years, I will vote my conscience again today. I urge each and every Senator to do the same. Review the record, truly review the record and the actions of this nominee over the past 4 years and vote accordingly.  I do not think I have ever been on the floor of this Senate and predicted vote totals. I am not going to today. But I will predict this: Democratic Senators will not vote as a block. Some will vote against this nomination; some will vote in favor of this nomination. They will do so not on the basis of some party caucus position but as individual Senators. I urge all Senators--Republicans and Democrats and Independent--to approach this vote in that way, on the merits, after you review the record in good conscience. This should not be a party-line vote on either side of the aisle but one where each Senator votes his or her best judgment.  Many Senators here today no doubt believe that the President is owed a high degree of deference in his Cabinet choices. I feel that way. But that does not erase our constitutional obligations as Senators. We have a duty to advise and consent, not to listen and rubberstamp. I take that responsibility very seriously, especially in the case of the Attorney General. The Attorney General is unique among Cabinet officers. You can give a lot more flexibility to other Cabinet officials whose main purpose is simply to state the position of the President of the United States. Whether you agree with the position, that is their duty. So you give a lot more deference, and you say: Well, they are going to state the position of the President. We can vote for them.  But the Attorney General is different. He or she is the top Federal law enforcement officer in the land. The power and discretion of the Attorney General is enormous. The Attorney General has to have sufficient independence to uphold the law and enforce the law, even if doing that serves to embarrass or disadvantage the President, even if it means taking a position contrary to what the President may want, because you have to enforce the law.  Now, when Judge Gonzales was designated and appeared in the White House with the President, he offered a very significant insight into how he views the role of the Attorney General. He emphasized how much he looked forward ``to continuing to work with friends and colleagues in the White House in a different capacity on behalf of our President.''  During his confirmation hearing, he appeared to continue to serve as a spokesman for the administration and to be its chief defense lawyer on a wide variety of important matters. His defenders here on the Senate floor have excused his answers by characterizing them as the views of the administration.  We are voting on the Attorney General of the United States, not the Attorney General of the President. The Attorney General must represent the interests of all Americans and is the nation's chief law enforcement officer.  One of the key questions raised by this nomination is whether, if confirmed as Attorney General, the nominee will serve not just this President but all the American people, and whether he will show the independence necessary to enforce the law. We have to know that he is there to represent all of us. We have to know that he can enforce the law and not be worried about friends, colleagues, or benefactors at the White House. The Attorney General's duty is to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law, not try to find ways to circumvent it to fit the desires of any President.  Actually, the President, when you come right down to it, as well as the Nation, are best served by an Attorney General who gives sound legal advice and takes responsible action without regard to political considerations. Others in the Cabinet are there to just voice the opinions of the President. The Attorney General has to be a lot more independent.  I raised this matter of independence with Judge Gonzales when he testified, and I reiterated it in a letter I sent to him before his hearing. I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                   Committee on the Judiciary,                                 Washington, DC, December 3, 2004.     Hon. Alberto R. Gonzales,     Counsel to the President,     The White House, Washington, DC.       Dear Judge Gonzales: I enjoyed our preliminary meeting and      look forward to your confirmation hearings. In following up      on our meeting, and to give you and your staff ample      opportunity to prepare for the hearings, I write to reiterate      several concerns that I have raised in prior discussions and      correspondence. When we met on November 17, 2004, I said that      these issues will be raised, by myself and other members of      the Senate Judiciary Committee, during the upcoming hearings.      Based on our conversation, I am encouraged by your      willingness to answer questions about your role and your      views in these matters.       Photographs and reports of prisoner abuse in Iraq and other      locations show an interrogation and detention system      operating contrary to U.S. law and the Geneva Conventions. In      addition to the abhorrent images from the Abu Ghraib prison      that were published last spring, actions that have occurred      with Administration approval include the forcible rendition      of individuals to nations where they may face torture, and      the hiding of ``ghost detainees'' from the International      Committee of the Red Cross. Reports of abuse continue to      emerge. Just this week, The New York Times reported that the      Red Cross has charged U.S. military authorities with using      physical and psychological coercion ``tantamount to torture''      on prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The Washington Post is      reporting that in December 2003 Army generals in Iraq were      warned in a confidential report that members of an elite      military and CIA task force were abusing detainees. According      to The Post, the report concluded that certain arrest and      detention practices could be deemed to be ``technically''      illegal.       In letters dated May 17 and June 15 of this year, I asked      you to describe your role in both the interpretation of the      law and the development of policies that led to what I and      many others consider to have been a disregard for the rule of      law. These letters remain unanswered.       My concerns regarding the abuse of prisoners in U.S.      custody did not begin with these letters. I have been seeking      answers from the Administration for well over a year, before      the abuses at Abu Ghraib came to light. In a very few cases      my questions were answered, but with information that later      proved to be less than accurate. For example, in a news      conference on June 22, 2004, you stated, ``In Iraq, it has      always been U.S. position that Geneva applies. From the early      days of the conflict, both the White House and the      Department of Defense have been very public and clear      about that.''       However, an October 24, 2004, article in The Washington      Post revealed yet another Justice Department memo authorizing      actions that potentially violate the Geneva Conventions. The      draft memo, dated March 19, 2004, apparently was written to      authorize the CIA to transfer detainees out of Iraq for      interrogation--a practice expressly prohibited by the Geneva      Conventions. According to the memo's cover letter, it was      drafted at your request.       In another example, a June 25, 2003, letter from Department      of Defense General Counsel William Haynes stated that the      United States was adhering to its international obligations      including those under the Convention Against Torture. We      later learned of an August 1, 2002, Department of Justice      memorandum that twisted the definition of torture in      unrecognizable ways. That memo was addressed to you. We also      learned months later of the rendition of a Canadian-Syrian      citizen to Syria, despite his fear of being tortured there,      and despite the Syrian government's well-documented history      of torture. Unnamed CIA officials told the press that this      man was in fact tortured in Syria.       The Committee and the Senate will want to know your role in      these situations and your views with regard to the      development of the legal justifications that appear to      underlie so many of these actions. You will be called upon to      explain in detail your role in developing policies related to      the interrogation and treatment of foreign prisoners. The      American public and the Senate that will be called upon to      confirm your appointment deserve to know how a potential      Attorney General, the chief law enforcement officer in the      nation, will interpret and enforce the laws and how you will      develop policy.       We want to know what the current policy on torture is, but      since the Administration disavowed the August 1, 2002, memo,      no public statement of policy has replaced it. Questions      remain unanswered on a host of issues. Requests to the White      House and the Department of Justice for relevant documents--     including my requests to you in May and June of this year--     have been ignored or rejected. I     urge you and the Administration to provide the documents that      have been requested by myself and others without further      delay so that the hearings will be well informed.       Another key concern you will be called upon to discuss is      how you view the duties and responsibilities of the Attorney      General. As we discussed, I view the White House Counsel      position and that of the Attorney General as quite distinct.      You may well have viewed this President as your ``client''      while serving him at the White House, although the courts do      not recognize an attorney-client privilege in that setting.      We will want to know how differently you will act and view      your responsibilities as the Attorney General of the United      States. finally, I encourage you to commit to cooperating      with all members of the Judiciary Committee on issues of      oversight and accountability. In the 108th Congress, the      Judiciary Committee failed to fulfill its oversight      responsibilities. Accountability and improving government      performance are sound and long established purposes of      congressional oversight, and accountability has been lacking      on these and other crucial issues. With a new Congress, and a      new Attorney General, I expect a return to the diligent      oversight envisioned by our Founders to ensure that the      Executive Branch remains accountable to the American people.       Our meeting was a constructive beginning at the start of      the confirmation process, and I look forward to your hearing      early next month. In the meantime, Marcelle and I send our      best wishes to you and your family and hope that you have a      restful and rewarding holiday season.           Sincerely,                                                    Patrick Leahy,                                        Ranking Democratic Member.
