Speaker, it is with great respect and admiration that I recognize Catholic Charities, Diocese of Gary, as the organization celebrates its 75th anniversary. During the celebration, which will take place on Friday, October 5, 2012, at the Center for Visual and Performing Arts in Munster, Indiana, Catholic Charities will also take time to honor my dear friend, Monsignor Joseph Semancik, for his 38 years of dedicated service to the organization.  Catholic Charities, a part of the Diocese of Gary, has been helping to meet the needs of citizens throughout Northwest Indiana for the past 75 years. It is a private, not-for-profit social service agency that serves Lake, Porter, LaPorte, and Strake Counties in Northwest Indiana. Catholic Charities, established in 1937, was originally part of the Diocese of Fort Wayne until 1957, when it became part of the Diocese of Gary. Initially, its function was to serve the underprivileged and needy through programs that would meet the professional standards of social work. However, throughout the years, Catholic Charities has focused its attention on programs that meet the changing needs of the community. In recent years, counseling, volunteer programs, and programs for the elderly and family life ministry have been added. Catholic Charities has been triumphant due to the unwavering dedication of its staff, board members, volunteers, and donors. Catholic Charities is a remarkable organization that is dedicated to serving those most in need and has been an extraordinary asset to the community. Northwest Indiana is not only grateful, but proud to have had the organization's support and help during the past 75 years.  Born in 1929, Joseph Semancik was ordained a Catholic priest in 1953 and in 1984 was named a Domestic Prelate with the title Monsignor. First and foremost, Monsignor Semancik is a man of God, who has tirelessly discharged his sacred duties with vigor, compassion, and an uncommon practicality. Generous to a fault with this time and commitment to help those most in need, Monsignor Joseph Semancik was deeply involved for most of his entire adult life with Catholic Charities, both locally and at the national level. A holder of a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago, Father Semancik is an author and teacher as well. In his ``spare time,'' Monsignor was the local Diocesan Director of Catholic Relief Services, representing North America on a planning committee for Caritas Internationalis, a union of 145 Catholic Charities organizations worldwide. He also was a founder of Hospice of the Calumet Area and one of the originators of the Indiana Catholic Conference. Monsignor Semancik currently serves on the Board of Trustees of Calumet College of Saint Joseph, the Board of Directors for Saint Catherine Hospital, the Board of the Community Foundation of Northwest Indiana, and is a member of the Lake County Advancement Committee.  The recipient of numerous awards, I believe Joe Semancik is probably most gratified by the respect and affection shown by those innumerable individuals whose spirit, body, and mind were guided, made whole, and yes made to laugh, because this good man touched their lives. It is an honor to consider Monsignor Joseph Semancik a friend, and it has been a privilege for each of us in Northwest Indiana to have had our lives enriched by this good and holy man.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Catholic Charities and Monsignor Semancik. For their remarkable commitment to serving those most in need, Catholic Charities and Monsignor Semancik are to be highly commended, and they serve as an inspiration to us all.                          ____________________
