Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, methane hydrates which consist of a mixture of methane and water frozen into a solid crystalline state have great energy potential and are found in many areas throughout the world. The U.S. Geological Survey's 1995 national assessment of United States oil and gas reserves estimated the value of U.S. in-place methane hydrate resources to be an astounding 320 quadrillion cubic feet of gas.  By comparison, the United States annually consumes about 33 trillion cubic feet of methane as natural gas. The world's currently known gas reserves are about 5 quadrillion cubic feet. H.R. 1753 directs the Secretary of Energy in consultation with the Secretaries of Commerce, Defense and the Interior and the director of the National Science Foundation to commence a program of methane hydrate R It authorizes the Secretary of Energy $5 million for fiscal year 2001, $7.5 million for fiscal year 2002, $11 million for fiscal year 2003, and $12 million for each of fiscal years 2004 and 2005 to carry out the programs.  The bill also authorizes the Secretary of Energy to award grants or contracts to, or enter into cooperative agreements with, institutions of higher education and industrial enterprises to conduct methane hydrate R                              {time}  1415  It requires that all such awards be made available based upon a competitive merit review process. It limits administrative expenses to not more than 5 percent and prohibits any funds from being used for either the construction of the new building or alteration of an existing building, including site grading and improvement in architect fees.  It allows the Secretary of the Interior to award methane hydrate Rcontracts and grants to and to enter into cooperative agreements with qualified entities under the Marine Mineral Resources Research Act of 1996. It sunsets the methane hydrate R program after the end of fiscal year 2005, and it requires the Secretary of Energy to engage the national research council to conduct a study of the progress of the program and to make recommendations for future methane hydrate R needs. The NRC report is to be transmitted to Congress not later than September 30, 2004.  Mr. Speaker, the House unanimously approved a similar version of H.R. 1753 last October, which the Senate amended in November. I commend this revised version of the bill which represents the bipartisan agreement with the Senate to the House for its adoption.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
