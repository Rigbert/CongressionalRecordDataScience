 President, the Biotechnology Industry Association analyzes both the Bond-Frist bill and the Feinstein-Kennedy bill, which is a second bill that addresses cloning. This interesting analysis, representing the entire biotechnology industry of the United States, makes a very important point, that whatever we do here impacts on human research in a multitude of different areas, and most particularly it affects cancer research. Mr. President, I will comment on this paper and also comment on a number of other items.  The American Association for Cancer Research's letter to Senator Connie Mack urges that there be a 45-day delay in enacting any legislation until definitions and implications of legislation can be determined in a more reasonable and thoughtful manner and in an open and public process. They are calling for reason, they are calling for thoughtful deliberation, they are calling for a public process. Who can deny that on a very complicated subject?  The Whitehead Institute--and specifically Gerald R. Fink, a Director of the American Cancer Society, Professor of Genetics--in his letter talks about the limited ability to develop cell-based strategies, which will take place if the Bond-Frist bill is ramrodded through this body.  The American Society for Reproductive Medicine has written a letter urging this body to vote no on the Bond-Frist legislation.  The American Psychological Association has written to us urging that we delay, that there be discussion and debate, and they point out that we need to protect research efforts in this area.  The American Association for the Advancement of Science has said that they are deeply concerned about the ethical and scientific issues. They warn us: ``Use great caution in moving with this legislation.''  Even the College of Veterinary Medicine from the University of Missouri, Colombia, has written to this body urging caution.  The University of California at San Francisco, Roger A. Pederson, Professor and Research Director of the Reproductive Unit of the Department of OB/GYN and Reproductive Science, has written to this body urging caution and restraint as well.  I ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              American Society for                                        Reproductive Medicine,                                 Birmingham, AL, February 5, 1998.       Dear Senator Kennedy: The American Society for Reproductive      Medicine (ASRM) urges you not to allow the Bond Human Cloning      Prohibition Act (S. 1601) to be brought to the floor for a      vote today, and if it is, to vote against it.       ASRM is very concerned that in the rush to make human      cloning illegal, Congress will inadvertently outlaw very      serious and promising medical research that may uncover cures      to some of the most deadly diseases. Cloning is a highly      technical area that cannot easily be understood and should      not be hastily legislated.       Scientists engaged in legitimate medical research are not      interested in cloning a human being. Since October,      professional organizations representing more than 64,000      scientists have announced their participation in a voluntary      five year moratorium on human cloning. Efforts led by the      scientific community, rather than legislative prohibitions,      have worked before, and will work this time.       When we first discovered how to duplicate DNA at any level,      there were cries to outlaw it. Luckily your predecessors did      not take that step, instead allowing the scientific      community's voluntary moratorium to slow     research while we explored its implications. Today millions      of Americans are alive thanks to drugs made using recombinant      DNA.       This bill prohibits not just the creation of a human clone,      but any attempt to understand how somatic cell nuclear      transfer could be used to improve our understanding and      treatment of disease.       We urge you and your colleagues to carefully consider any      human cloning legislation and to proceed through the proper      legislative channels so that a hastily drafted bill does not      get passed, sentencing millions of Americans to needless      suffering.           Sincerely,                                        J. Benjamin Younger, M.D.,     Executive Director.                                  ____                           American Psychological Association,                                                 February 2, 1998.     Senator Dianne Feinstein and     Senator Edward Kennedy,     Committee on Labor and Human Resources,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Feinstein and Kennedy, I write to support the      proposed ``Prohibition on Cloning of Human Beings Act of      1998'' introduced by both of you. There appears to be      considerable confusion on this topic which apparently has      resulted in an effort by some to restrict various areas of      biomedical and agricultural research dealing with      reproduction and embryo research. It is important to      differentiate between human cloning and other types of      research. My understanding also is that the FDA has indicated      that they are the federal agency responsible for monitoring      any possible attempts at cloning research.       I do want to emphasize again that we need to protect      researchers efforts at research which does not include ``the      production of a precise genetic copy of a molecule (including      DNA), cell, tissue, organ, plant, animal or human''.       Let me also add that the American Psychological Association      took the stand that it is human behavior, in all its aspects      which should ultimately serve as the focus of scientific and      bioethical inquiry, not simply the techniques which initiate      the process. After all, just think if nature had not beaten      us to the development of twins. Wouldn't there be a huge cry      about how we ought not to have identical twins because it      would be unnatural to have two people so similar to each      other?       Thank you for permitting me to express my viewpoints. I am      sure they are shared by many scientists in this country.           Sincerely,                                              Norman Abeles, Ph.D,     Professor and Immediate Past President.                                  ____                                      American Association for the                                       Advancement of Science,                                                 February 2, 1998.     Hon. Christopher S. Bond,     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Bond: The American Association for the      Advancement of Science (AAAS) has followed with interest the      developments of the past year related to cloning, including      current and proposed legislation regarding the possible use      of somatic cell nuclear transfer to clone a human being.       Throughout its 150-year history, AAAS has been a pioneer      among American scientific organizations in addressing the      moral and ethical issues related to scientific developments.      We are deeply concerned about the scientific and ethical      issues raised by the possibility of cloning human beings and      believe that a much more complete understanding of these      issues is essential before such experiments are even      considered. At the same time, however, we are also concerned      that well-intentioned legislation in the area of human      cloning may inadvertently impede vital research in      agriculture, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and genetics.       We urge that congressional leaders use great caution in      drafting legislation to ban human cloning. Congress should      consult with leading researchers in genetics and other areas      of the life sciences in crafting language so that definitions      of scientific and technical terms are well understood and the      resulting laws do not impede important research that may use      similar techniques but do not raise the same kinds of moral      and ethical concerns. Such related research can yield great      benefits, for example, in increasing agricultural production,      generating new products through biotechnology, finding cures      for genetic disorders, and reducing the costs of      pharmaceuticals. It is essential that these legitimate and      socially-important areas of research not be adversely      affected by legislation aimed at restricting human cloning.       AAAS, founded in 1848, is the world's largest      multidisciplinary scientific association, with 145,000      individual members and nearly 300 affiliated scientific and      engineering societies. Our Committee on Scientific Freedom      and Responsibility has been a powerful voice for ethics in      science and, in collaboration with our Program of Dialogue      Between Science and Religion, held a major public forum in      Washington last June that explored scientific, moral,      ethical, and religious implications of human cloning. We are      eager to assist in promoting a responsible and constructive      dialogue between scientists, policymakers, and the public in      this area, and stand ready to assist you in any manner that      would be useful.           Sincerely,     Richard S. Nicholson.                                  ____                                   College of Veterinary Medicine,                              University of Missouri-Columbia,                                   Columbia, MO, February 4, 1998.     To: Ms. Adira Simon, Senator Kennedy's Office.     From: R. Michael Roberts, Curators' Professor and Chair,          Veterinary Pathobiology.     Subject: Feinstein/Kennedy (S1602) versus Bond (S1599).       I am sending you a copy of my letter to Senator Bond, which      addresses some of the same scientific issues raised in your      comparison.       I have read S1602 and believe that it would be well      accepted by scientists, including members of the Society for      the Study of Reproduction, and the Developmental Biologists.      What is important is criminalization of any intent to produce      a baby and not to ban a possibly desirable outcome of the      technology, which is the generation of replacement cells and      tissues for an individual. The Feinstein/Kennedy Bill also      creates a moratorium rather than a difficult-to-reverse ban      on cloning of human beings. Again, most scientists would find      this comforting.       I should point out that the term ``somatic cell nuclear      transfer technology'' has much broader meaning than the way      it is defined in either bill. Nuclear transfer between      somatic cells is a common technique and has been used for      decades. I would be happier if the wording of both bills made      it clear that it is the transfer of a somatic cell nucleus to      an oocyte to create a human baby that is the issue.       What I found contradictory about S1601 is that it creates      an elaborate commission to report on cloning (and other      issues), yet the very technique that could allow future      discourse will have been criminalized.       In summary, I judge the Feinstein/Kennedy Bill likely to      accomplish what most scientists and the lay public support, a      ban on cloning human beings. It will not prohibit the      legitimate use of somatic nuclear transfer to oocytes to      create replacement tissues, and it places a time limit on the      ban, which can be extended as public and scientific sentiment      dictates.                                  ____                                         University of California,                                                San Francisco,                                                 January 30, 1998.     Hon. Senator Kennedy,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Kennedy, I am writing to express my profound      appreciation and support for your efforts to preserve the      opportunities for continuing research in the United States on      the earliest stages of human development. I can provide you      with the names and histories of several patients in our      experience who have benefited directly from prior research      and diagnostic procedures leading to healthy pregnancies and      births. In addition, I can provide you with one or more names      of families whose health misfortunes could have been or could      be avoided through research on early products of human      conception.       Please tell me if this additional information will be of      value to you. I applaud your efforts to achieve a responsible      bill on the subject of human cloning prohibition that does      not impede the benefits of basic and clinical research for      the American people.           Sincerely yours,                                         Roger A. Pedersen, Ph.D.,         Professor and Research Director, Reproductive Genetics            Unit, Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and            Reproductive Sciences.
