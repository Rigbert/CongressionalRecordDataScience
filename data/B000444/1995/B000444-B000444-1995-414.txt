 President, while I have strong reservations about the amendment offered by Senators Heflin and Shelby, I have also been informed that the amendment has been cleared by all other Senators--including Senators, from both sides, representing the committee of jurisdiction, the Committee on Environment and Public Works.  For these reasons, I will not object to the amendment offered by Senators Heflin and Shelby and require a roll [[Page S7759]] call vote. But, I would simply note my opposition for the Record.
