Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Jack Ford, who passed from our community on Saturday, March 21st.  Jack Ford was one of a kind. He gave his life, decade after decade, to our entire community. We hold an abiding gratitude for his lifetime of dedicated and honorable service to us. I particularly appreciated his genius and wry sense of humor. He never missed a beat. Our entire region has benefited from his generous and focused life on behalf of others.  Born in Springfield, Ohio to Edna and Stanton Ford, Jack Ford graduated from Ohio State University with a degree in social work. Already on a path to public service, he began his career with the Ohio Youth Commission. He came to Toledo in 1974 to earn his law degree from the University of Toledo. He then became director of the Lucas County Mental Health Board and consolidated county agencies into Substance Abuse Services Inc--known as SASI--which he directed.  Jack began his service in elected life in 1987, when he successfully ran for Toledo City Council, eventually serving as Council President in 1993. Beginning in 1994, Jack served in the State legislature until he reached his term limit. Always, he understood the interconnections of our City to the world beyond it. His knowledge was hard-earned and unique.  Jack Ford also made history. As an educator, health professional, and political activist, Mayor Ford became the very first African American Mayor elected in Toledo, in 2001. With his election as Mayor, he elevated our community to a more inclusive and progressive place. He made us proud. He was all business, and always demonstrated a hands-on, can-do attitude. He was a master of the City budget and directed his Administration to make long neglected improvements.  Following his tenure as Mayor, Jack was elected to the Board of Toledo Public Schools and, most recently, returned to Toledo City Council to continue his service to our community. All the while, Jack imparted his knowledge to young people, encouraging and teaching at the university level. Even when not feeling well, he carried forward his duties in a soldierly and persevering manner, earning respect from all who knew him.  Jack always had a twinkle in his eye and a knack for presenting the unvarnished truth to all whose paths he crossed. He had a very kind heart and generously shared his beloved family and adopted family like Reverend John McKissick and his lovely wife Mrs. Pearl ``Mother'' McKissick. What beautiful memories I hold of these self-giving, intelligent, productive citizens. Jack brought everyone together for a greater good to which he pledged his worthy efforts. He reserved a special place in his life for students and youth he mentored. He took particular pleasure in the classroom. Teaching at the University of Toledo and Bowling Green State University allowed him to inspire many leaders for the next generation.  It is with a heavy heart that I extend my deepest sympathy to the Ford family: his wife Cynthia, his children, and his friends and associates. May the angels carry Jack Ford to a place of peace and rest. He has been truly a good, faithful, and honorable servant.                          ____________________
