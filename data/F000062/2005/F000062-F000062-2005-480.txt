 Additionally, there is another problem on our southern border, if the Senator would give me a minute, and that is, other than Mexicans crossing the border being picked up illegally. I think it was up to 88,000 last year. So it is shooting up. And when you ask the Border Patrol about it, they say this is very difficult for them to sort it all out because there is such pressure on the border. The Senator, certainly, in Arizona knows that pressure on the border.  The fraud of documents is well known. One can buy a driver's license, a Social Security card fraudulently in places that I know of and have seen it happening in southern California for $15 or $20. So that is not a big problem.
