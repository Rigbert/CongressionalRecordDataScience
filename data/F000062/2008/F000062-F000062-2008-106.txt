 President, at this time, I send a resolution to the desk. Perhaps, rather than do that, I should just speak about it and then introduce it separately.  This resolution is sent on behalf of Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon and myself. It is also cosponsored by the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator Biden, as well as Senators Klobuchar, Brown, Cantwell, Dole, Obama, Snowe, Menendez, Voinovich, Schumer, Collins, and Byrd. It deals with Tibet.  It deals with what is happening in Tibet. This is a very difficult week because the day after tomorrow the Olympic torch is coming for the first time to my city, San Francisco, the only city in the United States that the torch will come to. It has created quite a stir.  This resolution condemns the violence in Tibet, and it calls for restraint by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the people of Tibet. It does other things as well; that is, to urge the Government of China to sit down with His Holiness the Dalai Lama and try to work toward meaningful autonomy with respect to the culture and religion of the people of Tibet.  There is an area called the Tibetan Autonomous Region. It has 3 million Tibetans. There are also 3 million Tibetans in the three surrounding provinces of China.  Starting on March 10, Tibetan monks and others began protesting in the autonomous area of western China. The protests were begun peacefully by monks who marched in their robes and were an expression of these religious people's desire to practice their religion freely and without Government interference.  The protesters took this action at great personal risk. Many monks and marchers carried pictures of the Dalai Lama, the most revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism. Possession of such a picture is punished in China, sometimes severely.  Unfortunately and tragically, on March 14, the protests in Lhasa, the capital of the Tibetan Autonomous Region, turned violent. Long-suppressed animosity boiled over. Innocent people were killed in the violence. Homes and businesses were burned in what appears to have been a riot.  Over the days and weeks that followed, the protests spread. They occurred in 42 separate Chinese counties. Most were peaceful. In some cases, they were met, though, with brute force by Chinese police. This resolution condemns force on both sides. The Chinese Government responded to these protests with force and secrecy. The crackdown included thousands of paramilitary police and possibly the People's Liberation Army, who were sent to Tibet.  International journalists and official representatives were kept out, making accurate information difficult to obtain. But we know dozens of people or more have died. We know more than 1,000 people have been incarcerated.  Now, how did all this happen? Over the past decade, China has flooded the Tibetan Autonomous Region with Han Chinese. They have built a major railroad. Han Chinese have participated in a major building boom in the capital city of Lhasa. In fact, there are many more hotels and restaurants and businesses there today.  The majority of Tibetans who live in rural areas benefit very little from central government investment in this Tibetan economy. Instead, the money has flowed to government-run enterprises, in which Han control is dominant.  The Tibetans lack the skills to compete. According to the Chinese Government's 2000 census, the illiteracy rate of ethnic Tibetans in China is 48 percent; that is five times higher than the Chinese national illiteracy rate.  Instead of providing educational opportunity to Tibetans, China is currently advancing patriotic education in Tibet's monasteries. What this means is Chinese reeducation teams go into the monasteries and try to reeducate the Tibetan monks. If they do not agree to reeducation, they are often punished and often beaten. The bottom line is, few Tibetans are prepared to compete for employment and business opportunities in the Han-dominated economic environment.  I first went to China and was the first American mayor to do so in June of 1979. I went with a delegation of San Francisco businesspeople and civic activists to develop the first friendship city agreement between an American city and a Chinese city.  From that flowed an agreement which at one time was the most active sister city relationship in the world. That was between the great cities of Shanghai and San Francisco. The Chinese have always had a love of San Francisco; it goes back many decades into former centuries of Chinese coming to this country and landing in San Francisco first.  We developed that relationship and good things happened. The first Chinese Consulate came to San Francisco and an American Consulate was opened in Shanghai. The first COSCO ship came into San Francisco Bay. The first chartered air service landed at San Francisco International Airport. A special relationship was developed between Guangdong Province and San Francisco. The first Bank of China opened in this country and on and on and on with many interesting projects.  It turned out the mayor of Shanghai was, first, Wang Daohan and then Jiang Zemin. Jiang Zemin and I met over an ensuing 8-year period every year. He then went on to become Secretary General of the party and President of the country. In 1992, 1997, and 1998, I, personally, carried letters from the Dalai Lama to the President of China. In 1997 and 1998, I had long discussions with the President of China, President Jiang Zemin.  I would like, if I might, to read parts of these letters. The second letter is dated June 12, 1997. It is signed by His Holiness the Dalai Lama. Let me read this to you:       When I met Chairman Mao over forty years ago, I felt very      assured by him and the other leaders of the new China. The      promises made to me gave the people and government of Tibet      considerable optimism and confidence. In the mid-1950s, when      we were confronted with new crises, it was Premier Zhou En      Lai who was able to play a crucial role in restoring my      confidence; we met several times during my pilgrimage in      India. Unfortunately, the situation in Tibet did not improve      despite his best assurances and I ultimately had to go into      exile.       Despite lost time and opportunities and the turmoil of the      recent past, my hopes were renewed in 1979 when Mr. Deng      Xiaoping took the initiative to contact me through my brother      in Hong Kong, assuring me that short of our demand for      separation from the People's Republic of China, all     problems could be discussed and resolved. It was a long      overdue rapprochement, and within a few years were able to      make considerable progress on several fronts.       Unfortunately, this initiative, started by Mr. Deng and      vigorously carried out by Mr. Hu Yaobang, then Party General      Secretary, came to a stuttering halt owing to events in Tibet      and elsewhere in China that prevented its natural fruition.       Many of the issues are yet to be resolved, and Tibet now      draws the concern of more than just the Tibetan people. The      primary responsibility for resolving this matter lies with      us, and I believe that now is an opportune moment to tackle      these problems without prejudice. I have, for my part, openly      and in confidence conveyed to you that I am not demanding      independence for Tibet, which I believe is fundamental to the      Chinese government.       I think the issue of Tibet has remained unresolved for too      long and any further delay will only complicate the matter. I      am also deeply concerned by the growing restlessness among      the Tibetan people in recent times. I can fully understand      their frustrations. But if a mutually agreeable solution is      found, I am confident that I will be able to dispel the      Tibetan people's concerns and win their support for my      efforts.  It is signed, ``With my prayers, the Dalai Lama.''  I delivered this to Jiang Zemin, in China, on June 12, 1997. On May 16, 1998, the next year, I returned to China and I delivered another letter from His Holiness to Jiang Zemin. I would like to quote from that.       It is my fervent and sincere hope that you will provide      similar leadership in resolving the Tibetan problem. If we      look at the issue positively I really do not see major      contradictions between our respective positions. If I      understand correctly, the main concern of the Central      leadership in China is the unity and stability of the nation.      My middle-way approach for resolving the Tibetan issue will      in fact contribute towards achieving the same objectives.       I would like to reiterate here that I am not seeking      independence for Tibet. My main concern is for the six      million Tibetan people (or whatever the actual figure is of      people who consider themselves Tibetans) to be able to enjoy      the opportunity to fully preserve their civilisation and the      distinct Tibetan culture, religion, and language. I am      convinced that this could be achieved through genuine      autonomy or self-rule within the framework of the People's      Republic of China. Such a situation will also make it      possible for the Tibetan people to take full advantage of,      and be an integral part of, the socio-economic development,      which is taking place in China. It is needless to mention      that a solution to the Tibetan problem will gain tremendous      international respect for the People's Republic of China as      well as for your leadership.       Mr. President, it has been four decades since I have had      the opportunity to sit down personally with the leader of the      Chinese people to have a frank and direct dialogue. With your      leadership and initiative, I am confident that we can begin      the process of resolving the many issues concerning Tibet. I      believe that you are privileged to be leading the People's      Republic of China at a unique time in history when it's      economy is growing vigorously and when you are gaining a new      respectability in the world.  It goes on.       May I suggest that at our meeting, you and I discuss      relations between the Tibetans and the Chinese government. I      am also concerned about the maintenance and enhancement of      those cultural, civic, and religious institutions that are so      important to the Tibetan people and others throughout the      world. In addition, we should discuss the fact that economic      growth in Tibet has not matched that of the rest of China,      and we would be interested in talking about how we can work      together towards poverty alleviation and educational and      economic growth.  There are other parts to these letters. But I would ask that the full text be incorporated at this point in my remarks in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    June 12, 1997.       Dear Mr. President: This letter comes to you through our      mutual friends Mr. Richard Blum and Senator Dianne Feinstein.      Unfortunately, it comes with a shared sense of deep concern,      frustration, and great disappointment over the lack of any      progress concerning the Tibetan situation.       When I met Chairman Mao over forty years ago, I felt very      assured by him and the other leaders of the new China. The      promises made to me gave the people and government of Tibet      considerable optimism and confidence.

But if a mutually agreeable solution is      found, I am confident that I will be able to dispel the      Tibetan people's concerns and win their support for my      efforts .       I am sure there may be other issues on which clarifications      may be needed from both sides in order to create the      necessary congenial environment for formal negotiations. My      assistants will continue to informally work with your people      so that these issues can be clarified to a satisfactory      conclusion candidly and in confidence.           With my prayers,     The Dalai Lama.                                  ____                                                     May 16, 1998.     His Excellency Jiang Zemin,     President of People's Republic of China,     Beijing.       Dear President Jiang Zemin: I have been closely watching      the developments in the People's Republic of China under your      leadership and applaud you particularly for the leadership      that you have provided both during the 15th Party Congress as      well as the National People's Congress session early this      year. Under your core leadership China is moving in the right      direction and it is my sincere hope that this process will      continue in the years to come. I also commend you for the      smooth transfer of power in Hong Kong and more importantly      for the way the affairs of Hong Kong are handled currently.       It is my fervent and sincere hope that you will provide a      similar leadership in resolving the Tibetan problem. If we      look at the issue positively I really do not see major      contradictions between our respective positions. If I      understand correctly, the main concern of the Central      leadership in China is the unity and stability of the nation.      My middle-way approach for resolving the Tibetan issue will      in fact contribute towards achieving the same objectives.

I have been often told by our good friends Mr. Richard Blum      and Senator Dianne Feinstein, and others, that a meeting      between you and me could make important progress in a      relatively short period of time on the aforementioned and      other pertinent issues.       In this context, I would hope that it would be possible for      you and me to be able to meet face to face some time in the      near future. I look forward to your reply.           Sincerely,                                                   The Dalai Lama.
