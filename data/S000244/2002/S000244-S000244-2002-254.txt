Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3180 was introduced by the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Bass) and the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Sanders) to amend the New Hampshire-Vermont Interstate School Compact originally approved by Congress in 1969. H.R. 3180 would enable participating interstate school districts to modify the manner in which local school bond issues are considered by the voters. Last year, residents of the Dresden interstate school district, which encompasses the cities of Hanover, New Hampshire, and Norwich, Vermont, voted to approve these changes. The legislatures of New Hampshire and Vermont subsequently ratified these amendments.  Rather than imposing a State or Federal solution upon local school boards, H.R. 3180 maintains the primacy of local school authorities by permitting locally-elected officials to avail themselves of the modified balloting procedures contained in the bill only if they elect to do so.  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this non-controversial but necessary measure.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
