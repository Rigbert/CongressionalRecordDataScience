Chairman, I also rise in opposition to this amendment. The fact is there is an appeal taking place before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. A number of States have filed suit, those suits are going to be in court this spring. This is not an issue we should be deciding tonight. I am strongly opposed to the amendment.
