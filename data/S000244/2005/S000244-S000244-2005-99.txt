 Madam Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment which adds distribution of fraudulent immigration documents to the list of criminal offenses.  Document fraud is a serious offense that enables our immigration laws to be violated and creates a national security threat. Controlling the production and distribution of false immigration documents is a critical component to effective immigration reform. Currently, the criminal code provides stiff penalties for those who forge, counterfeit, or alter visas, border-crossing cards, or other similar types of documents.  However, the statute does not currently mention distribution of fraudulent documents among the enumerated offenses. This amendment would help prosecutors go after those who are not necessarily producing the fake documents, but those who are making them available on the black market. Those who distribute or sell false documents deserve the same harsh penalties as those who forge or counterfeit the documents. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  Madam Chairman, since I have the right to close, I reserve the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. The gentleman will not have the right to close since he is not opposed to the amendment.
