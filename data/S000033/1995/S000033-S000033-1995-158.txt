 We keep reading in the media about the angry white male, but I think it is not only the angry white male. A whole lot of people of all colors and ages are angry, and also on the floor of this House we hear a lot about class struggle. Class struggle. Let me say a word about that also if I might.  Madam Speaker, I think that the average American is in fact angry, and I believe that that average American has every reason in the world to be angry. What concerns me is very often our anger is taken out against the wrong opponent. But let us focus on why we should be angry.  Madam Speaker, in 1973, the United States reached a high point of its economic life with regard to the wages and benefits that middle-income and working people reached. Since that time, approximately 80 pecent of the American working people have seen either a decline in their standard of living or economic stagnation. That means after 20 years of hard work, those people have gone nowhere economically.  Furthermore, what we are seeing is that the American worker, in order to compensate for the decline in his or her standard of living, is working longer hours. We are making lower wages. We are working longer hours. When you want to know why Americans are stressed out, why they are angry, why they are furious, we should understand that the average American today is working an extra 160 hours a year more in order to compensate for our falling standard of living.  Now, if middle-income people and middle-aged people should be worried, they are working longer hours, they are making less money, what about the younger people? And that is where the economy in the United States today looks extremely frightening.  The real wages of high school dropouts, that means people who did not graduate high school, plummeted 22 percent between 1973 and 1993.  For high school graduates who are entering into the job market, there has also been a precipitous decline in those wages. So what is going on is that as the standard of living of American workers declined in general, for the young workers it is becoming even worse.  But, Madam Speaker, we talk about increase in poverty in America, decline of the standard of living of American workers, the shrinking of the middle-class, the fact that 80 percent of our people are going nowhere economically except perhaps down. Is the economic crisis impacting all people? And the answer of course is no, it is not.  One of the very scary and unfair and unjust aspects of the American economy right now is that in many ways we are becoming two nations. The New York Times a few months ago reported that the wealthiest 1 percent of our population now owns 40 percent of the wealth of America. The richest 1 percent owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent.  The gap between the rich and the poor is growing wider, and in fact it is today wider and we have a more unfair distribution of wealth than any other industrialized nation on Earth. For the richest people, these times are great times and we can understand why the columnists, who themselves make millions of dollars, or the owners of the TV stations are talking about a booming economy.                              {time}  1445  It is booming, if you are making a whole lot of money. It is not booming if you are a middle-income or working-class person.  What I am also concerned about is that the nature of the new jobs that are being created are not only low-wage jobs, they are often part-time jobs. What we are seeing now is a proliferation of part-time jobs because companies would rather pay two workers at 20 hours a week without benefits than one worker 40 hours a week with benefits.  I wonder how many Americans know who the largest private employer is right now. People say, ``Well, maybe it is General Electric, maybe it is General Motors, IBM.'' Wrong. The largest private employer today is Manpower, Incorporated, which is a temporary agency.  Very briefly, let me make some recommendations as to what we might want to do to address this very serious economic problem. No. 1, we have got to raise the minimum wage. Workers in America cannot continue to work for $4.25 an hour. That is why so many of our working people are living in poverty.  No. 2, we need, in fact, a massive jobs training, jobs program, to rebuild this country. In my State of Vermont, all over America, there is an enormous amount of work to be done. Let us put people back to work at decent wages and rebuild this country.                          ____________________
