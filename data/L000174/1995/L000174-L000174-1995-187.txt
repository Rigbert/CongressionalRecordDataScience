President, one of the greatest problems facing the world is the staggering rate of population growth. Over 90 percent of all new births take place in developing countries, including many in countries that cannot even feed their people. The Earth's population is projected to double and possibly triple in the next century, with staggering implications for the world's food supply, environment, and the political and economic stability of every country.  It is critically important that we recognize that what we do today will determine the kind of world inhabited by our children and grandchildren. World Population Awareness Week will be held from October 22 to October 29. It will focus on implementing the program of action of the International Conference on Population and Development and educating the public about the dangers of unchecked population growth.  At a time when our foreign aid budget is being slashed, I was encouraged by the Senate's recent passage of my amendment to provide up to $35 million to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). The UNFPA is the largest voluntary family planning agency in the world. With programs in 140 countries, it provides family planning information and services to hundreds of millions of people who would otherwise have no access to family planning. By restoring funding for the UNFPA, the Senate has wisely chosen to support international efforts to reduce rates of population growth.  Mr. President, I ask that a proclamation by Gov. Howard Dean of Vermont proclaiming October 22-29 World Population Week, be printed in the Record.  The proclamation follows:       Whereas the world's population of 5.7 billion is increasing      by nearly 100 million per year, with virtually all of this      growth added to the poorest countries and regions; and       Whereas three billion people--the equivalent of the entire      world population as recently as 1960--will be reaching their      reproductive years within the next generation; and       Whereas the environmental and economic impacts of this      growth will almost certainly prevent inhabitants of poorer      countries from improving their quality of life, and, at the      same time, have deleterious repercussions for the standard of      living in more affluent regions; and       Whereas the 1994 International Conference on Population and      Development in Cairo, Egypt resulted in 180 nations approving      a 20-year Program of Action for achieving a more equitable      balance between the world's population, environment and      resources; and       Whereas World Population Awareness activities this year      will focus on implementing the Cairo Conference Program of      Action.       Now, therefore, I, Howard Dean, Governor, do hereby      proclaim the week of October 22-29, 1995 as World Population      Awareness Week.                          ____________________
