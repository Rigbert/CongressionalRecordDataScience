Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me time and especially thank the gentleman for his perseverance and the work he has done, as well as the ranking member for accepting the amendment to the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I think what I have said before is it is a way to have a little logic in this body. I do compliment the gentleman for bringing this amendment to the floor.
