Speaker, as the Speaker knows, I came over to the floor during the course of a previous special order that a number of Members heard, and I had some concerns about the facts that were being discussed about the Federal employee pension system and I therefore want to make some remarks.  Very frankly, those remarks will be in large part from a Congressional Research Service paper that was prepared when the questions raised by the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Mica], the chairman of the Civil Service Subcommittee, which he discussed on the floor today, were first raised.  Those two questions include, first, the unfunded liability that is alleged to be present in the Civil Service Retirement System. For those who may not be fully familiar, Federal employees have effectively two retirement systems, one for those employees who were hired prior to January 1, 1984, and those who were hired subsequent to 1984.  The Federal Employee Retirement System, known as FERS, is available to all employees, but is mandatory for those who came on board after January 1, 1984. It is a system that everybody agrees is fully funded. It is a system which for the first time incorporated Social Security within the retirement scheme for Federal employees as well as a thrift savings plan. So the employees since January 1, 1984, essentially have a 3-legged stool as their retirement benefit: the Federal Employment Retirement System itself, the Thrift Savings Plan to which employees and their employer contribute, and Social Security.  The second question that has been raised was the question: Is the system now insolvent or will it become insolvent in the future? The answer to both these questions is no. That is critically important because that answer leads to the conclusion that there is not the necessity to act precipitously on this issue.  In point of fact, the Republicans are acting precipitously, and notwithstanding the fact that the committee of jurisdiction, the committee formerly known as the Committee on Government Operations, had hearings in subcommittee on this issue, chaired by the gentleman from Florida, and considered a bill, which would have involved a 2\1/2\-percent increase in the contribution that Federal employees make to their retirement system. Now that was for both those in the Civil Service Retirement System for employees before January 1, 1984, and those after, even though everyone agrees that those after January 1, 1984, are in a system that is fully paid for, notwithstanding that the proposal is to increase their contribution as well.  For those prior, it is 2\1/2\ percent. Ladies and gentlemen, a 2\1/2\-percent increase for Federal employees in their contribution is on top of the 7 percent that they already contribute. They do not have Social Security. So this system is their sole retirement system.  Their employer matches their contribution of 7 percent and an additional contribution is made to fully fund the system.  I want to read from the CRS report in answer to those two questions about this system. I am not going to go into the background beyond what I have already stated.  The CRS report says this: ``The liabilities of a retirement system are the costs of benefits promised to workers and retirees. A retirement system is fully funded if a trust fund holds assets approximately equal to the present value of all future benefit promises to which retirees and vested employees are entitled.'' Vesting in the Federal plan, by the way, requires 5 years of employment.  ``Unfunded liabilities,'' the report goes on, ``are earned benefits for which assets have not been set aside in a retirement fund. As of the end of fiscal year 1993, the Federal retirement trust fund held $276.7 billion in assets for the CSRS, or about 34 percent of the long-term CSRS pension liabilities.'' Thus, the unfunded CSRS liability was $538.3 billion. That is the sum of which the gentleman from Florida speaks.  Normally one would say that is, and it is, a very large sum. And perhaps we ought to be worried about that. What do the experts say? ``The unfunded liability developed because the CSRS funding laws have not required the Government to fund the system fully.'' That is unlike the private sector, and [[Page H4027]] the theory of course is that the Government is not going to go out of business; therefore, will not have immediate demands on all of its resources and, therefore, like Social Security, can pay it on a year-to-year basis.  ``Nevertheless, the primary purpose of the Federal trust fund is not to provide a source of cash for the Government, but to provide budget authority to allow the Treasury to disburse monthly annuity checks without annual appropriations. The trust fund balance,'' and this is the important point, ``The trust fund balance is adequate to provide this budget authority on an ongoing basis.''  Let me repeat that sentence. ``The trust fund balance is adequate to provide this budget authority on an ongoing basis.'' In other words, there is no crisis. There is no risk to Federal employee retirees in not having their retirement paid.  The report goes on to say this: ``The combined funded and unfunded liabilities of the CSRS, $815 billion in fiscal year 1993, is the amount the Government would have to pay all at one time if everyone who is or whoever has been a vested CSRS participant could demand a check for the present value of all benefits to which they would be entitled from that time throughout retirement until their death, taking into account future pay raises they might receive, and cost-of-living adjustments after retirement.'' This is key.  ``This event,'' and I am quoting, ``cannot happen in the Federal retirement system.'' This event cannot happen in the Federal retirement system. In other words, the gentleman from Florida creates a false premise, and that is that the unfunded liability can be called upon to be paid all in one lump sum. Repeat the sentence. ``This event cannot happen in the Federal retirement system. Federal pension obligations cannot come due all at one time, unlike the situation that arises in the private sector when an employer goes out of business and must pay all promised obligations at once.'' In other words, what we have said to large and middle and small corporations, if you promise your employees a pension benefit, if you say it is going to be ``x,'' then you need to contribute a sum sufficient to ensure that even if you go out of business; in other words, if there is no additional cash-flow into your business out of which you could pay retiree benefits. In the eventuality you go out of business you must have resources sufficient to meet the obligation to your employees.  Very frankly, ladies and gentlemen, if the Federal Government goes out of business, the Federal retirees' pension is not going to be worth much anyway. Very frankly, nobody else's pension is going to be worth much either if the Federal Government goes out of business.  Some of the Government's liabilities represent payments due to current retirees who receive their benefits 1 month at a time throughout retirement. Others represent payments that will not commence for years to come, because the workers are not yet eligible to retire.  By the time they become eligible, others currently retired will have died. Thus, unlike private employers, the Government need not fully prefund the retirement system in order to insure against having to pay off all earned benefits simultaneously.  This is not a game, this is not legerdemain, this is not fiscal sleight of hand. This is simply the fact that the actuarial facts lead us to conclude.  The report goes on to say that some are concerned, and we have heard it on the floor today, ``that the existence of unfunded Federal pension liabilities has, or will have in the future, an effect on the budget deficit and/or the need for tax revenues. The annual budget cost to the Government of CSRS can never be more than the sum of the checks written to annuitants one month at a time.''  In other words, you are not going to have to pay out an obligation all at one time. ``Thus the liabilities of the system, funded or unfunded, will never require payments from the Treasury in excess of the benefits payable to living, retired workers or survivors.'' This is critical in understanding that there is not a crisis, that there is not a need to move precipitously, that there is not a need to move without deliberate consideration by the committee of jurisdiction.  That has not happened. As a matter of fact, my friend, the acting Speaker, knows that did not happen because he was at the committee and serves on this committee. What happened was there were some relatively abbreviated hearings. It then came to the committee for markup. The committee adjourned because they did not have the votes to pass the legislation.  Now that is not to say that everybody was against it, but there were on both sides of the aisle some very thoughtful Members who said I want to make sure that this is the right thing to do before acting to adversely affect 2 million civilian workers who work for the Federal Government, and to increase their contributions by a total of 2\1/2\ percent over 3 years, tantamount to a 10-percent tax increase for somebody making $20,000, $30,000, or $40,000, and working for the Federal Government.  However, the report goes on, ``The cash to pay monthly benefits comes from general revenues, and paying monthly benefits creates an outlay from the budget and therefore contributes to the budget deficit, as does any Government spending.'' It is as a contribution, when you have an employee and you make contributions toward their health benefits, toward their retirement benefits if you are in the private sector, a stock option, deferred payments, 401(k), whatever that might be. Clearly that is a cost.                              {time}  1700  No one says it is not a cost, but it is a cost of doing business. It is a cost of having employees. Consequently, the report goes on, in times of tight budgets, Congress often considers benefit cuts in order to reduce spending. In other words, we reach into the pocket of Federal employees and take out some of their money.  You say how much have we done? From January 1981, if we followed the law to this day, Federal employees would have received in pay and benefits, health care and retirement benefits, $163 billion more than they have received.  Now that sounds like a lot of money, and it is a lot of money. But during that time we have probably spent, I suppose, in that 14 years, somewhere in the neighborhood of approximately $1 trillion per year, or $14 trillion, approximately.  So you can see that it is a relatively small percentage of our cost of doing business, but it is a legitimate cost of doing business.  The report goes on to say this: Does the CSRS face insolvency? That was another concern raised by the gentleman from Florida. The report goes on to say that currently about half of the Federal work force participates in this program, and as the number of CSRS-covered workers declines, the assets in the trust fund will decline, not because of the payroll contribution from workers but primarily because of Government payments themselves declining.  It goes on: When Members of Congress wrote the new FERS law in 1986, they understood there would have to be a financial transition from CSRS to the FERS program. That is the pre-1984 program to the post-1984 program.  The law provides for one trust fund in which both assets of the old system and the new system are combined. Therefore, there is no separate CSRS trust fund that will be depleted. In other words, the gentleman from Florida is talking about a system that is integrated with a system that we all agree is fully paid for.  Second, Congress established a system whereby benefit payments under CSRS will be authorized by FERS trust fund securities, as needed, until there are no more CSRS benefits to be paid. In short, the system, as reformed in 1986, contemplated exactly the situation we are in today and provided for the funding of that system, to wit: The conclusion, there is no crisis, there is no insolvency. And although technically there is an unfunded liability because the Government is never going to go out of business short of a catastrophe for the country, there will never be a call on the assets of any fund except, as the report previously indicated, on a month-to-month basis.  In summary, Mr. Speaker, by definition, under the financing arrangement set out in current law, the system is not now and never will be insolvent or [[Page H4028]] without adequate budget authority for payment of benefits. That is the critical component of this debate.  Under the financing arrangement set out in current law, without change, the system is not now and never will be insolvent or without adequate budget authority for payment of benefits.  Again, because the budget cost of the system can never exceed the cost of monthly benefits to living annuitants, the cash required from the treasury or taxpayers will never exceed the cost of these monthly benefits. As a result, there is no crisis.  The Federal Government is paying a reasonable sum   for the benefits of its employees. Can we debate as to whether or not we ought to modify this system for those who come into the system or those who have been in it for such a short time they are not vested in the system? Of course we can. That is responsible. We have a budget deficit in this Nation. We need to deal across the board with how the Government spends money. That is appropriate to do so.  My friend from Virginia, Mr. Moran, has just arrived with me on the floor.  We do not object to that. What we do object to and, very frankly, what the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Clinger] the chairman of the committee objected to, was having this issue not dealt with by the substantive committee of jurisdiction, and having it taken up by the Committee on Rules without any debate, without any hearings. Just put into the tax bill on the premise that we are going to pay for a tax cut for other Americans by increasing the taxes on Federal employees.  Mr. Clinger, when that occurred in the last Congress--Mr. Speaker, you will be, I know, pleased to hear this--wrote to then chairman Conyers, chairman of the Committee on Government Operations, now the newly named committee, the Committee on Government Reform and Oversight--we have had a revolution, and I cannot keep up with the names all the time--in a letter dated July 12, 1994, in which then ranking member Clinger criticizes the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Conyers] for taking a bill to the Committee on Rules that has not been reported out of the Committee on Government Operations. That is exactly what has happened here.  In light of the report that has been issued, Mr. Speaker, which I have just read from extensively, it is clear that there is not a crisis. To the extent there is an issue, we ought to debate that issue honestly, openly, ask experts to come in, Federal employees to come in, and others to come in and say, ``This is how we think you ought to do the system.'' We are prepared to do that.  But I would hope, Mr. Speaker, that you and others would urge the Committee on Rules on Tuesday not to include this in the tax bill, to give us time to consider it. I would urge you to join the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] the chairman of the Committee on Rules, who when Mr. Moran and I, Mrs. Morella, and Mr. Wolf, in a bipartisan way, along with the ranking member Cardiss Collins, testified before the Committee on Rules, Mr. Solomon, the chairman of the Committee on Rules, said, ``I do not think this ought to be in this bill. We haven't considered it. We are not the committee of jurisdiction. We are not sure of the issues in this bill. And it does not, in any event, appear to me to be fair to Federal employees.''  I pointed out to the chairman of the Committee on Rules that if there had been a proposal to change the rules on somebody who served 18 years in the United States Marine Corps--which the chairman of the Rules Committee is a marine himself and justifiably incredibly proud of the Corps--and said, ``We are going to change the rules on you,'' I told Chairman Solomon, ``You would be on the roof yelling and screaming and hollering.'' And he said, ``You are right.''  Now I want to yield to my friend, the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Civil Service, who has done an outstanding job in fighting this fight, making the case, educating Members, asking that we consider this matter in a deliberate fashion. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend from Virginia.
