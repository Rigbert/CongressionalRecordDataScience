 President, let me say to my good friend from Nevada, I have not heard from Senator Grassley. I keep hearing from the other side that Senator Grassley objects, but I have not heard that, nor have floor staff been informed that he does. But either way, it is time to move forward, and it needs to be done this week, and should be done with a tight time agreement and a rollcall vote.                          ____________________
