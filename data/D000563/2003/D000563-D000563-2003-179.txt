The Superfund toxic sites are, frankly, just sitting there. Nothing is being done because the money is not being collected in the Superfund for enforcement.  The reason is, this administration said we are going to have a hands-off policy when it comes to the polluting industry. Any money going into Superfund has to come from the general tax fund, and then as a consequence of their budget there is no money in the fund. So this Superfund approach is a dream come true for polluting industries. This is the first President, Democrat or Republican, to turn his back on the responsibility of polluting industries to clean up toxic waste and, frankly, it appears that Governor Leavitt wants to continue that policy.
