 President, I just had an opportunity to speak to President Trump, and I will state to all of my colleagues, he is prepared to sign the bill.  He will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time, and I indicated to him that I am going to support the national emergency declaration.  So for all of my colleagues, the President will sign the bill we will be voting on shortly.                          ____________________
