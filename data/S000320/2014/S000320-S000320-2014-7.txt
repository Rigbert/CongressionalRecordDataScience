 We have worked together a long time and of course some of us--the Presiding Officer might not remember--but he was an astronaut himself in another part of his life. We go back a long time to our House days. We came to the House at the same time. But we have worked together on NASA because we believe in science, we believe in space, we believe that it is great for America in many ways.  I point out again that we have a bipartisan effort on the floor right now. We have three bills: the agriculture appropriations bill, which came out of the Appropriations Committee 30 to 0, with Republican and Democratic support; the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill--where I serve as the ranking member of the subcommittee and Senator Mikulski serves as the chair of the subcommittee--which came out 30 to 0; and the transportation, housing bill, which came out 29 to 1.  We are talking about working together. We are working under the Murray-Ryan numbers. That is what we are trying to stay within. I would like to see us move these three bills. If we can do this, we are going to regular order, which we need. I think it shows--when we have this kind of bipartisan effort coming out of the Appropriations Committee to the floor--we are saying to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle: Look, we believe these are fair bills, we believe it is a bipartisan effort, and we want to fund these agencies because they are important to this country and also there is some certainty out there. We do not need to go back to uncertainty in this body or in this government.  I thank Senator Nelson for his remarks.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
