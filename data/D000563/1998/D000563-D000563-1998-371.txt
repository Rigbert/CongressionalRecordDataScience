President, at the outset I would like to say to my colleagues in the Senate and those who are witnessing this Chamber this morning that we have a unique opportunity this year to do something of value not only for the children of this country but for many others. It relates to an issue that I have been involved in for over 10 years. It started a little over 10 years ago when as a Congressman from Illinois I was about to catch an airplane in Phoenix, AZ, to Chicago, but, as usual, I was late. I came rushing into the airport in Phoenix, AZ, put my ticket on the counter of United Airlines, and said to the flight attendant, ``Can I make this plane?'' She punched it into the computer and said, ``You can if you hurry.'' I said, ``Can you get me a seat in the nonsmoking section?'' She punched it into the computer, and said, ``No. I am sorry. It is too late. The only seat we have is a middle seat in the smoking section.'' I looked at her, and I said, ``I know I am in a hurry, but isn't there something you can do?'' She looked at my ticket, and she looked at my title, and she looked me in the eye, and said, ``No; but, Congressman, there is something you can do.''  So I got on that airplane and flew from Phoenix to Chicago seated between two sumo wrestlers chain smoking the whole way. I turned my air vents on, one and then the other, and realized when I got off that plane that my clothes were stinking, my sinuses were clogged, and I was grumpy. But I still would be alive. I looked a couple of rows away and saw a woman with a tiny baby and, on the other side of the plane, an elderly person. I thought to myself, this doesn't make any sense at all. Why do we let people smoke away in the cabin of an airplane and endanger the health and lives of other people?  So I came to Washington and in 1987 introduced legislation to ban smoking on airplanes. I never dreamed that it would be successful. In fact, it was the first time in its history that the tobacco lobby had lost a major vote on the regulation of their product on the floor of the House of Representatives. It was a bipartisan effort. I never would have succeeded without the intervention of Senator Claude Pepper, who was chairman of the House Rules Committee, my friend; and Mike Synar, the late Congressman from Oklahoma; Henry Waxman of California, and some others.  It really started in my political career an effort to take a close look at tobacco. Now, almost 11 years later, that wave that was just starting to rise in 1987 is about to crest in 1998. We have a chance now to not just deal with the annoyance and danger of secondhand smoke but something much, much bigger. We have a chance to enact legislation in 1998 that will dramatically change, in America, our view of tobacco as a product for sale. If we are successful, if we do our job, we will finally say that the law in every State in the Nation which bans the sale of tobacco products to children will be enforced. What a breakthrough that would be for us to finally come to grips with the fact that these tobacco companies with their insidious strategy and their advertising have been going after our kids. That is it.  They lose 2 million of their best smokers each year; 400,000 die from tobacco-related diseases, and 1.5 million or so quit. Well, if you are in the corporate board room of RJR or Philip Morris, you say, ``I have a problem. Two million customers gone. We have to replace these customers. Where are we going to go?''  Well, we found out as we have surveyed that when a person reaches the age of 18 and beyond, they are less likely to decide for the first time to smoke. They are a little more mature. They know the danger, and they stay away from it. But these corporate leaders in the tobacco companies know that if they can get kids to start smoking, they might have customers for life, albeit an abbreviated life for many smokers.  So we see Joe Camel, we see Marlboro's cancer cowboy, and we see all these efforts to glamorize tobacco. For what purpose? Ultimately so the children will try to smoke. Oh, these tobacco companies do a great job. You know what happens? Every single day in America 3,000 kids start smoking for the first time. A third of them, 1,000 of them, will find their lives shortened because of that experience. Kids who become addicted to nicotine become smokers for life. The tobacco companies win. The kids lose. Their parents lose. America loses.  We have a chance this year to change it. But we may blow that opportunity because, unfortunately, this Senate, and the House for that matter, have become tangled up in the politics of this issue and can't see the forest for the trees. If we miss this chance this year to do something about this effort to addict our children, we may never have it again.  The President and Vice President have been leaders on this issue. We would not be here today discussing it were it not for President Clinton's leadership. And we have seen many others, 42 States' attorneys general, who brought lawsuits against the tobacco companies and said, now it is time for you to pay for the damage you have caused to America by tobacco products; now it is time for you to be held accountable for your lies, your fraud, your deception, your advertising directly at children.  So we are here today and the ball is in our court. Will we do something about it? Take a look at this. This is the situation. Here is the 1998 teen smoking report. How many kids will be hooked today? Three thousand. How many kids have been hooked so far this year? Mr. President, 213,000. How manykids will die too young because Congress has failed to act this year? Mr. President, 71,000. How many days are left for Congress to act? Sixty-seven days. And the count goes up every single day--more kids addicted to nicotine, addicted to tobacco; more kids who will die.  We are told repeatedly this is a short session; we do not have a lot of time here. We have just 67 days and then we have to get back to other things. What is more important? What could be more important than the lives of our children? What could be more important than this opportunity in history for the first time--the very first time--that we can do something? Think about it. If we said, as part of our legislation, legislation I support, that the tobacco companies have to show reductions in kids smoking or they are going to pay more, guess what will happen. They will reduce the number of sales to kids. They will watch it more carefully. If we say to these tobacco companies that we are sick and tired of your insidious advertising at sporting events and all sorts of billboards near schools--we know what is going on here--it is coming to an end, we can do it; we can do it this year.  There is more. We also have to take the money that will come from this effort--from additional fees, for example, on tobacco products--and make sure that it is well spent on antitobacco advertising, on medical research, and on so many other things the President has suggested.  The President wants to take these funds and put them into the basics, make sure there is money for education, make sure there is money for child care, make sure there is money at the NIH for medical research. This is money that is well spent and well invested. But we can miss this opportunity. We can find ourselves twisted in knots. Unfortunately, we may find, if that occurs, we may never have this chance again.  Today is March 12; there are 67 days left on Capitol Hill to take action on an antitobacco bill. If we are going to do this, the Senate needs to finish up its work on this bill by Memorial Day and no later. There are 3,000 reasons each day to pass this legislation--the 3,000 kids who start smoking for the first time. There are no good reasons not to. When you count the days and you count the kids and you count the cost, I think you understand the gravity of this situation. We have offered comprehensive legislation. I hope we can count on our friends on the other side of the aisle to join us.  Yesterday the committee hearings focused on details of tobacco legislation--immunity, liability, committee jurisdiction--but it is time to bring the focus back where it belongs. This is not about the details of the legislative process, it is about our children. Let's send a bill to President Clinton that he can sign. We certainly owe it to America's kids to stop stalling and start saving lives.                          ____________________
