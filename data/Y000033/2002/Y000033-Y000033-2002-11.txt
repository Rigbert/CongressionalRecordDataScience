If my good friend will yield, I can suggest to her respectfully, under the bill they have to have the training; and I would rather have my pilot be armed and defend that cockpit as against an F-16 to be shot down. That is the whole intent. So in the bill they are trained, yes. All this says is that it is a voluntary process they go through, but the training is necessary.
