 President, in 2008, Medicare accounted for about $470 billion of the $2 trillion spent on health care in the U.S..  Conservative estimates are that as much as $60 billion of that Medicare spending is lost to fraud, waste, and abuse each year.  News reports today tell us that the Medicare payment error rate for fiscal year 2009 is going to be 12.4 percent. To put it in a different way, last year, Medicare made 47 billion dollars in improper payments. $47 billion of taxpayer money that by all accounts was wasted by Medicare on payments that shouldn't have been made.  As Medicare spending continues to skyrocket, so will the dollars lost to fraud, waste and abuse.  That problem is bad enough. But it is even worse because it turns out that a rule in the law today makes it easier for crooks to cheat the system and steal money from Medicare.  A recent 60 Minutes segment highlighted how the law as written contributes to the problem and drives this growing danger to the American taxpayer and public coffers.  In this segment, we saw a medical supply company that billed Medicare, $2 million this past July--despite being empty and having apparently no staff.  Federal agents described the problem as far bigger than the drug business in Miami now.
