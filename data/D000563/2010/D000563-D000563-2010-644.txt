I don't know what the situation is with the New Jersey Guard, but many of the Illinois Guard have been deployed and redeployed in Iraq and Afghanistan at great inconvenience and hardship to their families. The McCain amendment calls for deployment within 72 hours. People will literally be removed from their families and on the road headed down to Arizona within 72 hours under the McCain amendment.  I ask the Senator if he has dealt with these Guard families and has any idea what impact this might have on their lives.
