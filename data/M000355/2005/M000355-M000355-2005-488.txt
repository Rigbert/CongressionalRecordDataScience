 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great Kentuckian and the fine organization he represents--Mr. Craig Williams and the Chemical Weapons Working Group, CWWG, based in Madison County, KY.  For almost 20 years, Craig and the CWWG have been invaluable in their efforts to ensure that the millions of pounds of chemical weapons stored at Kentucky's Blue Grass Army Depot are destroyed as safely and expeditiously as possible. In large part due to their efforts, we are closer than we have ever been to taking tangible steps towards chemical weapons disposal.  One of our biggest challenges has been to keep those in charge of weapons disposal at the Department of Defense, DOD, accountable to the citizens of Kentucky. It hasn't been easy. Without the efforts and diligence of Craig and his organization, it would have been close to impossible to hold DOD to the commitments it has made to the local community. This is because, with respect to chemical demilitarization, DOD has long operated in a less than transparent manner. Craig has been another set of eyes and ears for the Kentucky delegation, keeping us abreast of what is going on--or not going on--at the depot. In this regard, Craig has been at the vanguard of a unique public/private partnership between the citizens of Madison County and its elected representatives, including my colleague and friend from Kentucky, Senator Bunning.  But for the efforts of Craig and the CWWG, our Nation's obligations under the Chemical Weapons Convention would be in more jeopardy than they already are. More importantly, but for Craig and the CWWG, hundreds of thousands of Americans would continue living indefinitely with the specter of an aging and increasingly unstable chemical weapons stockpile looming in their midst.  All of us in the Commonwealth of Kentucky owe Craig and the CWWG a substantial debt of gratitude for their tireless work to protect the health and safety of the public, the depot workers, and the local environment.  I ask my fellow Senators to join me in paying tribute to the CWWG and to my friend, Craig Williams.                          ____________________[Page S9924]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]    TRIBUTE TO CRAIG WILLIAMS AND THE CHEMICAL WEAPONS WORKING GROUP  Mr. McCONNELL.
