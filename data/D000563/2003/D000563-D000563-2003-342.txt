President, my colleagues will remember the President's State of the Union Address, during which $15 billion over 5 years was pledged to fight global AIDS.  This bill only provides $2 billion. When Senator Bingaman offered his amendment on the floor on July 10, by a vote of 78 to 18, we said we want it to be $3 billion regardless of the budget resolution; 45 Democrats and 33 Republicans voted for $3 billion in spending. It can be spent. Every major organization has come forward and said the need is there, the need is now.  To my friends on the other side of the aisle, including the chairman of the subcommittee, who voted for the Bingaman resolution, if 33 Republicans will step forward today as they did July 10 for the same proposition, we guarantee our 45 Democratic votes will be there with you. Let's pass this resolution and keep our promise to fight the global war on AIDS. Stand behind President Bush's promise of $3 billion.
