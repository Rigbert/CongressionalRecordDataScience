 President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts. As I do so, I thank him for his tremendous leadership on our side on the issue of education and making sure all children, no matter where they are in this country, have the opportunity to learn. It is represented in this amendment which he has had such an incredible part in drafting. I thank him for that. I yield him 10 minutes.
