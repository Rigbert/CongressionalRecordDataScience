Madam Speaker, I submit the following:  Requesting Member: Rep. Christopher H. Smith.  Bill Number: H.R. 2638.  Account: Military Construction, Navy Account.  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Naval Weapons Station (NWS) Earle.  Address of Requesting Entity: Colts Neck, New Jersey.  Description of Request: This project will upgrade the Main Gate located at Naval Weapons Station (NWS) Earle. These upgrades will provide the proper Anti-terrorism Force Protection (AT/FP) measures required for current security and terrorist threats. Construction will consist of the following: gate access realignment; reinforced ornamental fencing along the public highway; new security fencing surrounding guardhouse area; removal of existing guard house; and removal of existing parking areas; hardened guard house, intrusion detection system (IDS), local area network (LAN), and base wide alarm duress system; site lighting with connections tied into existing generator; raised median; rejection area for privately owned vehicles (POVs); permanent vehicle inspection shelter with CCTV, for one truck and two POVs side by side; undercarriage video surveillance equipment; permanent passive barriers from fence and gate to active vehicle barriers; two active (pop-up) vehicle barriers; elevated fighting position; hardening of existing generator; sidewalks on both the inbound and outbound sides; relocate entrances to parking for Family/Housing Services and to Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD); construct new connector road to EOD; demolish existing pass and identification office; construct new pass/i.d, within new inspection facility and provide 54 parking spaces.  NWS Earle has been fortunate to not experience serious assaults or threats; however, continued operations without major security improvements could result in exposing NWS Earle's valuable assets and personnel to terrorist activity.  Detailed Financial Plan:  The majority of the funding (approximately $6.5 M) will be used for Electronic and Mechanical Utilities and Site Improvements, including: Area Lighting; Water Distribution; Sanitary Sewer System; Paving and Site Improvements; Storm Water Management; and Demolition.  The rest will fund Special Construction Features, which total $1,515,766 M and include:  Active vehicle barrier--$91,036.00.  Passive vehicle barriers--$270,213.00.  Security fencing--$208,801.00.  Automatic traffic controls/devices--$245,648.00.  Inspection enclosure (truck/car)--$85,977.00.                          ____________________
