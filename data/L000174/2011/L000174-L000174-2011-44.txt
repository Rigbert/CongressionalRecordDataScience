President, I would join the Senator from South Carolina in thanking Senator Levin, the chair of the Armed Services Committee, and Senator McCain, the ranking member, who worked closely with us. But I must say again, my good friend from South Carolina, I think even as late as a week ago, in the meeting we had with the Secretary of Defense, talked about this need.  We have tried not to show any light between one Republican and one Democrat but to do what was best here. I want to see the Senate get back to the days when Republicans and Democrats work together like that. But I thank the distinguished Senators from Michigan and Arizona for their help.  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of quorum.  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator from South Carolina yield for a question?
