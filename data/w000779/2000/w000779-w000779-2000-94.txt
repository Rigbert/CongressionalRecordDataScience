President, I am here today to introduce legislation that will allow a valuable member of the Portland, Oregon, community to become a permanent resident of the United States of America. Rose-Marie Barbeau-Quinn, a native of Canada, has lived in Portland since 1976. Together with her husband, Michael Quinn, she ran the Vat and Tonsure Tavern, a unique and popular restaurant that was a favorite of many of my constituents.  While Ms. Barbeau-Quinn and her husband, an American citizen, were together for over 16 years, their marriage did not take place until shortly before Michael's death in 1991. Since Rose-Marie and Michael were not formally married for the two years required by immigration law, and despite their 16 years together living as husband and wife, Rose-Marie has not been able to file for permanent residency in this country.  This legislation will correct their injustice, and allow Rose-Marie to be a permanent resident of the country she loves and has called home for over 20 years. I first learned of Ms. Barbeau-Quinn's situation from Senator Hatfield when I joined the Senate in 1996. Senator Hatfield championed her cause in the 104th Congress, and, as his request and the request of many of my constituents, I am attempting to complete the work that Senator Hatfield started. We both firmly believe that Rose-Marie would be a model United States resident.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, so that Rose-Marie Barbeau-Quinn can continue her place as a valuable member of our community for many years to come.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2509       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. PERMANENT RESIDENCE.       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, for purposes of      the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.),      Rose-Marie Barbeau-Quinn, shall be held and considered to      have been lawfully admitted to the United States for      permanent residence as of the date of the enactment of this      Act upon payment of the required visa fees.     SEC. 2. REDUCTION OF NUMBER OF AVAILABLE VISAS.       Upon the granting of permanent residence to Rose-Marie      Barbeau-Quinn, as provided in this Act, the Secretary of      State shall instruct the proper officer to reduce by the      appropriate number during the current fiscal year the total      number of immigrant visas available to natives of the country      of the alien's birth under section 203(a) of the Immigration      and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1153(a)).                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Moynihan, and Mr. Kerrey):  S. 2510. A bill to establish the Social Security Protection, Preservation, and Reform Commission; to the Committee on Finance.SOCIAL SECURITY PROTECTION, PRESERVATION, AND REFORM COMMISSION ACT OF                                   2000 Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I join with my friends and colleagues, Senators Bob Kerrey and Pat Moynihan, to introduce a very important bill that will serve as the catalyst for putting aside partisan politics and beginning the process of protecting, preserving and reforming the Social Security system.  Our bill establishes principles and a process for Social Security reform. The bill sets forth broadly stated objectives for comprehensive reform of the Social Security system that should be supported by every one of us. It establishes a bipartisan Congressional Commission charged with developing a reform plan consistent with those objectives. The Commission is required to submit a detailed legislative proposal to Congress by September 2001, and the bill includes a process for expedited Congressional action on the Commission's recommendations by the end of next year.  Mr. President, for far too long, Social Security has been used by politicianson both sides of the aisle to polarize, manipulate and scare American voters. The mere mention of ``Social Security reform'' has become a lightning rod for the fears of retirees and workers alike about their financial futures.  Seniors, particularly low-income seniors, are vulnerable to exaggerations and hyperbolic rhetoric about their retirement benefits. They are often frightened into believing they will be homeless, penniless and starving if Congress reforms Social Security. We all know that is simply not true. The benefits seniors receive today are not the issue--nobody wants to take them away. And it is disgraceful that some would stoop so low as to play on the fears of older Americans.  The real issue driving Social Security reform--an issue that is only frightening when left unresolved--is how to strengthen and protect the system so that it is available for future retirees, without putting an unfair financial burden on current and future workers. We have wasted too much time on partisan politics when we should have been working together to find a solution to the financial problems facing our nation's retirement system. We can no longer afford to just spout rhetoric about the need for reform, then deliberately avoid taking any concrete action because of fears about how it may affect us in our next election.  Social Security reform is not just a political problem; it is a serious economic problem for millions of Americans who are counting on a retirement system that is in dire financial straits. It's time to step up to our common responsibilities, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as servants of the American people.  That is why I have joined with Senator Kerrey and Senator Moynihan to introduce this bill to require the Congress to act, and act soon, on legislation to preserve, protect, and reform Social Security. As my colleagues know, Bob Kerrey and Pat Moynihan have worked tirelessly for many years to highlight the urgent need for reform of the Social Security system, and they have succeeded in making the American people, if not the Congress, recognize that reforming our nation's retirement system must be a national priority.  Our bill sets out a timetable for action on Social Security reform by the end of next year--November 2001.  First, the bipartisan, bicameral Social Security Protection, Preservation, and Reform Commission must be appointed by February 1, 2001, and begin work within a month. The Commission will be made up of 12 Members of Congress, selected in equal numbers by the Party Leaders in both Houses. In addition, the Commission of Social Security will serve as an ex-officio, non-voting member.  The Commission is given a reasonable period of time--six months--to conduct hearings, review the myriad of reform proposals already in the public domain, and research new ideas to put together a comprehensive reform plan that meets the objectives set out in this bill.  Those broadly stated objectives represent the most basic requirements of meaningful Social Security reform:       Guaranteed 75-year solvency of the system;       Payment of all benefits to which retirees or workers are      entitled;       A reasonable rate of return on payroll tax contributions      for all generations;       An opportunity to participate in private investment      accounts;       A ``lockbox'' for the Social Security Trust Funds to      protect from spending raids; and       Use of non-Social Security surplus revenues to shore up the      system while implementing reform.  The Commission is required to submit its recommendations to Congress in the form of a detailed legislative proposal by September 1, 2001, and the bill's expedited procedures are designed to ensure a final vote on Social Security reform by mid-November 2001. The strict time lines in the bill are designed to ensure that this vitally important issue is dealt with promptly--not pushed aside yet again, to be solved later.  Too often, election year politics stand as an obstacle to any meaningful action in Congress. This proposal is carefully crafted to avoid this. The bill is designed to ensure that Congress can complete action on Social Security reform by the end of 2001, before being consumed by the political sparring of an election year.  Mr. President, each year that reform of the Social Security system is postponed, restoring solvency to the trust funds becomes more expensive and places a greater financial burden on current and future workers. This ``principles and process'' legislation is, we believe, the only way to force Congress to pass a Social Security reform proposal that will protect and preserve our nation's retirement system and also allow more Americans to share in our nation's prosperity.  Mr. President, let me take a moment to comment on the objectives, or principles, included in this bill. The objectives are intended as minimum guidelines for the Commission's work, not as a comprehensive blueprint for Social Security reform. We intentionally stated these objectives as broadly as possible in order to give the Commission the opportunity to develop a comprehensive plan without micro-managing their every decision.  I believe very strongly that all promised benefits must be guaranteed under any reform proposal, both for those currently receiving Social Security benefits and those who are working and paying into Social Security today. In addition, I will work to ensure that Social Security reform does not unfairly burden today's workers by increasing payroll taxes from their current levels. And I do not believe it would be fair to further increase the eligibility age for receiving Social Security benefits.  I am a strong proponent of allowing workers to invest a portion of their payroll taxes in personal retirement accounts that will provide a much greater return than the current Social Security system. This will afford all Americans the opportunity to have greater personal wealth creation in addition to a minimum Social Security benefit.  Mr. President, I was very disappointed that Vice President Gore is continuing to use scare tactics about Social Security reform. Instead of putting the retirement needs of all Americans ahead of politics, the Vice President seems content to exacerbate the financial burden facing our children and grandchildren by ignoring the real structural problems of the program. By using politically intimidating rhetoric, the Vice President is seriously harming bipartisan efforts in Congress to put the needs of working Americans ahead of partisan politics.  Let's look at the facts. The savings rate in America today is appallingly low. Many low-income families have no savings at all, and a large number of middle-income Americans have less than $2,000 in the bank.  Because of this low savings rate, many Americans rely heavily on Social Security benefits for their retirement income. But economists agree that the rate of return on Social Security payroll tax contributions is abysmal--somewhere between 1 and 2 percent. Most workers today are unaware that the payroll taxes they contribute to Social Security may not provide anywhere near the income they expect when they retire. In fact, if nothing is done to reform the Social Security system, younger workers will receive nothing at all in return for paying more than 6 percent of their earnings every pay day into the Social Security system.  Allowing every worker to invest a portion of the payroll taxes they already pay in a higher-yielding private account would make it possible for families on very tight budgets to save more for their futures.  Even the most anemic savings account today realizes almost 3 percent, and secure short-term certificates of deposit return almost 6 percent. Over the past 50 years, the stock market has gained an average of more than 6 percent per year, with 20 to 30 percent gains in several recent years.  Proposals to allow every American to choose to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes in a low- to moderate-risk private investment account are designed to give even the lowest-income families the opportunity to share in our Nation's economic prosperity and create wealth for themselves and their children.  In the long run, diverting a portion of payroll taxes to personal retirement accounts will bring more money into the Social Security system. In the short run, it will cost money. Using a significant portion of the non-SocialSecurity surplus revenues to shore up the Social Security system will ensure that current retirees receive their full benefits while reforms are implemented. At the same time, reducing the financial insolvency of the Social Security system through reform will also reduce our national debt.  Mr. President, we all have opinions about how the Social Security program should or could be reformed, and I will have more to say about specific aspects of Social Security reform when I introduce a comprehensive reform bill later this month. Every one of these ideas deserves fair and full consideration as we work together to restore solvency to our Nation's retirement system. It is clear that we need a formal process and effective deadlines to review these ideas and develop and pass a real, meaningful plan to reform Social Security. That is exactly what this bill will achieve.  Mr. President, Social Security is a sacred compact with workers and retirees that must be honored. The Congress has an obligation to develop a real, meaningful reform plan that strengthens and protects the Social Security program for our Nation's seniors without placing an unfair burden on America's workers. And we must do it sooner rather than later.  I urge my colleagues to put aside partisan politics and work with us to get this process legislation passed and begin the business of reforming Social Security now.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2510       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Social Security Protection,      Preservation, and Reform Commission Act of 2000''.               TITLE I--FINDINGS AND OBJECTIVES OF REFORM     SEC. 101. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Two-thirds of Americans depend on social security for      half or more of their income and 47 percent of beneficiaries      would be in poverty without their social security benefits.       (2) Social security is an unbreakable compact between      workers and retirees across generations that must be honored      and needs to be sustained.       (3) The social security trust funds will begin to run a      cash-flow deficit in 2015 and trust fund assets are expected      to be exhausted by 2037.       (4) Americans covered by the social security program are      required to pay into a system from which they can expect      lower rates of return than earlier generations.       (5) Each year that comprehensive reform of the social      security system is postponed, restoring actuarial solvency to      the trust funds becomes more expensive and places a greater      financial burden on current and future workers.     SEC. 102. OBJECTIVES OF REFORM.       Congress must act to reform the social security system so      that--       (1) beneficiaries receive the benefits to which they are      entitled based on a fair and equitable reform of that system;       (2) the long-term solvency of the social security system is      guaranteed for at least 75 years without any foreseeable      funding shortfall immediately following that period and cash-     flow deficits and pressure on future general revenues to pay      benefits is significantly reduced;       (3) every generation of workers is guaranteed a reasonable      comparable rate of return on all tax contributions;       (4) all Americans, particularly low-income workers, are      provided the opportunity to share in our Nation's economic      prosperity and create wealth for themselves and future      generations through a private investment account under that      system;       (5) revenues flowing into the Federal Old-Age, Survivors,      and Disability Trust Funds are protected from congressional      or other efforts to spend on nonsocial security related      purposes; and       (6) resources are made available from surplus non-social      security revenues to preserve and protect the social security      system while implementing reform.

Such reform      bill shall be introduced in the House of Representatives by      the Speaker, and in the Senate, by the Majority Leader,      immediately upon receipt of the language and such reform bill      shall be referred to the appropriate committee of Congress      under paragraph (2). If the reform bill is not introduced in      accordance with the preceding sentence, the reform bill may      be introduced in either House of Congress by any member      thereof.       (2) Committee consideration.--       (A) Referral.--A reform bill introduced in the House of      Representatives shall be referred to the Committee on Ways      and Means of the House of Representatives. A reform bill      introduced in the Senate shall be referred to the Committee      on Finance of the Senate.

(C) Discharge of committee.--If the committee to which is      referred a reform bill has not reported such reform bill (or      an identical reform bill) at the end of 30 calendar days      after its introduction or at the end of the first day after      there has been reported to the House involved a reform bill,      whichever is earlier, such committee shall be deemed to be      discharged from further consideration of such reform bill and      such reform bill shall be placed on the appropriate calendar      of the House involved.       (b) Expedited Procedure.--       (1) Consideration.--       (A) In general.--Not later than 2 days after the date on      which a committee has been discharged from consideration of a      reform bill, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, or      the Speaker's designee, or the Majority Leader of the Senate,      or the Leader's designee, shall move to proceed to the      consideration of the committee amendment to the reform bill,      and if there is no such amendment, to the reform bill. It      shall also be in order for any member of the House of      Representatives or the Senate, respectively, to move to      proceed to the consideration of the reform bill at any time      after the conclusion of such 2-day period.       (B) Points of order waived.--All points of order against      the reform bill (and against consideration of the reform      bill) are waived.

The motion is not subject to amendment, to      a motion to postpone consideration of the reform bill, or to      a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A      motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion to proceed      is agreed to or not agreed to shall not be in order. If the      motion to proceed is agreed to, the House of Representatives      or the Senate, as the case may be, shall immediately proceed      to consideration of the reform bill without intervening      motion, order, or other business, and the reform bill shall      remain the unfinished business of the House of      Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be, until      disposed of.       (D) Limited debate.--Debate on the reform bill and on all      debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith shall      be limited to not more than the lesser of 100 hours or 14      days, which shall be divided equally between those favoring      and those opposing the reform bill.
