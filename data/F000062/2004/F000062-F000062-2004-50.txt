 President, I thank the distinguished chairman. It is always a great privilege for me to work with her. Her leadership has been superb, and I can easily say I agree with everything she has just so well stated.  The chairman mentioned that this is a $10 billion bill. It is up 2.5 percent over last year. It funds environmental remediation. There is $4.5 billion for Active-Duty military construction, $1 billion for new barracks, and $814 million for Reserve component facilities. That is 31 percent greater than the President's budget request. It includes $361 million for BRAC environmental cleanup, including revenue from Navy land sales, and $188 million for medical and dental clinics and hospitals. The bill also includes $4.2 billion--more than 40 percent of the total funding--for improved family housing for service members and their families.  Mr. President, this is a good bill. I would be very hopeful that the Senate would accept it unanimously. Again, I thank the chair for her leadership. I thank the majority staff and the minority staff as well.  I yield the floor.
