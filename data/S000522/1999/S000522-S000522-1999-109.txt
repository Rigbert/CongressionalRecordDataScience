Reclaiming my time, it is the release that we are talking about. I believe she needs a fair trial. That is where all of our diplomatic efforts must be put. No American should be immune from prosecution of a criminal charge, but they are entitled, I say to the chairman and to my colleagues, to a fair trial. She has not gotten it and that is where I believe that President Fujimori has erred completely. I happen to believe that the tendency in Peru is towards dictatorship on the part of the President, although there have been some trends that may suggest otherwise.  I would ask for a fair trial, not her release. I would hope--and we had asked the gentlewoman through staff and through other ways to reword her amendment so we could all support it, asking again for due process rights to be protected, not for her release.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
