 We agreed that wilderness designation could be fully compatible with such restoration treatments.  I agree with the Forest Service observation that this area has been altered by human influences, including the suppression of natural burning. As the Forest Service develops its plan in accordance with this act and with the goal of LSR restoration, I believe the old growth characteristics of the LSR are a primary value of the wilderness. I also believe that the Forest Service can achieve its goal of LSR restoration in accordance with this act and the Forest Service manual direction on wilderness. The relevant portion of the manual, FSM 2323.35a states:       Manipulation of Wildlife Habitat. The objective of all      projects must be to perpetuate the wilderness resource;      projects must be necessary to sustain a primary value of a      given wilderness or to perpetuate a federally listed      threatened or endangered species. To qualify for approval by      the Chief, habitat manipulation projects must satisfy the      following criteria:       The condition needing change is a result of abnormal human      influence.       The project can be accomplished with assurance that there      will be no serious or lasting damage to wilderness values.       There is reasonable assurances that the project will      accomplish the desired objectives.  Do my colleagues share my views that treatments to promote old growth in the Sanhedrin LSR are fully consistent with this act?
