There are other ways to restore this money other than taking it from the fossil fuel research. I will have amendments later on down the line that would save in the realm of $108 million that is unnecessary to spend at this time for the purchase of new vehicles and aircraft for agencies that have no reason to purchase them other than to have their own private fleet.  What I am suggesting is that there is plenty of room in this bill to transfer moneys into. I think the gentleman from Michigan will agree, and yourself and the gentleman from Ohio, this is a much higher priority than to purchase hardware for those that want their own little playground to play on with their own little play toys. So I am glad you have reached this agreement.  But I do not support the gentleman from Wisconsin taking it out of the fossil fuel research. I think in the meantime, before we get to title II, we can work out an amendment that can get the moneys to the American Indian education fund.
