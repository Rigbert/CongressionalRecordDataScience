Mr. President, the appropriations bill reported from the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State, and Judiciary included within the immigration examinations fees account $3,325,000 for the Law Enforcement Support Center in Vermont. It is my understanding that the $567,550,000 provided in the omnibus appropriations conference report for immigration examinations fees includes the $3.325 million for the Law Enforcement Center. Does the Senator from New Hampshire agree with my interpretation.
