Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his comments, and I congratulate him for those clinics. I think that is a wonderful idea. I think very frankly we ought to have similar clinics and cooperate with a number of the people in our communities who could help people, particularly the EITC is difficult to understand for Members, much less those who it is designed for, to make sure people at the very poor end of the income scale have enough resources to support their kids. That is what it is all about, and this is what we think ought to be done.  So I thank the gentleman. I also want to thank him for the simplification of all the child tax credits that are now available because if we can get that just one item, as you pointed out, down from those 200-plus questions down to 10 or 12 questions, we are going to save a lot of money, a lot of time and a lot of mistakes, a lot of mistakes. The EITC is complicated, but there are a lot of mistakes made, not by people who want to commit fraud but who simply make mistakes.  I am glad that we are joined now by, in my view, one of the real stars of the new class in the Congress. She has been sent to us from south Florida, an area where I used to live, and she is doing an extraordinary job. I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Wasserman Schultz).
