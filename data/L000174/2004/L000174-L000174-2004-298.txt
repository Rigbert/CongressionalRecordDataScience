His amendment does not cover war profiteering; mine does. In fact, his, I believe, removes my prohibition against war profiteering. What I have in here is an amendment, very similar to what we passed in the appropriations bill earlier, about real war profiteering.  This Monday I was at the funeral in Vermont of a young sergeant who was killed in Iraq, just as my wife and I have been at other funerals of Vermonters killed over there, and I suspect most Members of the Senate have. They are over there defending their country. They are over there doing what their country asked them to, being paid as corporals and sergeants, and dying.  We have a lot of other people sitting in boardrooms back here in America, watching enormous profits, watching the American taxpayers pay for things that are never delivered, for trucks that are never there, for meals that are never there, and we can't stop them. My amendment would stop them. My amendment would put, if not patriotism in them, it will put the fear of going to jail in them.  Let us stand up for our American men and women over there. Let us stop the war profiteers. Let us say no to them, and let us say, if you continue, you are going to go to jail because that is where you belong.
