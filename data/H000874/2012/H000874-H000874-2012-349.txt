Speaker, today I rise to honor the work of a remarkable woman from Maryland, Roberta Roper, and to express to her the appreciation felt by so many across our state and throughout the country.  In 1982, Roberta and her family faced their darkest days when they learned that their daughter, Stephanie--a talented artist and college student--had been kidnapped, raped, and murdered. While struggling with her own personal pain and grief, Roberta learned that there were no supportive services for her and her family as they struggled with the loss of their daughter. Even more devastating was that the criminal justice system lacked the rights and support they needed as family members of a murder victim.  That same year, to honor the memory of their daughter and to address the inadequacies between the rights of a defendant and those of a victim of crime, Roberta and her husband, Vince, founded the Stephanie Roper Foundation. The Foundation's mission has been to provide supportive services to crime victims across Maryland for thirty years. They also established the Stephanie Roper Committee, the Foundation's legislative arm, which has resulted in over sixty laws enacted to create new or improved crime-victim rights and services.  With Roberta's active encouragement, the Maryland General Assembly created the State Board of Victim Services in 1988. This Board offers recommendations to the legislature and to the Governor on matters concerning state and local efforts to assist victims of crime. In 1994, Roberta was appointed as Chair of the Board, a position she held until her retirement last October.  In 2002, the Foundation merged with the Maryland Crime Victim Resource Center, a one-stop, statewide non-profit that provides victim services, crisis assistance, legal help, victim notification, financial help, social services, and links to national victim resources.  Roberta's activism since her daughter's tragic death in 1982 led her to so many important accomplishments benefitting my home state. These include the creation of the Maryland Victims of Crime Fund, legislation ensuring victims and their families a place in the courtroom and a voice during the sentencing process, the creation of new support and services for victims and their loved ones, as well as the ratification of an amendment to the Maryland Constitution guaranteeing crime victims the right to be informed, present, and heard throughout the investigatory and judicial process.  In addition to her tireless efforts to improve victims' treatment, Roberta serves as Co-Chair of the National Victims Constitutional Amendment Network--a network of states working with Congress to enact a Constitutional amendment establishing meaningful and enforceable rights for every crime victim in this country.  Today, I join in honoring Roberta Roper for turning a deeply saddening and difficult tragedy into a thirty-year movement to provide crime victims and their families a greater voice.  Stephanie Roper once said: ``One person can make a difference, and every person should try.'' Roberta Roper has built a lasting legacy in her daughter's name by doing just that--and we are all better off for it.                          ____________________
