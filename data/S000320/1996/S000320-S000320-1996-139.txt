 President, I will speak to this in a second.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during the consideration of the committee amendment on page 80 regarding abortion funding there be 1 hour of debate prior to a motion to table, to be equally divided betweenSenators Nickles and Boxer, and that no other action occur prior to the motion to table. This has been cleared with Senator Kerrey.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Gregg). Without objection, it is so ordered.
