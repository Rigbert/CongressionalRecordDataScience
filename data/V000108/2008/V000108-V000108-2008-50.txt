They will be celebrating this occasion by rededicating the hall in honor of four members who selflessly gave their lives in the ``Memorial Day Massacre'' in 1937. This event will take place at the Local 1010 United Steelworkers Hall in East Chicago, Indiana, on Saturday, June 7, 2008.  Local 1010 has a long history of selfless sacrifice for the advancement of workers' rights, which in 1937 culminated with the ``Memorial Day Massacre.'' After a picnic and rally on May 30, 1937, hundreds of members of Local 1010 picketed with members of other local unions at the plant gates of the Republic Steel Company in a show of solidarity against ``Little Steel.'' While the strikers were protesting for union and worker's rights, Chicago police officers opened fire on the crowd, wounding over 100 union members and killing ten individuals, including four members of Local 1010. The four courageous Local 1010 members who gave their lives were: Earl Handley, Sam Popovich, Kenneth Reed, and Alfred Causey.  These selfless individuals will be honored at this milestone event with a workers' memorial, which will be displayed in the union hall. The memorial will bear the engraved names of these four men, as well as all 387 members of Local 1010 who have lost their lives while working for the union. This will ensure they will be remembered forever.  Madam Speaker, I urge you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Local 1010 President, Mr. Thomas Hargrove, and all members of the United Steelworkers Local 1010 for their loyalty and devotion to workers' rights.                          ____________________
