It is the only one I know that would stick to the wall locally. I know how hard Chairwoman Waters has fought to even get this embedded in this legislation, and I have to say to the people here tonight, when you think about $1 trillion or more, a $15 billion proposal is very, very modest. Our community development dollars for the whole country I think total about $8 billion a year. It's very, very modest.  Frankly, I wish you well and hope that you can expand that significantly because Wall Street will be rewarded with a $1 trillion bailout, and yet we're going to give our mayors and local housing authorities pennies to deal with the level of foreclosure that is being experienced across this country. I would think they would roll out the red carpet for you in that committee and do everything they could to help you make this bill not just efficient but equitable, particularly to the American taxpayers who are going to bear the brunt of this cost.
