Speaker, S. 1448 is identical to legislation that I introduced in the House of Representatives with Representative Schrader in March. The bill accomplishes two things: (1) It corrects a disparity between federally recognized tribes in Oregon in how these tribes lease land held in trust, and (2) it incentivizes long-term investment that will attract businesses and create jobs for Oregon tribes and nearby communities.  Currently, four of the nine federally recognized tribes in Oregon are able to lease land held in trust by the Federal Government for up to 99 years without going through a maze of bureaucracy and red tape at the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The 99-year lease authority is crucial to attracting and retaining long-term investment, incentivizing economic development projects on trust land, and creating jobs for communities that need them the most.  But five of Oregon's nine federally recognized tribes--the Coquille, the Confederated Tribes of the Siletz, the Confederated Tribes of the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw, the Klamath, and the Burns Paiute do NOT have this important authority. These tribes are limited to 25-year leases or must rely on a lethargic BIA to approve longer leases on an individual basis.  S. 1448 fixes this disparity and gives all nine federally recognized tribes the same authority to pursue economic development and job-creating activities on land held in trust.  The bill enjoys bipartisan support, has no opposition in the State of Oregon, and passed the U.S. Senate without amendment and by unanimous consent. This is a no-brainer. It's good for the Tribes. It's good for rural and tribal communities. The bill will create jobs and incentivize financial investment. I ask my colleagues to pass this bill today on suspension and send it to President Obama for his signature.
