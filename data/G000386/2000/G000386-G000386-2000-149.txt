 President, No. 2, I remind people the farmer savings accounts give the farmers an opportunity to level out years of high income versus years of low income. Very seldom, because of nature, can the farmers control their productivity to any great extent, so they have these peaks and valleys. This gives the family farmer an opportunity to manage his income to a greater extent.  I yield the floor.                           Amendment No. 3835 (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to increase the    unified credit exemption and the qualified family-owned business      interest deduction, to provide a refundable credit to certain    individuals for elective deferrals and IRA contributions, and to    provide an incentive to small business to establish and maintain  qualified pension plans, to amend the Social Security Act to provide   each American child with a KidSave Account, and for other purposes)
