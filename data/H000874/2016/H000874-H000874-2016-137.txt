Speaker, this week marks the sixth anniversary of the adoption of the Affordable Care Act.  I am proud of the role I played as majority leader in 2010 to bring that legislation to the floor, legislation that has been extraordinarily successful in making affordable coverage accessible to millions of Americans.  The Affordable Care Act has become a critical tool in fighting poverty. As a result of the Affordable Care Act, 20million previously uninsured individuals now have coverage.  Expanded Medicaid is now covering 8.6 million Americans in 28 States and the District of Columbia. Were the rest of the States to implement it, it would provide access to affordable, quality care to another 5.1 million Americans.  Young people under age 26 can be covered under a parent's plan, making it easier for them to find their footing in the workforce. And insurance companies, Mr. Speaker, can no longer deny coverage based on a preexisting condition.  As we mark this anniversary, the Democratic Whip's Task Force on Poverty, Income Equality, and Opportunity will continue to lead efforts to defend the law against attempts to repeal or undermine it, and we will pursue additional policies that help more Americans stay healthy, put roofs over their heads, and find jobs that lift them out of poverty and into the middle class.                          ____________________
