 President, I rise today to pay tribute to LCpl Benjamin Robert Carman who bravely gave his life for our country in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I offer my deepest sympathy to his parents, Marie and Nelson, as well as his siblings; James, Catherine, and Amelia. LCpl Carman was killed in action by small arms fire during combat operations in the Al Anbar Province of Iraq on Tuesday, April 6, 2004.  LCpl Carman is the eleventh Iowan to be killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom. I appreciate his faithful service to our country and the patriotic mission that he died supporting. The attitude that Ben had toward his military service was summarized by his pastor at his funeral; ``Ben died because he loved freedom. He died because he loved justice.'' LCpl Carman was not afraid to courageously serve his country and accomplish his duty. As an Iowan, I am proud of this exemplary young man who will be missed by many.  Ben Carman graduated from Jefferson-Scranton High School in 2002 where he excelled in the industrial arts, winning first in the State on several occasions in the sheet metal category of an industrial skills contest. He also participated in football and golf and was well loved by his classmates. Ben also loved the outdoors and his hobbies included fishing, hunting and camping. He was a proud Marine who proved himself to be a true hero and patriot. LCpl Ben Carman lived out the Marine motto, Semper Fidelis, always faithful, and is a credit to his State and to his country. I again express my sympathy for Ben's family and my gratitude for his courageous service.                          ____________________
