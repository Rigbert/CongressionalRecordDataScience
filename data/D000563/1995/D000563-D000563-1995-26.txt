Speaker, day four of the Gingrich gridlock; 800,000 Federal workers sent home without pay while Mr. Gingrich, the Republican leadership, and Members of Congress continue to draw their own paychecks. That is why we need No Budget, No Pay, a proposal which I put on the books in September which says that if the Government shuts down, Members of Congress stop receiving their paychecks.  Now the Gingrich Republicans want us to take the weekend off, leave Saturday evening, be home on Sunday, come back late on Monday, while the Government is shut down. Frankly, this is a terrible idea. We should stay here and do our work and get this Government running.  Today on the floor you are going to hear what this debate is all about. The Gingrich budget comes up with deep cuts in Medicare to pay for a tax break for the wealthiest people in America.  Listen to this. If you happen to make $600,000 in income, pay close attention; Mr. Gingrich wants to give you a $14,000 tax cut. If you happen to be in the lower 20 percent of Americans making around $6,000, guess what? You are going to pay more. Typical trickle-down economics.                          ____________________
