President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for his comments.  The Senator from Utah has spoken and will be coming back, and so I am going to speak about the Estrada nomination, the matter at hand. I say what everybody knows, especially those of us like the distinguished Presiding Officer, who have practiced law, becoming a Federal judge for a lifetime is a privilege. It is not a right.  No nominee should be rewarded for stonewalling the Senate and the American people. The Constitution directs Senators to use its judgment in voting on judicial nominees. It does not direct them to rubberstamp. It says ``advise and consent,'' not advise and rubberstamp.  During the 17 months that the Democrats were in control of the Senate, we confirmed a record 100 of President Bush's judicial nominees. Interestingly enough, no judicial nominees of President Bush's had been confirmed up to mid-July when I took over as chairman of the committee. Within 10 minutes of taking over as chairman of the committee, I called the first confirmation hearing, and in 17 months we set a record of moving nominations. We certainly acted faster, and I believe more fairly, than the Republicans did for President Clinton.  President Bush also has proposed several controversial nominees like Miguel Estrada. They divide the American people and the Senate. The President, of course, could easily end this impasse. I hope he will act to give Senators the answers they need to make informed judgments about this nomination. That was suggested by one of the most distinguished and senior Republican Members of this Senate. So far it has been rejected by the White House. I hope they will reconsider. The President can also help by choosing mainstream judicial nominees who can unite instead of divide the American people.  Unfortunately, the White House seems to have this attitude that they should divide and not unite, and I think that is a mistake. One of the unfortunate aspects of the President's determination to pack the Federal courts with extreme conservatives is a division that the nomination of Miguel Estrada has caused among Hispanics. Rather than nominate someone whom all Hispanic Americans would support, the President has chosen to divide rather than unite. The White House's ideological litmus test has motivated the President to select another highly controversial nominee rather than a consensus nominee.  Over the last several days, the division within the Hispanic community has been the subject of a number of news reports. On February 14, the Washington Times ran a front page story quoting a statement for the National Council of La Raza noting that since the Latino community is clearly divided on the Estrada nomination, we find the accusation that one side or another is anti-Latino to be particularly divisive and inappropriate.  The division was likewise noted in the Boston Globe on February 15, in a story by Wayne Washington. And on February 20, the Washington Postnoted the division in a story by Darryl Fears.  I ask unanimous consent that some of the articles on this issue be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Boston Globe, Feb. 15, 2003]               Latinos Bitterly Debate Estrada Nomination                         (By Wayne Washington)       Washington.--President Bush's nomination of Miguel Estrada      for a federal judgeship has exposed sharp divisions among      Latinos, who are weighing the possibility of having one of      their own on a fast track to the US Supreme Court against a      fear that the minority group's interests could be harmed if      the Senate confirms that the conservative lawyer of Honduran      descent.       In the divisive intra-ethnic battle, some Latinos have      challenged Estrada's allegiance to the Hispanic community, an      accusation that others have sharply criticized. Each side has      at times accused the other of being anti-Latino. The debate      has gotten so nasty on Spanish-language television and over      the Internet that this week the National Council of La Raza,      a Latino group that says it is neutral on Estrada's      nomination, called for both sides to tone down their      language.       ``We urge those who are engaging in name-calling and      accusatory language to instead focus on the substantive      issues and merits of this nomination,'' the group said in its      statement. ``Since the Latino community is clearly divided on      the Estrada nomination, we find the accusation that one side      or another is `anti-Latino' to be particularly divisive and      inappropriate.''       Estrada's nomination to the Court of Appeals for the      District of Columbia has been endorsed by the Hispanic Bar      Association, US Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, the Latino      Coalition, and the League of United Latin American Citizens,      which is comparable to the NAACP. Opposed are the Mexican      American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the Puerto Rican      Legal Defense and Education Fund, and the Congressional      Hispanic Caucus, whose members are Democrats.       Bush nominated Estrada in May 2001, but Senate Democrats      blocked his approval. This week, they stalled the nomination      by threatening a filibuster. Estrada, 42, would be the first      Latino on the D.C. Appeals Court, where six of the nine      justices currently on the Supreme Court once served. Only 12      of the 154 judges on federal appeals courts are Latinos; one      has never served on the nation's highest court.       Some observers have compared the volatile debate to      dissension among African-Americans when President George H.W.      Bush nominated Clarence Thomas--then a member of the D.C.      Court of Appeals--to the Supreme Court.       ``There are similar fault lines,'' said Lisa Navarrete,      spokeswoman for the National Council of La Raza, a nonprofit      Hispanic group that fights poverty and discrimination. ``Some      people said Clarence Thomas is African-American and would be      the only one on the court. He deserves our support. Others      felt that his views would be harmful to the community.      That's exactly what's happening here.''       Born in Honduras, Estrada immigrated to the United States      with his family as a teenager, graduated magna cum laude from      Columbia College, and earned a law degree from Harvard, where      he was an editor of the Harvard Law Review. He went on to      work as an assistant US attorney in New York and an assistant      to the solicitor general during the Clinton administration.      Currently, he is a partner in the Washington office of      Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher.       His ethnicity and academic and legal record have been      enough to win the support of some Latinos, while critics      maintain that Estrada, a member of the conservative      Federalist Society, has not clearly spelled out his judicial      philosophy. He clerked for Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, a      member of the conservative majority on the Supreme Court.       ``That Miguel Estrada is of the Hispanic culture counts far      more than the fact that he is a Republican or a Democrat,''      said Tina Romero-Goodson, a social service official in New      Mexico. ``What weighs heavily with me is that he is Hispanic      and will have far more in common with me and mine than a      Democratic Anglo or African-American candidate.''       Representative Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey,      said Estrada ``shares a surname'' with Latinos but has done      little to help them.       ``Mr. Estrada said he is unfamiliar with cases that are      important to our community,'' Menendez said. ``He has said      that his being Hispanic would be irrelevant to his role as a      judge. I don't want it to be irrelevant, and neither does the      community.''       That stark call to ethnic solidarity outrages other      Latinos.       ``I think it's just shameful,'' said Robert G. de Posada,      president of Latino Coalition, a nonprofit Washington-based      policy group. ``There is no other way to describe it.''       De Posada said Menendez and other congressional Democrats      are trying to portray Estrada as a well-off lawyer ``who      never had a problem in his life.''       Of Menendez, de Posada added: ``He's a Cuban-American who      looks completely white. I wonder: Has he faced the racism and      isolation that other Hispanics have faced? Can you challenge      his Hispanic-ness? I would never do that. He's a success      story. But so is Miguel Estrada.''       Pierre M. LaRamee, acting president of the Puerto Rican      Legal Defense and Education Fund, said Republicans have      attempted to portray Estrada as ``a Latino Horatio Alger.''      That portrayal, LaRamee argues, makes it proper to question      just how representative he is of Latino communities.       ``He didn't come from a poor, disadvantaged background,''      La Ramee said. ``He came from a background of relative      privilege. Of course, that's nothing negative about Miguel      Estrada. He's been successful.  .  .  . We'd rather have a      non-Latino judge who we believe would be a better judge.''       Supporters point out that Estrada did pro bono legal work      on antiloitering laws that some Latino community group      leaders believe led to the harassment of black and Latino      men.       Latinos who are not of Mexican-American descent have said      Estrada would get more support from Latinos if he were part      of it. Mexican-Americans are the largest subgroup of Latinos      in the United States.       ``There's a dirty little secret in the Hispanic      community,'' said Jennifer Braceras, a member of the U.S.      Commission on Civil Rights. ``There's a real intra-Hispanic      community rivalry. There's a real feeling in the Mexican-     American community that the first Latino Supreme Court      nominee should be Mexican-American.''       Not true, said Marisa Demeo, regional counsel for the      Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund. ``It has      nothing to do with his ethnicity,'' she said. ``It has to do      with how he would be as a judge.''       Democrats are expected to resume their filibuster of      Estrada's confirmation when the Senate returns from a recess      on Feb. 24.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 20, 2003]                For Hispanic Groups, A Divide on Estrada               political, geographic fault lines exposed                           (By Darryl Fears)       When he spoke in support of federal judicial nominee Miguel      Estrada at a recent news conference, Jacob Monty masked his      harsh criticism of opponents in Spanish. He said Latinos who      are fighting against the Bush administration's choice for a      judgeship on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of      Columbia Circuit ``no tienen verguenza''--have no shame.       That comment by Monty, a former chairman of the Texas-based      Association for the Advancement of Mexican Americans, was      just one shot in a bitter war of words that has divided      Latino politicians and civil rights organizations in ways      rarely seen.       It followed one fired by Rep. Robert Menendez (N.J.), a      member of the Democratic Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which      opposes the nominee. ``Being Hispanic for us,'' Menendez      said, ``means much more than having a surname''--a statement      his critics understood to imply that Estrada is not      ``Hispanic enough.''       The name-calling has reminded some observers of the      bitterness among African Americans during the Senate      confirmation hearing for Supreme Court Justice Clarence      Thomas--a hearing that Thomas, a conservative black man,      likened to a lynching after liberal activists persuaded Anita      Hill, a former assistant, to come forward with sexual      harassment allegations against him.       Latino activists have differing perceptions of who Estrada      is and what kind of judge he would be.       Estrada's supporters say is a Latino success story,      immigrating as he did from Honduras at age 17 and going on to      graduate from Columbia College at Columbia University and      Harvard Law School, and clerking for Supreme Court Justice      Anthony M. Kennedy. He is now a partner with the District law      firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher and a nominee for a judgeship      on what is considered the nation's second most powerful court      because it has jurisdiction over all appeals regarding      federal regulatory agencies.       Opponents question whether Estrada appreciates the      interests of poor people--his family came from the Honduran      elite--and say his conservative politics would color his      decisions on the bench. They say Estrada has a low regard for      hard-won civil rights protections that benefit Latinos.       Ideological wars over federal judicial nominations are      nothing new, but the fight among Latinos offers a small      window on how what will soon be the nation's largest ethnic      minority is divided by ideology and geography.       Of the Latino community's three most influential groups,      each has taken a different position on Estrada's nomination.      The League of United Latin American Citizens, based in Texas,      supports it; the Mexican American Defense and Educational      Fund, in California, opposes it, and the National Council of      La Raza, in Washington, has remained neutral.       The fuse for the current debate was lit in June, when      members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus met with Estrada      in the basement of the Capitol. Rep. Charlie Gonzalez (D-     Tex.) said the nominee at first looked uncomfortable as he      stared at the faces of 16 Democrats across the long      boardroom table.       ``We wanted to make sure the nominee . . . appreciates what      the court system means for Latinos,'' Gonzalez said recently.      Estrada was not available for comment.       ``We wanted him to give us some idea of how the role of a      judge impacts minority communities, and it just wasn't      there.''       Two weeks later, the caucus returned a recommendation      opposing Estrada's nomination to the Senate Judiciary      Committee, then controlled by Democrats. Latino civil rights      groups read the recommendation, then met among themselves.       In October, the League of United Latin American Citizens      (LULAC) voted to support Estrada.       ``It was just very difficult for us not to support the guy,      given his impeccable credentials,'' said Hector Flores,      president of the Texas-based group. ``It's the American      dream, rising up from Honduras the way he has. The battle      isn't whether he's conservative; it's that he represents      Latinos, whether we like him or not.''       Flores said the vote to support Estrada was overwhelming,      but in recent days the California state delegation of LULAC      broke away from the national group in opposing the nominee.      In a Feb. 12 statement, a former president of LULAC, Mario      Obledo, opposed the nominee because of his ``sparse record''      on civil and constitutional rights issues, and because he      declined to answer questions about his record in Senate      hearings.       LULAC's overall support was backed by Monty, the former      chairman of AAMA. His assertion that Estrada's opponents were      shameless was broadcast on C-SPAN and remembered by Flores,      who was present. Monty did not return several calls seeking      comment.       President Bush tried to keep up the pressure yesterday by      giving an interview by the Spanish-language Telemundo      network, and vigorously urged senators to confirm Estrada.       Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) recently said that Estrada's      Democratic opponents were ``anti-Latino,'' and brought howls      from his liberal colleagues and from leaders of Latino      organizations across the land.       Marisa Demeo, regional counsel for the Los Angeles-based      Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said      Hatch failed to mention three Latinos nominated for      judgeships by the Clinton administration whom Republican      senators opposed. Those nominations--of Jorge Rangel, Enrique      Moreno and Christine Arguello--were returned to President      Bill Clinton without a hearing or vote.       Demeo said LULAC and AAMA back Estrada for cosmetic      reasons. ``Because he's Latino, they would support him,'' she      said. ``They've been very strong in thinking there should be      a Latino sitting on the D.C. Circuit, and we say it is      important, but not as such a cost.''       The cost, she said, would be the weakening of civil rights      laws. ``The groups opposing have taken the analysis a step      further,'' Demeo said. ``We look at the record to determine      what kind of judge Mr. Estrada would be.''       MALDEF is supported by the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and      Educational Fund, the Southwest Voter Registration Project      and the Hispanic caucus, among other groups.       ``I don't know why the administration put up Estrada,''      said Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Southwest Voter      Registration Project. ``He was marked as a right-wing      ideologue some time ago. Clearly, that is a tactic by the      Bush administration . . . not to really embrace issues that      are important to Latinos, but to try symbolic measures.''
