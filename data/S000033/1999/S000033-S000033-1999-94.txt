 Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding to me.  Once again, let me point out, I know the gentleman's job is a difficult job, and he has to balance a whole lot of needs.  I guess what I am arguing, and I am glad to hear that companies like Exxon, Chevron, Conoco, Texaco, Amoco, Phillips Petroleum, some of the largest conglomerates in the world, are contributing something into the program. I am glad to hear that.  But the bottom line is, do my colleagues not think these companies, many of them, are enjoying record-breaking profits? Do my colleagues not think they can pay for their own research and developments rather than stick it to local communities, many of whom have got to raise their regressive property tax to fund their basic needs? That is the only point that I would make.
