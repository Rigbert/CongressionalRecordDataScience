This is exactly the same thing. If I responded to everything he said then, I have already done it before. I have read and I have talked about this. I have more scientists, if anyone wants to hear from more scientists. Also, as far as peer-reviewed studies, I have documented it, I have said where they are. So I can just say that so many times.  But here is what I would suggest: What we are talking about is an amendment to this bill, an amendment to the bill which addresses the Corps of Engineers and asks them to report to us on every project, from this point forward, certain types of things, and it describes what they are.  We had a hearing the other day, I say to my good friend from Massachusetts. It was May 11, 2007. That was, what, last week. We have had John Paul Woodley, who is the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works.  This is a quote from his testimony. He said:       The United States Army Corps of Engineers has the capacity      and necessary authorities to comprehensively examine the      uncertainties, threats and vulnerabilities on water      infrastructure and to implement the necessary adjustments as      part of a proactive adaptive management program.  They can do it now. They can do it. This is the head of the Corps of Engineers. So they do not need this amendment.  Now, I wish to say this. We were supposed to have this vote at 5:30. It is now 10 after 6. I am prepared not to say anything else and to yield back the remainder of my time, if the Senator from Massachusetts will do the same thing.
