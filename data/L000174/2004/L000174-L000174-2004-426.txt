President, I see my good friend from Kentucky on the floor, and I want to take this moment to clarify a couple of funding issues in the Foreign Operations portion of the Omnibus Appropriations bill.  I notice that the conference report is silent on the issue of funding for Laos. Is it the chairman's intention that the administration should implement the language contained in the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations Report, 108-106?  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Vermont. Before I respond, I was wondering if he could take a moment to read the Senate report language for the benefit of our colleagues.
