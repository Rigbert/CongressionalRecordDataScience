President, as we approach the close of the 105th Congress, it is time to take stock of our accomplishments, and reflect on the work that remains. When the environmental record of this Congress is tallied up, there won't be much to show. At best, we have avoided a great roll-back of environmental protections. We can't claim to have broken much new ground.  To her credit, Carol Browner and her staff at the Environmental Protection Agency have tried to push ahead in a very difficult political climate. Administrator Browner recently announced that EPA was ordering 22 Eastern states to make sharp cuts in emissions of the pollutants that result in summertime ozone pollution. A significant portion of these pollutants come from coal-fired power plants. The predictable howl from the utility companies and their lobbyists is being heard on Capitol Hill. I applaud Administrator Browner and her staff for their persistence on this important issue.  Even though this is a good step, it doesn't go far enough. Stronger, more comprehensive action is needed to finally address the whole gamut of air pollution problems that spew from power plant smoke stacks.  Taken collectively, fossil fuel-fired power plants constitute the largest source of air pollution in the United States. It is clear by now that the current Clean Air Act and its regulations are not up to the job of addressing the local, regional and global public health and environmental burdens imposed by the emissions from these plants. Congress took a big step to control air pollution with the Clean Air Act of 1970, and it did major rewrites of the Act in 1977 and 1990. Even with all this legislation on the books, most fossil fuel-fired power plants produce as much pollution as they did prior to 1970. The average fossil fuel-fired generating unit in the United States came into operation in 1964--six years before the 1970 Act. Seventy-seven percent of the fossil fuel generating units in operation in the United States began operation before the 1970 Clean Air Act was implemented, and are thus not subject to the full force of its regulations.  At the very heart of the environmental problems posed by this industry are the antiquated and inefficient combustion technologies that are used. Nothing in the Clean Air Act, or in other energy related statues, tackles this inefficiency. The average plant uses technology devised in the 1950's or before, and has a combustion efficiency of 33%. Put another way, 67% of the energy available in the fuel is wasted. When you get so little energy out of the fuel, you have to burn a lot more fuel to produce a given quantity of electricity. The more fuel you burn, the more pollution you get. Increasing efficiency is the only way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, and burning less fuel will result in smaller amounts of all pollutants.  Burning all this fuel may be good for the bottom line of the companies that produce the coal, oil, and natural gas, but it imposes great environmental and health consequences on the rest of us. Many of my colleagues came to the Senate after successful business careers. I imagine that most would agree with me that any other business that was this wasteful would not survive for long.  To produce the power that our economy needs, some level of emissions is inevitable. But this inefficiency, coupled with the free ride on emissions that the pre-1970 plants get, exacts an enormous environmental cost. Consider the following power plant facts:  Every year, fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States produced a staggering 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide, the primary ``greenhouse gas,'' the equivalent weight of 24,655 Washington Monuments.  Over 600 of these generating units produce over one million tons of carbon dioxide per year--two produce more than 9 million tons per year.  On average, coal plants emit over 2,100 pounds of carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity that is generated.  Coal-fired power plants emit at least 52 tons of mercury per year and are the leading source of mercury pollution in the United States.  Power plants emit particulate and urban ozone pollution that impair respiratory function in people with asthma, emphysema, and other respiratory ailments.  Power plant emissions result in acid deposition, which damages lakes, streams and rivers, and the plants and animals that depend on them for survival.  Technology exists that can raise power plant efficiencies to 35% to 50% above current levels. The question is how to get utilities to retire their inefficient processes and bring new, clean, and efficient ones on line. We can see a better future, but we don't have a clear path to get there.  Today, I am introducing the ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of 1998'' to help us get to the other side. My goals with this legislation are tochart a sensible and balanced course for the future that: protects public health and the environment; protects consumers, workers, and the economy; and provides electrical power producers with a clear set of achievable performance expectations and financial incentives for installing new, clean, and efficient electrical power generating capacity that will meet our needs into the 21st Century.  This industry plays a central role in the U.S. economy and in our daily lives. We expect that electrical service will be reliable, predictable and affordable. We flip on the switch without giving a second thought that the light will go on. My bill will not change that.  Major changes cannot be made over night. We know about inertia From Sir Isaac Newton's First Law of Motion that ``any object in a state of rest or uniform linear motion will remain in such a state unless acted upon by an external force.'' The inertia in the utility industry to continue business as usual is overwhelming. The old, inefficient, pollution-prone power plants will continue to operate in perpetuity because they are paid for, they burn the cheapest fuel, and they are subject to less stringent environmental requirements.  My bill provides an ``external force'' in the form of financial and regulatory incentives to prompt modernization that is beneficial for the environment and the economy. It provides industry decision-makers with a comprehensive and predictable set of requirements and incentives to guide their long-term business planning.  For investor-owned utilities, the bill provides accelerated depreciation tax incentives for plants that meet the efficiency goals. Under current tax law, new generating capacity is depreciated over a 20 year period. Under my bill, new capacity that meets a 45% efficiency level would be depreciated over a 15 year period, and new capacity that meets a 50% efficiency level would be depreciated over a 10 year period. Publicly owned utilities would be eligible for grants that have the equivalent monetary value of the depreciation benefit received by a similarly-situated investor-owned utility. This approach will spur innovation, and will reward utilities that aggressively move to increase their efficiency and reduce their emissions.  To pay for these incentives and to achieve this within the balanced budget constraints, my bill establishes a fee that would be levied on carbon dioxide emissions. The emission fees would also provide funds: for worker retraining for individuals adversely affected by reduced consumption of coal; community redevelopment funds; research and development for renewable technologies such as wind, solar, and biomass; development of a carbon sequestration strategy; and implementing carbon sequestration projects including soil restoration, tree planting, preservation of wetlands, and other ways of biologically sequestering carbon dioxide.  I want to work cooperatively with the power companies on this legislation, and I want to work with my colleagues from coal-producing states to minimize the impact of reduced coal consumption on mine workers and mining communities. I also want to work with my colleagues on the Committees that are taking up utility restructuring legislation to ensure that this industry, whether in its current form or in a restructured form, finally comes to terms with the environmental costs of its operations.  While the 105th Congress may not have much of an environmental record to brag about, pressure is mounting to dramatically reduce the environmental impact from fossil fuel fired power plants. The people of Vermont are willing, I look forward to working hard in the first session of the 106th Congress to enact this much needed and long-overdue piece of legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill and the section-by-section overview be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2636       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) the United States is relying increasingly on old,      needlessly inefficient, and highly polluting powerplants to      provide electricity;       (2) the pollution from those powerplants causes a wide      range of health and environmental damage, including--       (A) fine particulate matter that is associated with the      deaths of approximately 50,000 Americans annually;       (B) urban ozone, commonly known as ``smog'', that impairs      normal respiratory functions and is of special concern to      individuals afflicted with asthma, emphysema, and other      respiratory ailments;       (C) rural ozone that obscures visibility and damages      forests and wildlife;       (D) acid deposition that damages estuaries, lakes, rivers,      and streams (and the plants and animals that depend on them      for survival) and leaches heavy metals from the soil;       (E) mercury and heavy metal contamination that renders fish      unsafe to eat, with especially serious consequences for      pregnant women and their fetuses;       (F) eutrophication of estuaries, lakes, rivers, and      streams; and       (G) global climate change that may fundamentally and      irreversibly alter human, animal, and plant life;       (3) tax laws and environmental laws--       (A) provide a very strong incentive for electric utilities      to keep old, dirty, and inefficient generating units in      operation; and       (B) provide a strong disincentive to investing in new,      clean, and efficient generating technologies;       (4) fossil fuel-fired power plants, consisting of plants      fueled by coal, fuel oil, and natural gas, produce nearly      two-thirds of the electricity generated in the United States;       (5) since, according to the Department of Energy, the      average combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil fuel-fired      power plants in the United States is 33 percent, 67 percent      of the heat generated by burning the fuel is wasted;       (6) technology exists to increase the combustion heat rate      efficiency of coal combustion from 35 percent to 50 percent      above current levels, and technological advances are possible      that would boost the net combustion heat rate efficiency even      more;       (7) coal-fired power plants are the leading source of      mercury emissions in the United States, releasing an      estimated 52 tons of this potent neurotoxin each year;       (8) in 1996, fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United      States produced over 2,000,000,000 tons of carbon dioxide,      the primary greenhouse gas;       (9) on average--       (A) fossil fuel-fired power plants emit 1,999 pounds of      carbon dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity      produced;       (B) coal-fired power plants emit 2,110 pounds of carbon      dioxide for every megawatt hour of electricity produced; and       (C) coal-fired power plants emit 205 pounds of carbon      dioxide for every million British thermal units of fuel      consumed;       (10) the average fossil fuel-fired generating unit in the      United States commenced operation in 1964, 6 years before the      Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) was amended to      establish requirements for stationary sources;       (11)(A) according to the Department of Energy, only 23      percent of the 1,000 largest emitting units are subject to      stringent new source performance standards under section 111      of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7411); and       (B) the remaining 77 percent, commonly referred to as      ``grandfathered'' power plants, are subject to much less      stringent requirements;       (12) on the basis of scientific and medical evidence,      exposure to mercury and mercury     compounds is of concern to human health and the environment;       (13) pregnant women and their developing fetuses, women of      childbearing age, and children are most at risk for mercury-     related health impacts such as neurotoxicity;       (14) although exposure to mercury and mercury compounds      occurs most frequently through consumption of mercury-     contaminated fish, such exposure can also occur through--       (A) ingestion of breast milk;       (B) ingestion of drinking water, and foods other than fish,      that are contaminated with methyl mercury; and       (C) dermal uptake through contact with soil and water;       (15) the report entitled ``Mercury Study Report to      Congress'' and submitted by the Environmental Protection      Agency under section 112(n)(1)(B) of the Clean Air Act (42      U.S.C. 7412(n)(1)(B)), in conjunction with other scientific      knowledge, supports a plausible link between mercury      emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil fuels and      mercury concentrations in air, soil, water, and sediments;       (16)(A) the Environmental Protection Agency report      described in paragraph (15) supports a plausible link between      mercury emissions from combustion of coal and other fossil      fuels and methyl mercury concentrations in freshwater fish;       (B) in 1997, 39 States issued health advisories that warned      the public about consuming mercury-tainted fish, as compared      to 27 States that issued such advisories in 1993; and       (C) the number of mercury advisories nationwide increased      from 899 in 1993 to 1,675 in 1996, an increase of 86 percent;       (17) pollution from powerplants can be reduced and possibly      eliminated through adoption of modern technologies and      practices, including--       (A) methods of combusting coal that are intrinsically more      efficient and less polluting, such as pressurized fluidized      bed combustion and an integrated gasification combined cycle      system;       (B) methods of combusting cleaner fuels, such as gases from      fossil and biological resources and combined cycle turbines;       (C) treating flue gases through application of pollution      controls;       (D) methods of extracting energy from natural, renewable      resources of energy, such as solar and wind sources;       (E) methods of producing electricity and thermal energy      from fuels without conventional combustion, such as fuel      cells; and       (F) methods of extracting and using heat that would      otherwise be wasted, for the purpose of heating or cooling      office buildings, providing steam to processing facilities,      or otherwise increasing total efficiency; and       (18) adopting the technologies and practices described in      paragraph (17) would increase competitiveness and      productivity, secure employment, save lives, and preserve the      future.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to protect and preserve the environment while      safeguarding health by ensuring that each fossil fuel-fired      generating unit minimizes air pollution to levels that are      technologically feasible through modernization and      application of pollution controls;       (2) to greatly reduce the quantities of mercury, carbon      dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides entering the      environment from combustion of fossil fuels;       (3) to permanently reduce emissions of those pollutants by      increasing the combustion heat rate efficiency of fossil      fuel-fired generating units to levels achievable through use      of commercially available combustion technology, installation      of pollution controls, and expanded use of renewable energy      sources such as biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind sources;       (4)(A) to create financial and regulatory incentives to      retire thermally inefficient generating units and replace      them with new units that employ high-thermal-efficiency      combustion technology; and       (B) to increase use of renewable energy sources such as      biomass, geothermal, solar, and wind sources;       (5) to establish the Clean Air Trust Fund for the purpose      of encouraging and facilitating the modernization of fossil      fuel-fired generating units in the United States;       (6) to eliminate the ``grandfather'' loophole in the Clean      Air Act relating to sources in operation before the      promulgation of standards under section 111 of that Act (42      U.S.C. 7411);       (7) to express the sense of Congress that permanent      reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases that are      accomplished through the retirement of old units and      replacement by new units that meet the combustion heat rate      efficiency and emission standards specified in this Act      should be credited to the utility sector in any climate      change implementation program;       (8) to promote permanent and safe disposal of mercury      recovered through coal cleaning, flue gas control systems,      and other methods of mercury pollution control;       (9) to increase public knowledge of the sources of mercury      exposure and the threat to public health from mercury,      particularly the threat to the health of pregnant women and      their fetuses, women of childbearing age, and children;       (10) to decrease significantly the threat to human health      and the environment posed by mercury;       (11) to promote energy efficiency in homes, including major      appliances;       (12) to provide worker retraining for workers adversely      affected by reduced consumption of coal; and       (13) to provide economic development incentives for      communities adversely affected by reduced consumption of      coal.

SEC. 11. RECOGNITION OF PERMANENT EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN                    FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE IMPLEMENTATION PROGRAMS.       It is the sense of Congress that permanent reductions in      emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides that are      accomplished through the retirement of old generating units      and replacement by new generating units that meet the      combustion heat rate efficiency and emission standards      specified in this Act, or through replacement of old      generating units with nonpolluting renewable power generation      technologies, should be credited to the utility sector, and      to the owner or operator that retires or replaces the old      generating unit, in any climate change implementation program      enacted by Congress.     SEC. 12. RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION TECHNOLOGIES.

SEC. 16. CARBON SEQUESTRATION.       (a) Carbon Sequestration Strategy.--In addition to amounts      made available under any other law, there is authorized to be      appropriated to the Environmental Protection Agency and the      Department of Energy for each of fiscal years 2003 through      2005 a total of $15,000,000 to conduct research and      development activities in basic and applied science in      support of development by January 1, 2005, of a carbon      sequestration strategy that is designed to offset all growth      in carbon dioxide emissions in the United States after 2010.       (b) Methods for Biologically Sequestering Carbon Dioxide.--     In addition to amounts made available under any other law,      there is authorized to be appropriated to the Environmental      Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture for each      of fiscal years 2003 through 2015 a total of $15,000,000 to      carry out soil restoration, tree planting, wetland      protection, and other methods of biologically sequestering      carbon dioxide.                                  ____      Section-by-Section Overview of the ``Clean Power Plant and                       Modernization Act of 1998''       What will the ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of      1998'' do?       The ``Clean Power Plant and Modernization Act of 1998''      lays out an ambitious, achievable, and balanced set of      financial incentives and regulatory requirements designed to      increase power plant efficiency, reduce emissions, and      encourage use of renewable power generation methods. The bill      encourages innovation, entrepreneurship, and risk-taking.       The bill encourages ``retirement and replacement'' of old,      dirty, inefficient generating capacity. It does not utilize a      ``cap and trade'' approach. Many believe that the      ``retirement and replacement'' approach does a superior job      at the local and regional levels of protecting public health      and the environment from mercury pollution, ozone pollution,      and acid deposition. On a global level, the ``retirement and      replacement'' also does a much superior job of permanently      reducing the volume of carbon dioxide emitted.       Section 4. Combustion Heat Rate Efficiency Standards for      Fossil Fuel-Fired Generating Units.       Fossil fuel-fired power plants in the United States operate      at an average combustion efficiency of 33%. Put another way,      on average, 67% of the heat generated by burning the fuel is      wasted. Increasing combustion efficiency is really the only      way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Section 4 lays out a      phased two-stage process for increasing efficiency. In the      first stage, by 10 years after enactment, all units in      operation must achieve a combustion heat rate efficiency of      not less than 45%. In the second stage, with expected      advances in combustion technology, units commencing operation      more than 10 years after enactment must achieve     a combustion heat rate efficiency of not less than 50%.      Carbon dioxide emission reductions of at least 650 million      tons per year are expected, and the potential exists for even      larger reductions.       If, for some unforeseen reason, technological advances do      not achieve the 50% efficiency level, Section 4 contains a      waiver provision that allows owners of new units to offset      any shortfall in carbon dioxide emissions through      implementation of carbon sequestration projects.       Section 5. Air Emission Standards for Fossil Fuel-Fired      Generating Units.       Subsection (a) eliminates the ``grand father'' loophole in      the Clean Air Act and requires all units, regardless of when      they were constructed or began operation, to comply with      existing new source review requirements under Section 111 of      the Clean Air Act.       Subsection (b) sets mercury, carbon dioxide, sulfur      dioxide, and nitrogen oxide emission standards for units that      are subject to the 45% thermal efficiency standards set forth      in Section 4. For mercury, 95% removal of mercury contained      in the fuel is required. For carbon dioxide, the emission      limits are set by fuel type (i.e., natural gas = 0.9 pounds      per kilowatt hour of output; fuel oil = 1.3 pounds per      kilowatt hour of output; coal = 1.55 pounds per kilowatt hour      of output). Ninety-five percent of sulfur dioxide emissions      (and not more than 0.3 pounds per million Btu's of fuel      consumed), and 90 percent of nitrogen oxides (and not more      than 0.15 pounds per million Btu's of fuel consumed) are to      be removed.       Subsection (c) contains the same emission standards for      mercury, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides as those in      Subsection (b). Greater combustion efficiency results in      lower emissions of carbon dioxide, and the fuel specific      emission limits at the 50% efficiency level are lowered      accordingly (i.e., natural gas = 0.8 pounds per kilowatt hour      of output; fuel oil = 1.2 pounds per kilowatt hour of output;      coal = 1.4 pounds per kilowatt hour of output). Section 6.      Accelerated Depreciation for Investor-Owned Generating Units.       Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, utilities can      depreciate their generating equipment over a 20 year period.      Section 6 amends Section 168 of the Internal Revenue Code of      1986 to allow for depreciation over a 15 year period for      units meeting the 45% efficiency level and the emission      standards in Section 5(b). Section 168 is further amended to      allow for deprecation over a 10 year period for units meeting      the 50% efficiency level and the emission standards in      Section 5(c).       Section 7. Grants for Publicly-Owned Generating Units. No      federal taxes are paid on publicly-owned generating units. To      provide publicly-owned utilities with comparable incentives      to modernize, Section 7 provides for annual grants in an      amount equal to the monetary value of the depreciation      deduction that would be realized by a similarly-situated      investor owned generating unit under Section 6. Units meeting      the 45% efficiency level and the emission standards in      Section 5(b) would receive annual grants over a 15 year      period, and units meeting the 50% efficiency level and the      emission standards in Section 5(c) would receive annual      grants over 10 year period.       Section 8. Clean Air Trust Fund, and Section 9. Carbon      Dioxide Emission Fees.       To offset the impact to the Treasury of the incentives in      Sections 6 and 7, the bill establishes the Clean Air Trust      Fund. The Trust Fund is similar to the Highway Trust Fund or      the Superfund. The revenue for the trust fund will be      provided through phased implementation of a ``per ton fee''      on emissions of carbon dioxide. Implementation of the fee      would begin 3 years after enactment at the rate of $25.00 per      ton. The rate would increase to $37.50 per ton seven years      after enactment, and would be fully implemented 10 years      after enactment at a rate of $50.00 per ton.       The Trust Fund will also be used to pay for assistance to      workers and communities adversely affected by reduced      consumption of coal, research and development for renewable      power generation technologies (e.g., wind, solar, and      biomass), and carbon sequestration projects.       Section 10. Extension of Renewable Energy Production      Credit.       Section 45(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is      amended to include solar power, and to extend renewable      energy production credit to 2010 (it is currently set to      expire in 1999). This section expands on S. 1459 (Senator      Leahy is a co-sponsor) which would extend the credit to 2004.      S. 1459 has been referred to the Finance Committee.       Section 11. Recognition of Permanent Emission Reductions in      Future Climate Change Implementation Programs.       This section expresses the sense of Congress that permanent      reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides      that are accomplished through the retirement of old      generating units and replacement by new generating units that      meet the efficiency and emissions standards in the bill, or      through replacement with non-polluting renewable power      generation technologies, should be credited to the utility      sector and to the owner/operator in any climate change      implementation program enacted by Congress.       Section 12. Renewable Power Generation Technologies.       Beginning 3 years after enactment, this section provides      $75 million per year (for a total of $975 million over 13      years) to fund research and development programs and      commercial demonstration projects and partnerships to      demonstrate the commercial viability and environmental      benefits of electric power generation from biomass,      geothermal, solar, and wind technologies. Types of projects      may include solar power tower plants, solar dishes and      engines, co-firing biomass with coal, biomass modular      systems, next-generation wind turbines and wind verification      projects, and geothermal energy conversion.       Section 13. Evaluation of Implementation of this Act and      other Statutes.       Not later than 2 years after enactment, DOE, in      consultation with EPA and FERC, shall report to Congress on      the implementation of the Clean Power Plant and Modernization      Act of 1998. The report shall identify any provision of the      Energy Policy Act of 1992, the Energy Supply and      Environmental Coordination Act of 1974, the Public Utilities      Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, or the Powerplant and      Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 that conflicts with the      efficient implementation of the Clean Power Plant and      Modernization Act of 1998. The report shall include      recommendations for legislative or administrative measures to      harmonize and streamline these other statutes.       Section 14. Assistance for Workers Adversely Affected by      Reduced Consumption of Coal.       Beginning 3 years after enactment, this section provides a      total of $850 million over 13 years ($75 million per year for      the first 8 years and $50 million per year for the following      5 years) to provide assistance to coal industry workers who      are adversely affected as a result of reduced consumption of      coal by the electric power generation industry. The funds      will be administered under the economic dislocation and      worker adjustment assistance program of the Department of      Labor authorized by Title III of the Job Training Partnership      Act.       Section 15. Community Economic Development Incentives for      Communities Adversely Affected by Reduced Consumption of      Coal.       Beginning 3 years after enactment, this section provides a      total of $850 million over 13 years ($75 million per year for      the first 8 years and $50 million per year for the following      5 years) to provide assistance to communities adversely      affected as a result of reduced consumption of coal by the      electric power generation industry. The funds will be      administered under the economic adjustment program of the      Department of Commerce authorized by the Public Works and      Economic Development Act of 1965.       Section 16. Carbon Sequestration.       This section authorizes expenditure of $45 million over 3      years for development of a long-term carbon sequestration      strategy for the United States. This section also authorizes      EPA and USDA to fund up to $195 million over 13 years ($15      million per year) for carbon sequestration projects including      soil restoration, tree planting, wetlands protection, and      other ways of biologically sequestering carbon dioxide.                                 ______                                       By
