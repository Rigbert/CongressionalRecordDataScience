 President, I think it bears repeating again what I have said the last few days. If you look at the Barack Obama years--he will ultimately have 8 years in the White House--and the George W. Bush 8 years in the White House, and you draw a line at this point in their Presidencies, Barack Obama has gotten 21 more lifetime appointments, Federal judges, than George W. Bush did during the same period. By any objective standard, President Obama has been treated more than fairly during the course of his Presidency--much more fairly than George W. Bush was treated during the same period of his Presidency.  I yield the floor.
