Speaker, on May 9, I came to the Floor and spoke about the March For Our Lives on March 24 and the nine extraordinarily poised students in Morristown, New Jersey, who spoke at the rally there, which I attended. Because they were too long to insert into the Record together, I am submitting them individually. I hope my colleagues will read them and internalize the sense of fear in which our nation's students are living every day--and our responsibility as Members of Congress to do something to address this crisis of gun violence.                     `March for Our Lives' Remarks                           (By Bella Bhimani)       Hi, everyone. Before I begin, I would first like to thank      everyone for coming today to support such an important cause.      The overwhelming support we've received has made all the      difference. And to everyone who donated, whether it be your      time, money or even knitting hats, I cannot thank you enough.      I would also like to thank both the mayor and the Morristown      Police Department for all the help they have provided and      doing everything possible to make this march happen. We also      have four sponsors, Blue Wave NJ, Moms Demand Action, NJ-ll      for Change, and League of Women Voters. These organizations      are all truly amazing and have done so much for us. Lastly I      would just like to say how grateful I am for the incredible      group of students that we have. These students have worked so      hard and without them none of this would have been possible.       One of the questions I've been asked a lot is ``what makes      this shooting so different?'' I can't speak for everyone      else, but I know at least for me, when the last major school      shooting happened, (Sandy Hook) I had only just turned      eleven. It's not that I didn't care, because I was obviously      upset, but I knew that as a fifth grader I didn't have the      power to do anything. Because we live in a world where we are      taught growing up that ``the     adults will handle it''. We expect that the president and all      of our legislators will do their job and when there is a      problem they will actually do something about it. However as      we have grown up we've realized that that is not the case. If      we want change to happen we have to make it happen ourselves.      One of my favorite Gandhi quotes is `Be the change you wish      to see in the world.' And that is why I am up here today. We      are the ones affected and we are the only ones willing to fix      this.       But before I go any further I want to address the      preconceived notion that we are trying to take away all guns.      This is not the case. All we want is to make the world safer,      which is something I think everyone can agree. We believe      this can be accomplished through stricter gun regulations. We      are asking for stricter background checks, raising the age      limit of purchase and, while not everyone may agree, I am      certainly in favor of a ban on assault rifles, which are      truly weapons of war.       Going off of that another question that I am frequently      asked is, what am I actually trying to accomplish with this      march. With that comes the constant criticism that this march      isn't going to suddenly make change happen. And to some      extent they're not wrong. This is not something that will      happen overnight and is a fight that is going to take time.      Every fight has to start somewhere and this is only the      beginning. So to answer the question what I want is to keep      this conversation going. To get Congress to begin discussing      passing stricter gun laws and to show the world that we won't      stop.       That being said, I would like everyone to take a second to      turn to the people around you and introduce yourselves. Get      to know each other, because we are ultimately all one      community, and we are here for the same reason: to put an end      to gun violence. And this change is only going to happen if      we are united.                          ____________________
