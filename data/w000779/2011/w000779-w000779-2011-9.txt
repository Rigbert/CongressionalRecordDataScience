President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation to expand the Wild Rogue Wilderness Area and expand protections to Oregon's iconic Rogue River and its tributaries. I am pleased that Senator Merkley is joining me in this effort, and that Congressman DeFazio has introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives.  The Wild Rogue Wilderness and the Rogue River that runs through it embody one of the Nation's premier recreation destinations, famous for the free flowing waters which provide numerous rafting and fishing opportunities. The headwaters of the Rogue River start in one of Oregon's other great gems Crater Lake National Park, and the river ultimately empties into the Pacific Ocean, near Gold Beach on Oregon's southwest coast. Along that stretch, the Rogue River flows through one of the most spectacular canyons and diverse natural areas in the United States. The Rogue River is a world class rafting river, offering everything from one day trips to week long trips through deep forested canyons. On the land, the Rogue River trail is also one of Oregon's most renowned backpacking routes.  The legislation I introduce today, the Rogue Wilderness Area Expansion Act of 2011, would add 60,000 acres of new wilderness to the existing Wild Rogue Wilderness. The Wild Rogue Wilderness expansion would protect habitat for bald eagles, osprey, spotted owls, bear, elk, cougar, wild coho, wild Chinook, wild steelhead and many others. It would also ensure these treasured lands are protected for generations to come.  My legislation would also protect an additional 143 miles of tributaries that feed the Rogue River with cold clean water; 93 miles would be designated Wild and Scenic Rivers and an additional 50 miles would be protected from mining. The areas receiving protection include Galice Creek, Little Windy Creek, Jenny Creek, Long Gulch, and 36 other tributaries of the Rogue. The Rogue River is one of Oregon's most iconic and beloved rivers. It is a river that teems with salmon leaping up rapids to spawn, and finds rafters down those very same rapids at other times of the year. The Rogue River is home to runs of coho, spring and fall Chinook, winter and summer steelhead, and it has the special distinction of being one of only a handful of rivers in the country with runs of green sturgeon. In 2008, American Rivers named the Rogue and its tributaries as the second most endangered river in the U.S. I am hoping to change that today by introducing legislation to protect this river and its tributaries.  I previously introduced legislation to protect the Rogue River tributaries in the last two Congresses. Since that time, I have worked with the timber industry and conservationists to find a compromise that protects one of America's treasures with additional wilderness designations and more targeted protections for the Rogue's tributaries. I am pleased that nearly 60 local businesses, and over 100 organizations and business in total, support protecting the Wild Rogue, and that support grows every day. Many of those businesses directly benefit from the Wild Rogue and the Rogue River. As I often say, protecting these gems is not just good for the environment, but also good for the economy. These protected landscapes are powerhouses of the recreation economy that draws visitors from around the world to this region and the Rogue River is one of Oregon's most important sport and commercial fisheries. The Wild Rogue is the second largest salmon fishery in Oregon behind the Columbia. The Wild Rogue provides the quality of life and recreational opportunities that create an economic engine that attracts businesses and brings in tourists from around the world. The Rogue River supports 450 local jobs in nearby communities like Grants Pass.  By protecting the Wild Rogue landscape and the tributaries that feed the mighty Rogue River, Congress will ensure that future generations can raft, fish, hike and enjoy the Wild Rogue asit is enjoyed today and that the recreational economy of this region remains strong.  I want to express my thanks to the conservation and business communities of southern Oregon, who have worked diligently to protect these lands and waters and enable the outdoor recreationists to use and enjoy these rivers. I look forward to working with my House colleagues and the bill's supporters to advance our legislation to the President's desk.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.
