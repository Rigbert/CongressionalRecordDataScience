 President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky and the Senator from Arizona for their words. I had hoped to join them on the floor earlier, but I was in the JudiciaryCommittee. So I am very pleased to be able to be here now to say a few words in support of this effort.  I first became involved in the Burmese, or Myanmar, dilemma back in 1995-1996 with then-Senator William Cohen, and we offered some legislation at that time. So we have had the opportunity to follow this situation. I then worked with Senator McConnell a year ago on this legislation. And now I am very pleased to support the renewal of the sanctions imposed on Burma by the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003.  Last year, in response to a brutal and vicious coordinated assault by progovernment paramilitary thugs on members of the National League for Democracy (NLD), and the arrest and detention of NLD's leader, the Nobel Peace Price winner, Aung San Suu Kyi, the U.S. Congress overwhelmingly passed this act. The purpose was to impose a complete import ban on products from Burma.  Working together, the Congress and the administration demonstrated our determination to put pressure on the ruling State Peace and Development Council--that is the military junta formerly known as the SLORC--to release Suu Kyi, and also to respect the 1990 elections decisively won by the National League for Democracy party in Burma and put Burma on an irreversible path of national reconciliation and democracy. One year later, it is clear that the SPDC has failed to make substantial and measurable progress toward implementing a democratic government to have those sanctions lifted.  The junta has failed. The world has condemned the arrest of Aung San Suu Kyi. They have called for her unconditional release. She still remains under house arrest. NLD Vice-Chairman U Tin Oo also remains in custody.  Last August, the junta proposed a seven-point ``roadmap'' to democracy. That included a national convention to take place the following month to draft a new constitution. Yet there is no timetable for restoration of democracy, no assurance that the junta will give up power, and no meaningful participation for Suu Kyi and her party.  Numerous human rights abuses, including torture, forced labor, rape, and sex trafficking continue unabated.  The most recent State Department report indicates that:       The Government's extremely poor human rights record      worsened [in 2003] and it continued to commit numerous      abuses.  Recently, the junta sentenced three Burmese citizens to death for one thing: for meeting with representatives of the ILO, the International Labor Organization. That is how repressive this regime is. If you meet with an organization not favored by the government, you could be sentenced to death.  Mr. President, 1,300 political prisoners are still in jail, many of them elected parliamentarians. According to the State Department, three political prisoners died in custody last year.  The government engages in the production and distribution of opium and methamphetamine.  The Thai-sponsored ``Bangkok Process''--designed to mediate a solution to the political situation in Burma--collapsed after one meeting with the SPDC's refusal to attend further sessions with ``like-minded'' countries. The regime said it was ``too busy'' to attend this week's session.  For years, we have been working with ASEAN nations to put pressure on the military junta to make changes. But these nations were reluctant to do so. The Thailand-sponsored Bangkok Process aimed to do the same thing. However, what is clear is that the military junta has ignored those efforts.  So over the past several months, the regime has gone to great lengths to rehabilitate its standing with neighbors and the international community. Some thought this was evidence that the junta was committed to national reconciliation, that engagement works, and that the sanctions and other pressures on Rangoon should be eased to facilitate the implementation of this new roadmap.  But I think they are mistaken because I think we have learned something now about this regime's intentions. So what we need is substantive and meaningful action, not more promises and empty statements and failure to deliver on commitments.  For over 15 years, this junta has engaged in a systematic campaign to wipe out the democratic movement in Burma and the NLD's 1990 election victory.  For over 15 years, we have listened to assurances that the junta was committed to national reconciliation and a dialog with all parties on restoring democracy, and still nothing has happened.  I was actually cautiously optimistic when Suu Kyi was first released from house arrest 2 years ago. Yet sure enough, 1 year later, she was back in custody. The regime showed its true colors in orchestrating and carrying out a brutal attack. After her release, Aung San Suu Kyi had gone on the road. She was greeted with enormous popularity. The junta's forces attacked her caravan. Many of her people were killed; many were arrested; and she was shoved back into house arrest for doing nothing more than what she was elected originally to do.  So whatever the regime might say about ``roadmaps'' and ``national conventions,'' their actions have clearly demonstrated they are uninterested in restoring democracy to the Burmese people and, more importantly, they are going to take any steps they can to hold on to power.  Even if, as we all hope, Aung San Suu Kyi is released and is invited to take part in a national convention, I think we should maintain the pressure on this junta and keep the sanctions in place.  Now, earlier this week, the junta allowed members of the NLD, the democratic party, to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi to discuss their participation at the convention. But this is hardly progress.  ``Substantial and measurable'' progress is just that, and we should not settle for lofty pronouncements when they have a record of breaking their word on virtually every statement they have made.  So I am very pleased that Secretary of State Colin Powell has testified that the administration supports reauthorizing the sanctions. He recently stated:       I have seen no improvement in the situation. Aung San Suu      Kyi remains unable to participate in public political life in      Burma, and we will not ignore that. We will not shrink from      the strong position we have taken.  So now is not the time to reduce our support for this brave leader. Now is the time to stand with her side by side, to buttress her, to reinforce her, to point out, over and over again that she is the elected democratic leader of that country; now is the time to show the SPDC that America is not going to stand by and see members of the parliament jailed, not going to stand by and see her people continually attacked, and not going to stand by and see every promise the junta made violated.  So I feel very strongly and am very pleased to join with the distinguished Senators from Kentucky and Arizona in supporting this extension legislation.                              S.J. Res. 36       Whereas the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has      failed to make substantial and measurable progress toward      implementing a democratic government in Burma;       Whereas the courage and determination of the people of      Burma in their struggle for freedom and justice remains      steadfast and strong;       Whereas import sanctions and other restrictions against the      SPDC and its affiliated entities should remain in force until      Burma embarks on an irreversible path of reconciliation that      includes the full and unfettered participation of the      National League for Democracy and ethnic minorities in the      country; and       Whereas the Department of State supports the continuation      of sanctions against the SPDC: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress      approves the renewal of the import restrictions contained in      section 3(a)(1) of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of      2003.                                  ____  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to commend Senators McConnell and Feinstein for introducing legislation that will renew sanctions contained in last year's Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this resolution.  The world's democracies have a common moral obligation to promote human rights. In few places is the lack of freedom and justice more appalling than in Burma, a country in which a band of thugs, led by General Than Shwe, controls the population throughviolence and terror. The Burmese regime has a record of unchecked repression. It has murdered political opponents, used child soldiers and forced labor, and employed rape as a weapon of war. Nearly one year ago the Burmese military junta launched an orchestrated, violent attack against democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and hundreds of her supporters. Since then the regime has kept more than 1,000 political activists imprisoned, including elected members of parliament. It also recently sentenced three Burmese citizens to death for contacting representatives of the International Labor Organization.  And Aung San Suu Kyi remains a captive. Because she stands for democracy, this heroic woman has endured attacks, arrest, captivity, and untold sufferings at the hands of the regime. The junta fears Aung San Suu Kyi because of what she represents--peace, freedom and justice for all Burmese people. The thugs who run Burma have tried to stifle her voice, but they will never extinguish her moral courage. Her leadership and example shines brightly for the millions of Burmese who hunger for freedom, and for those of us outside Burma who seek justice for its people. The work of Aung San Suu Kyi and the members of the National League for Democracy must be the world's work.  In recognition of this, last year the Congress overwhelmingly passed the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. In doing so, we took active steps to pressure the military junta, and we sent a signal to the Burmese people that they are not forgotten--that the American people care about their freedom and will stand up for justice in their country.  The State Department released just this week a new report on U.S. trade sanctions against Burma. This report notes that the Freedom and Democracy Act encouraged ASEAN nations to take a critical stance on Burma, and that these pressures were likely a factor behind the junta's August announcement of a ``roadmap'' toward democratic transition. While this roadmap is sorely lacking, it does point to the tangible effect that our efforts are having inside the country.  Yet since we passed our bill last year, the ruling State Peace and Development Council has failed to make substantial progress toward implementing a democratic government in Burma. The new State Department report indicates that Burma's ``extremely poor human rights record has worsened over the past year, and it continued to commit serious abuses.'' Pro-democracy activists remain in detention, the National League for Democracy offices remain closed, and citizens do not have the right to change their government. Security forces continue to commit extrajudicial killings and rape, forcibly relocate persons, and use forced labor. The military junta refuses to tolerate any form of political opposition. On top of this, the dismal economic polices implemented by Burma's rulers have led to widespread poverty and the flight of most foreign investors.  Sadly, the picture is clear. So long as this band of thugs rules Burma, its people will be never be free. They will remain mired in poverty and suffering, cut off from the world, with only their indomitable spirit to keep them moving forward.  For this reason I stand in support of the joint resolution that will renew the import restrictions contained in last year's legislation--sanctions that are supported by the National League for Democracy. These restrictions must remain until Burma embarks on a true path of reconciliation--a process that must include the NLD and Burmese ethnic minorities. I note, however, that while the American people have spoken with one voice in support of freedom in Burma, it is past time that the leaders of other nations do the same. No other country has yet implemented U.S.-style economic sanctions. The Europeans should reject half measures and join the United States in targeted sanctions against the military regime. China, Thailand, India and other Asian nations uncomfortable with a tougher response to the junta's crimes must understand that diplomatic obfuscation and obstruction on Burma will profoundly affect their broader bilateral relationships with the Western democracies.  Mr. President, this week I co-authored with former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright an editorial on Burma for the Washington Post. This article enumerates several of the points that I have made here, and illustrates the bipartisan consensus that we must act to promote democracy and human rights in Burma. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of our editorial be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.
