 President, today I am offering this resolution with my distinguished colleagues, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senators Lugar and Harkin. The resolution addresses an antidumping investigation being conducted by the Government of Mexico, on the import of high-fructose syrup [HFCS] from the United States.  Mr. President, I have often come to the Senate floor to discuss the importance of international trade to our agricultural economy. American farmers have become more reliant on global markets for their income. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates that 31 percent of farmers' income will be derived from foreign markets by the end of the decade.  Because American farmers are the most efficient in the world we should not be frightened by this trend. But we must be more vigilant than ever when it comes to eliminating foreign trade barriers.  Both the North American Free Trade Agreement [NAFTA] and the Uruguay Round Agreement of GATT were successful for American farmers. They served to reduce or eliminate barriers to trade in agriculture products to a greater extent than any prior trade agreement. The implementation and enforcement of these agreements will be crucial to American farmers.  That is why the recent actions of the Mexican Government are so disturbing. The Mexican Government has imposed unreasonably high, preliminary tariffs on imports of HFCS from the United States. These tariffs are far in excess of what was negotiated under NAFTA. The justification for these tariffs is the antidumping action filed by the Mexican sugar industry.  I and my colleagues are very concerned with the propriety of this action. There have been questions raised as to whether the action meets the standards set forth in the World Trade Organization Agreement on Antidumping. I will submit for the Record a letter from the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Jeff Lang, that outlines these serious concerns.  The resolution we introduced today is very simple. It says that if the antidumping action has not been conducted in accordance with WTO requirements, it should be terminated immediately. And all tariffs that have been imposed as a result of the action should be removed immediately.  If the Mexican Government refuses to do this, the United States Trade Representative is directed to request consultations with the Mexican Government, under the dispute settlement provisions of the WTO. This action will trigger a resolution of this dispute according to WTO procedures.  Finally, if the Mexican Government fails to accept our request for consultations, Congress directs the USTR to take any and all applicable actions under United States trade law.  Mr. President, I am a firm believer in free and open trade. It is never productive to engage in a trade war with one of our largest and most loyal trading partners. And that is certainly not the intent of this resolution.  However in order to have fair trade, we must insist that our trading partners live up to the obligations set forth in our trade agreements. This is vital to facilitating the free trade that will raise the standard of living for workers and consumers worldwide.  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter I referred to be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            Executive Office of the President,                                     Washington, DC, June 4, 1997.     Alvaro Baillet,     Jefe De La Unidad, Secretaria de Comercio y Fomento          Industrial, Av. Insurgentes Sur 1940 PISO II, Col.          Florida, C.P. 01030 Mexico, D.F.       Dear Mr. Baillet: The United States has recently been      contacted by American producers of High Fructose Corn Syrup      (HFCS) regarding the initiation of an antidumping      investigation concerning their exports of HFCS to Mexico. Our      producers are concerned that the applicable like product in      the investigation is HFCS, that the investigation was      initiated without the support of the Mexican producers of      that like product, and that certain information about the      Mexican producers of HFCS known to the Mexican authorities      was not considered in the initiation notice.       We have reviewed information that indicates that HFCS was      produced in Mexico during the 1996 period of investigation.      We further understand that this information was available to      SECOFI and the Mexican sugar chamber that submitted the      application for this antidumping investigation prior to      SECOFI's initiation of the investigation. The domestic      producers of the like product on whose behalf the antidumping      application was filed consequently would normally have      included any such Mexican producers of HFCS. SECOFI's      initiation notice, however, does not reference these      producers. It merely states, without support, that HFCS is      not produced in Mexico.       An investigation into allegations of dumping can be      extremely time consuming, expensive and have commercial      consequences even before a preliminary or definitive measure      is in place. For this reason, and because the Antidumping      Agreement is explicit about the need for the authorities to      examine the accuracy and adequacy of the evidence provided in      the application, including that pertinent to the industry      support needed for initiation, we would appreciate your      attention to this matter in time to minimize any unnecessary      impediment to U.S. exports of HFCS.           Sincerely Yours,                                                     Jeffrey Lang,                        Deputy United States Trade Representative.
