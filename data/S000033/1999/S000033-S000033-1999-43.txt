 Chairman, this amendment is a very simple amendment. It prohibits loans in excess of $1 billion to foreign countries from the Treasury Department's exchange stabilization fund unless approved by Congress.  Now this is an unusual amendment in that the sponsors come from a wide and broad spectrum of political life. This amendment is being cosponsored by the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Bachus), the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur), the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher), the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns), the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Paul), the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Visclosky), the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio), the gentleman from California (Mr. Miller), the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Stark). And not only are the Members who are endorsing this amendment from a wide spectrum of political life, so are the organizations who are endorsing this amendment. They include such unions as the United Steelworkers, the Atomic Chemical and Energy Workers, the United Union. They include the Americans for Tax Reform, the National Taxpayers Union, the Alliance for Global Justice, the Competitive Enterprise Institute and many other organizations.  Now why are we all united on this issue? For a very simple reason, and that reason is that the great crisis in American society today is that the vast majority of our people are giving up on the political process.                              {time}  2130  They do not believe that it is worth their energy to vote. In the last election, 64 percent of the American people did not vote. Over 80 percent of the young people did not vote.  What this amendment tries to do right here in the United States Congress is to reinvigorate our democracy. It says that if the President of the United States wants to spend more than $1 billion as part of a loan or a bailout, he must come to the United States Congress to get approval.  As all of us know, the Exchange Stabilization Fund was originally developed in the 1930s to stabilize our currency. That is what it has done. This amendment leaves that function untouched. The President of the United States can continue to do that. But what it does say is that if the President spends more than $1 billion, he must get the approval of the United States Congress.  Once again, this amendment will not in any way restrict the Treasury Department's use of the ESF to stabilize currencies, because currencies stabilization is the purpose for which Congress established the ESF.  The point here is that, as everybody Member of this body knows, that we on occasion spend hours debating how we are going to spend $1 million here or $1 million there. Given that reality, some of us think that maybe we should participate in debates when billions of dollars are appropriated.  Mr. Chairman, in recent years, whether it has been Mexico, whether it has been Asia, whether it has been Latin America, in Brazil, the President has acted unilaterally. I would argue that those of us who believe in the democratic process, those of us who get up here and argue about how we spend $1 million here or there, have a right to participate in how billions of taxpayer dollars are going.  Mr. Chairman, our opponents in this amendment, and they are legion, they are all over the place, no doubt, from both political parties, they are going to say, well, the President has to act in an emergency. But take that argument to its logical extreme. What are we doing here? Are we chopped liver, or what? Is it not time that we revitalize American democracy and get involved in the process?  Now, everybody knows that there are great concerns about the global economy, and honest people have differences of opinion about that economy. I have real fears. I have real fears that when a financial problem in Thailand develops, it spreads all over Asia and it affects the United States. It is amazing to me how little this Congress participates in that debate.  The gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) and I may disagree, but he should not disagree that that debate should taken here on the floor of the House. Has the ESF program worked? Has the IMF program worked? Honest people have differences of opinion. Let us have that debate here on the floor of the House.  Once again, let me inform Members of what this amendment does and what it does not do.
