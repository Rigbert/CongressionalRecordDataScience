                      Tribute to Emmylou Harris  Madam President, last week, at the Birchmere Music Hall in Alexandria, VA, there was a concert that honored one of the most distinguished songwriters and singers I know, Emmylou Harris. Emmylou Harris was honored because of the work she has done to aid victims of landmines and to help stop the scourge of landmines throughout the world. In honoring her, some of the best artists of this country came and sang for her. They honored both her work and, of course, they honored her amazing talent.  My wife Marcelle and I, and our daughter Alicia, and Emmylou's daughter, mother, and friends were there to hear this. She received the award from the Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, the Patrick Leahy Humanitarian Award. I can't think of anything that gave me more pleasure than to give it to her.  I ask unanimous consent that an article from Rolling Stone magazine of November 13, 2002, speaking of Emmylou being honored in Washington, DC, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [Rolling Stone, Nov. 13, 2002]                        Emmylou Honored in D.C.                          (By Lynne Margolis)     musicians, politicians praise harris for landmine charity work       When Senator Patrick J. Leahy presented singer-songwriter      Emmylou Harris with his namesake humanitarian award Tuesday      night at the Birchmere Music Hall in Alexandria, Virginia, he      said her work on behalf of landmine victims might have      touched more lives--in more important ways--than her vast      body of beloved music.       Harris, who received the award from the Vietnam Veterans of      America Foundation for her creation and continued support of      the Concerts for a Landmine Free World benefits, said it      merely represented how blessed she is to be able ``to give      something back'' in exchange for a career that brings her so      much joy that ``you really can't call it work.''       Harris seemed even more humbled than usual by the shower of      accolades from Leahy, VVAF president Bobby Muller and some of      her closest musical friends including Steve Earle, Buddy and      Julie Miller, Patty Griffin, Nanci Griffith, Guy Clark,      Rodney Crowell, John Prine and Jamie O'Hara, all of whom      performed at the benefit concert. Pal Mary Chapin Carpenter      was unable to attend because of back problems, but sent      flowers that adorned the stage of the intimate, 500-seat      venue. Most of the artists had participated in earlier      Landmine Free World concert tours and, like Harris, have      visited countries devastated by landmines that still remain      years after military conflicts have ended. Leahy has      spearheaded efforts for a global landmine ban; VVAF aids      civilian victims of those conflicts.       During a night that focused on the purest of musical      elements--lyrics, wooden guitars, and frequently, Harris'      angelic soprano soaring in harmony with her equally talented      friends--she gave as much praise to her fellow activists and      performers as they did to her.       ``Really what I have done has been given the opportunity to      reflect, or deflect, some of the light that shines on me      because of the nature of my work, and shine it on these      people, these causes, these situations,'' she said backstage.       ``I'm so, so grateful for the opportunity to be able to do      that. Because that's the only way I know to be really      thankful for my blessings. This is a really wonderful moment      for me. And I'm so grateful to all my fantastic friends who      made it possible.''       The night contained a few overtly political references or      anti-war proselytizing, though Prine performed ``Your Flag      Decal Won't Get You Into Heaven'' and his 1970 tearjerker      gem, ``Hello in There,'' with its reference to parents who      lost a son in Korea. Harris noted that her father was a World      War II veteran and Korean War POW, and that the show was      occurring one day after Veterans Day as well as the twentieth      anniversary of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial dedication. She      talked about playing at the memorial's fifteenth     anniversary five years ago and how listening to O'Hara sing      his ``50,000 Names'' was ``the most cathartic experience I've      ever had in my career.'' As he performed the tune again,      sniffles could be heard in the audience. Later, at Harris'      request, Earle did ``a song about faith,'' the title track      from his new album, Jerusalem.       Earlier, Leahy cracked that everybody in Washington was in      the room except U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft, who      ``listens to Steve Earle all the time.'' The outspoken Earle      has made his anti-war and anti-death penalty views well known      in Washington.       Harris noted that ``Jerusalem'' provided a necessary note      of hope, adding ``we're in a very difficult time right now.''      Backstage she said, ``I don't know whether [war is]      inevitable or not. Certainly, the world is gonna change in      some way pretty soon. I can't see the status quo staying the      same.''       But this was a night for positivity and humor, despite the      profusion of sad love songs and achingly beautiful hormonies      delivered on tunes such as Harris' ``Prayer in Open D''      (performed by the Millers as ``Prayer in D'' because, Buddy      explained, ``I can't play an open D'').       For the encore, Harris brought out John Starling and Mike      Auldrige, original members of the D.C.-area bluegrass band      the Seldom Scene, for the Louvin Brothers' classic ``Satan's      Jeweled Crown,'' which she recorded on Elite Hotel.       The evening was probably best represented by comments      delivered by Leahy. ``There are people in Southeast Asia, in      Africa, in Central America, around the world, who are going      to be helped by what you have done,'' he said. ``They will      never know you, they'll never hear your songs, they'll never      know your fame. They'll never be able to do anything to help      you, but because you've helped them, their lives are      immeasurably better. And how many people in life can say      that?''
