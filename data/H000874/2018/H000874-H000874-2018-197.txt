The Speaker has said he was going to address this issue. He has not at this point in time.  The Speaker said on 9/23/2010: We will advance major legislation one issue at a time.  He said: We will not duck the tough issues. We will take them head-on.  In that light, I urge the Speaker to put on the floor the three bills that are pending in this House: a clean Dream Act; the USA Act, sponsored by Representatives Aguilar and Hurd, a bipartisan bill; and a Republican bill, the Securing America's Future Act, sponsored by Representative Goodlatte.  Madam Speaker, let the people's House speak. Let them vote. Put these three bills on the floor, and let the majority rule. That is democracy. Let democracy prevail in this House.                          ____________________
