President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Judd Gregg, to introduce an important bill that will put patients in the driver's seat of their medical care. Today, my fellow Oregonian Representative Earl Blumenauer is introducing the same bill in the House of Representatives.  On the Senate floor and in the Finance Committee and Health Education Labor and Pensions Committee, senators have been wrestling with health reform. The challenge before the Congress is to both expand quality, affordable coverage to all Americans while containing costs.  Cost containment requires a lot of tough choices because it will require changing how care is delivered. The time of paying for volume and low quality is past. Chairman Baucus rightly recognized the challenges in cost containment and took up this issue as the first area he wanted to address in the series of public roundtables held in the Finance Committee.  I believe the key to transforming the health care system and cost containment is to give patients more choices. Patients should have more choices of health insurance plans. Patients should have a choice of doctor. Patients should also have choices in their medical care.  The research by Dr. Jim Weinstein and Dr. John Wennberg with the Dartmouth Atlas Project has documented regional variations in medical care. They have found both underuse, or the failure to deliver needed evidence-based care, and overuse, or the delivery of unnecessary supply-sensitive care. Regional variations are driven by local medical opinion, rather than sound science or the preferences of well-informed patients. Just because doctors are licensed to have a hammer, doesn't make every patient a nail.  Using their research, Office of Management and Budget Director Peter Orszag and other experts have estimated that as much as 30 percent of medical spending today goes to care that is unnecessary. That is 30 percent of $2.5 trillion is $750 billion going to care that does not make patients healthier and may even harm them.  The current standard of medical care in the U.S. fails to adequately ensure that patients are informed about all their treatment options and the risks and benefits of those options. This leads to patients getting medical treatments they may not have wanted had they been fully informed of their treatment options and integrated into the decision making process. In order to deliver the right care at the right time, informed patient choice should be the goal of medical care.  Shared decision making is a collaborative process between the doctor and patient when they discuss the trade-offs among treatment options and discuss the patient's preferences and values. Shared decision making uses patient decision aids, an educational tool like a video or pamphlet that helps patients understand, communicate their beliefs and preferences related to their treatment options, and decide what medical treatments are best for them with their provider based on their medical treatment options, scientific evidence, circumstances, beliefs and preferences.  Informed patients choice depends on clinical comparative effectiveness research that compares the effectiveness of health care treatments. Shared decision making and patient decision aids use clinical comparative effectiveness research so that doctors and patients together make the right medical treatment choice for each individual patient.  This bill creates a three stage phase in of patient decision aids and shared decision making into the Medicare program. Phase I of the pilot is a 3-year period allowing `early adopting' providers--those who already have experience using patient decision aids and incorporating them into their clinical practices--to participate in the pilot providing data for the Secretary and also serve as Shared Decision Making Resource Centers. During this period, an independent entity will develop consensus based standards for patient decision aids and a certification process to ensure decision aids are effective and provide unbiased information. An expert panel then recommends to the Secretary which patient decision aids may be used in this program.  Phase II is a 3-year period during which providers will be eligible to receive reimbursement for the use of certified patient decision aids. New providers may be added on an annual basis allowing for the gradual and voluntary expansion of shared decision making and patient decision aids to a large portion of the country.  The final stage requires all Medicare providers to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive shared decision making and patient decision aids prior to receiving treatment for a preference sensitive condition. If a provider does not ensure that a patient receives a patient decision aid then the provider's reimbursement may be reduced by no more than 20 percent.  This legislation is built on a shared savings model distributing 50 percent of the savings to participating providers based on their participation and performance on quality measures. Twenty-five percent of the savings are used to expand provider participation providing financial support to the Shared Decision Making Centers and providers. The final 25 percent savings are returned to the Medicare program. As shared decision making becomes the standard of practice, the shared savings percentages phases out.  I believe that this simple approach to informed patient choice is critically important to giving patients real choices by engaging them in their health care. As we look to expand access to health coverage, this bill provides a bipartisan, sensible path to putting patients in the driver's seat.  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill, and I look forward to working with Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley and other members of the Finance Committee to secure passage of this important bill.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1133       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Empowering Medicare Patient      Choices Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The Dartmouth Atlas Project's work documenting regional      variations in medical care has found both underuse, or the      failure to deliver needed evidence-based care, and overuse,      or the delivery of unnecessary supply-sensitive care.       (2) The Dartmouth Atlas Project has also found that many      clinical decisions physicians make for elective medical      treatments are driven by local medical opinion, rather than      sound science or the preferences of well-informed patients.      For example, the Dartmouth Atlas Project found that, among      the 306 Hospital Referral Regions in the United States during      the period of 2002 through 2003, the incidence of surgery for      back pain-related conditions and joint replacement for      chronic arthritis of the hip and knee varied 5.9-, 5.6-, and      4.8-fold, respectively, from the lowest to the highest      region.       (3) Discretionary surgery for the following common      conditions accounts for 40 percent of Medicare spending for      inpatient surgery: early stage cancer of the prostate; early      stage cancer of the breast; osteoarthritis of the knee;      osteoarthritis of the hip; osteoarthritis of the spine; chest      pain due to coronary artery disease; stroke threat from      carotid artery disease, ischemia due to peripheral artery      disease; gall stones; and enlarged prostate.       (4) Decisions that involve values trade-offs between the      benefits and harms of 2 or more clinically appropriate      alternatives should depend on the individual patient's      informed choice. In everyday practice, however, patients      typically delegate decision making to their physicians who      may not have good information on the patient's true      preferences.       (5) The current standard of medical care in the United      States fails to adequately ensure that patients are informed      about their treatment options and the risks and benefits of      those options. This leads to patients getting medical      treatments they may not have wanted had they been fully      informed of their treatment options and integrated into the      decision making process.       (6) Patient decision aids are tools designed to help people      participate in decision making     about health care options. Patient decision aids provide      information on treatment options and help patients clarify      and communicate the personal value they associate with      different features of treatment options. Patient decision      aids do not advise people to choose one treatment option over      another, nor are they meant to replace practitioner      consultation. Instead, they prepare patients to make      informed, value-based decisions with their physician.       (7) The Lewin Group estimated that the change in spending      resulting from the use of patient decision aids for each of      11 conditions using per-procedure costs estimated for the      Medicare population studied, assuming full implementation of      such patient decision aids in 2010, would save as much as      $4,000,000,000.
