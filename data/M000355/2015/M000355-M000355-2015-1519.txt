 President, I believe my U.S. Senate colleagues are well aware of how seriously we take our basketball in my home State of Kentucky. I rise to congratulate the statewide champions in girls' basketball in Kentucky, the Covington Holy Cross Indians, who won the Kentucky High School Athletic Association, KHSAA, State Basketball Championship this March 15.  It was a dramatic ending to a spectacular season for the Indians, who finish with a 33-to-3 record. The score in the final game against the Allen County-Scottsville Patriots was tied at 32 with just under 20 seconds to play when senior forward Abby Hassert, who had not scored all game, drove the lane from the top of the key to score a layup and win the game. It was the Indians' first appearance in the State tournament in 39 years, and the game was enjoyed by over 5,000 fans at E.A. Diddle Arena in Bowling Green, KY.  I want to recognize every member of this championship team that is bringing the KHSAA trophy to Covington. Team members include Justice Arce, Zyah Beal, Olivia Crigler, Kate Dreas, Morgan Gabbard, Abby Hassert, Ally Mayhaus, Cessie Mayhaus, Dajah McClendon, Candace McNama, Tara Niehaus, Hannah Niemeyer, Alexis Riep, Aleah Tucker, Courtney Turner, and Deja Turner. The coach is Kes Murphy.  The Lexington Herald-Leader recently published an article about the Indians' victory. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Mar. 15, 2015]      Girls' Sweet Sixteen: Covington Holy Cross Takes State Title                           (By Mark Maloney)       Bowling Green.--Abby Hassert picked a fine time for her      only points of the game Sunday.       Hassert drove down the lane and put in the winning basket,      plus a free throw, with 5.5 seconds left to vault Covington      Holy Cross to a 35-32 victory over Allen County-Scottsville      in the Houchens Industries/KHSAA Girls' Sweet Sixteen      championship game.       ``I knew I had to do something,'' said Hassert, a 5-foot-10      senior. ``I knew that we had to get the ball to somebody to      score and I saw the lane wide open, and I knew I had to take      it.''       An E.A. Diddle Arena crowd of 5,335 roared.       After multiple timeouts, Allen County-Scottsville had a      last shot to tie. But Morgan Rich's long three-point try from      near her team bench hit off the backboard and rim.       ``We got exactly what we wanted,'' Patriots Coach Brad      Bonds said. ``We got Morgan in the right spot for the shot.      We threw it up to Savannah (Gregory), who threw it to Morgan.      It was perfect. It was executed great. We got the shot we      wanted.''       Holy Cross (33-3), out of the 9th Region, ended the season      on a 22-game winning streak.       The Indians, with a school enrollment of 406, also won the      All ``A'' title back on Feb. 1. They are the fourth team ever      to sweep the KHSAA and All ``A'' titles in the same season,      joining Nicholas County (1993), Hazard (1997) and Lexington      Christian (2007).       ``It doesn't matter the size. It really doesn't matter the      size,'' said Deja Turner, who led Holy Cross with 13 points      and five rebounds, and who was named tourney MVP. ``We came      in here against some big, big teams. We knocked off some very      big teams, and we came through and we pulled it out twice.''       Ally Mayhaus added 10 points for the winners.       Holy Cross also beat the Patriots on Dec. 22, 61-54 in      Lexington.       In the Sweet Sixteen, Holy Cross opened with a 51-33 win      over Bell County, then edged top-rated Elizabethtown 41-40.      In the semifinals, the Indians beat Male 47-37.       Allen County-Scottsville (30-5), the 4th Region champion,      had an eight-game winning streak snapped.       ``Bottom line, they made a big-time play. A big-time      play,'' Bonds said. ``And that's what the State Tournament's      all about is kids and very high-quality basketball teams      going at it, and unfortunately we came out on the short end      of the stick. But a lot of credit to them. I thought it was      two outstanding basketball teams battling on both ends.''       Rich, a 5-foot-10 University of Kentucky recruit, led all      scorers with 20 points. She also had three rebounds and two      assists.       Gregory was the next-highest ACS scorer with five. She and      Holly Robinson grabbed seven rebounds each.       Holy Cross Coach Kes Murphy, whose sister Donna was      Kentucky's first Miss Basketball in 1976, credited the      championship to a killer schedule that had his team well      prepared for Sunday.       The game was tied 18-18 at halftime, with ACS holding a 12-     3 advantage in rebounds. Robinson has six of those.       But Holy Cross had a 9-0 edge in points off turnovers.       The Indians led 27-24 through three quarters.       In a game that saw seven ties and six lead changes, the      Patriots took their final lead, 32-31, when Rich hit two of      three free throws with 2:29 left.       A Mayhaus free throw at 1:09 tied the score.       With the Patriots patiently looking for a game-winning      shot, Holy Cross point guard Dajah McClendon picked Rich's      pocket with 32 seconds left.       ``I just knew I had to get up and get one for my team,''      McClendon said. ``We needed that.''       Holy Cross took a timeout at 19.6, which led to Hassert's      game-winning play.       ``She'd better make it,'' Murphy said he thought at the      time of the drive. ``And you know what, she's not an      offensive player. For what we need. But we know she can play,      we know she can make passes and for her to finish and give us      this, it means everything.''                          ____________________
