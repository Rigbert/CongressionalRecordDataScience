President, I urge my colleagues to support the approach offered by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, and Senator Lott, Senator Carper, and myself, and reject the approach offered by Senator Clinton and Senator Akaka.  Senator Clinton said earlier that we are rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic but, in fact, that is what her amendment does. It takes the weak FEMA that we have now and moves it outside of the Department with no new personnel, no new function, no new authorities, no new funding, no infrastructure protection responsibilities, no new communications assets, no new medical assets, no new cyber-security assets.  That is exactly contrary to the approach that we have taken. We have built a new FEMA within the Department with strong authorities--authorities that FEMA has never had--to allow it to respond effectively to a disaster, regardless of its size. We create a new regional structure that will improve the management and the relationship with State and local governments. That is why the first responder groups are all supporting the Collins-Lieberman amendment, and I hope my colleagues will, too.
