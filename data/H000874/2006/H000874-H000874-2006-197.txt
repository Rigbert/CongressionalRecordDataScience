Chairman, I think Perry Mason would be very proud of Mr. Davis on this effort. I understand, you and I have talked about it, it is an important effort. I sympathize and am going to vote with Mr. Markey, but I nevertheless think that your effort is certainly some small attempt to reduce, by some little bit, the $600 billion. I thank the gentleman for his efforts.
