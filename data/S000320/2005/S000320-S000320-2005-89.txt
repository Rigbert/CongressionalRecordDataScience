 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, September 15. I further ask unanimous consent that following the prayer and the pledge the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 2862, the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill.
