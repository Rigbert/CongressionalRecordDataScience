Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of Harold L. Salisbury of East Greenwich, RI. Mr. Salisbury was a volunteer firefighter who lost his life in the line of duty earlier this year.  Harold was a man who truly exemplified what volunteer services in this country is all about. Mr. Salisbury dedicated 31 years to the East Greenwich Fire District. He was called upon day and night to be at accidents, to respond to alarms, and to put out fires. He represented the East Greenwich Fire Department with pride and an unending commitment to protecting people from harm.  In addition to his distinguished service as a firefighter, he worked as a service manager for the Mac Truck Co. in Rhode Island. Harold Salisbury is survived by his wife Carole V. Salisbury and three children; Tracy, Todd, and Peter.  On October 15, 1995, the USFS will hold the 14th Annual Fallen Firefighters Memorial Service in Emmitsburg, MD, to remember and honor those men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for others. Regrettably, more than 100 career and volunteer firefighters from 35 States have lost their lives this year.  Our country is proudly served by just over 1 million firefighters operating out of more than 30,000 fire departments. All of these men and women risk their lives daily to protect the well-being of our Nation. These courageous workers are constantly on call defending their neighbors and property from harm. In fact, public fire departments responded to over 2 million fires in 1994.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of appreciative citizens from Rhode Island and all over the country, I respectfully ask that my colleagues join me in saluting all of the firefighters like Mr. Salisbury, who have fallen in the line of duty. We owe all of these men and women a sincere debt of gratitude for making our country a safer place to live.                          ____________________
