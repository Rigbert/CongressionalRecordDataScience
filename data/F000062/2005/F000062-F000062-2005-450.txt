 President, today Senators Hatch, Kennedy, Specter, Harkin and I are introducing legislation to ban human reproductive cloning, while ensuring that important medical research goes forward under strict oversight by the federal government.  Simply put, this legislation will enable research to be conducted that provides hope to millions of Americans suffering from paralysis and debilitating diseases including Juvenile Diabetes, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, cancer and heart disease.  Every member of this body knows someone--whether it's a parent or grandparent, a child or a friend--who suffers from one of these diseases. That is why this legislation is so critical. We must act now to protect promising research that will bring hope to those who suffer.  I now that every member of this body would agree that human reproductive cloning is immoral and unethical. It should be outlawed by Congress and the President. That is exactly what this bill does.  It prohibits any person from conducting or attempting to clone a human being. It also prohibits shipping materials for the purpose of human cloning in interstate or foreign commerce and prohibits the export of an unfertilized blastocyst to a foreign country if such country does not prohibit human cloning.  Any person that violates this prohibition is subject to harsh criminal and civil penalties. They include: imprisonment of up to 10 years in federal prison.  Fines of up to $1 million or three times the gross profits resulting from the violation, whichever is greater.  This legislation draws a bright line between human reproductive cloning and promising medical research using somatic cell nuclear transplantation for the sole purpose of deriving embryonic stem cells.  Somatic cell nuclear transplantation is the process by which scientists derive embryonic stem cells that are an exact genetic match as the patient. Those embryonic stem cells will one day be used to correct defective cells such as non-insulin producing or cancerous cells. Then those patients will not be forced to take immuno-suppressive drugs and risk the chances of rejection since the new cells will contain their own DNA.  It is truly astonishing that somatic cell nuclear transplantation research may one day be used to regrow tissue or organs that could lead to treatments and cures for diseases that afflict up to 100 million Americans. What we are talking about here is research that does not even involve sperm and an egg.  I believe it is essential that this research be conducted with Federal Government oversight and under strict ethical requirements.  That is why the legislation: Mandates that eggs used in this research be unfertilized.  Prohibits the purchase or sale of unfertilized eggs--to prevent ``embryo farms'' or the possible exploitation of women.  Imposes strong ethics rules on scientists, mandating informed consent by egg donors, and include safety and privacy protections.  Prohibit any research on an unfertilized blastocyst after 14 days--After 14 days, an unfertilized blastocyst begins differentiating into a specific type of cell such as a heart or brain cell and is no longer useful for the purposes of embryonic stem cell research.  Requires that all egg donations be voluntary, and that there is no financial or other incentive for egg donations.  Requires that nuclear transportation occur in labs completely separate from labs that engage in in vitro fertilization.  And for those who violate or attempt to violate the ethical requirements of the legislation, they will be subject to civil penalties of up to $250,000 per violation.  Embryonic stem cell research that is currently being done using private funds, in animal models, and by scientists overseas continues to show great promise and potential. This progress will not be sustained in the U.S. without additional stem cell lines for federally-funded research and without strict federal oversight of this research.  Senator Hatch and I have argued this point for years. What has happened since the President limited federally-funded research to only those embryonic stem cell lines derived prior to August 9, 2001?  Researchers have made a number of advancements confirming the promise of embryonic stem cells using animal models and private research dollars. In the absence of federal policy on embryonic stem cell research and human reproductive cloning, States have taken action creating a patchwork of state laws under varying ethical frameworks. Fewer researchers are choosing to go into this field given the void created by Federal inaction.  Last January, a study published by researchers from the University of California San Diego and the Salk Institute for Biological Studies confirmed that all 22 existing federally-approved stem cell lines are tainted by mouse feeders cells and cannot be used in humans.  Researchers at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, MA, used embryonic stem cells created by somatic cell nuclear transplantation to cure a genetic defect in mice.  Researchers at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York found that embryonic stem cells produce proteinsthat can help ailing organs repair themselves.  Stanford scientists were able to relieve diabetes symptoms in mice by using special chemicals to transform undifferentiated embryonic stem cells of mice into cell masses that resemble islets found in the mouse pancreas.  In the absence of federal legislation, we have seen a patchwork of State laws under varying ethical frameworks and this is extremely worrisome. In total, 30 States have passed laws pertaining to stem cell research and there is tremendous variety in those laws.  California launched a $3 billion initiative to fund embryonic stem cell research including somatic cell nuclear transplantation research which bans human reproductive cloning.  At least 6 academic centers in California including UC San Francisco, Stanford, UCLA, UC Berkeley, UC Irvine and UC Davis have already begun developing facilities where this embryonic stem cell research will be conducted and are all actively recruiting stem cell biologists from across the country.  New Jersey has proposed a $380 million initiative to fund embryonic stem cell research.  Wisconsin has proposed investing $750 million to support embryonic stem cell research.  By contrast, Arkansas, Iowa, North Dakota, South Dakota and Michigan have specifically prohibited nuclear transfer used to create stem cells. And 22 other States have enacted laws on the matter.  What this means is researchers and research money are now moving to States with pro-research laws and pro-research Governors.  There is clearly a void that needs to be filled--and it can only be filled by the Federal Government.  To be clear, this is research that involves an unfertilized blastocyst. No sperm are involved. It is conducted in a petri dish and cannot occur beyond 14 days. It is also prohibited from ever being implanted into a woman to create a child.  For those who believe that the clump of cells in a petri dish that we are talking about is a human life, that is a moral decision each person must make for himself, but to impose that view on the more than 100 million of our parents, children and friends who suffer from Parkinson's, diabetes, Alzheimer's and cancer is immoral.  As former Senator and Episcopal minister John C. Danforth said recently in an op-ed in the New York Times, ``Criminalizing the work of scientists doing such research would give strong support to one religious doctrine, and it would punish people who believe it is their religious duty to use science to heal the sick.  This is exactly why the legislation I am introducing with my colleagues Senators Hatch, Kennedy, Specter and Harkin is needed. I urge the Senate to take up and pass this bill and help turn the hopes of millions of Americans into reality.  I ask unanimous consent that the attached letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     Coalition for the Advancement                                          of Medical Research,                                   Washington, DC, April 21, 2005.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, 331 Hart Senate Office Building Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein, On behalf of the Coalition for the      Advancement of Medical Research (CAMR), I am writing to add      our strong support for the introduction of the Human Cloning      Ban and Stem Cell Research Protection Act of 2005. Along with      Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA),      Senator Ted Kennedy (D-MA), and Senator Tom Harkin (D-IA),      your leadership in protecting research using somatic cell      nuclear transfer (SCNT), also known as therapeutic cloning,      is greatly appreciated.       This year, Congress will address the future of biomedical      research and the Nation's efforts to prevent, treat, and cure      such debilitating diseases as cancer, juvenile diabetes, ALS,      Parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries and many more. Let      me be clear, CAMR supports a ban on reproductive cloning; it      is unsafe and unethical. Given the scientific potential of      SCNT and regenerative medicine, however, we strongly support      the bill's effort to allow for this research, which may      provide essential tools allowing scientists to develop the      promise of embryonic stern cell research. I am sure you will      agree, therapeutic cloning is about saving and improving      lives. It is fW1damemally different from human reproductive      cloning; it produces stem cells, not babies.       CAMR applauds your leadership in sponsoring legislation      that ensures cures for devastating diseases continue to be      developed. We look forward to working with you.           Thank you,                                                     Daniel Perry,                                                        President.
