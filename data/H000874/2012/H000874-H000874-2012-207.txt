 Certainly we're concerned about violence perpetrated against all women who happen to be in this country and subject to violent acts by others. So we want to make sure that we can, in fact, protect all women who are subject to abuse. Hopefully we can pursue that objective.  Mr. Leader, the appropriation bill we just passed was somewhat more controversial than I had hoped it would have been, in part because of the riders that were adopted to that bill, which were strongly opposed by many on this side of the aisle, and in part because we do not believe it complied with the agreement that we reached with reference to funding levels.  There are now 11 more appropriation bills to go. Can the gentleman tell me the next appropriation bill that he expects to have on the floor?
