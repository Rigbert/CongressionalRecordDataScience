President, today we are considering a bipartisan resolution to express the common sense of all in this Chamber that Senator McCain is a ``natural born Citizen,'' as the term is used in the Constitution of the United States. Last week the Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to report this resolution to the Senate. I urge Senators to come together to pass this bipartisan resolution without delay.  Our Constitution contains three requirements for a person to be eligible to be President--the person must have reached the age of 35; must have resided in America for 14 years; and must be a ``natural born Citizen'' of the United States. Certainly there is no doubt that Senator McCain is of sufficient years on this Earth and in this country given that he has been serving in Washington for over 25 years. ``However, some have raised the question whether he is a ``natural born Citizen'' because he was born outside of the United States.  John Sidney McCain, III, was born to American citizens on an American Naval base in the Panama Canal Zone in 1936. His father was serving in the Navy at that time.  It is possible that at the time of our Nation's founding, the Framers of our Constitution could not imagine how pronounced our commitments overseas would become but it would make no sense to limit the careers of children born to military families simply because they were stationed overseas. Similarly, it would not make sense to punish children born to foreign service families or Ambassadors stationed overseas or children born overseas to American missionaries. They are all American citizens at the time of their birth.  Numerous legal scholars have looked into the purpose and intent of the ``natural born Citizen'' requirement. As far as I am aware, no one has discovered any reason to think that the Framers would have wanted to limit the rights of children born to Americans abroad or that such a limited view would serve any noble purpose enshrined in our founding document. Based on the understanding of the pertinent sources of constitutional meaning, it is widely believed that if someone is born to American citizens anywhere in the world they are natural born citizens.  It is interesting to note that another previous Presidential candidate, George Romney, was also born outside of the United States. He was widely understood to be eligible to be President. Senator Barry Goldwater was born in a U.S territory that later became the State of Arizona. Certainly those who voted for these two Republican candidates believed that they were eligible to assume the office of the President.  Because he was born to American citizens, there is no doubt in my mind that Senator McCain is a ``natural born Citizen''. I recently asked Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, a former Federal judge, if he had any doubts in his mind. He did not.  Former Solicitor General Theodore Olson and Harvard Law School Professor Laurence Tribe also analyzed the issue and came to the same conclusion--that Senator McCain is a natural born citizen eligible to serve as President.  Our bipartisan resolution would make it clear that Senator McCain, born in 1936 on an American Naval base to U.S. citizens, is a ``natural born Citizen. We should act today on a bipartisan basis to erase any doubt that Senator McCain is eligible to run for President because of his citizenship status.  I ask unanimous consent that the legal analysis of Theodore Olson and Laurence Tribe be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP,                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 2008.     Re legal analysis of question whether Senator John McCain is          a natural born citizen eligible to hold the office of          President.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen          Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: Pursuant to a request received from      the staff of your Committee, I enclose for your and your      Committee's consideration a copy of my and Professor Laurence      Tribe's analysis of the question whether Senator John McCain      is a natural-born citizen eligible, under Article II of the      Constitution, to hold the office of President of the United      States. Professor Tribe and I are in agreement that the      circumstances of Senator McCain's birth to American parents      in the Panama Canal Zone make him a natural-born citizen      within the meaning of the Constitution.       Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further      assistance in this matter.           Very truly yours,     Theodore B. Olson.                                  ____                                   Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP                                    Washington, DC, April 8, 2008.     Re legal analysis of question whether Senator John McCain is          a natural born citizen eligible to hold the office of          President.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Specter: Pursuant to a request received from      Democratic Committee staff, I enclose for your consideration      a copy of my and Professor Laurence Tribe's analysis of the      question whether Senator John McCain is a ``natural born      citizen'' eligible, under Article II of the Constitution, to      hold the office of President of the United States. Professor      Tribe and I are in agreement that the circumstances of      Senator McCain's birth to American parents in the Panama      Canal Zone make him a natural born citizen within the meaning      of the Constitution.       Please do not hesitate to contact me if I can be of further      assistance in this matter.           Very truly yours,     Theodore B. Olson.                                  ____                                                   March 19, 2008.       We have analyzed whether Senator John McCain is eligible      for the U.S. Presidency, in light of the requirement under      Article II of the U.S. Constitution that only ``natural born      Citizen[s] . . . shall be eligible to the Office of      President.'' U.S. Const. art. II, Sec. 1, cl. 5. We conclude      that Senator McCain is a ``natural born Citizen'' by virtue      of his birth in 1936 to U.S. citizen parents who were serving      their country on a U.S. military base in the Panama Canal      Zone. The circumstances of Senator McCain's birth satisfy the      original meaning and intent of the Natural Born Citizen      Clause, as confirmed by subsequent legal precedent and      historical practice.       The Constitution does not define the meaning of ``natural      born Citizen.'' The U.S. Supreme Court gives meaning to terms      that are not expressly defined in the Constitution by looking      to the context in which those terms are used; to statutes      enacted by the First Congress, Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S.      783, 790-91 (1983); and to the common law at the time of the      Founding. United States v. Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. 649, 655      (1898). These sources all confirm that the phrase ``natural      born'' includes both birth abroad to parents who were      citizens, and birth within a nation's territory and      allegiance. Thus, regardless of the sovereign status of the      Panama Canal Zone at the time of Senator McCain's birth, he      is a ``natural born'' citizen because he was born to parents      who were U.S. citizens.       Congress has recognized in successive federal statutes      since the Nation's Founding that children born abroad to U.S.      citizens are themselves U.S. citizens. 8 U.S.C. Sec. 1401(c);      see also Act of May 24, 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-250, Sec. 1, 48      Stat. 797, 797. Indeed, the statute that the First Congress      enacted on this subject not only established that such      children are U.S. citizens, but also expressly referred to      them as ``natural born citizens.'' Act of Mar. 26, 1790, ch.      3, Sec. 1, 1 Stat. 103, 104.       Senator McCain's status as a ``natural born'' citizen by      virtue of his birth to U.S. citizen parents is consistent      with British statutes in force when the Constitution was      drafted, which undoubtedly informed the Framers'      understanding of the Natural Born Citizen Clause. Those      statutes provided, for example, that children born abroad to      parents who were ``natural-born Subjects'' were also      ``natural-born Subjects . . . to all Intents, Constructions      and Purposes whatsoever.'' British Nationality Act, 1730, 4      Geol. 2, c. 21. The Framers substituted the word ``citizen''      for ``subject'' to reflect the shift from monarchy to      democracy, but the Supreme Court has recognized that the two      terms are otherwise identical. See, e.g., Hennessy v.      Richardson Drug Co., 189 U.S. 25, 34-35 (1903). Thus, the      First Congress's statutory recognition that persons born      abroad to U.S. citizens were ``natural born'' citizens fully      conformed to British tradition, whereby citizenship conferred      by statute based on the circumstances of one's birth made one      natural born.       There is a second and independent basis for concluding that      Senator McCain is a ``natural born'' citizen within the      meaning of the Constitution. If the Panama Canal Zone was      sovereign U.S. territory at the time of Senator McCain's      birth, then that fact alone     would make him a ``natural born'' citizen under the well-     established principle that ``natural born'' citizenship      includes birth within the territory and allegiance of the      United States. See, e.g., Wong Kim Ark, 169 U.S. at 655-66.      The Fourteenth Amendment expressly enshrines this connection      between birthplace and citizenship in the text of the      Constitution. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Sec. 1 (``All persons      born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the      jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States. * *      * '') (emphases added). Premising ``natural born''      citizenship on the character of the territory in which one      is born is rooted in the common-law understanding that      persons born within the British kingdom and under loyalty      to the British Crown--including most of the Framers      themselves, who were born in the American colonies--were      deemed ``natural born subjects.'' See, e.g., 1 William      Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 354 (Legal      Classics Library 1983) (1765) (``Natural-born subjects are      such as are born within the dominions of the crown of      England, that is, within the ligeance, or as it is      generally called, the allegiance of the king.* * * '').       There is substantial legal support for the proposition that      the Panama Canal Zone was indeed sovereign U.S. territory      when Senator McCain was born there in 1936. The U.S. Supreme      Court has explained that, ``[f]rom 1904 to 1979, the United      States exercised sovereignty over the Panama Canal and the      surrounding 10-mile-wide Panama Canal Zone.'' 0'Connor v.      United States, 479 U.S. 27, 28 (1986). Congress and the      executive branch similarly suggested that the Canal Zone was      subject to the sovereignty of the United States. See, e.g.,      The President--Government of the Canal Zone, 26 Op. Att'y      Gen. 113, 116 (1907) (recognizing that the 1904 treaty      between the United States and Panama ``imposed upon the      United States the obligations as well as the powers of a      sovereign within the [Canal Zone]''); Panama Canal Act of      1912, Pub. L. No. 62-337, Sec. 1, 37 Stat. 560, 560      (recognizing that ``the use, occupancy, or control'' of the      Canal Zone had been ``granted to the United States by the      treaty between the United States and the Republic of      Panama''). Thus, although Senator McCain was not born within      a State, there is a significant body of legal authority      indicating that he was nevertheless born within the sovereign      territory of the United States.       Historical practice confirms that birth on soil that is      under the sovereignty of the United States, but not within a      State, satisfies the Natural Born Citizen Clause. For      example, Vice President Charles Curtis was born in the      territory of Kansas on January 25, 1860--one year before      Kansas became a State. Because the Twelfth Amendment requires      that Vice Presidents possess the same qualifications as      Presidents, the service of Vice President Curtis verifies      that the phrase ``natural born Citizen'' includes birth      outside of any State but within U.S. territory. Similarly,      Senator Barry Goldwater was born in Arizona before its      statehood, yet attained the Republican Party's presidential      nomination in 1964. And Senator Barack Obama was born in      Hawaii on August 4, 1961--not long after its admission to the      Union on August 21, 1959. We find it inconceivable that      Senator Obama would have been ineligible for the Presidency      had he been born two years earlier.       Senator McCain's candidacy for the Presidency is consistent      not only with the accepted meaning of ``natural born      Citizen,'' but also with the Framers' intentions when      adopting that language. The Natural Born Citizen Clause was      added to the Constitution shortly after John Jay sent a      letter to George Washington expressing concern about      ``Foreigners'' attaining the position of Commander in Chief.      3 Max Farrand, The Records of the Federal Convention of 1787,      at 61 (1911). It goes without saying that the Framers did not      intend to exclude a person from the office of the President      simply because he or she was born to U.S. citizens serving in      the U.S. military outside of the continental United States;      Senator McCain is certainly not the hypothetical      ``Foreigner'' who John Jay and George Washington were      concerned might usurp the role of Commander in Chief.       Therefore, based on the original meaning of the      Constitution, the Framers' intentions, and subsequent legal      and historical precedent, Senator McCain's birth to parents      who were U.S. citizens, serving on a U.S. military base in      the Panama Canal Zone in 1936, makes him a ``natural born      Citizen'' within the meaning of the Constitution.
