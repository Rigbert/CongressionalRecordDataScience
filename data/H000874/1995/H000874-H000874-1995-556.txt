Speaker, it was our understanding--and I was just checking to make sure with our minority leader's staff to make sure--we do not expect any Member to ask for and we do not plan to ask for a vote on the rule, as the gentleman suggests.  In light of that, I ask the gentleman, is it possible, therefore, for us to notify Members that pursuant to an agreement between the majority and the minority that there would be no votes on Tuesday, so that Members, if they need to, could return either late Tuesday or Wednesday morning?
