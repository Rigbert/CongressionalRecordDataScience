 President, throughout the week, I have raised questions about the President's level of seriousness and engagement when it comes to resolving the short- and long-term fiscal challenges we face. I have done this because, as I have said repeatedly, the President is the key to success in all of these discussions. So I am hoping that when Secretary Geithner comes up to the Capitol today, he brings a specific plan from the President that the two parties could agree to for the good of the country. I hope to hear the administration's specific plans for protecting jobs and promoting economic growth for middle-class Americans, while reducing the debt by strengthening entitlements, reducing Washington's spending, and preventing a tax hike on every American taxpayer.  Up until now, the White House has preferred talking points and an appeal to the hard left to a serious discussion about how we fix the economy, reduce the Federal debt, and return the country to a path of growth and prosperity for all.
