Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, so we come to this hour. There will be a subsequent vote on final passage of Shays-Meehan, but this is the critical vote. This vote will determine whether years of hard work and commitment will be realized through the effective passage of legislation to reform campaign finance.  Yes, there is another day for the Thomas substitute. It is a noncontroversial piece of legislation. But it is not campaign finance reform, although it has some aspects of that. It is, in fact, reform of the process of the FEC. That process needs reforming. I would even ask perhaps for unanimous consent that we place this on the consent calendar tomorrow. I will not do that, but I suggest that it could happen.  Now, at this late hour, before day's end, before the clock strikes 12, we can pass meaningful campaign finance reform. But in order to do that, we must reject the Thomas legislation, which, as the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Davis) clearly posited, was a device to defeat a bill that the Chairman does not like. I accept that. But no one ought to misunderstand what the Thomas substitute is, a device to defeat Shays-Meehan.  It ought, therefore, to be rejected, so that we can honestly fulfill the Speaker's pledge, which was a pledge to vote on Shays-Meehan, not merely to bring it to the floor so that opponents could, by some procedural device, dispose of it before we had a chance to vote on it. But let us, as we were elected to do, make a decision. Let us vote on Shays-Meehan, and say to the American people ``This is where we stand on preventing soft money, on precluding sham ads, and on providing for a system that is more open and more fair to the American public,'' so that the cynicism that now abounds can, to some degree at least, be diminished, and the American public can have more faith in their political system and, yes, in us.  I urge a ``no'' vote on the Thomas substitute and a ``yes'' vote on Shays-Meehan, which is meaningful, important, campaign finance reform.                              {time}  2310
