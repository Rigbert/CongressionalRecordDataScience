President, today's passage of the Preserving Independence of Financial Examinations Act of 2003 is an example of solid, efficient bipartisan work on a needed legislative reform. I am pleased to have seen its passage so swiftly through the U.S. Senate and I thank my friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, for his assistance and advice.  The bill provides a logical and necessary modification to important, but outdated, criminal statutes originally written to ensure the objectivity and integrity of financial institution examinations. Sections 212 and 213 of title 18 of the United States Code, first drafted in 1948, appropriately provide criminal penalties for bank examiners who are offered, or who accept, a loan or gratuity from the financial institution they are examining. This bill exempts from the law's reach ordinary credit card and residential home mortgage loans sought and held by bank examiners in their everyday lives.  Several factors supported the proposed blanket credit card and residential loan exceptions. Most important, consolidation within the banking industry made it increasingly difficult for examiners to obtain nationally available credit cards and mortgage loans and for the banking agencies to assign examiners to work.  The Leahy-Hatch bill strictly defines the circumstances under which the exceptions to the criminal statute apply with a keen eye on preserving the independence of financial institution examinations and the original legislative intent of the statute.  I thank Senator Hatch for his assistance in this bill forward and making it possible for bank examiners to engage in arms-length and routine business transactions without fear of prosecution. I also thank our friends in the banking agencies, including the Federal Reserve Bank, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for bringing this important issue to our attention.
