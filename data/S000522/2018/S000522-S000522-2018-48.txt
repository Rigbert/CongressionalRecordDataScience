Mr. Speaker, I thank Dr. Harris for his very eloquent remarks and for reminding us that this is the greatest human rights struggle on Earth.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx), the chairwoman of the Education and the Workforce Committee. Ms. Foxx has been a lifelong leader on the issue of life and, of course, in leadership, and now as a full committee chairman. I thank the gentlewoman for all she does on behalf of the unborn and their mothers each and every day.
