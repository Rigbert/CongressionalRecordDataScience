Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 152) expressing the sense of the Congress that all parties to the multiparty peace talks regarding Northern Ireland should condemn violence and fully integrate internationally recognized human rights standards and adequately address outstanding human rights violations as part of the peace process, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 152       Whereas multiparty talks regarding Northern Ireland      attended by representatives of the British and Irish      Governments and representatives elected from political      parties in Northern Ireland are underway for the first time      since the partition of Ireland in 1922 creating a momentous      opportunity for progress on human rights concerns;       Whereas human rights violations and the lack of      accountability by those responsible for such violations have      been persistent features of the conflict in Northern Ireland;      and       Whereas more than 3,000 people have died and thousands more      have been injured as a result of the political violence in      Northern Ireland since 1969: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring), That--       (1) the Congress condemns the violence committed on all      sides of the conflict in Northern Ireland as illegal, unjust,      and inhumane;       (2) the Congress commends the leadership in both the      British and Irish Governments and former United States      Senator George Mitchell, Independent Chairman of the      multiparty talks, for fostering a new environment in which      human rights concerns may be addressed and an agreement may      be reached expeditiously through inclusive talks with respect      to Northern Ireland; and       (3) it is the sense of the Congress that--       (A) all parties should reject violence and work diligently      through democratic, peaceful means to reach a just and      lasting peace in Northern Ireland;       (B) human rights should be protected for all citizens and      any peace agreement in Northern Ireland must recognize the      state's obligation to protect human rights in all      circumstances; and       (C) there are a number of measures which can be taken      immediately that would remedy abusive human rights policies      and build confidence in the peace process, such as acting      upon the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights (SACHR)      report and recommendations put forth by other human rights      organizations.                              {time}  1615
