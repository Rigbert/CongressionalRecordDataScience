President, I rise today to introduce the Military Spouse Physician Choice Act of 2001. This legislation amends the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services, CHAMPUS, to eliminate the requirement that a military dependent obtain a nonavailability statement, NAS, or a waiver from a commanding officer of a military treatment facility, in order to receive maternity care from a civilian doctor. I am pleased that my colleague Senator Landrieu is joining me in introducing this legislation.  This legislation, which is a companion to H.R. 1511, introduced in the House by Representatives Jim Ryun and Susan Davis, will eliminate the requirement for TRICARE Standard maternity patients to obtain military nonavailability statements before seeing other doctors. Under current policy, Standard patients who live within 40 miles of a military medical facility must obtain a NAS from the facility commander before receiving pregnancy care from a civilian physician.  Over 53 percent of our Nation's active service personnel today are married. Maintaining a high quality of life for these men and women in uniform must include the best possible health care for their spouses. While the services may recruit men and women to serve in our military forces, the reality is that we retain families to protect our Nation. It is therefore critical that all military spouses receive the health care services they signed up for.  Currently, a military dependent has two options under the military's health care system. All military personnel and 84 percent of military dependents enroll in TRICARE Prime, which is the military's version of an HMO. Prime provides quality care, usually at a military treatment facility on the post or base. However, some dependents choose to enroll in the military's fee-for-service plans, called TRICARE Standard and Extra. These dependents voluntarily accept higher copayments and deductibles in return for the promise of freedom to choose their own doctor.  Unfortunately, the promises in the enrollment brochure do not apply in all circumstances. Currently, a woman who chooses a civilian doctor through TRICARE Standard or Extra is forced to change doctors and return to the military treatment facility when she becomes pregnant. The only way for her to continue using her own doctor is to receive special permission from the commanding officer of that military treatment facility. The result is a bureaucratic nightmare.  This situation is a concern for military dependents across the country. It represents a break in continuity of care that compromises the invaluable relationship between a woman and her doctor. A woman who has a trusted relationship with her civilian ob/gyn is required to change to a doctor at the military treatment facility due to an unnecessary regulation that can, and should, be fixed.  Military families deserve better treatment. Many of them consistently pay higher premiums and accept higher out-of-pocket costs in exchange for an active role in controlling their health care decisions. It should not take a military order to allow a woman to stay with her regular doctor for prenatal, delivery and postnatal care. This is why Senator Landrieu and I are introducing legislation to cut through this burdensome red tape. The Military Spouse Physician Choice Act would eliminate the need for women to get special permission to receive the continuity of care they were promised.  Over the past few years, Congress has made several positive changes to military health care services. We have given our military personnel the ability to choose the health care option that is right for each of their families. We have enabled our military treatment facilities to maintain a high level of excellence, making them the choice of most military dependents. It only follows that a pregnant spouse should be able to choose to utilize that treatment facility but not be mandated to do so.  If we want to continue to recruit and retain quality people for our armed services, we need to show them that they and their families will be treated fairly when making health care decisions.  I am very pleased that the Military Coalition, a consortium of nationally prominent uniformed services and veterans organizations representing more than 5.5 million members plus their families, has endorsed this legislation. The Retired Officers Association, TROA, has as well because the current policy denies TRICARE Standard beneficiaries one of the most important principles of quality health care, continuity of care by a provider of their choice.  I urge all Members of the Senate to join me and Senator Landrieu in support of the Military Spouse Physician Choice Act.  I ask consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1096       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
