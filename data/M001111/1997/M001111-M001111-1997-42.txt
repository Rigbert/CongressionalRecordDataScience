 President, the following is an article written by Metropolitan King County Councilman Larry Philips of the fourth district and Metropolitan King County Councilwoman Louise Miller of the third district. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          Congress Should Embrace Investment in Arts, Culture                 (By Louise Miller and Larry Phillips)       ``Democracy demands wisdom and vision in its citizens and *      * * must therefore foster and support a form of education,      and access to the arts and the humanities, designed to make      people of all backgrounds * * * masters of their technology      and not its unthinking servant.''--The Declaration of Purpose      for the National Foundation of the Arts and Humanities Act of      1965.       With the establishment of the National Endowment for the      Arts (NEA) in 1965, our country has come a long way in      achieving the ideal of access to and participation in the      arts for all Americans. Today, that ideal is under attack.       There has been a movement in Congress to eliminate all      public investment in the cultural activities of our nation,      specifically, by targeting the NEA. Although funding for the      NEA was recently restored by a Senate subcommittee after it      had been eliminated by the House, the agency's future remains      uncertain. In September, a joint committee of House and      Senate members will negotiate the fate of the NEA and the      investment we make in our arts and cultural heritage. Is the      U.S. to be the only Western nation on earth not to fund its      cultural legacy?       As elected leaders in King County, we firmly believe that      the NEA is a critical investment that helps keep the arts      alive and accessible for all residents in our nation and,      closer to home, in King County. Why is the NEA so important?      With the NEA's support, the King County Arts Commission      (KCAC) was created in 1967--the nation's first county arts      commission. Since then, an entire ``cultural sector'' has      burgeoned in our region, stimulating a stronger economy,      enriching our quality of life and enhancing education in the      arts.       Vital arts organizations and active participation in the      arts are increasingly essential to our regional economy. Not      only do the arts contribute to our quality of life in the      Northwest, but they also generate over $180 million annually      to our economy, according to a Corporate Council on the Arts      1992 economic impact study. In addition, cultural tourism      means big business to our area. When the Seattle Opera      presents Wagner's Ring Cycle, it attracts an audience from      all 50 states and 18 countries.       Opponents of the NEA state that the arts should be funded      exclusively through private contributions. This demonstrates      a lack of understanding about arts funding. Many private      organizations will not make a financial donation to an artist      or arts organization unless they have also received grant      funding from the NEA or their state or local arts agency.      Donations by private corporations, foundations and      individuals cannot fill the financial gap that would be      created if the NEA were eliminated. In other words, the small      percentage of funds contributed by the NEA and public      agencies is essential in order for nonprofit arts      organizations to leverage donations from private sources.       Critics of the NEA have questioned the value of the artwork      that has received NEA funds. Let's look at the real picture.      In the last three years, over 40 local and regional arts      organizations have received $3.1 million in direct NEA grants      (equal to about 1 percent of their combined operating      budgets). Who are these organizations? They range from major      ones like the Seattle Symphony, the Seattle Opera and the      Seattle Repertory Theater, so suburban groups like the      Village Theater in Issaquah and the Vashon Allied Arts, to      youth-centered organizations including the Seattle Youth      Symphony Orchestra, the Northwest Girlchoir and Seattle      Children's Theater.       These organizations reflect the rich diversity of our      community and the best work of our finest artists. More      importantly, the grant funding helps ensure that the arts--     and all the enrichment and joy that they bring--are      affordable for the families and young people of our region. A      requirement for an arts organization that receives grant      funding is to broaden public access to the arts. That may be      in the form of reduced ticket prices or special performances      for school groups.       Another good example of local NEA support is this year's      inaugural season of the King County Performance Network, a      collaboration between the KCAC and 14 suburban arts agencies.      A $60,000 grant from the NEA to the KCAC will help bring      outstanding dance ensembles to under-served suburban      communities from Redmond to Federal Way beginning Sept. 6.      The Performance Network is a good example of the vast      majority of projects supported by the NEA: It brings art into      the lives of those who may not otherwise have the      opportunity.       The success of the arts in our region is the result of a      strong partnership among the NEA, more than two dozen local      governments and nonprofit arts agencies, hundreds of      businesses and foundations, and thousands of private      citizens. Thanks to this partnership, King County residents      enjoy one of the highest cultural participation rates per      capita in the nation. With the full participation of the NEA,      that partnership is threatened, and the rich cultural      environment of our nation and King County will be severely      undermined.       As we celebrate 30 years of public support of the arts, we      strongly believe that public investment for culture and the      arts should be strengthened and valued. The partnership we      have enjoyed for nearly a generation should be preserved so      that today's and tomorrow's citizens may enjoy the cultural      heritage and traditions of our region and our nation. As we      look toward the future, the county pledges to continue its      mission to raise the standard of artistic accomplishment in      King County and to broaden cultural opportunities for all our      citizens, not merely those who can afford it. Congress should      do the same.
