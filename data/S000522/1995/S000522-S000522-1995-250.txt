Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, I would like to call the attention of my colleagues to the recent passing of Sister Ann Gillen, one of the leading human rights activists on behalf of persecuted Jewish dissidents and refuseniks in the former Soviet Union. A member of the Society of the Holy Child Jesus, Sister Ann served for 15 years as executive director of the Interreligious Task Force for Soviet Jewry. On numerous occasions, she traveled to the former Soviet Union to visit and support Jewish refuseniks and the families of political prisoners. In addition, Sister Ann was a frequent attendee at international human rights fora. An unwavering supporter of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, Sister Ann served as a leader for several human rights delegations to the Belgrade, Madrid and Vienna CSCE Review Conferences where she urged political figures and diplomats to press the Soviets to live up to their own obligations under the Helsinski Accords and other international agreements.  Sister Ann was a woman of action when responding to the plight of Soviet Jews. In 1979, Sister Ann offered her own freedom to the Soviet Government in exchange for the release of long-time refusenik Ida Nudel. Needless to say, the Soviets refused, but her gesture helped dramatize Ida Nudel's plight to the world and bring additional pressure on Kremlin leaders to allow Nudel to emigrate. In 1982, Sister Ann was one of three human rights leaders to serve an historic Writ of Habeas Corpus on the Soviet Consul in Washington, DC for Andrei Sakharov. In 1989, while attending the Sakharov International Human Rights Conference in Moscow, Sister Ann publicly urged Soviet leaders to end state regulation of religion.  Long before others were encouraged to speak out on behalf of religious liberty and long before religious organizations collaborated on issues such as these, Sister Ann crossed ecumenical lines and reached out to persecuted, imprisoned human beings of all faiths--and in particular the Soviet Jews--to bring them hope and to fight tirelessly for their rights. Even in the last days of her life, Sister Ann did not think of her own pain, but of the suffering of religious believers around the world as she continued to plan conferences and projects that would go on after her own work had ended.  Sister Ann's fellow campaigner in the struggle for Soviet Jewry, Union of Councils President Pamela Braun Cohen, was certainly correct when she said, ``No doubt thousands of Soviet Jews owe their freedom to Sister Ann's tireless efforts.''  Dr. Kent Hill, President of Eastern Nazarene College and an expert on religion in the former Soviet Union, described Sister Ann as ``a tireless, selfless, and effective advocate of those who suffered because of their religious convictions.''  In an award presented to her by a coalition of human rights organizations just prior to her death, Sister Ann was honored with these words: ``All of us who are novices in this work are very grateful for the paths that you have paved for us. This small token of our admiration pales in contrast to the contributions that you have given to make the world more humane. Perhaps, someday, we, following your example, may demonstrate the same depth of devotion and be a role model to other human rights activists.''  Mr. Speaker, Sister Ann exemplified the finest qualities of her faith and her religious order as she reached across ethnic and religious boundaries to rescue strangers in distress. Her many friends and associates, and those who benefitted from her tireless efforts, will cherish her memory.                          ____________________
