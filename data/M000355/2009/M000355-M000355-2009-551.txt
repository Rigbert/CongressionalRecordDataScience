 President, there is no debate among Republicans concerning access to affordable health care for children--we believe every child should have access to quality affordable health care.  Many of us are proud of our role in creating the children's health program, SCHIP. We think it ought to be reauthorized responsibly.  But we are troubled by the direction the program has taken in recent years. It has strayed from its original purpose--the purpose Republicans support--of providing coverage to low-income, uninsured children.  This bill before us would only exacerbate those troubling trends.  That is why I offered an alternative--the Kids First Act--to return the children's health program to its original purpose of covering low-income children.  Senate Republicans also believe we need to focus scarce resources on those families who need it most. Mr. Cornyn  offered an amendment to use any leftover state funds to help insure children who are eligible, but not enrolled, rather than expanding to high-income beneficiaries.  Senate Republicans believe SCHIP should cover those children who don't have insurance yet. Senator Kyl offered a commonsense amendment which says kids should be able to keep the coverage they have, freeing up resources to enroll more children who don't have insurance.  Senate Republicans believe that States should cover low-income children who are not yet enrolled before they expand subsidies to wealthier families. Senators Murkowski, Specter, Collins, and Johanns offered an amendment to require just that.  Regrettably, our friends across the aisle rejected each and every one of these commonsense proposals.  As a result, we are left with a bill that fails to address the fundamental problems facing this children's health program--and that I cannot support.
