Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to inform the membership this bill has been moving at record speeds today, and I want to express my personal appreciation to the majority for avoiding the kind of difficulty we faced on the floor the week before last on this bill. We have several Members that had wanted to offer amendments to the bill, and I think some of them did not anticipate it would have moved as swiftly as it has this afternoon, and I just wanted to make sure and put on the record that there may be some remaining amendments.  Mr. Chairman, I see the gentlewoman from Florida (Mrs. Meek) is rising to her feet here, and there may be some other Members who were not aware until just a few moments ago that this bill would be on the floor and moving as expeditiously as it has today.                              {time}  1245  So I just wanted to reemphasize that point and give our Members an opportunity to come to the floor. We have attempted to call their offices and so forth.            Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mrs. Meek of Florida
