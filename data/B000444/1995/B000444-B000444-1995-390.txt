 President, let me say I know he has decided not to run again, and this will probably hurt his reputation, but it is a pleasure to work with the Senator from Colorado. He is always reasonable. I thank him very much.  As Senator Eastland once said to me, ``I will come and campaign for you or against you, whichever will help the most.'' Maybe if I said something negative it would help more but I really mean it. I thank him for his cooperation. This is the second time he has moved this legislation along. I truly appreciate it.  I want to correct something I said earlier. I referred to the posse comitatus amendment as the Nunn-Biden amendment. That is not accurate. This is not a minor point. It is the Nunn-Thurmond-Biden amendment. Senator Thurmond has been a leader in this issue and I did not mean in any way to leave him out. It is the Nunn-Thurmond-Biden amendment. I yield the floor.
