Can I bring an example up that I ran into recently in the State of Florida down around Gainsville?  There was a sighting of a puma, or a mountain lion or a puma, whatever you like to call it, by farmers, and they made up their mind they were going to protect this puma if, in fact, it was. The Fish and Wildlife from the Federal Government said there is no such thing in Florida and this area. Well, they found tracks, they being the farmers, saying, all right, we know it is here. They took costs of the tracks. They named him Toby, by the way. They cast the track, took it to the Fish and Game Department, our Government in action, and they had to say, lo and behold, there is a puma. So they set out, and they finally zapped him with a tranquilizing gun, and then did a DNA on the puma and decided the puma was a western puma from New Mexico. Now how he got--unless they are doing the Amtrak or a 747 plane.
