We have shared many a planeride back and forth here to Washington, D.C., but we disagree on this issue.  In May, the Department of the Interior issued a finding of no significant impact with respect to these operations. This followed a review of 23 oil and gas platforms currently operating off the shore of California. The review drew upon the best available science and reaffirms these operations are operating as safely as they should.  The amendment is nothing more than another attempt to restrict offshore development for oil and gas. I oppose the amendment and encourage my colleagues to vote ``no.''  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
