 President, I wish to congratulate a distinguished Kentuckian and exceptional physician who brings great honor to the Bluegrass State. Dr. Boyd R. Buser, doctor of osteopathic medicine, is the vice president for health affairs and dean for the University of Pikeville's Kentucky College of Osteopathic Medicine, or UP-KYCOM. He is also the president-elect for the American Osteopathic Association, AOA, and will be installed as that organization's president next month at its next annual meeting in Chicago.  Dr. Buser earned his osteopathic medical degree in 1981 and has served as a physician for 35 years. Originally from Iowa, he completed an osteopathic internship in Rhode Island before proudly calling Kentucky his home. He is board certified in family practice, as well as osteopathic manipulative medicine.  He has taught extensively around the world for the past 15 years and has represented the American osteopathic profession in the World Health Organization. He is an officer of the board of directors of the Osteopathic International Alliance. He has been a member of the AOA's board of trustees since 2004 and has served the AOA in a number of other capacities as well before assuming the mantle of president.  Dr. Buser has been recognized by the medical community with many awards for his achievements. In 1994, the AOA, along with the American Osteopathic Foundation, named him the osteopathic profession's ``Educator of the Year.'' The Maine Osteopathic Association presented him with the Roswell Bates Award in 1994 and the Distinguished Service Award in 1996 and 2007. He is also a current member of the Kentucky Institute of Medicine and the Kentucky Board of Medical Licensure.  A fellow of the American College of Osteopathic Family Physicians, Dr. Buser is past president of the American Academy of Osteopathy, AAO. He is also a past chair of the National Board of Osteopathic Medical Examiners, NBOME, and was a founding member of the board of directors of the Osteopathic International Alliance.  Dr. Buser was the recipient of the A.T. Still Medallion of Honor from the AAO in 2010. He also received the Riland Medal for Public Service from the New York Institute of Technology College of Osteopathic Medicine in 2013, as well as the Santucci Award for outstanding contributions to the mission of NBOME. In 2015, he received the Pioneer of Osteopathic Medicine Award from the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine.  Kentucky is very proud that Dr. Buser is the second dean from UP-KYCOM to serve as AOA's president; the first was Dr. John Strosnider, the founding dean of UP-KYCOM, in 2006. UP-KYCOM was founded in 1997, and since then, more than 1,000 physicians have graduated from that institution. Nearly 70 percent of them serve in primary care, frequently in rural areas. UP-KYCOM is supplying doctors to the regions of Kentucky and the Nation who need them the most.  I want to praise Dr. Buser for his many awards and accomplishments and thank him for bringing his talents and his expertise to Kentucky. The Bluegrass State is pleased to reap the benefits from his efforts to heal and comfort the sick. It is truly an honor for him to ascend to the presidency of the American Osteopathic Association, and we are glad to see him in that position. I know his colleagues at UP-KYCOM are equally pleased for him, and I wish him great success in his new role.                          ____________________
