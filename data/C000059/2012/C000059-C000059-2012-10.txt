Rohrabacher, and I look forward to serving with you for a long time in the future. God bless.  Elton Gallegly was brought up, and I'd like to say something about Elton. Elton and I are close friends. We've spent a lot of time together in the automobile going back and forth to theairport. I don't know what I'm going to do now that Elton is retiring. Elton is a person who is universally admired for his fighting spirit and tenacity. He is someone who will fight to the end for the things that he believes in. I've had the honor of working with Congressman Gallegly on a number of issues, including E-Verify, invasive species issues, and regional water projects. Congressman Gallegly holds the distinction as the only Member of Congress, by the way--and this is an important thing if you're a Member--who can get from the Capitol to Dulles Airport in 30 minutes or less. I think he holds the record.  From the start, Congressman Gallegly has been a leader on immigration issues, most recently as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement. He understands the nuances of our legal immigration system and the vital importance of secure borders, especially as it relates to his role as vice chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Congressman Gallegly brought a unique perspective to the Foreign Affairs Committee, having served 8 years on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and its Terrorism, Human Intelligence, Analysis and Counterintelligence Subcommittee.  In the aftermath of September 11, Congressman Gallegly chaired the Subcommittee on International Terrorism, Nonproliferation and Human Rights and held one of the first hearings on the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, a hearing that led to more than 10 provisions that were included in the final bill.  Congressman Gallegly's long and distinguished career has been supported by the love and support of his wife, Janice, and their four children and ten grandchildren. Congressman Gallegly's dedication to our national security, strong borders, and legal immigration has contributed immensely to the betterment of our Nation, and we certainly thank him for all the years of his service.  Next I want to talk about my friend, Brian Bilbray. Working alongside Congressman Gallegly on immigration issues is Congressman Bilbray, the chairman of the House Immigration Reform Caucus. Anyone who knows Congressman Bilbray knows his commitment and dedication to his constituents. He is always on the go, never misses an opportunity to meet and discuss issues important to those he represents.  Congressman Bilbray is a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, with subcommittee appointments to the Oversight and Investigations, Communications, Technology and the Internet, and Energy and Environment. He is chairman of the House Immigration Reform Caucus, where he works with Members on both sides of the aisle to enact meaningful immigration reform.  In this Congress, Congressman Bilbray was a leader on policy initiatives that would incentivize companies to return their businesses to the United States, as well as encourage the private sector to hire veterans. I personally worked with him on a number of issues, including making E-Verify mandatory.  Throughout his career, Congressman Bilbray has been supported by his wonderful wife, Karen, their five children and seven grandchildren. It's been an honor to serve with Congressman Bilbray, and I would like to extend my gratitude to his many years of dedicated service. We're great friends and will continue to be so.                              {time}  1610  Our final departing Member is someone, as all of these Members, someone I have known very closely and consider a very close personal friend and whose leadership will be sorely missed, Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack, California's only Republican woman in the United States House of Representatives. She's been a trailblazer in the House.  Congresswoman Bono Mack's selection as subcommittee chairman of Commerce, Manufacturing, and Trade for the 112th Congress was historic, making her the first Republican woman in American history to hold a gavel on the Energy and Commerce Committee, one of the oldest standing committees in the United States House of Representatives. As chairman, Congresswoman Bono Mack has become a national leader on privacy issues, an expert on technology matters, and a global champion of Internet freedom.  In addition to her impressive chairmanship, Congresswoman Bono Mack passed landmark legislation that called for country-of-origin labeling for fresh fruits and vegetables, in addition to several innovative energy-saving bills, rewarding companies for utilizing clean-burning fuel technologies, and increasing the energy efficiency of Federal buildings. The House of Representatives also overwhelmingly passed Mary Bono Mack's SPY ACT, which helps to protect Americans' personal information on the Internet.  Congresswoman Bono Mack is married to fellow Congressman Connie Mack, has two children, three stepchildren, and is now a new grandmother. All of us will certainly deeply miss Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack's humor, intellect, compassion, and expertise; and I know we'll see her in town.  On a personal note, I remember shortly after Sonny was killed a number of years ago visiting her along with Congressman Jerry Lewis. It was a very difficult time, but she stood in the breach and came in, as Dana mentioned, under very tragic circumstances but represented her beloved Coachella Valley in a wonderful way and has been a fantastic member of the California delegation. Again, we will sorely miss her service.  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to mention that among the seven departing Members, the House is losing 163 years of experience. The careers of my colleagues have had a positive impact on hundreds of thousands of constituents, Californians and Americans.  Due to schedule changes, not everyone could be here, but I'm sure as we go through the remainder of this session, they will find an opportunity to say their farewells to the House.  With that, I thank you, and I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
