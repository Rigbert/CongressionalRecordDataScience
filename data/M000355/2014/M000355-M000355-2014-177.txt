 President, let me briefly make a few observations about some of the majority leader's opening comments this morning.  As he knows full well, Senator Vitter dropped his request for an ObamaCare amendment days ago, before the weekend. I think it is important for everybody to understand, the minority in the Senate has had eight votes since July--eight votes since July--on amendments that we wished to vote on.  We have not had a fulsome energy debate in the Senate since 2007--7 years ago. What we are asking for here is four or five amendments related to the subject of energy--one of the biggest issues in our country. That is hardly obstructionism. It is laughable to suggest that it is obstructionism for the minority to be given four or five amendments on issues related to the underlying bill, particularly since we have only had eight amendment votes on amendments that we wanted to vote on since last July, and we have not had a fulsome, broad-ranging energy debate since 2007.  So I would say to my friend, the majority leader, I do not think there is anything at all unreasonable about what we are requesting. Far from obstructionism, it is about time we had a debate on energy. We are having an energy boom in this country. It is important to our constituents all across the land. Forty-five Republicans represent millions of Americans. We wish to have a chance to have our voices heard occasionally. Eight amendments for the minority since July? This is not the way the Senate ought to be run.
