 I say to the Senator from Nevada, what we are looking for now, if I am not mistaken, is what--eight or nine more Republican Senators who will decide that it is time to put an end to this charade that has gone on for so many weeks. If we can get eight or nine Republican Senators to come forward, we can finally invoke cloture, bring the President's bill that he requested to the floor, and provide theassistance for these starving refugees who are coming out of Afghanistan.  I ask the Senator from Nevada, am I correct that is what we are looking for, another eight or nine Senators to come forward on the Republican side?
