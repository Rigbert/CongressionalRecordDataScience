 We have $1 million, $2 million, $3 million, all by the year 2005, and that is where Senator Feingold's money went. We still found more for a $4 million credit by the year 2009.  This action undoes a very carefully crafted bipartisan effort by Senator Lincoln, Senator Kyl, Senator Baucus, and myself. I see this as one other effort--amendment after amendment--trying to destroy particularly the most easily crafted part of this bill, one mostly agreed to, by Senator Lincoln and Senator Kyl. I hope we can get away from these efforts to destroy this bipartisan compromise.
