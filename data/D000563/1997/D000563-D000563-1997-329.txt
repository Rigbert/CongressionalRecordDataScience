She and I served together on the House Budget Committee, and I agree with her. In 15 years, I have never seen anything like this. For some reason, the Budget Committee is on vacation when it is supposed to be on the job. The statute says get moving by April 15, give us a budget resolution. We have an appropriations process to get started in the House, to move forward on in the Senate, and it cannot get started until we figure out what our priorities in spending are going to be. That is a very difficult thing to do with the high-flying rhetoric. The Republicans ran for the House and Senate saying, ``Let us lead.'' And these steely-eyed, styptic-hearted conservatives said, ``We know how to balance a budget. Out of the way, bleeding-heart liberals. Give us a chance. We'll get rid of all this red ink. We'll get you on the straight and narrow.''  Where is the budget? I don't see it. What do we have to do? As the Senator suggested earlier this morning, do we have to send out dogs to sniff out this budget? Where is it? Where on the floor? Is it in one of the committee meeting rooms on Capitol Hill? In one of the think tanks? Does the Heritage Foundation have a budget they want to send up here for us to take up? What are we waiting for? The American people met their obligation today. Some of them are sitting down right now saying, ``Oh, my goodness, I have to finish this 1040 form. I have a legal responsibility to do it. My family is going to meet its legal responsibility.'' When is this Congress going to meet its legal responsibility to find and prepare a budget resolution which keeps up with the rhetoric which we have heard now time and again in this Chamber and across the Nation?  I thank the Senator for her leadership. I think the President has at least given us a starting document. Now, to my friends in the majority, on the Republican side, it is certainly your turn.
