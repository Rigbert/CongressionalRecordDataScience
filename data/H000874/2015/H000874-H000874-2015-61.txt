Speaker, that is a nice theory, nice rhetoric. We don't have an agreement on a number of things the gentleman says. What we do have agreement on, I presume, is that the gentleman, the majority leader from California, wants to see a solvent nation, a nation that pays its bills, a nation that does not create a lack of confidence in our own country and around the world, a nation that does not take hostage either its government by shutting it down or take hostage its creditworthiness by bringing us to the brink, time after time after time, on whether or not we are going to do something that Mr. Hensarling and Mr. Ryan and Mr. Boehner--I didn't quote him, but I have got a quote here from Mr. Boehner--said that if we don't do, it will have extraordinarily adverse effects on America and on every American. And the answer that I heard, Mr. Speaker, is an answer that, if you don't do something we want you to do, we may not extend the debt limit.  Now, Mr. Speaker, I would ask the majority leader, is that his position?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I hear a lot of things on the floor, but I have never heard the things that you just said about me on this floor spoken.
