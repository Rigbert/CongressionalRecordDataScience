 I would again reiterate that he and I and others who will speak, while we are saying that we need to make sure that the military component of our country is strong and fully funded, we are saying that the majority of the surplus ought to pay down that debt, because then our entire country and our economy will be strong, and we will have the resources to keep not only a strong defense, but a strong educational system as well, and to save and ensure the security of Social Security and Medicare, so that we can accomplish those objectives which will benefit all of our Nation and the international community as well.  Madam Speaker, at this time I would now like to yield to my good friend, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Taylor), and the ranking member, who also would be a chairman of a very important subcommittee of the Committee on Armed Services. I thank the gentleman for joining us.
