 President, reserving the right to object, it has never been our desire to delay considerationof the House-passed stimulus package. The other side has made it clear they will have some package of changes. Those changes were discussed last week and, evidently, there was a decision to put a different package together. As I mentioned earlier this morning, we got that package last night. It was, apparently, a work in progress.  What I am going to do is ask the leader to modify his request. I know the senior Senator from Illinois said earlier today--or suggested that maybe people on this side don't support seniors or disabled veterans. So I will offer a request of the majority leader to modify his request so we do not have further delay.  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the majority leader's unanimous consent request be modified so that we proceed to the bill today--not tomorrow or Thursday but today--and that we have a cloture vote today on the amendment we received last night--the one to which the leader's request refers; further, if cloture is not invoked, that we proceed immediately to a vote on the Republican amendment that we will file at the desk; finally, that the Senate then proceed to a vote on passage of the House bill, as amended, if amended.
