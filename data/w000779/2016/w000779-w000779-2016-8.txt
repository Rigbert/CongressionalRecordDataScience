President, reserving the right to object, I would like to have a colloquy with my colleague.  It is my understanding that Senator Carper was interested in 5 minutes, Senator Merkley was interested in 5 minutes, I was interested in 5 minutes, and I think Senator Enzi was interested in 5 minutes.  Could I ask my colleague if he would amend his UC so that each of those four Senators would have 5 minutes? I think that would take us to about 3:10, as opposed to 3 o'clock.
