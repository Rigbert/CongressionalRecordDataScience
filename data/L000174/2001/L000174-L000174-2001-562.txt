President, I am very fortunate to be one of only one hundred individuals chosen to represent my fellow Americans here in the Senate. As a result of this work, I have the opportunity to meet many, many people. Occasionally I have come to know people who are so giving of themselves, so devoted to their life's work, that they truly serve as an inspiration. I would like to take a few moments to recognize one such individual, Harold Howrigan of Fairfield, VT.  Harold has been a dairy farmer in Vermont his entire life and has been a Director of the St. Albans Cooperative Creamery for over 20 years, as well as the long-time President of the co-op. He has been actively involved with dairy promotion on State, national, and international levels, and has worked with practically every dairy farm organization that I know, including Dairy Management Inc., the National Milk Producers Federation, the U.S. Dairy Export Council, the National Dairy Board, the Vermont Farm Bureau, and the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission.  Harold and his wife, Anne--a former school teacher, who is still a very active tutor, mentor and volunteer in the cause of education have also devoted themselves to educating future generations about agriculture, starting with their five children--Harold, Lawrence, Michael, Bridget and Ellen--and their 12 grandchildren. They are very special friends of my wife Marcelle, my children and me.  Most recently, Harold has been honored as the recipient of what some call the ``Nobel Prize'' of the dairy industry, the Richard E. Lyng award from the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board. This award recognizes an individual for their ``distinguished service to dairy promotion and research.'' I can't think of another individual more deserving of this honor than Harold Howrigan.  In a recent interview Harold said ``family farmers are the best, hardest working people in the world . . . it's a business and a way of living that is second to none in this country.'' I couldn't agree more and I thank Harold for the tremendous work he has done for the dairy industry in Vermont and across America, as well as the expert and unselfish counsel on agriculture he has provided to me and my staff over many years.  I ask that an article about Harold be printed in the Record.  The article follows:          [From the St. Albans (VT) Messenger, Feb. 26, 2001]                  To Harold Howrigan: Congratulations                           (By Emerson Lynn)       Occasionally, something happens that is so right that when      you learn about it, you pound the table and say, yes, that's      what should have happened.       That's our response to the news that Harold Howrigan was      the recipient of the Richard E. Lyng Award for      ``distinguished service to dairy promotion and research.''      The award, which is only given out periodically, is the      industry's equivalent to the Nobel Prize.       There is not a person in the industry, anywhere, who      deserves the award more. That there may not be a kinder, more      professional person alive is an aside, what made the award so      appropriate is the incredible level of dedication he has made      toward his profession, or, as he would say, his way of life.       His name and the St. Albans Cooperative Creamery are      synonymous. He's its president     and has sat on its board for two decades. If there is an      issue that involves the industry he is there, as he has been      for all rounds with the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.      He knows the politics of Washington and Montpelier as well as      any insider and he is as respected there as he is here.       But what shines through all this is the understanding that      if the awards were not there his commitment would be no less.      He's a fortunate man; he believes in what he does and would      choose no other way of life. To Harold Howrigan, there is no      higher calling than producing food for a hungry world and, in      the process, keeping alive and vibrant a livelihood that's as      healthy as the milk he produces.       He knows better than most the value of the industry's $350      million that sustains our communities. And he understands the      importance of pushing the industry's efforts far past      Franklin County's borders.       But what he understands best is the meaning of the words he      once heard from his school's nun: ``Much has been given to      you, and much will be expected from you.''       It can be safely said that he has met her      expectations.                          ____________________
