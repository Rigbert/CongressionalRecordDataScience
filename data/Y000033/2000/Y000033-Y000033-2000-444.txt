Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I am one who supports the maintenance. I will say this, that if the appropriators had done their job, the maintenance would have occurred and should have occurred.  I am a little bit concerned and I would like to ask those that oppose this bill, where would the maintenance money be for this program if we did not have CARA? Where would it be? It would not happen. There would be no maintenance. It would be the same minimal type maintenance that has existed the last 6 years, and before that in the other administration.  And if we go back and check the units that were created, we will find out a large percent of those units were created without authorization by this Congress, but through the appropriating committee.                              {time}  2330  Just check the record.  So I ask a lot of my colleagues, where would they be when they offer these amendments. If we did not have CARA, would they have any more maintenance? I say, no, they would have the same old thing. Just keep that in mind.  So I think this amendment is unnecessary. We do recognize the need in this bill. I respectfully reject the amendment. Keep this package together. Let us go forward and accomplish what we set out to do: maintain, take care of our species, take care of our urban parks, take care of our easements, take care of destroyed land, and, yes, maybe buy some land. But nowhere in this bill says there shall be land bought. Nowhere.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Pease). All time has expired.  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Hastings).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.
