President, again, I thank the majority leader.  I have heard some talk tonight from some saying they wished there would be votes.  I finally have given up handing long lists of amendments we are prepared to vote on to the Republican side, both Republican and Democratic amendments. Each time, that was rejected. Most of them were amendments with no controversy, Republican and Democratic alike, and would have been accepted.  I think back to the debate we had in the Senate Judiciary Committee where we actually voted on amendments. We brought up 140 or so. All but two or three passed with bipartisan votes. About 40 Republican amendments passed on bipartisan votes. Yet when it came onto the floor of the Senate, my friends on the other side, time and time again, objected to bringing up amendments that would pass unanimously, both Republican and Democratic.  I suppose in one case we have some who don't want any immigration bill, and others are probably waiting for a cloture vote.  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask the time be equally divided.
