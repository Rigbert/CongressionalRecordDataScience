President, I am pleased to join Senator Sarbanes in introducing the Financial Information Privacy Act of 1999. Senator Sarbanes, along with Senators Dodd and Bryan, have been leaders on the Senate Banking Committee in protecting the privacy of personal financial information.  Mr. President, the right to privacy is a personal and fundamental right protected by the Constitution of the United States. But the American people are growing more and more concerned over encroachments on their personal privacy.  I seems that everywhere we turn, new technologies, new communications media, and new business services created with the best of intentions and highest of expectations also pose a threat to our ability to keep our lives to ourselves, to live, work and think without having giant corporations looking over our shoulders.  This incremental encroachment on our privacy has happened through the lack of safeguards on personal, financial and medical information about each of us that can be stolen, sold or mishandled and find its way into the wrong hands with the push of a button.  Our right of privacy has become one of the most vulnerable rights in the information age. The digitalization of information and the explosion in the growth of computing and electronic networking offer tremendous potential benefits to the way Americans live, work, conduct commerce, and interact with their government. But the new technology also presents new threats to our individual privacy and security, in particular, our ability to control the terms under which our personal information is acquired, disclosed, and used.  In the financial services industry, for example, conglomerates are offering a wide variety of services, each of which requires a customer to provide financial, medical or other personal information. And nothing in the law prevents subsidiaries within the conglomerate from sharing this information for uses other than the use the customer thought he or she was providing it for. In fact, under current Federal law, a financial institution can sell, share, or publish savings account balances, certificates of deposit maturity dates and balances, stock and mutual fund purchases and sales, life insurance payouts and health insurance claims.  Our legislation would protect the privacy of this financial information by directing the Federal Reserve Board, Office of Thrift Supervision, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to jointly promulgate rules requiring financial institutions they regulate to: (1) inform their customers what information is to be disclosed, and when, to whom and for what purposes the information is to be disclosed; (2) allow customers to review the information for accuracy; and (3) for new customers, obtain the customers' consent to disclosure, and for existing customers, give the customers a reasonable opportunity to object to disclosure. These financial institutions could use confidential customer information from other entities only if the entities had given their customers similar privacy protections.  I hope the Financial Information Privacy Act is just the beginning of this new Congress' efforts to address the privacy issues raised by ultra competitive marketplaces in the information age.  For the past three Congresses, I have introduced comprehensive medical privacy legislation. I plan to soon introduce the Medical Information Privacy and Security Act to establish the first comprehensive federal medical privacy law. It would close the existing gaps in federal privacy laws to ensure the protection of personally identifiable health information. Medical records contain the most intimate, sensitive information about a person and must be safeguarded.  This Congress will also need to consider how our privacy safeguards for personal, financial and medical information measure up to the tough privacy standards established by the European Union Data Protection Directive, which took effect on October 25, 1998. That could be a big problem for American businesses, since the new rules require EU member countries to prohibit the transmission of personal data to or through any non-EU country that fails to provide adequate data protection as defined under European law.  European officials have said repeatedly over the past year that the patchwork of privacy laws in the United States may not meet their standards. Our law is less protective than EU standards in a variety of respects on a range of issues, including requirements to obtain data fairly and lawfully; limitations on the collection of sensitive data; limitations on the purpose of data collection; bans on the collection and storage of unnecessary personal information; requirements regarding data accuracy; limitations regarding duration of storage; and centralized supervision of privacy protections and practices.  The problem is not that Europe protects privacy too much. The problem isour own failure to keep U.S. privacy laws up to date. The EU Directive is an example of the kind of privacy protection that American consumers need and do not have. It has encouraged European companies to develop good privacy techniques. It has produced policies, including policies on cryptography, that are consistent with the interests of both consumers and businesses.  The Financial Information Privacy Act updates U.S. privacy laws in the evolving financial services industry. It calls for fundamental protections of the personal, confidential financial information of all American citizens. I urge my colleagues to support it.                                 ______                                       By
