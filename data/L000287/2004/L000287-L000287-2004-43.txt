I continue to yield to the gentleman from Texas.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's yielding to me.  As the gentleman knows, he was here last night, the President mentioned last night that the third-quarter economic growth in 2003 was the strongest in 20 years and that housing starts and home ownership rates are up and at an all-time high; that financial markets are growing, after a long contraction; that interest rates are low; that factory orders are up; that unemployment is on the decline. Unemployment benefit claims have decreased actually every month since September, and the unemployment rate today is 5.7 percent, which is almost a full percentage point lower than the rate that we had in 1994 when a Democrat Congress and a Democrat President discontinued an expanded unemployment compensation program.  So with a growing economy and a recent precedent for managing these scenarios, it is clear to the majority that the best employment program is to keep growing jobs and paychecks instead of extending and expanding Federal programs.
