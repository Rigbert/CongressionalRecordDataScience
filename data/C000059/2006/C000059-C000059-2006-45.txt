Speaker, I rise today to recognize and honor Ali Sahabi for his dedication and commitment to improving the community of Corona, California. The Corona Chamber of Commerce honored Ali by presenting him with its 2005 ``Citizen of the Year'' award on January 14, 2006.  Ali is currently the President of SE Corporation, a privately held, California-based land planning, entitlement, and development firm. For nearly 18 years, Ali Sahabi has been an active member of our community, devoting a tremendous amount of time and effort to causes greater than his own.  After spending much of his youth in a middle class family in the country of Iran, Ali was sent to Michigan to live with an uncle and aunt at the age of thirteen. After graduating high school, Ali and his brother drove to California, where they lived in a small apartment with their grandmother and another uncle.  In California, the two brothers worked at a variety of odd jobs and Ali, always the entrepreneur, began trying his hand at different kinds of small business opportunities including sales. He became a print broker and opened his own printing business in downtown Los Angeles. Ali finished his bachelor's degree in business management at Pepperdine University, which he had been working on in the evening, and sold the print shop. Later, Ali obtained his Master of Real Estate Development degree from the School of Urban Planning and Development at the University of Southern California.  Throughout his career, Ali has undertaken a number of development projects across Southern California including industrial, multi-family residential and commercial retail projects. He has been instrumental in implementing innovative planning solutions and environmentally sensitive development plans for the Dos Lagos mixed use development in southwest Riverside County, making it a true model for sustainable development.  Ali is an active and leading proponent of local and regional collaboration and the stewardship of natural resources, establishing and endowing the Blakeley Center for Suburban Sustainable Development at UC Riverside. Through his vision and tireless efforts the Center has contributed to forming alliances across jurisdictional lines bringing individuals, local governments and communities together to address major issues that represent significant challenges for entire regions and communities.  Locally, Ali somehow finds time to play a significant role in a number of non-profit and community-based organizations. He serves notably on the Board of Directors of the Children's Spine Foundation and the Corona Regional Medical Center Foundation, Governor's Mentoring Program, and is active with the American Cancer Society, YMCA, At Risk Children's Angels, Boy Scouts, and ICUC among others.  I want to express my appreciation for Ali's tireless efforts on behalf of our entire community and congratulate him on receiving this award.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Page E12]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                         TRIBUTE TO ALI SAHABI                                 ______                                                             HON.
