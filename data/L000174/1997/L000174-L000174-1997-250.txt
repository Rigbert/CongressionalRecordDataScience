President, I am delighted that the majority leader has decided to take up the nomination of Jeffrey T. Miller to be a U.S. district court judge for the southern district of California. Judge Miller is a well-qualified nominee.  The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported his nomination to the Senate more than 4 weeks ago. The southern district of California desperately needs Judge Miller to help manage its growing backlog of cases.  We first received Judge Jeffrey Miller's nomination in July 1996. He was not accorded a hearing last Congress and the President renominated him on the first day of this Congress for the same vacancy on the district court for the southern district of California, which vacancy has existed since December 1994. This is one of the judicial emergency vacancies that we should have filled last year. This vacancy has persisted for 2\1/2\ years. He has the support of both Senators from California. He had a confirmation hearing on March 18 and his nomination was considered and reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee on April 17.  With this confirmation, the Senate has confirmed four Federal judges this year--the same number as the number of amendments to the Constitution that have been considered and defeated by the House of Representatives and the Senate. At this rate, we are falling farther and farther behind and more and more vacancies are continuing to mount over longer and longer times to the detriment of more Americans and the national cause of prompt justice. We must do better.
