They say it is a great success. In reality, there have been no species protected. They claim the eagle. The eagle was very viable in my State. The eagle's problem was DDT. It was not the Endangered Species Act. Once we stopped using DDT, we have eagles now in the majority of the United States today, and we have an abundance of them in Alaska, so it was not the act; but they keep waving it because it was the American bird. They keep saying, ``This is what we did with this act.''
