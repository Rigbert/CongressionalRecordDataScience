Speaker, I offer a motion to instruct.  The Clerk read as follows:       Ms. Kaptur moves that the managers on the part of the House      at the conference on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses      on the bill, H.R. 1469, be instructed to insist on the House      position with respect to funding for the Special Supplemental      Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC),      providing a funding level of $76,000,000, to ensure no      reduction in the number of participants being served by this      program.
