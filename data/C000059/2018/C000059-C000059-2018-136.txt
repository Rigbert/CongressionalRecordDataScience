Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Orville ``Dean'' McWhorter, who passed away in his home in Norco, California, on Tuesday, July 24, 2018. Dean, a devoted family man, served his nation in the Vietnam War. He will be deeply missed.  Dean graduated from La Serna High School in Whittier, California, in 1969. Not long after graduating high school, Dean joined the Army and was a member of the 101st Airborne Division during the war in Vietnam. After he returned home from Vietnam, Dean began working as an electrical designer at Fluor Corporation and other engineering firms. After 37 years, Dean ultimately finished his career with MARMAC Engineering. After retiring at age 62, Dean and his wife Robin spent time looking for the perfect house and ultimately settled in Norco to be near his children and grandchildren, who meant the world to him.  Dean enjoyed the great outdoors, fishing, guns, hunting, horseback riding, ping-pong, playing pool and camping. He was a devoted Christian, a patriot, and a big sports enthusiast. He loved animals, music, classic cars and motorcycles, a good joke, a great meal, and holiday family get-togethers. Dean leaves behind his loving wife Robin; his daughters Jenny and Brandi; their husbands and children; Dean's oldest brother Lee; Lee's wife Janet; Lee's two daughters Leanne and Kristi; their spouses and children; and Dean's loving mother Delona Louise.  I extend my heartfelt condolences to the McWhorter family, his friends, and everyone fortunate enough to know Dean. Although Dean may be gone, the many contributions he made to his country, community and family will have a lasting impact.                          ____________________
