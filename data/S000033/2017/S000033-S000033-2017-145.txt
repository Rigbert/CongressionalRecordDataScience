 President, I thank my friend from Delaware for yielding. When we talk about the health care crisis in this country, it is not just health care, it is also the outrageously high cost of prescription drugs. I know in my State of Vermont, and in fact throughout this country, millions of people today are unable to afford the medicine they need.  In fact, almost one out of five Americans who go to the doctor and get a prescription are unable to afford to buy the medicine their doctors prescribe. Frankly, that is insane because what happens if you don't take the medicine your doctor prescribed, often you are going to get sicker. Sometimes you may die. Sometimes you may end up in the emergency room. Sometimes you may end up in the hospital. It is literally beyond comprehension that almost one out of five Americans today are unable to afford the medicine they need.  Meanwhile, while so many of our people cannot afford the medicine they need, the top five drug companies last year made $50 billion in profit--$50 billion in profit. The top 10 CEOs in the pharmaceutical industry earned over $300 million.  So what we have is a scenario in which the American people pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. Millions cannot afford the medicine they desperately need, but at the same time the drug companies make out like bandits, and their CEOs earn exorbitant compensation packages.  I happen to live 50 miles away from the Canadian border. A number of years ago, I took a busload of Vermonters across the Canadian border, not just to do some sightseeing in Montreal, which is a beautiful city, but to go there to purchase the same exact medicine that Vermonters, many of whom were dealing with breast cancer, were buying but yet buying it in Montreal, Canada, for a fraction of the price they were paying in the United States.  In fact, on that particular trip, many of the women who were dealing with breast cancer purchased the medicine they needed for one-tenth of the price they were paying in Vermont--one-tenth of the price. Let me take a moment today to review the costs of some of the exact same drugs sold in the United States compared to their costs in Canada.  Here in the United States, EpiPen, as we all know, costs more than $600 a set. That price has skyrocketed in recent years. In Canada, the same exact set costs $290, less than half of what we pay in the United States.  Crestor, a popular drug to treat high cholesterol levels, is $730 here but $160 across the border. We are not talking about generics. We are not talking about another drug. We are talking about the same exact same drug manufactured by the exact same company.  I may be mispronouncing it, but I think it is Abilify, a drug for depression, is more than $2,600 for a 90-day supply here in the United States but only $436 in Canada.  I can go on and on and on. By the way, let's be clear--  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chart of drug prices around the world which will show that prices in the United States are not only almost always higher than in Canada but higher than in the UK, Spain, and the Netherlands as well.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    USA--THE HIGHEST DRUG PRICES IN THE WORLD----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                      CANADA           U.K.            SPAIN        NETHERLANDS       U.S.A.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ENBREL..........................          $1,646          $1,117          $1,386          $1,509          $3,000CELEBREX........................              51             112             164             112             330COPAXONE........................           1,400             862           1,191           1,190           3,900CYMBALTA........................             110              46              71              52             240GLEEVEC.........................           1,141           2,697           3,348           3,321           8,500HUMIRA..........................           1,950           1,102           1,498           1,498           3,048NEXIUM..........................              30              42              58              23             305----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
