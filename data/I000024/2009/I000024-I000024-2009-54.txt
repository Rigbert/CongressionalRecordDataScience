President, first of all, let me thank the chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee--a position I held at one time, but I am the ranking member for the minority. This is a huge issue. This is one we cannot let go unattended. Tonight at midnight this thing expires. So we have to do it. Let me compliment Senator Boxer in being willing to go to some extremes that, quite frankly, I did not know she would be able to agree to.  What is at stake right now is about $500 million of projects that will have to be canceled. If you cancel these projects--these contracts have already been let--we are talking about lawsuits. We are talking about around 17,000 jobs being lost unless we are able to fix this recision thing and to get it offset. Well, that is what is going to happen.  We are drafting an amendment right now. I know the hour is late. I know we are going to come back for a vote at 6:30. But I think this absolutely has to be done, and I think it will be done. I am looking right now for any of the Republicans who might be objecting to this so I can talk to them. Quite frankly, I do not think there will be objection on our side.  The highway money at risk would put people to work, unlike much of the so-called stimulus. So I think we have an opportunity now to do this, and it is only going to be done because of the cooperation between the chairman of this committee and myself as ranking member.  So let's do everything we can. I say to the Senator, I think you have come up with a solution. We have, together, come up with a solution. Let's make it happen.
