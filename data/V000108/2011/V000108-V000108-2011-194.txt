Speaker, it is with great sincerity and admiration that I offer congratulations to several of Hammond's most noteworthy athletes, as well as to others who have contributed to the legacy of Hammond's athletic programs. On Tuesday, March 8, 2011, the Hammond Sports Hall of Fame honored eight new inductees at its annual Induction Banquet, which was held at the Hammond Civic Center in Hammond, Indiana. The Hammond Sports Hall of Fame was established in 1987 to recognize and honor individuals for their significant contributions to Hammond's distinguished sports legacy. These eight individuals are an admirable group, composed of former athletes, coaches, and elected officials who have excelled in their athletic pursuits or supported Hammond sports and athletics in an extraordinary manner.  At this year's induction ceremony, the Hammond Sports Hall of Fame recognized and honored the 2011 inductees. The individuals who have so deservingly earned this high honor are: Thomas McDermott, Sr., Marty Jakubowski, Frank Carroll, Tom Burns, Jeff Yelton, Carla Eskridge Rogers, David M. Wilhelm, and Bill Atkins.  Hammond is very fortunate to have produced such a rich tradition of excellence among its athletes, coaches, and supporters. In unique ways, the Class of 2011 inductees have made extraordinary contributions and have added to Hammond's rich sports heritage.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these outstanding individuals. Along with the current members of the Hammond Sports Hall of Fame, these new inductees have made a significant contribution to the continued excellence of Hammond athletics, and I am very proud to represent them in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
