 President, in just a few minutes, the Senate will take another important step toward passing sweeping defense legislation that will support our troops and our national security. It will help drive defense innovation and research. It will authorize pay raises for our servicemembers and modernize retirement benefits. It will help prepare our country to deal with the threats of today and the challenges of tomorrow, and it will help prepare the force that the next Commander in Chief will lead to do so as well.  It is a responsible and important bill. Chairman McCain and Ranking Member Reed of Rhode Island have worked relentlessly to manage this bill, and I urge all my colleagues to join me in voting for cloture this morning.                          ____________________
