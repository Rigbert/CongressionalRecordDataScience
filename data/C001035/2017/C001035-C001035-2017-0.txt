President, I rise to join my colleague from Rhode Island, Senator Reed, in introducing the Museum and Library Services Act of 2017. This bill would reauthorize the core programs administered by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), which support libraries and museums in Maine and across the country. This bill includes important updates to improve the abilities of libraries and museums to meet the needs of local communities.  The Museum and Library Services Act represents a commitment to supporting libraries and museums that enrich our communities. Libraries provide not only a wonderful learning tool, full of books, public documents, and internet access, but also are community hubs where citizens can meet to share and explore ideas. Likewise, great museums do more than accumulate artifacts--they tell stories. The programs reauthorized in this bill would help libraries and museums across Maine and the United States better serve the public by helping with research, planning, and programming.  The Museum and Library Services Act would make important improvements to IMLS's ability to collaborate with states and communities. It would reauthorize the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA), the only federal program that helps public libraries meet their community's needs, enhance their services through technology, reach underserved and rural populations, and recruit new professionals to the library field. Ensuring that federal resources reach our rural communities is particularly important to me, and I am pleased that this bill highlights support for rural and tribal areas.  Every state in our country receives its share of the LSTA, which leverages the federal investment with a state and local funding match. In Maine, the LSTA has helped libraries lend books and other materials by mail to reach residents in communities that do not have libraries nearby or who are homebound. It has helped Maine libraries serve individuals with disabilities through access to book recordings and special media players, including braille and audio downloads. It has helped my state improve online access to magazines, newspapers, and reference books, and spurred innovative collaborations with schools statewide.  The bill would also reauthorize the Museum Services Act, providing support for museums to collaborate with schools, libraries, and colleges and universities, and to encourage new technologies to extend the reach of programs and museum collections. As with the LSTA, museums are incentivized to leverage other sources of support to match the federal investment.  This reauthorization underscores the role that libraries and museums play in community revitalization. Libraries are important information centers for workforce development, health information, and digital and financial literacy. Museums are also vital community partners that work to connect our communities to the cultural, historical, natural, and scientific pieces of our heritage.  From providing job search resources and free internet access to exposing children and families to enriching literary and educational experiences, libraries and museums serve vital roles in our communities. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
