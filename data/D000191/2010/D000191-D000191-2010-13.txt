  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the Republicans have a plan for America; not their so-called pledge, just a garbled rehash of the failed policies of the Bush era that put us in this mess.  The real plan, step one, try to block every Democratic initiative, even those that could aid our economic recovery, put people back to work. They would harm people for their own political ends. And if something passes, lie about it. Remember death panels?  Now, step two, aided and abetted by a right-wing activist Supreme Court overturning 100 years of precedent. New independent groups, independent groups every day, one a day, are filing with the Federal Elections Commission. They can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money anonymously, no disclosure necessary to try to buy the election for their Republican lap dog buddies.  Well, I have got news for you over on that side of the aisle: America is not for sale.                          ____________________
