Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.  I would just say, you know, there used to be an old expression. They asked Jesse James, ``Why do you rob banks.'' He said, ``That is where the money is.''  So I think about the situation we face in our country today. I am not willing to take the money out of this budget, which I consider critical to America's security at home and abroad, and meanwhile, in other fora, to give trillions of dollars to the top 1 percent in this country who aren't really interested in what we are doing here much, don't appreciate it sometimes. I am not willing to leave off the hook the Wall Street bankers that took us into the 2008 recession, not a single one went to jail.  It is interesting where the gentlewoman is looking for money. One of the reasons I chose to be on this subcommittee is I am sick of going to war for energy. Too many people from my region have died.  I think part of America's solution is becoming energy independent and being able to conduct war where we have to. This bill allows us to do that for the sake of the Republic.  I think the gentlewoman has a good intention to try to balance the budget. I think she is looking at the wrong end of the telescope.
