Speaker, from time to time, for whatever reasons, people want to vote and, either because they don't get down the aisle or they don't request a vote, they do not get the opportunity to vote on issues that they think are important to them.  From time to time, frankly, on our side we have felt that we have been shut out when the majority was in the hands of the Republicans. We wouldwant fairness. In return, we ought to extend fairness.  There are obviously many, many Members who wanted to vote on the continuing resolution which was the subject of one of the votes, but from our point of view--and having reviewed the tapes--that did not happen. That happens.  But because we want to assure Members on both sides of the aisle that their opinion can be expressed as they would wish it to be expressed--and I think Mr. Scalise will say that. Mr. Butterfield, former judge, who is one of our fairest and best Members, I would hope we would acknowledge that he handled the matter fairly and consistent with the rules.  Given that, it will be my intention to now ask for unanimous consent to provide for the opportunity, when we return on Wednesday, so that we have all Members here--we are going to return on Tuesday. And I would say that we will return before that. We may return tomorrow if we can open up government, if we have an agreement on that. But we will return as soon as that option is available to us.  But we will return, if that does not happen, on the evening of Tuesday at 6:30, and we will then, as a result of the unanimous consent request I am about to make, vote--revote--on the issue at hand on Wednesday at the first of business.                          ____________________
