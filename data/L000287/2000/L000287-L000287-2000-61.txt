Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, October 31, 2000, the New York Knicks of the National Basketball Association will commemorate 50 years of integration in the NBA. The Knick's special guest in Madison Square Garden on this historical evening will be Mr. Earl Lloyd. Mr. Lloyd was the first African American player to participate in an NBA game. Drafted by the Washington Capitols, Mr. Lloyd made his NBA debut against the Rochester Royals on October 31, 1950. There were two other players making their debuts the following day. Chuck Copper was the first choice of Red Auerbach and the Boston Celtics. Nat ``Sweetwater'' Clifton's contract was bought by the New York Knicks from the Harlem Globe Trotters. Earl Lloyd grew up on the other side of the 14th Street Bridge in the shadows of the White House in Alexandria, Virginia. He was an all around athlete at Parker Gray High School. He excelled in football, basketball and baseball. It was on the Banneker and Park View playgrounds in Washington, D.C. that he developed his game. Mr. Lloyd and his friend the legendary running back of Parker Gray and West Virginia State Bubba Ellis would make regular walks across the 14th Street bridge into the Nation's Capital for pickup basketball, D.C. playground style--no holds barred!  Mr. Lloyd would graduate from high school with honors and as one of the school's greatest athletes. He would matriculate to West Virginia State on a basketball scholarship. In college he was named to the All-American team and here he would leave a lasting impression on his opponents. Hall of Fame  In 1950 Mr. Lloyd was also drafted by another team the United States Army! On Halloween night after serving his military time Mr. Lloyd returned to make professional basketball history. The Washington Capitols would play the Rochester Royals. In the stands that night would be Mr. Lloyd's proud mother. Mrs. Lloyd was sitting directly in front of two fans who acknowledged that Mr. Lloyd was the firstblack, but could the Nigger play? Without missing a beat Mrs. Lloyd turned and looked the two fans directly in their eyes and said ``Take my word for it, the Nigger can play.''  NBA legendary coach Arnold ``Red'' Auerbach of the Boston Celtics says, ``Earl blocked shots and played defense like there was no tomorrow.'' Red should know. Earl Lloyd led the Syracuse Nationals team that eliminated the Boston Celtics from the 1955 playoffs. The Nationals would go on to capture their one and only NBA Championship. 1955 was a good year. Mr. Lloyd and teammate Jim Tucker would become the first African Americans to play on an NBA Championship team.  A 1994 Sports Illustrated Magazine article read, ``In the NBA Mr. Lloyd was  In May 1993 he was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame in Portsmouth, Virginia. In 1998 twenty-eight years after being selected to the 25th Anniversary All-Time Great CIAA Team Mr. Lloyd was inducted into the CIAA Hall of Fame.  Earl Lloyd has always made it clear where the credit belongs for his NBA success story. He says, ``If it had not been for Red Auerbach and the Boston Celtics, we may still be trying to get into the NBA. The Celtics were the first to draft a Black player, the first to put five Black players on the floor at the same time, the first to hire a Black coach and the first to hire a Black General Manager.'' The Boston Celtics are truly equal opportunity employers in professional sports.  Halloween night in the NBA would be great if the N.Y. Knicks were hosting the rest of the league's players. They all could learn a little history and then be treated and introduced to a man who does not have a problem with being called a role model. Mr. Lloyd made it all possible for today's NBA black players and thousands of others like them. Earl Lloyd was Number One in 1950 and he is still Number One in the New Millennium 2000.                          ____________________
