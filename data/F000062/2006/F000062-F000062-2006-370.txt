 But we will talk about that another day.  The Smiths' maternal grandfather, Jesse Udall, was the chief justice of the Arizona Supreme Court. So Milan Smith stands poised to follow family precedent in serving on one of our Nation's highest courts.  I congratulate him on this nomination. I urge all of my colleagues to votefor him. I say to his younger brother, who is sitting here in the Chamber, that it is a wonderful day for both Senator Boxer and for me to be able to see you so happy. I know what it means to you and how great it is to have such a fine legal mind in your family. We offer you our best congratulations, as well.  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.
