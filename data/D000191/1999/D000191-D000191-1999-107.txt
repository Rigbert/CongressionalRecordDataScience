Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  The question before the House is how do we safeguard Social Security, increase military spending, cut taxes forthe wealthy, and balance the budget without devastating cuts in everything else that is important to many Americans, from veterans' programs to education to law enforcement? The answer is we do not, and we cannot honestly.  On the Republican side they have revived with gusto the magic asterisks of the Reagan years, which are so-called undistributed cuts, meaning we do not know what to do, we are punting, and we will figure it out later, but there will probably be a whole bunch more cuts or we will not deliver on these promises. One or the other has got to give.  Unfortunately, the other budget alternatives before us also come up short in those areas. I tried to offer a progressive budget alternative that was balanced, did not offer tax cuts to the wealthy, protected those programs important to Americans, with modest reductions in the military, and it was not allowed.  It was an honest budget and it was not allowed. It did not have any magic asterisks that say we do not have the slightest idea how we are going to do this, we will just put something in that says we will figure out how to cut later.  This is a dishonest budget with a dishonest debate without a progressive alternative.
