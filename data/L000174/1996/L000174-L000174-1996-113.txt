President, I wonder if the Senator will just answer a question. I realize he has yielded the floor.  I wonder if I might ask the Senator from North Carolina a question. I was just glancing over his amendment.  Mr. President, would the Senator tell me, in section (a), the first section, it speaks of the ``United States persons or borrows funds from any international financial institution.'' Does that mean that no money could go to them if they were to borrow money from, say, the New York City Bank or other international financial institution just to pay their payroll? If they borrow from an American bank that has international affiliates to pay whatever housekeeping bills, would that preclude us?
