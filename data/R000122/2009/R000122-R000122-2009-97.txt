President, today I am introducing the Success in the Middle Act, which will help provide new support for raising student achievement in the middle grades. I thank Senators Klobuchar, Stabenow, Whitehouse, and Lautenberg for joining me as original cosponsors.  We know that the middle grades are an important and unique transition period for young people, and a criticaltime in a student's educational and social development. The middle grades are the key to ensuring students remain on track to college and career-readiness. International comparisons indicate that students in the United States do not start out behind other nations in math and science, but they fall significantly behind in these subjects by the end of the middle grades. According to the 2007 National Assessment on Educational Progress, only one-third of eighth grade students in the United States can read at proficiency or above. For math proficiency, this number falls to 31 percent of all American eighth grade students.  There has been significant focus during K-12 reform discussions regarding high school reform, and while there is no doubt that this is an essential component of improving our education system, addressing dropout prevention must begin earlier. It must begin at the middle schools that feed into the thousands of ``dropout factories'' across the country. Dropout factories are high schools in which fewer than 60 percent of students graduate. As one of the leading experts in the area of middle and high school reform, Robert Balfanz, has stated, middle schools are the ``first line of defense'' in identifying at-risk students and then effectively intervening to prevent them from dropping out. Balfanz's research has shown that sixth-graders who failed math or English, attended school less than 80 percent of the time, or received an unsatisfactory behavior grade in a core course had only a 10 to 20 percent chance of graduating on time. Without successful intervention, these behaviors lead students to course failure, non-promotion, and eventually dropping out.  That is why I am reintroducing the Success in the Middle Act. This bill will help strengthen that first line of defense by authorizing grants to states and school districts to improve and turnaround low-performing middle schools. It would concentrate new resources on the middle grades by requiring districts to develop an early warning indicator system for indentifying students at risk of dropping out, and tailoring research-based interventions to get these students back on track to graduating college and career-ready. These interventions would include high-quality professional development for teachers; personal academic plans such as the Individual Learning Plans required in Rhode Island; mentoring and counseling; and extended learning time.  When he was in the Senate, President Obama was the lead sponsor of this legislation. I am pleased that the President has continued to recognize the need for increased investment in middle and high school reform, including earlier this year, his action to encourage states and school districts to spend a significant portion of their American Recovery and Reinvestment Act education funds on improving student achievement in the middle and high school grades.  I was pleased to work with the Rhode Island Middle Level Educators, Rhode Island Association of School Principals, ACT, Alliance for Excellent Education, The College Board, International Reading Association, National Association of Secondary School Principals, National Council of Teachers of English, National Forum to Accelerate Middle Grades Reform, and National Middle Schools Association, and a host of other education organizations on this bill. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor the Success in the Middle Act. =========================== NOTE ===========================     On page S7082, June 25, 2009, the Record reads: . . . and a host of other education organizations on this bill.

There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1362       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Success in the Middle Act of      2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       In this Act:       (1) International comparisons indicate that students in the      United States do not start out behind students of other      nations in mathematics and science, but that they fall behind      by the end of the middle grades.       (2) Only \1/3\ of eighth grade students in the United      States, and only 4 percent of such students who are English      language learners, can read with proficiency, according to      the 2007 National Assessment on Educational Progress (NAEP).      The percentage of eighth grade students proficient at reading      has not increased since 1998, and the NAEP average reading      score for eighth grade students has remained static. In      contrast, NAEP reading scores and achievement levels for      fourth grade students have increased significantly.       (3) In mathematics, less than \1/3\ of students in eighth      grade show skills at the NAEP proficient level, and nearly 30      percent score below the basic level. The percentage of eighth      grade students scoring above the basic level was 8 points      higher in 2007 than in 2000, but for fourth grade students,      the percentage increased 17 points, more than double the      increase for middle grades students. In eighth grade, the      gaps between the average mathematics scores of white and      black students and between white and Hispanic students were      as wide in 2007 as in 1990.       (4) Fewer than 2 in 10 of the students who graduated from      high school in 2005 or 2006 met, as eighth graders, all 4 of      ACT's EXPLORE College Readiness Benchmarks, the minimum level      of achievement that ACT has shown is necessary if students      are to be college- and career-ready upon their high school      graduation.       (5) Lack of basic skills at the end of middle grades has      serious implications for students. Students who enter high      school 2 or more years behind grade level in mathematics and      literacy have only a 50 percent chance of progressing on time      to the tenth grade; those not progressing are at significant      risk of dropping out of high school.       (6) Middle grades students are hopeful about their future,      with 93 percent believing that they will complete high school      and 92 percent anticipating that they will attend college.       (7) Sixth grade students who do not attend school      regularly, who are subjected to frequent disciplinary      actions, or who fail mathematics or English have less than a      15 percent chance of graduating high school on time and a 20      percent chance of graduating 1 year late. Without effective      interventions and proper supports, these students are at risk      of subsequent failure in high school, or of dropping out.       (8) Student transitions from elementary school to the      middle grades and to high school are often complicated by      poor curriculum alignment, inadequate counseling services,      and unsatisfactory sharing of student performance and      academic achievement data between grades.       (9) According to ACT, the level of academic achievement      that students attain by eighth grade has a larger impact on      the students' college and career readiness upon graduation      from high school than anything that happens academically in      high school.       (10) Middle schools are almost twice as likely as      elementary schools to be identified for improvement,      corrective action, or restructuring (22 percent as compared      to 13 percent) under section 1116 of the Elementary and      Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 63116).       (11) Middle grades improvement strategies should be      tailored based on a variety of performance indicators and      data, so that educators can create and implement successful      school improvement strategies to address the needs of the      middle grades, and so that teachers can provide effective      instruction and adequate assistance to meet the needs of at-     risk students.       (12) To stem a dropout rate nearly twice that of students      without disabilities, students with disabilities in the      critical middle grades must receive appropriate academic      accommodations and access to assistive technology, high-risk      behaviors such as absenteeism and course failure must be      monitored, and problem-solving skills with broad application      must be taught.       (13) Local educational agencies and State educational      agencies often do not have the capacity to provide support      for school improvement strategies. Successful models do exist      for turning around low-performing middle grades, and Federal      support should be provided to increase the capacity to apply      promising practices based on evidence from successful      schools.
