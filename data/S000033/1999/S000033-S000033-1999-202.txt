 Speaker, I would like to submit for the Record these statements by high school students from my home State of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today.                         Child Care in Vermont    (On behalf of Jody Foster, David Verge, Alicia Norris and Bobby                                 Collone)       David Verge: Our issue is about child care in Vermont, and      with the young people because a lot of the younger people are      having kids now. According to child care funds in Vermont, a      family could not afford care in 75 percent of the homes or      any center. Vermont child care subsidy is at too low of a      rate, only $83.70 for field time centers, and $67.45 for      full-time care and home care. People of low income levels      cannot afford even $50 to make up the difference that the      state does not pay.       If they want to come and encourage people to work or go to      school, then they need to make it worthwhile. If you are      working and your whole paycheck is going to the cost of     day care, then what is the point of working? Youth Build      needs a day care, because 11 people out of, I'd say, about      33, 30 people have kids already, and we would like if we      could try to open child care round Vermont so people can get      their educations, and for the people that drop out of high      school, because they don't have the money to pay for child      care. We would like to see more people graduate than drop      out, because we have the lowest dropout rate, from what I      understand, and we are just trying to fix it, because a lot      of us want to become something so our kids will not look down      on us and can think something of us. You know, a lot of us      are just not willing to work with it, because we have no      money to pay for all the child care, plus other things that      we need for essential needs for babies, us, and it is really      hard.       Congressman Sanders: You are doing great, Dave.       Alicia Norris: I think a lot of it is, we are all students      and we all either have children or are having children. Two      of us have kids already, and our whole paycheck from Youth      Build goes straight to day care. I mean, we have no money for      expenses, for diapers or anything else like that. And it is      hard to find good day care when it is $150 a week, and that      is really expensive. That makes it really hard, because we      want to go to school. And I think a lot of it is, students      don't get the help they need so they can go back to school,      because they are trying to better their lives and make their      lives better for them and their children.       Jody Foster: Some of our changes would include maybe a      special subsidy for parents that are going back to school or      working, and base it better on income levels, on a higher      income level for state help for child care.       Alicia Norris: And just employers helping out their      employees, to give them day care, or to either provide day      care, like the hospital does, or to help with the funds for      it.       Congressman Sanders: Well, you guys have touched on an      enormously important subject, and you have done a great job      making that presentation.                                       ____                       Democracy and Child Labor             (On behalf of Matt Sheldon and Emily Webster)       Matt Sheldon: My presentation is on democracy in the United      States.       The U.S. system of government is not as fair as it could      be. There is an elite ruling class who have too much control      in the way things are run. People in the lower classes have      no power. They remain in the lower class because of a      concentration of power and wealth within a small area of the      population.       The type of political system that the U.S. has is a      representative democracy. The people elect officials to      ``represent'' them in decision-making. These elected      officials are very often corrupt and become politicians only      because they have a hunger for authority.       The election process doesn't allow everyone to be      represented. It costs a great deal of money for a politician      to campaign. Therefore, most people in government come from      the upper classes. Many of them raise funds illegally. An      honest person with good ideas for change may not be able to      get their voice heard because of a lack of campaign funds.       The mass media also makes it difficult for many people,      because it suppresses anything that seems too radical. When a      news organization decides whose campaign to cover, they may      essentially be helping to decide the electee. The public only      has access to certain orthodox views, so naturally, they vote      for those certain people.       Many people on the left figure that a liberal leader is      better than a conservative, so they vote for the liberal, But      the liberals are often just as bad. They're hypocritical in      many ways. Their opinions and actions are determined by the      status quo. Our current president, Bill Clinton, is becoming      more conservative, in that he wants to increase military      spending. People like him do not really want to make the      country a good place, they just crave power and fame.       Liberals are often too afraid of offending people. They are      slightly critical of capitalism and make some attempts to      make it better by tax reform or supporting higher wages and      improved working conditions in general, but the fact remains,      capitalism is a system that rests on the exploitation of      humans by other humans. And the same can be said about      government: As long as there is an elitist state, there will      be division of classes and limited opportunity.      Nonhierarchical collectivism is the only way for true      liberty.       Emily Webster: I will be presenting on child labor.       Child labor is alive and well today, despite efforts by the      government and the people to control and regulate it. The      efforts made show that the issue of exploitative child labor      has been recognized in the United States and steps have been      taken to eliminate it, for progress is not being made fast      enough and it is not effective enough.       Exploitative child labor has been in existence for far too      long. Even though it occurs less often in this country, it is      mainly the United States-based companies that commit this      abusive act. Nike is a multibillion dollar U.S.-based      company. If this is so, why aren't the majority of Nike      factories in this country? In order for Nike to bring in the      profit that it does, the goods need to be manufactured at a      very low cost. By setting up companies in other countries,      mainly Third World countries, the company brings in more      profits than it would if manufacturing was done in the United      States.       Disney is another huge U.S.-based company. The products      made by Disney are aimed for young children, and in most      cases are made by young children overseas. These countries      don't enforce labor laws or don't have a minimum wage, so      workers don't have enough money to live even on a poverty      level. In addition, the workers are abused in the factories.      Oftentimes, the abuse is even sexual. If the workers try to      help themselves and report their abuse, they can be fired and      even blacklisted.       The U.S. is aware that Nike and Disney commit illegal acts      outside this country, so why don't we act upon it? These      children are not only abused, but they are denied schooling,      something American children take for granted.       The most brutal of child labor is called bonded child      labor. In a lot of places, the need for money is so great,      the parents literally sell their children, or their children      are kidnapped by companies who put them to work. They receive      extremely low wages.       Though child labor is still going on, there has been a lot      of progress in reducing these terrible condition. Global      Fashions, a clothing company, took its first step in      improving conditions when it was discovered that exploitative      child labor was being used. Global Fashions then agreed to      voluntary codes of conduct to improve working conditions.       Another example of success is the Bonded Child Labor      Elimination Act, sponsored by Bernie Sanders. It amends the      Tariff Act, which says the products made by prisoners or      adult bonded labor cannot be imported into the United States,      by including products made by forced or indentured child      labor.       Exploitative child labor is not only an issue about wages.      It goes deeper, to the point where it turns into a life-     threatening situation for many children around the world.      Many people are in such desperate need for whatever money      they can get that any conditions are tolerable, as long as      they are getting paid. That needs to change. People      everywhere deserve to be rewarded for the work they do.      Children should be able to go to school and have the      opportunities that most American children have. Major      corporations must stop treating people as machines, but as      people who have needs. Until this country can put the welfare      of people all over the world before money, exploitation of      children in other countries will prevail.                               ____________________
