 President, I would like to take a moment to clarify one section of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act with my colleague, Senator Thurmond.  I want to clarify further the intent of the language in section 371. This section deals with the ability of the children of U.S. Customs employees living in Puerto Rico to attend the Department of Defense school in Puerto Rico. It is my understanding that the Customs Service will not be required to reimburse the Department of Defense for the cost of dependents attending the DOD school in Puerto Rico. Is this the Senator's understanding?
