Speaker, we have again seen the face of courage. It is Lance Armstrong's.  Lying in his hospital bed just 3 years ago, Mr. Armstrong was fired by his French bicycle racing team. He suffered from testicular cancer and was given less than a 40 percent chance of survival.  He underwent two operations and 12 weeks of chemotherapy, but he refused to succumb and now has prevailed by winning the Tour de France last Sunday.  Lance Armstrong was not alone on this long journey back. The one team willing to take a chance on Mr. Armstrong was sponsored by the United States Postal Service. The Postal Service deserves great credit.  This wonderful story reminds me of a poem by another American trailblazer, Amelia Earhart. She wrote:     Courage is the price that life extracts for granting peace.     The soul that knows it not knows no release from little            things;     knows not the livid loneliness of fear,     nor mountain heights where bitter joy can hear     the sounds of wings.  Lance Armstrong knows both and inspires us all.                          ____________________
