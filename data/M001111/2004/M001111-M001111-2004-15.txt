 President, the Senator from Massachusetts is absolutely correct. The Department of Education could end this today with a simple rulemaking procedure. Instead they are pointing fingers, saying Congress has to do it. Congress had the opportunity in the Appropriations Committee last week. They said, no, we have to wait for an authorization 6 months from now. Every month that goes by we lose billions of dollars in taxpayers' money and thousands of students don't get access to college. We don't need any more fingerpointing on this.  I think the Senator would agree that we don't need the Department of Education pointing to Congress and Congress pointing to the Department of Education. We need to stop this now. The Department of Education can do it by rulemaking and we can do it on any bill that comes before us. But we need to do it and we need to do it quickly.
