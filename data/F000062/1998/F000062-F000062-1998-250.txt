 President, today I join my colleague Senator Boxer in introducing the Sonny Bono Memorial Salton Sea Restoration Act. This legislation is similar to that now pending in the House of Representatives, but it seeks to respond to concerns expressed by local, state and federal officials about problems with the House bill. Despite the fact that there are differences between the two versions, the time to address the problems of the Salton Sea has come, legislation will move forward promptly, and be signed into law.  I have spoken on this floor about the problems facing the Salton Sea. Now it is time to turn to how to solve those problems. The legislation introduced today reflects the work of scores of people in California concerned with the Salton Sea. It is consistent with the approach they believe is most appropriate, and it involves them in the process.  This legislation proceeds in two stages.  First, it provides funding and sets a deadline of 18 months for the conduct of additional scientific research on the problems facing the Salton Sea, for the evaluation of various projects to address these problems, for the selection of a specific project, and for the completion of the necessary environmental reviews required by the National Environmental Policy Act and the California Environmental Quality Act.  Second, it authorizes funding, subject to modification by Congress, for the implementation of the project that is chosen.  The research funded in this legislation is absolutely crucial, for the problems facing the Salton Sea are complex. Previously, most concerns expressed about the Sea related to its increasing salinity and its rising water level. More recently, however, massive die offs of fish and migratory birds have occurred, that appear to be caused by problems other than salinity.  So, in addition to determining the optimum elevation for the Sea, and the desirable level of salinity, it is important to understand the interrelationships between these two components and the pollutants that continue to flow into the Sea.  Finally, this legislation proposes a tight timetable for reaching a decision on the best project to solve the problems facing the Sea. However, it is my understanding that the Department of the Interior already has the authority and a limited amount of funding to begin additional testing and environmental review and is willing to do so. This means that an 18 month timetable is realistic. There has been deep concern that a 12 month timetable is insufficient if a sound plan is to evolve which also involves the rivers, now heavily polluted, which empty into and add contamination to the Salton Sea. Therefore, I urge all parties to begin working while this legislation moves through Congress.  Mr. President, in closing, I want to say that I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House to craft a bill that is acceptable to both bodies, a bill that will preserve and enhance the Salton Sea, a bill that is a fitting tribute to the memory of the late Congressman Sonny Bono, who cared so deeply about the Salton Sea. Thank you.                                 ______                                       By
