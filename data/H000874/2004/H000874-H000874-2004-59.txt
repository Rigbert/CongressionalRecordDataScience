Speaker, revenue went up after they occurred, and we balanced the budget 4 years in a row.  Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, on the intelligence legislation, obviously there has been a lot of discussion about that. We have been very concernedabout passing that legislation in a bipartisan fashion. The 9/11 Commission report has now been on our desks for many weeks now.  Can the leader inform us of where that legislation currently stands?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
