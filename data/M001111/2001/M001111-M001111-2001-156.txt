 As Members know, this bill contains many, many important infrastructure projects across this country for Members' airports, the Coast Guard, roads, infrastructure, bridges. We are trying diligently to move this bill forward so we can make progress and move to the House for a conference so we can do our duty in terms of the transportation infrastructure in this country and getting those projects funded.  I know many Members have priority projects in here they want to make sure are included. Senator Shelby and I have been working extremely hard together in a bipartisan manner to ensure those projects move forward in a timely fashion.  We implore all of our colleagues who have amendments to come to the floor this morning. It is 10:30 on Wednesday morning. We are here. We are ready. We are waiting for those amendments to be offered. I understand Senator Graham of Florida will be here shortly to offer his. I let all Members know, postcloture their amendments may fall, and we are going to be moving to that very quickly. Members have this morning, the next hour and a half, to offer any amendments they would like to have considered, either to be included in a voice vote that we hope to have or to be offered as amendments. Otherwise, they may not get their project debated on the floor and included in our bill.  Senator Shelby and I are ready to consider any amendments that Members bring. We let them know that if they don't bring them shortly, they will probably not be allowed to be offered or included in the bill.  I yield the floor.
