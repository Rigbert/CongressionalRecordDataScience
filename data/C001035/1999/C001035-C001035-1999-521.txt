President, I am pleased to be joining my colleague from Alaska, Senator Murkowski, in introducing the Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act of 1999, which is intended to address some of the problems that small family practice residency programs in Maine and elsewhere are experiencing as a result of provisions in the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997 that were intended to control the growth in Medicare graduate medical education spending.  Of specific concern are the provisions in the BBA that cap the total number of residents in a program at the level included in the 1996 Medicare cost reports. Congress' goal in reforming Medicare's graduate medical education program was to slow down our nation's overall production of physicians, while still protecting the training of physicians who are in short supply and needed to meet local and national health care demands. While the BBA's provisions will indeed curb growth in the overall physician supply, they do so indiscriminately and are thwarting efforts in Maine and elsewhere to increase the supply of primary care physicians in underserved rural areas.  Because Maine has only one medical school--the University of New England, which trains osteopathic physicians--we depend on a number of small family practice residency programs to introduce physicians to the practice opportunities in the state. Most of the graduates of these residency programs go on to establish practices in Maine, many in rural and underserved areas of the state. The new caps on residency slots included in the BBA penalize these programs in a number of ways.  For instance, the current cap is based on the number of interns and residents who were ``in the hospital'' in FY 1996. Having a cap that is institution-specific rather than program-specific has caused several problems. For example, the Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program had two residents out on leave in 1996--one on sick leave for chemotherapy treatments and one on maternity leave. Therefore, the program's cap was reduced by two, because it was based on the number of actual residents in the hospital in 1996 as opposed to the number of residents in the program.  Moreover, residents in this program have spent one to two months training in obstetrics at Dartmouth's Mary Hitchcock's Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire. Because the cap is based on a hospital's cost report, these residents are counted toward Dartmouth Medical School's cap instead of the Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program's. Lastyear, the Maine program was informed that Dartmouth would be cutting back the amount of time their residents are there. But the Maine-Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program has no way of recouping the resident count from them in order to have the funds to support obstetrical training for their residents elsewhere.  Moreover, the cap does not include residents who continue to be part of the residency program, but who have been sent outside of the hospital for training. This penalizes all primary care specialties, but especially family medicine, where ambulatory training has historically been the hallmark of the specialty. This is particularly ironic since other specialty programs that now begin training in settings outside the hospital will, under the new rules, have those costs included in their Medicare graduate medical education funding.  All told, the Maine Dartmouth Family Practice Residency Program will see its graduate medical education funding reduced by over half a million dollars a year as a result of the cap established by the BBA.  The example I have just used is from Maine, but the problems created by the BBA's graduate medical education changes are national in scope. It has created disproportionately harmful effects on family practice residencies from Maine to Alaska. A recent survey of all family practice residency program directors has found that:  56 percent of respondents who were in the process of developing new rural training sites have indicated that they will either not implement those plans or are unsure about their sponsoring institutions' continued support.  21 percent of respondents report planning to decrease their family practice residency slots in the immediate future. The majority of those who are planning to decrease their slots are the sole residency program in a teaching hospital. This means that, under current law, they have no alternative way of achieving growth, such as through a reduction of other specialty slots in order to stay within the cap.  And finally, the vast majority of family practice residencies did not have their full residency FTEs captured in the 1996 cost reports upon which the cap is based.  In addition to this survey, we have anecdotal information from residencies across the country detailing how they have lost funding either because of where they trained their residents or because their residents had been extended sick or maternity leave. For example, one family practice residency in Washington State last year had an equivalent of 14 residents training outside of the hospital and four in the hospital. Under the BBA, their cap would be four. By contrast, had all of their residents been trained in the hospital up to this point, their payment base would have been capped at 18, even if they trained residents in non-hospital settings in the future.  The Medicare Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act we are introducing today will address these problems by basing the cap on the number of residents ``who were appointed by the approved medical residency training programs for the hospital'' in 1996, rather than on the number of residents who were ``in the hospital.''  I am also concerned that the Balanced Budget Act and its accompanying regulations will severely hamper primary care residency programs that are expanding to meet local needs. Specifically, a new residency program that had not met its full complement of accredited residency positions until after the cutoff date of August 5, 1997, is precluded from increasing its number of residents unless the hospital decreases the number of residents in one of its other specialty programs. However, over forty percent of the nation's family practice residency programs are the only program sponsored by the hospital. This provision therefore completely precludes such a hospital from expanding its residency program to meet emerging primary care needs.  To address this problem, the legislation we are introducing today would allow the small number of programs at hospitals that sponsor just one residency program to increase their cap by one residency slot a year up to a maximum of three. In addition, to enable a number of family practice residency programs that are already in the pipeline to get accredited and grow to completion, the bill extends the cutoff date to September 1999.  And finally, the Balanced Budget Act gave the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to give ``special consideration'' to new facilities that ``meet the needs of underserved rural areas.'' The Health Care Financing Administration has interpreted this to mean facilities that are actually in underserved rural areas. There have been several recent expansions in family practice residency programs that include a rural training track, with residents located in outlying hospitals, or with satellite programs designed specifically to train residents to work with underserved populations.  Even though these new programs or satellites required accrediting body approval, they are still part of the ``mother'' residencies, which may not be physically located in an underserved rural area. While these are not technically new programs, I believe that the definition should be expanded to include such endeavors, given the value of these programs in addressing the needs of underserved populations. Therefore, the Medicare Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments Act would expand the definition to include ``facilities which are not located in an underserved rural area, but which have established separately accredited rural training tracks.''  Mr. President, while the changes we are proposing today are relatively minor and technical in nature, they are critical to the survival of the small family practice residency programs that are so important to our ability to meet health manpower needs in rural and underserved areas. I urge all of my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the Medicare Graduate Medical Education Technical Amendments and ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 541       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
