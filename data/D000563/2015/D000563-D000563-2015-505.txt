President, today is the 150th anniversary of the second inaugural address of President Abraham Lincoln. Later on this evening there will be an observance in the Rotunda sponsored by the Illinois State Society and the Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial Foundation to observe this anniversary. My colleague Senator Kirk is scheduled to be there; former Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood; Stephen Lang; and some of the most distinguished Lincoln scholars in America: Dr. Edna Greene Medford, Chief Justice Frank Williams of Rhode Island, and the most prolific Lincoln writer I know, Harold Holzer from New York.  There have been 15,000 books written about Abraham Lincoln. I think Mr. Holzer has written about half of them. He is not only prolific, but he is profound in his observations about this great man's life. He was joined by Edith Holzer, his wife, who stood by him through his Lincoln travails.  Historians disagree on whether the second inaugural address of Abraham Lincoln was his greatest speech or his second greatest. I am in the latter camp. I accord that highest honor to the Gettysburg Address for its brevity as well as its inspiration, but both speeches are immortal.  I am not a Lincoln scholar, but my life as a Springfield attorney, elected Congressman, and Senator from Illinois has taken me to some of the same streets and same buildings that were part of Abraham Lincoln's life.  Although he tried mightily to be elected to the Senate in 1858, Abraham Lincoln fell short. It was in that campaign of 1858 that he debated Stephen Douglas. At the end of the debates and when the votes were cast, Stephen Douglas was the victor in that senatorial contest in Illinois. Of course, the same two men faced off again 2 years later for the Presidency. But that Senate seat, the Douglas seat that was contested in the 1858 election, is the same seat I am honored to hold today in the State of Illinois.  We can feel Abraham Lincoln's presence in this building, particularly near the Senate Chamber. There is a magnificent room off the Senate Chamber known as the President's Room. It is one of the historic rooms in the Capitol.  It was in this room in April of 1862 that President Lincoln signed the bill outlawing slavery in the District of Columbia. It was in this room in 1965 that Dr. Martin Luther King and other leaders watched Lyndon Baines Johnson sign the Voting Rights Act, prohibiting discrimination at the polls--100 years after Lincoln's death. It was in the same room on January 20, 2009, that a newly inaugurated President Barack Obama signed his first official documents as President of the United States. And it was in this room that Abraham Lincoln worked long into the night before his second inauguration, signing and vetoing bills passed in the final hours of one Congress, before the next Congress was sworn in. Imagine that, Congress leaving important business until the last minute.  President Lincoln was working in the President's Room on March 3, 1865, when he received an urgent message from GEN Ulysses Grant. GEN Robert E. Lee was seeking a peace conference to negotiate an end to the war. Grant asked the President, his Commander in Chief: What should I reply?  After conferring with Secretary of War Stanton and Secretary of State Seward, Lincoln sent word back to General Grant that he was not to meet with Lee ``unless it be for the capitulation of General Lee's army.''  The following day, in his second inaugural address, March 4, 1865, Lincoln explained more fully why he had refused Lee's request for a negotiated settlement. He said: ``With firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in.''  Less than 5 weeks later, General Lee surrendered unconditionally at Appomattox. The cannons would fall silent. After 4 years of horrific death and destruction, the worst war and the most costly war in the history of the United States was over. But the work was not.  President Lincoln told us in his second inaugural address the urgent challenge is not only to win the war, but to win the peace by achieving true reconciliation. Another President could certainly have been vindictive toward the South--that had been the practice of the day and it is what many people wanted in the North--but Lincoln understood that if America remained divided after the hostilities ceased, then the terrible sacrifices of war would have been in vain. So he counseled in that immortal inaugural address: ``With malice toward none, charity for all.'' Let us bind up the wounds here, and not inflict new injuries. That was how the Union would be reunited and persevere.  Six weeks later after this speech, Abraham Lincoln was cut down by an assassin's bullet. He was, in fact, the last casualty of America's war within its own boundaries.  That address, that second inaugural address, remains the second shortest in the Nation's history, only 703 words. Lincoln spoke so briefly that many people were still arriving after he finished. As at Gettysburg, some listeners were mystified by the President's brevity. Few understood the genius of the speech at that moment. Frederick Douglass was an exception. He said to Mr. Lincoln afterwards, ``Mr. Lincoln, that was a sacred effort.''  In the century and a half since his death, we have made uneven progress in achieving the kind of America Abraham Lincoln believed we could be. Afull century passed before African Americans in the South were guaranteed the most basic right of citizenship, the right to vote.  If President Lincoln were here today, I think he would be happy to see how our Union has survived. I think he would be pleased and astonished to see that America had elected and reelected another lanky lawyer from Illinois, and an African American, to be our President.  I also think he would challenge us. When our government ``of the people, by the people, for the people'' is under threat from a cabal of secret, special interest money that can buy elections, I think President Lincoln would tell us we have unfinished work to do.  When we neglect to bind up the wounds of war of even one soldier returning from war, and neglect to care for widows and orphans, Lincoln would have reminded us that we have unfinished work to do.  And when the right to vote is under systematic attack in so many States for obvious political reasons, there is still work to do.  When Americans who work long and hard can't earn enough to provide for their families, I think Lincoln would tell us to put our shoulder to the plough and finish the work of creating a genuine opportunity for all Americans.  We can see in the second inaugural and in the Gettysburg Address one reason that Abraham Lincoln remains our greatest President. He shows us that America is capable of constant progress toward our professed creed. We can love our country and be determined to make it better.                      Tribute to Bill Bartholomay  Mr. President, even by Chicago standards, this has been some winter. From Boston to Birmingham, AL, tens of millions of Americans have been clobbered this winter by record snowfalls. In fact, we are heading for the exits in Washington this afternoon with the threat of another winter storm.  That may be why so many of us are so happy this week is finally here and we can literally count the days until spring training of baseball begins. In cities throughout the Sun Belt, mighty Casey is smiling again. More than Punxsutawney Phil or the sighting of the first robin, spring training for many of us marks the unofficial arrival of spring.  Few people on Earth are happier about the start of the baseball season than Bill Bartholomay, a man who has done so much for the cities of Chicago and Atlanta, for the sport of baseball, and for our Nation.  Bill Bartholomay has achieved more in his one life than many talented people in five. He is phenomenally successful as an entrepreneur, and he has built some of the most successful insurance brokerage firms in the world. Bill has owned a restaurant, a candy company, and a chain of toy stores.  He helped a friend and business partner by the name of Ted Turner transform CNN from an upstart news station to one of the most powerful news organizations in the world.  Bill Bartholomay is more than a successful businessman, he is a principled civic leader and a true philanthropist. On top of all that, he is chairman emeritus of the Atlanta Braves. He is a man who half a century ago, with support from leaders, including the father of the Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr., brought Major League Baseball to America's Deep South. What a life.  In 1962, Bill Bartholomay and a group of investors bought the Milwaukee Braves. The Braves roster then included a lot of great legendary ballplayers. Among them was a young catcher with a rocket for an arm whose mother had to sign his first major league contract because he hadn't reached the age of 21. His name was Joe Torre. But the Braves greatest player then and ever was a man named Henry Aaron, ``Hammerin' Hank.''  In 1966, Bill Bartholomay and his partners moved the Braves from Milwaukee to Atlanta. Here is something that will do your heart good. Go to YouTube and watch the video of that magic night, April 8, 1974, when Hank Aaron broke Babe Ruth's record to become baseball's all-time home-run champ, a record he would hold for 33 years. For anyone under the age of 50, it may be impossible now to fully appreciate what that moment meant.  It was 6 years almost to the day after Dr. King's assassination. For more than a year, as Hank Aaron had closed in on Babe Ruth's fabled record of 714 home runs, he had been cheered by many, but also subjected to ugly racist threats and taunts. There were people who just seethed at the idea that Babe Ruth's immortal record would be broken by a Black baseball player.  Years later, Hank Aaron would acknowledge that the anger and the jeers wore on him. They worried Bill Bartholomay too.  So watch that clip on YouTube, April 8, 1974. It was the Braves home opener against the Los Angeles Dodgers. More than 53,000 fans were standing for that great moment--a record crowd.  It is the fourth inning. Henry ``Hank'' Aaron is up at bat. The count is 1 and 0. And then it happens: Aaron swings and smashes the ball over the center field fence.  The fans roar. Fireworks fill the sky over the stadium. As Aaron rounds the bases, the Dodgers infielders reach out to shake his hand.  He crosses homeplate, surrounded by teammates, his beaming wife, and parents. And standing right next to him was Bill Bartholomay.  It had been a dozen years since Bill and his partners had bought the Braves and 8 years since they moved to Atlanta. Part of their reason for moving the Braves to Atlanta was because Atlanta was working hard in the 1960s to become the leading city of the new South, a city that would move beyond the old legacy of Jim Crow to a new era.  Leaders, including Dr. King, believed that Major League Baseball could help to create that new Atlanta, and Bill Bartholomay and his partners wanted to be part of that dream. Eight years after he moved the team to Atlanta, there he stood with baseball's new home-run king, a man who had started his career in the old Negro League, who had just broken the most revered record in Major League Baseball and who would become a symbol of immense pride for Atlanta and all of America. That was one of the many great moments for the Braves under Bill Bartholomay.  Since he moved the team to Atlanta in 1966, Bill has witnessed the Braves winning 16 division championships, including a record-setting 14 in a row, 5 National League pennants. And in 1995 the Braves went all the way, winning the World Series.  Bill no longer owns the Braves, but he is still closely connected to the team and has served as the chairman emeritus since 2003. He is an active member of the MLB owners group.  Bill Bartholomay grew up in Illinois in a family where his father and grandfather had made good money in the insurance brokerage business. He was the second of two boys, and he grew up in Winnetka, IL, just outside of Chicago, in a big house. The Bartholomay family were friends with both the Wrigley family, who owned the Chicago Cubs, and the Comiskey family, who owned the White Sox.  As far back as he can remember, Bill loved baseball and so did his mom. They used to go to Cubs games together.  At North Shore Country Day School, his eighth grade phys ed instructor thought Bill loved baseball a little too much. He sent home a report card that said:       Billy is very cooperative in play activities. While his      ability is not great, he makes up to a large degree by his      enthusiasm and interest. My greatest concern with him is that      he seems to borrow much of his ideas of conduct from      professional baseball.  That teacher needn't have worried. The lessons of baseball have served Bill Bartholomay very well. They have inspired and shaped his entire amazing life.  One of Bill's favorite sayings is: ``Start strong, finish strong and play all nine innings.'' Translation: Give it everything you have got--no half measures.  That attitude has enabled Bill to build or even help build a number of powerful insurance brokerage firms, along with other diverse businesses.  In 2003, he became vice chairman of Willis Group Holdings, one of the largest insurance brokers in the world. He increased their presence in Chicago to the point where they became the regional headquarters of what was formerly known as Sears Tower, nowknown as the Willis Tower. Today that office anchors Chicago's place as a first-rate place to operate a global company.  Bill is more than a businessman, more than a man of baseball; he is a civic leader as well. In the early 1980s, then-Chicago mayor, the late James Byrne, asked Bill to serve on the park commission, overseeing Chicago's 400 parks. Bill never said no to public service. So even though he had five teenaged kids and a number of businesses, he said he would serve for 1 year. He ended up serving for 23 years, including many as commission chairman.  All told, three of Chicago's mayors recognized Bill's talents as a bridge builder in Chicago. He made sure the commission focused not only on the wealthy parts of the city but all of the city.  Bill created a charitable foundation and he has helped to make it work and helped millions of others. He is a generous man and he is generous in praise of others.  I wish to give a short story that I read when I was reading a book one day and stumbled on this little episode in Bill's life that really tells a story. It is a story about another baseball legend, a man by the name of Satchel Paige, who may have been the best baseball pitcher ever. He was an American treasure.  He was a star in the Negro Leagues during the Jim Crow era. He later became the first African-American pitcher in the American League and the first Negro League player elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame.  He played for an astonishing 250 teams in his 40-year career. He used to pitch year around, often on back-to-back days. He hurled exhibition games on his day off. He spent the winter months playing in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Mexico.  In 1968 Satchel Paige was 62 years old, and despite all the time he had played in baseball, he hadn't played long enough to qualify for a pension. He fell 6 months short. So Satchel Paige sent a letter to every Major League Baseball team asking them if they would consider hiring him as a coach, and if they would for 6 months, he would qualify for a pension.  Well, you can guess who replied. It was Bill Bartholomay. Bill Bartholomay, in a real true act of kindness, said: ``Baseball would have been guilty of negligence should it not assure this legendary figure a place in the pension plan.''  Bill made sure Satchel Paige got his pension. He hired him to be the Braves' pitcher-coach-trainer just long enough for him to meet his pension needs. In case there was any doubt about what he was doing, he assigned Satchel Paige the number 65, the age at which his retirement salary would kick in.  But there was another reason the Braves hired Satchel Paige. That summer--the summer of 1968--riots were raging and cities were burning across America in the wake of Dr. King's assassination. Bill Bartholomay believed that having a bridge builder such as Satchel Paige might help diffuse tensions in Atlanta, and he was right.  Satchel did that partly by signing autographs and spending time with fans and serving as a good will ambassador. Even though his title was trainer, what Satchel Paige really wanted to do, even at age 62, was pitch. The club didn't care for the idea. They were afraid his eyesight wasn't good enough and a line drive might knock him off the mound, but Satchel insisted. He said he could tell by the crack of the bat where the ball was headed.  In 1969, Satchel Paige pitched a couple of innings in an exhibition game for the Braves' highest level minor league team, the Triple-A Richmond team. So picture this: Satchel Paige on the mound beaming, and who steps up to the plate? Hank Aaron. The best pitcher in baseball history against the best hitter.  Strike one, strike two, and finally Hank Aaron swings hard, gets a piece of the ball and pops out to third. Old Satchel still had it.  In his 1966 Hall of Fame induction speech, Ted Williams urged the inclusion of Negro League players to the Hall of Fame. Satchel Paige was elected as the first Negro League player to be inducted.  Satchel Paige once said: ``Ain't no man can avoid being born average, but there ain't no man got to be common.''  Bill Bartholomay has led an uncommonly good life as a business leader, as a pioneer in baseball, as a civic leader, as a philanthropist, and as a man who sensed in his lifetime an opportunity to build bridges in America and make us a better nation through the game of baseball and through the integration of that sport. He served the cities of Chicago and Atlanta in an extraordinary way, but he served America as well. He proved his old phys ed instructor from grade school wrong by showing that the rules of baseball are pretty good rules for life after all.  On this day, as we start spring training and a new baseball season, I wish the very best to the very best--Bill Bartholomay.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Perdue). The clerk will call the roll.  The senior assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.
