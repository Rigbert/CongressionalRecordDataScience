Speaker, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the chairman, who is one of the real leaders in our House and in this Nation on defense policy.  We lament the loss of those four brave sailors. We pray for the injured, the missing, and for their families. And we reiterate what the chairman's sentiment that there will be no division, there will be no partisanship, there will be no disagreement on standing together in defense of our forces around the world to maintain freedom and peace.  I thank the gentleman for his comments and join with him in that sentiment.
