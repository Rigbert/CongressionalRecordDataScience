Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the artists, the writers, the actors, the musicians, the schoolchildren, and the thousands upon thousands of people in Georgia and around the Nation who benefit from the National Endowment for the Arts. I rise on behalf of all of these people to plead with all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to defeat this rule, this rule which abolished the National Endowment for the Arts without so much as a vote.  It was President Lyndon Johnson who said:       Art is a Nation's most precious heritage, for it is in our      works of art that we reveal to ourselves and to others the      inner vision which guides us as a Nation. And where there is      no vision, the people will perish.  We cannot and we should not and we must not abandon the role of the Federal Government in supporting the arts. Bombs, not books; planes, but not poems; missiles, but not music: Is this the legacy we will leave for our children? I say no, and the American people say no. There is a role for our government to play in supporting the arts, and that role is through the National Endowment for the Arts.  This rule abolishes the NEA. It does not even permit a vote. This rule is a travesty. It is an insult to our democracy. Mr. Speaker, let us defeat this rule.
