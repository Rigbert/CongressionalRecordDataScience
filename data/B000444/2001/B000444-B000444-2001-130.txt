  This amendment is fairly simple, and I hope all of my colleagues can support it.  It would extend the Justice Department's school resource officer program for 6 years. It authorizes $180 million per year through 2007 for the wildly successful COPS in Schools Program. This is the same amount appropriated for the program in each of the last 2 years, the same amount requested by the administration in its Budget, and it's enough money to hire 1,500 resource officers per year.  This is a great program. Police departments and schools get together and they file their application jointly, based on the community's needs. To date, the Justice Department has funded over 3,800 school resource officers. They are 3 year grants, totaling up to $125,000 per officer. That's about $40,000 per year, usually enough to fund the officer's whole salary.  Why offer this amendment now. Well, the bill before us is designed to improve our schools, but without my amendment it does not include dedicated funds to hire school resource officers. And authority for COPS in Schools, one of the most successful school safety programs out there, expired last year.  My amendment has been endorsed by the National Association of School Resource Officers, by the National School Safety Center, by the Center for the Prevention of School Violence, by the National Education Association, and by the Fraternal Order of Police.  Why do school safety experts, line officers, the resource officers themselves, and the heads of police departments across the country, and educators support this amendment. Because they know COPS in Schools works. They know school resource officers can help quiet troubled schools halls, can quickly stop a violent incident, and can mentor students.  What are school resource officers. These are specially-trained police officers, men and women who work in and around elementary schools, middle schools, and high schools. They work with teachers, parents, and kids to identify and combat school-related crime and disorder problems. They get to know the students. They are their counselors and their role models, and, when necessary, they enforce the law.  D.A.R.E. police officers would be eligible to receive funding under this amendment, just as they are under the current COPS in Schools program.  I recently sat down with all of the school resource officers in Delaware. My State has embraced the concept, today, 16 members of the Delaware State Police serve as school resource officers. So do two members of the Wilmington Police Department, and one Newark police officer.  And about 1 year ago, I held a field hearing on school safety at the William Penn High School in Delaware. One of the witnesses was Delaware State Police Corporal Jeff Giles. Jeff told me low successful he has been as a school resource officer, how the kids feel safer, the school is more secure, and parents and teachers are put at ease.  This program works, COPS in Schools is a success. Let me tell you a story: When a high school in my State, Lake Forest High School, tried to phase out its school resource officer because of a lack of funds, the kids walked out. They walked out of school to protest Corporal Gary Fournier's, dismissal! The kids would not let their school resource officer go, they liked having him around so much. We found some funds that let the school keep Corporal Fournier on, but it should never have come to that.  Now, I was pleased the appropriators saw fit to include $180 million for COPS in Schools last year. And it looks like the Administration wants to continue the program at the same level this year. But year-to-year appropriations are no substitute for a multi-year authorization.  Schools need to have assurances this is a program that's here to stay. Citycouncils and other local governing bodies need to be able to pass their budgets knowing the Federal Government is there to help. Today, as we debate this education bill, authority for the whole COPS program has expired and with it, the COPS in Schools program's future is unclear.  That just shouldn't be the case. A lot of these school resource officers are heroes, and we shouldn't end the program that helps fund them. Take a look at the tragic shooting this past March in Granite Hills High School in El Cajon, CA. Local officials there have stated that but for the quick response of Rich Agundez, that school's resource officer, lives may have been lost. In the weeks following this shooting, San Diego school officials decided to station resource officers in all of their 180 schools.  We should help communities like San Diego. We should make sure they hear the message, loud and clear, that this Senate agrees with them. Let's give school resource officers to every school that wants one. Let's give parents a little peace of mind that their kids are safe when they get on that school bus and head off to learn. Let's give teachers a hand in maintaining order in their classrooms.  Let's pass my amendment and fund the COPS in Schools program. It works. It works, and I challenge any of my colleagues to tell me otherwise.                      Amendment No. 640 Withdrawn
