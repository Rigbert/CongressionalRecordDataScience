Corona has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Matt Logan is one of these individuals. On September 23, 2008, the Temescal District Boy Scouts of America will host the 2008 Distinguished Citizens Dinner in honor of Matt Logan.  Matt Logan has been the coach of the Centennial Huskies for 11 years. Centennial is currently ranked number 17 in the country and Matt has an overall record of 108-3. In the last eight seasons the Huskies have posted an incredible record of 90-15, which includes four CIF Championships, seven League Championships, a trip to the State Championship Bowl Game, and a 22 game winning streak.  Matt's coaching honors include: the 2007 Press Enterprise Sportsmen of the Year; NFL/ABC 2007 Coach of the Year; 2004 CalHiSports State Coach of the Year; the 2002, 2004, and 2007 Riverside County Coach of the Year; four-time CIF Coach of the Year; six-time League Coach of the Year; and two-time NFL Coach of the Week. Matt was selected to coach in the 2007 Southern California Bowl, the 2002 and 2003 Inland Empire All-Star Classic, the 2004 Cal/Florida Bowl, and the 2004 Shrine Game. During Coach Logan's tenure, there have been over 50 players to earn college scholarships.  Before becoming the Head Coach, Matt served as the Defensive Coordinator for the Huskies when they reached the CIF Finals in 1996 and the CIF semi-finals in 1995. Prior to Centennial High School, he coached at Esperanza High School and at Mater Dei High School. A 1985 graduate of Norco High School, Matt lettered in football, basketball and track and he was elected into the Hall of Fame in 1997. After high school, Coach Logan went on to play running back at Fullerton College and then at Chico State University. He graduated from Chico State in 1990 with a degree in Business. After a couple of years in sales, Matt returned to college and in 1995 received his Teaching Credential from Cal State Fullerton. In 2001, he graduated with a Masters Degree in Education from Azusa Pacifica University. In addition to his Head Coach responsibilities, he teaches Physical Education at Centennial High School. Matt and his late wife Donna, have three beautiful daughters; Lindsey who is 16 and a Junior at Centennial, Samantha who is 13 and Madison who is 12 years old.  Matt's tireless passion for coaching and mentoring has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Corona, California and to Centennial High School. I am proud to call Matt a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute them as a 2008 Distinguished Citizen.                          ____________________
