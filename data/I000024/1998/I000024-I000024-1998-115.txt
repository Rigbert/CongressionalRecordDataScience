We forget sometimes to mention that only 3.7 percent of the tax will be borne by those with incomes over $115,000, which I think is very significant.  I ask you this question since you represent the fine State of Missouri and I represent your neighboring State of Oklahoma. I had an experience and I just want to see if Missouri is anything like Oklahoma.  Over the last 10 days, I have had 3 days of townhall meetings throughout the State. As you know, I am active in aviation. I have all these townhall meetings at airports. With 20 meetings in 3 days--that was kind of a record for me, because normally I do five a day--not one time in one townhall meeting, in Watonga, OK, in Oklahoma City, in Miami, OK, right up on your border, or anyplace in Oklahoma, did anyone bring up the subject of the tobacco bill.  I brought it up in about half those meetings just because nobody had asked the question about this tobacco bill. Then when I talked to them about it, they said they had read about it and they said, ``We're opposed to it.''  In Oklahoma, in those meetings, there was not one hand that went up when I asked, ``Is there anyone here who is in support of this tobacco tax increase in this tobacco bill?'' Not one.  Is there something unusual about Oklahoma, or could it be that this is really a beltway issue? Have you tested your people in Missouri on this?
