Mr. Speaker, today I rise to call attention to the 150th Anniversary of the creation of Bordentown Township by the New Jersey State Legislature. Throughout all of my 21-year tenure in Congress, I have had the privilege of representing the residents of Bordentown Township, here in the United States House of Representatives.  I believe that it is fitting and proper for a community that has a long and rich tradition like Bordentown Township to periodically celebrate its history with its current residents, so that community awareness and cooperation are deepened. To understand where you are, you must first understand where you've been.  Throughout its long history, Bordentown Township has been forced to grapple with the challenges of growth, due its desirable location along the Delaware River and its well-deserved reputation as a good place to live and raise a family. Consequently, there has been a sense of commitment among Township residents about the need to create and preserve parks, recreational areas, and open spaces, in order to uphold the character of the township.  From the earliest beginnings of Bordentown, its residents have been civic-minded. Indeed, the creation of Bordentown Borough in 1825 was prompted by the growth of population in the village of Bordentown, and calls for a more representative government. When residents decided that they wanted to have a greater say on their own schools and a separate polling district, they successfully petitioned the State of New Jersey to amend its Borough Charter in 1849.  However, the arrangement of 1849 generated much dissatisfaction because the interests of the rural Chesterfield section of the borough, and the more urban Bordentown section, were mutually incompatible. In 1852 the New Jersey Legislature divided Bordentown and Chesterfield (a more rural neighbor) into two separate communities. A similar division was conducted in 1902, when the City of Bordentown, and Bordentown Township, were separated.  The first meetings of the Bordentown Township Committee were held in an unheated shed. Later, the meetings were held in a private home when it became too cold to hold them in the shed. In 1903 Township Hall was built on Cemetery Lane.  While things are much different in Bordentown Township today, the same spirit of service and willingness to make personal sacrifices for the benefit of local residents still exists in Bordentown's elected leaders. I know, because I am friends with, and work with, many of them. For instance, the current mayor of Bordentown Township, Mark Roselli, once served as my Legislative Director, Campaign Manager, and Policy Advisor.  In addition, the Director of my Burlington/Mercer Constituent Service Center, Joyce Golden, has been a proud resident of Bordentown Township for 22 years. She currently serves on the Township's County Committee, and has often told me that she and her husband, Marty, would not want to raise their family in any other community. Joyce and Marty are especially proud that their children have chosen to continue to live and work in Bordentown Township. Their daughter and her family have built a home in Bordentown Township, and their son serves the community as a career Firefighter/EMT for Fire District #2.  Mr. Speaker, I once again congratulate the people of Bordentown Township for preserving a community with a high quality-of-life for 150 years.                          ____________________
