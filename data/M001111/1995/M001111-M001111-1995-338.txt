 President, tomorrow is a critical date in United States trade relations with the People's Republic of China [PRC]. The United States Trade Representative has found that the PRC is seriously deficient in its protection of intellectual property rights. Talks have broken off, and unless the Chinese change their laws and improve their enforcement at this eleventh hour, the United States will impose steep tariffs on a number of products imported from the PRC, starting tomorrow.  I am disappointed that the situation has deteriorated to this point. More than 1 year ago I invited the Chinese Ambassador, United States executives and other Members of the Washington congressional delegation to my office to discuss this issue. I spoke with President Clinton and U.S. Trade Ambassador Michael Kantor as well. I encouraged all sides to get together and work toward a solution to the problem.  As a proponent of free trade, I am hopeful talks will be resumed and the Chinese Government will take serious steps to protect intellectual property rights. Hard-working people in the State of Washington are losing too much money to international pirates. This must end, and our relationship with this important trading partner must resume as quickly as possible.  It is up to the Clinton administration, and, more importantly, to the Chinese, to show some leadership. If China wants to be a global economic player, they have to play by the global economic rules. And those rules don't allow piracy.  Mr. President, as you know, I come from a State which is, per capita, the largest exporting State in the country. Washington State is home to America's single largest exporting company--the Boeing Co. We send the literal fruits of our labors--our apples and wheat--to every corner of the globe.  And, we are the site of some of America's most forward-looking, cutting-edge industries. We have big companies like the Microsoft Corp and Nintendo of America as well as small concerns all along the I-5 corridor which specialize in a dazzling array of high technology and biotech products.  These companies produce goods rich in intellectual property, the cornerstone of American innovation. Protecting these inventions through intellectual property rights is vital. Enforcing copyrights, patents and trademarks means that when you build a better mousetrap, you can reap the rewards of innovation. That's why we need and have strict laws in this country which protect inventions and punish thievery.  I am pleased that intellectual property has been included as a new discipline in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade [GATT]. Accordingly, it is important that all our trading partners uphold and enforce the strongest intellectual property laws possible, especially those countries that wish to join the GATT.  That is why the looming deadline is so disheartening. I sincerely hope China will address this situation, and prove they deserve a place in the global economic community.                          ____________________
