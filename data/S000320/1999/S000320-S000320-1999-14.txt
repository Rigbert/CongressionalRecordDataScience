 President, I rise today to offer the ``Consumer's Right to Financial Privacy Act'' for myself and Senator Bryan. This bill would address the significant deficiencies in the Financial Services Modernization Act passed by this very body last week.  Our bill would provide that consumers have (1) notice of the categoriesof nonpublic personal information that institutions collect, as well as the practices and policies of that institution with respect to disclosing nonpublic information; (2) access to the nonpublic personal information collected and shared; (3) affirmative consent, that is that the financial institution must receive the affirmative consent of the consumer, also referred to as an opt-in, in order to share such information with third parties and affiliates. Lastly, my provision would require that this federal law not preempt stronger state privacy laws. This bill is drafted largely after the amendment Senator Bryan and I offered in the Conference on Financial Services Modernization, but failed to get adopted due to the Conference's rush to pass a financial modernization bill, no matter what the cost.  I know some think that opt-in is extreme, but I have to tell you that is what the American people want. Over the past year I have learned a great deal about the activities of institutions sharing sensitive personal information. Many may not be aware, but it had become a common practice for state department of motor vehicles to sell the drivers license information, including name, height, weight, social security number, vehicle identification number, motor vehicle record and more. Some states even sold the digital photo image of each driver's license.  I was not aware of this practice going on. When I learned about it and studied it a little closer, I found several groups who were outraged by this practice. One such group was Eagle Forum. Another such group was the ACLU. Still another group was the Free Congress Foundation. Before I knew it, there was an ad hoc coalition of groups not only supporting the issue of driver's license privacy, but demanding it.  Thanks to the hard work of these groups, I was able to include an opt-in provision for people applying for drivers licenses at their state department of motor vehicles. That provision sailed through the Senate and then the House. That bill was signed into law by President Clinton. Despite significant lobbying by the direct marketing industry, not one member of the House or Senate took to the floor and said, ``I believe we should not allow consumers to choose whether or not their drivers license information, including their picture, should be sold or traded away like an old suit.'' No, no one objected to the opt-in. As a result, I believe very strongly that Congress has already set the bar on this issue. Opt-in is not just reasonable, it is the right thing to do.  Meanwhile, the ad hoc coalition, which is continuing to grow and includes every ideology from conservative to liberal, has signed on to four basic principles with regard to financial privacy. The principles include notice, access and consent, but also a requirement that weak federal laws not preempt stronger state laws. Our amendment incorporates those four basic principles.  Now my basic question is this, why would anyone oppose this bill? Only if you believe the financial services industry cannot make money by doing business above the table and on the level for everyone to see in the ``sunshine'' if you will. If you believe that financial institutions make money only by deceiving their customers or leaving those customers in the dark, then maybe you should oppose this bill. I do not subscribe to such a belief.  Industry will tell you that if they are required to include an opt-in, consumers will not, and therefore business will shut down. What does that tell you that consumers won't choose to opt-in? It means people don't want their information shared. If that is such a problem, it seems to me the business would spend more time educating the consumer as to the benefits of information sharing. That is where the burden to convince the consumer to buy the product should be--on the business.  During the financial modernization debate, the financial industry, along with Citigroup communicated to Congress that they would not be able to operate or function appropriately with an opt-in requirement. I find that very difficult to comprehend, seeing as Citibank signed an agreement with their German affiliates in 1995 affording German citizens the opportunity to tell Citibank ``no,'' they did not want their personal data shared with third parties. I have a copy of the contract to prove it.  Entitled, Agreement on ``Interterritorial Data Protection'' one can see this is an agreement on the sharing of customer information between Citibank (South Dakota), referred in the document as CNA, and its German affiliates. On page two paragraph 4, entitled, Use of Subcontractors, Transmission of Data to Third Parties, number 2 reads:       For marketing purposes, the transfer of personal data to      third parties provided by the Card Service Companies (that is      Citicorp of Germany and Citicorp Card Operations of Germany)      is prohibited, except in those cases where such personal data      is transferred to affiliated companies engaged in banking      business in order to market financial services; the transfer      of such data beyond the aforementioned scope to third      parties, shall require the Card Service Companies' express      approval. Such approval is limited to the scope of the Card      Customers' consent as obtained on the application form.  That ladies and gentlemen, is an opt-in to operate in Germany, by none other than Citigroup, the number one proponent of financial modernization. Now if they can offer financial privacy to individuals in Germany, why on God's green earth can't they agree to an opt-in here in America? Do Germans have special rights over Americans? I should hope not.  Mr. President, simply put, this bill is what Americans want. This bill is workable as proven in the Citicorp agreement. The truth is that the American people do not understand the intricacies of banking law or securities regulation. They probably do not know or care much about affiliates or operating subsidiaries. What I do know, is that if you walked outside and polled people from New York City to Los Angeles, CA, and everywhere in between, they would not only understand financial privacy, 90 percent of them would demand financial privacy and the ability to tell an institution ``no.''  Mr. President, in passing the financial modernization bill, Congress gave mammoth financial services companies significant expanded powers and unprecedented ability to collect, share, buy and sell a consumers nonpublic personal financial information. During the debate, many members promised they would address privacy, but only in a separate bill at a later time. Well, Mr. President, the time is now and the bill is the ``Consumer's Right to Financial Privacy Act.''  The financial industry may have won the battle by keeping stronger financial privacy provisions out of the financial modernization bill. But I assure you they have not won the war. They cannot win the war on financial privacy because the American people just won't allow it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement on ``International Data Protection'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             Agreement on Interterritorial Data Protection                             by and between     1. Citicorp Kartenservice GmbH, Wilhelm-Leuschner-Str. 32,            60329 Frankfurt/M, Germany (CKS)     2. Citicorp Card Operations GmbH, Bentheimer Strae            118, 48529 Nordhorn, Germany (CCO)       (CKS and CCO hereinafter collectively referred to as: Card      Service Companies)     3. Citibank (South Dakota), N.A., Attn.: Office of the            President, 701 E. 60th Street North, Sioux Falls, South            Dakota 57117 (CNA)     4. Citibank Privatkunden AG, Kasernenstrae 10, 40213            Dusseldorf, Germany (CIP)                                recital       1. CIP has unrestricted authority to engage in banking      transactions. As a license of VISA International, CIP issues      the Citibank Visa Card''. Additionally, since July 1st, 1995,      CIP has been cooperating with the Deutsche Bahn AG in issuing      the ``DB/Citibank BahnCard'' with a cash-free payment      function--hereinafter referred to as ``DB/Citibank-     BahnCard''--on the basis of a Co-Branding Agreement concluded      between Deutsche Bahn AG and CIP on November 18th, 1994.      After the conclusion of the Agreement, the co-branding      business was extended to include the issuance of the DB/     Citibank BahnCard without a cash-free payment function, known      as BahnCard ``pure''.       2. CIP transferred to CKS the operations of the Citibank      Visa credit card business, including accounting and      electronic data processing, on the basis of the terms of a      Service Agreement (non-gratuitous contract for services)      dated March 24, 1998, supplemented as of June 1, 1989 and      November 30, 1989. Details are contained in the ``CKS Service     Agreement'', according to which CKS performs for CIP all      services pertaining to the Citibank Visa card business.      Concurrent with the application for a Citibank Visa Card, the      Citibank Visa Card customers agree to the transfer of their      personal data to CKS and to those companies entrusted by CKS      with such data processing.       3. In the Co-Branding Agreement with the Deutsche Bahn AG      dated November 18, 1994, CIP assumed responsibility for the      issuance of the DB/Citibank BahnCard as well as for the      entire management and operations associated with this      business.       4. On the basis of a Service Agreement dated April 1, 1995,      CIP transferred the entire operations of the DB/Citibank-     BahnCard business, including data processing and accounting,      to the Card Service Companies. Details are contained in the      ``BahnCard Service Agreement''. Concurrent with the      application for issuing a DB/Citibank BahnCard, the BahnCard      customers agree to the transfer of their personal data to CCO      and to those companies entrusted by CCO with such data      processing.       5. Due to reasons of efficiency, service and      centralization, the Card Service Companies have entrusted CNA      with the processing of the Citibank Visa card business and of      the DB/Citibank BahnCard business as of July 1, 1995. In      light of such considerations, the Card Service Companies--as      principals--and CNA--as contractors--concluded the ``CNA      Service Agreement'', to which CIP expressly consented.       6. The performance of the CNA Service Agreement requires      the Card Service Companies to transfer the personal data of      the Citibank Visa card customers and the DB/Citibank BahnCard      customers--hereinafter collectively referred to as ``Card      Customers''--to CNA and further requires CNA to process and      use these data.       In order to protect the Card Customers' rights with respect      to both the data protection law, as well as the banking      secrecy, and in order to comply with the banking supervisory      and data protection requirements.       The contractual parties agree and covenant as follows:                        Sec. 1  Basic Principles       The parties hereto undertake to safeguard the Card      Customers' right to protection against unauthorized capture,      storage and use of their personal data and their right to      informational self-determination. The scope of such      protection shall be governed by the standards as laid down in      the German Federal Data Protection Law      (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz, abbreviated to ``BDSG''). The      parties hereto additionally agree to comply with the banking      secrecy regulations.           Sec. 2  instructions of the card service companies       1. CNA shall process the data provided by the Card Service      Companies solely in accordance with the Card Service      Companies' instructions and rules, and the provisions      contained in this Agreement. CNA undertakes to process and      use the data only for the purpose for which the data have      been provided by the Card Service Companies to CNA, said      purposes including those as described in the CNA Service      Agreement. The use of such data for purposes other than      described above requires the Card Service Companies' express      written consent.       2. At any time, the Card Service Companies may make      inquiries to CNA about the personal data transferred by the      Card Service Companies and stored at CNA, and the Card      Service Companies may require CNA to perform corrections,      deletions or blockings of such personal data transferred by      the Card Service Companies to CNA.        Sec. 3  inspection rights of the Card Service Companies       At regular intervals, an (joint) agent appointed by the      Card Service Companies shall verify whether CNA complies with      the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in particular      with the data protection law as well as the banking secrecy      regulations. CNA shall grant the Card Service Companies'      agent supervised unimpeded access to the extent necessary to      accomplish the inspection and review of all data processing      facilities, data files and other documentation needed for      processing and utilizing the personal data transferred by the      Card Service Companies in a fashion which is consistent with      the CNA Operational Policies. CNA shall provide the agent      with all such information as deemed necessary to perform this      inspection function.  Sec. 4  use of subcontractors, transmission of data to third parties       1. CNA may not appoint non-affiliated third parties, in      particular subcontractors, to perform and fulfill CNA's      commitments and obligations under this Agreement.       2. For marketing purposes, the transfer of personal data to      third parties provided by the Card Service Companies is      prohibited, except in those cases where such personal data is      transferred to affiliated companies engaged in the banking      business in order to market financial services; the transfer      of such data beyond the aforementioned scope to third parties      shall require the Card Service Companies' express approval.      Such approval is limited to the scope of the Card Customers'      consent as obtained on the application form. The personal      data of customers having obtained a BahnCard ``pure'' may      only be used or transferred for BahnCard marketing purposes.       CNA and the Card Service Companies undertake to institute      and maintain the following data protection measures:     1.

The requested information shall generally be provided in      writing.       2. The Card Service Companies shall honour the concerned      person's request to correct his personal data at any time,      provided that the stored data are incorrect. The same shall      apply to data stored at CNA.       3. The concerned person may claim from the responsible Card      Service Companies the deletion or blocking of any data stored      at the Card Service Companies or CNA, in the event that: such      storage is prohibited by law; the data in question relate to      information about health criminal actions, violations of the      public order, or religious or political opinions, and its      truth/correctness cannot be proved by the Card Service      Companies; and such data are processed to serve Card Service      Companies' own purposes, and such data are no longer      necessary to serve the purpose of the data storage under the      agreement with the respective Card Customers.       Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto submit to      the provisions of Sec. 35 of the German Federal Data      Protection Law (BDSG), and agree to be familiar with such      provisions.       4. The concerned person may demand that the responsible      Card Service Companies block his or her personal data, if he      or she contests the correct nature thereof and if it is not      possible to determine whether such data is correct or      incorrect. This shall also apply to such data stored by CNA.       5. If CIP. the Card Service Companies or CNA should violate      the data protection or banking secrecy regulations, the      person concerned shall be entitled to claim damages caused      and incurred thereby as provided in the German Federal Data      Protection Law (BDSG). CIP's and the Card Service Companies'      liability shall moreover extend to those claims arising from      breach of this Agreement and asserted against CNA and/or its      employees in performance of this Agreement.       6. CNA acknowledges the obligation assumed by CIP and the      Card Service Companies towards the concerned person, and      undertakes to comply with all Card Service Companies'      instructions concerning such person. The concerned person may      also directly assert claims against CNA and file an action at      CNA's applicable place of jurisdiction.              Sec. 9  Notification to the Concerned Person       The Card Service Companies undertake to appropriately      notify the concerned Card Customers of the transfer of their      data to CNA.                  Sec. 10  Data Protection Supervision       1. According to the German Federal Data Protection Law      (BDSG), the Card Service Companies and CIP are subject to      public control exercised by the respective responsible      supervisory authorities.       2. Upon request of CIP or either of the Card Service      Companies, CNA shall provide the respective supervisory      authorities with the desired information and grant them the      opportunity of auditing to the same extent as they would be      entitled to conduct audits at the Card Service Companies and      CIP; this includes the entitlement to inspections at CNA's      premises by the supervisory authorities or their nominated      agents, unless barred by binding instructions of the      appropriate U.S. authorities.                      Sec. 11  Banking Supervision       1. Any vouchers, commercial books of accounting, and work      instructions needed for the comprehension of such documents,      as well as other organizational documents shall physically      remain at the Card Service Companies, unless electronically      archived by scanning devices in a legally permissible      fashion.       2. The Card Service Companies and CNA undertake to adhere      to the principles of proper accounting practice applicable in      Germany for computer-aided processes and the auditing      thereof, in particular FAMA 1/1987.       3. The Card Service Companies undertake to submit a data      processing concept and a data security concept to the German      Federal Authority for the Supervision of Banks      (Bundesaufsichtsamt fur das Kreditwesen) prior to commencing      transfer of data to CNA.       4. The remote processing of the data shall be subject to      the internal audit department of CIP and the Card Service      Companies. CNA agrees to cooperate with the internal auditors      of CIP and the Card Service Companies, who shall have the      right to inspect the files of CNA's internal auditors,      insofar as they relate to the data files transferred by the      Card Service Companies to CNA. The internal auditors of the      Card Service Companies and of CIP shall conduct audits of CNA      as required by due diligence.       5. In a joint declaration to the Federal Banking      Supervisory Authority; CIP, the Card Service Companies and      CNA shall undertake to allow the inclusion of CNA in audits      in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 44 of the Banking      Law (Kreditwesengesetz abbreviated to KWG) at any time and      not to impede or obstruct such audits, provided that legal      requirements and/or instructions of U.S. authorities bind CNA      to the contrary.       6. CNA shall request the US banking supervisory      authorities' confirmation in writing to the effect that no      objections will be raised against the intended remote data      processing concept. In the event that CNA cannot procure such      written confirmation upon the Card Service Companies'      request, the Card Service Companies and CIP may withdraw from      this Agreement and the underlying CNA Service Agreement.       7. CIP, the Card Service Companies and CNA undertake to      abide by the requirements for interterritorial remote data      processing in bank accounting as set forth in the letter of      the Federal Authority for the Supervision of Banks dated      October 16, 1992. This letter is appended as a Schedule      hereto and forms an integral part of this Agreement.                     Sec. 12  Indemnification Claim       1. CNA shall indemnify the Card Service Companies within      the scope of their internal and contractual relationship from      any claims of damages asserted by the Card Customers, and      resulting from CNA's incompliance with the terms and      conditions of this Agreement.       2. The Card Service Companies shall indemnify CNA within      the scope of their internal and contractual relationship from      any claims of damages asserted by the Card Customer, and      resulting from one or both of the     Card Service Companies' incompliance with the terms and      conditions of this Agreement.                     Sec. 13  Term of the Agreement       1. This Agreement is effective as of July 1st, 1995, until      terminated. It may be terminated by any party hereto at the      end of each calendar year upon 12 months notice prior to the      expiration date, subject to each party's right of termination      of the Agreement for material, unremedied breach hereof. The      termination of this Agreement by any one of the parties shall      result in the termination of the entire Agreement with      respect to the other parties.       2. CNA commits to return and delete all personal data      stored at the time of termination hereof in accordance with      the Card Service Companies' instructions.                        Sec. 14  Confidentiality       The parties hereto commit to treat strictly confidential      any trade, business and operating secrets or other sensitive      information of the other parties involved. This obligation      shall survive termination of this Agreement.    Sec. 15  Data protection Agreement with Deutsche Bahn AG (DB AG)       1. The Deutsche Bahn AG captures personal data at its      counters and appears as a joint issuer of the DB/Citibank      BahnCard. The parties hereto agree that the Deutsche Bahn AG      therefore bears responsibility for such data.       2. The Deutsche Bahn AG and CIP concluded a Data Protection      Agreement as of February 13, 1996, defining the scope of data      protection obligations and commitments between the parties.      The parties hereto are familiar with said Data Protection      Agreement and acknowledge the obligations arising for CIP      thereunder.       3. The parties hereto authorize CIP to provide DB AG with      written notification of this Agreement on Interterritorial      Data Protection.                      Sec. 16  General Provisions       1. This Agreement sets forth the entire understanding      between the parties hereto in conjunction with the subject      matter as laid down herein and none of the parties hereto has      entered into this Agreement in reliance upon any      representation, warranty or undertaking of any other party      which is not contained in this Agreement or incorporated by      reference herein. Any subsequent amendments to this Agreement      shall be in writing duly signed by authorized representatives      of the parties hereto.       2. If one or more provisions of this Agreement becomes      invalid, or the Agreement is proven to be incomplete, the      validity and legality of the remaining provisions hereof      shall not be affected or impaired thereby. The parties hereto      agree to substitute the invalid part of this Agreement by      such a legally valid provision which constitutes the closest      representation of the parties' intention and the economical      purpose of the invalid term, and the parties hereto further      agree to be bound by such a valid term. An incompleteness of      this Agreement shall be bridged in a similar fashion.       3. The Parties hereto submit to the jurisdiction and venue      of the courts of Frankfurt/M.       4. This Agreement shall be governed by, interpreted and      construed in accordance with German law.       What are the main features of the International Agreement?       1. The parties on both sides of the Atlantic agree to apply      German Data Protectional Law to their handling of      cardholders' data (Sec. 1).       2. Customer data may only be processed in the United States      for the purpose of producing the cards (Sec. 2).       3. Citibank in the United States and in Europe is not      allowed to transfer personal data to third parties for      marketing purposes except in two cases:       (a) Data of applicants for a RailwayCard with payment      function may be transferred to other Citibank companies in      order to market financial services; (b) Data of applicants      for a pure RailwayCard may only be used or transferred for      BahnCard marketing purposes, i.e., to try to convince the      cardholder that he should upgrade his RailwayCard to have a      ``better BahnCard'' with credit card function (Sec. 4 II).       4. The technical requirements on data security according to      German law are spelt out in detail in Sec. 5.       5. The American Citibank subsidiary has to appoint data      protection supervisors again following the German legal      requirements (Sec. 6).       6. The German card customers have all individual rights      against the American Citibank subsidiary which they have      under German law. They can ask for inspection, claim      deletion, correction or blocking of their data and they can      bring an action for compensation under the strict liability      rules of German law either against German Railway, the German      Citibank subsidiary or directly against the American Citibank      subsidiary (Sec. 8).       7. The Citibank subsidiaries in the United States accept      on-site audits by the German data protection supervisory      authority, i.e., the Berlin Data Protection Commissioner, or      his nominated agents, e.g. an American consulting or auditing      firm acting on his behalf (Sec. 10 II).       This very important provision contains a restriction in      case US authorities instruct Citibank in their country not to      allow foreign auditors in. However, this restriction is not      very likely to become practical. On the contrary, US      authorities have already declared by way of a diplomatic note      sent to the German side that they will accept these audits.      This follows an agreement between German and United States      banking supervisory authorities on auditing the trans-border      processing of accounting data (cf. Sec. 11). Indeed this      previous agreement very much facilitated the acceptance of      German data protection audits by Citibank in the United      States. As far as data security concepts are concerned the      Federal Banking Supervisory Authority and the Berlin Data      Protection Commissioner will be working hand in glove.       8. Finally--and this is not reproduced in the version of      the Agreement which you have received--German Railway has      been linked to this agreement between Citibank subsidiaries      in a specific provision.                                 ______                                       By
