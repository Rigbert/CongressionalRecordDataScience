Two exceptional teams from Munster High School, Team Adams and Team Jefferson, accomplished the extraordinary feat of finishing in first and second place, respectively, in the State competition of the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution program. Following their victory at the State level, Team Adams went on to compete in the national finals held in Washington, DC, from May 3-May 5, 2008. For their knowledge and understanding of the American Government, these extraordinary young people received an honorable mention as one of the top ten finalists at this year's national competition.  The We the People program, administered by the Center for Civic Education, is a program that reaches over 28 million elementary, middle, and high school students. The goal of the program is to provide students with an understanding of the fundamentals of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The program helps students to understand their rights under the American governmental system.  The people of Munster, as well as the entire northwest Indiana community, can be proud of this truly remarkable class of students. Team Adams consisted of the following students: James Burgwald, Sarah Chowdhury, Sophia Griggs, Nicole Hong, Megan Hruska, Grant Huebner, Daniel Jayakar, Robin Jiang, Neil Keshvani, Charlie Krull, Alicia Nieves, Paige Patterson, Blake Platt, Michael Pudlow, Matt Stewart, Nicholas Stoffregen, and Julianne Watterson. Team Jefferson was comprised of: Danny Alexander, Eric Anderson, Keriann Ballanco, Katharine Banks, Arefin Chowdhury, Lorien Estes, Amy Fuhs, Carly Gibbs, Russell Gonzalez, Jonathan Harangody, Jessica Hilbrich, Nithin Krishnan, Viraj Maniar, Samantha Mardyla, Martha Mihich, Lana Muhrez, Molly Poczontek, Abhinav Ravi, Christopher Witter, and Meagan Yothment.  Madam Speaker, I would like to once again extend my most heartfelt congratulations to the members of Munster High School's We the People program, as well as their coach, Mr. Michael Gordon, and all of the community and faculty members who have instilled in these students the desire to succeed. The values exhibited by these young people and their interest in the history and fundamentals of our great Nation serve to inspire us all. I am proud to represent these fine individuals in Congress, and I am proud to have been given this opportunity to recognize these future leaders. I look forward to watching their achievements as they continue to rise to the top.                          ____________________
