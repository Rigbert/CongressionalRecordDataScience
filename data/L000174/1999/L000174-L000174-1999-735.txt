President, I was delighted to see that the Villa Tragara in Waterbury Center, Vermont has been awarded the ``Emblem of Excellence'' in Italian Cuisine.  I am not the least bit surprised. My wife and I enjoy going to this restaurant more than any other. The owners, Tony and Patricia DiRuocco are special friends of ours and have brought the highest of culinary excellence to our state of Vermont. I count among my most enjoyable experiences meals in their superb restaurant and I wanted the rest of the country to have notice of this great honor.  I ask that the article from our local newspaper, The Times Argus, be printed in the Record.  The article follows:                    [The Times Argus, April 8, 1999]          Villa Tragara Honored By Italian Academy, Government       WATERBURY CENTER--The Villa Tragara Ristorante of Waterbury      Center has been awarded ``Insegna Del Ristorante Italiano''      meaning ``The Emblem of Excellence'' in Italian Cuisine.       The award has been presented by the prestigious Italian      Academy of Cuisine, located in Rome.
