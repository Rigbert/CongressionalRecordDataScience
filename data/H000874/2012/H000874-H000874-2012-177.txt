Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The second bill, which we considered yesterday, would impose a radical policy on our border areas that would undermine security coordination and bring polluting industries to some of our most pristine parks and historic sites, even though our border enforcement officials have said such legislation is unnecessary. That's what we worked on yesterday. Not jobs, not student loans, not transportation, but a piece of legislation that they said wasn't necessary.  These are not what Congress ought to be focusing on this week or next week. Let's turn our attention to our most pressing issues--student loans, construction jobs, keeping middle class taxes low, and reducing deficits--instead of wasting the American people's time on partisan bills that won't solve any of our real problems.  Mr. Chairman, I'm hopeful that either in the next 24 hours or in the next 9 days we will, in fact, pass a jobs bill that will create jobs, and everybody knows that that's the highway bill.  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has again expired.
