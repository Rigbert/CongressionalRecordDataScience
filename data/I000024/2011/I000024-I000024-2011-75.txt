President, just one comment on the subject at hand, and then I want to talk about something completely different that is very significant happening today.  I listened to the Senator from New Jersey down here. He kept talking about only in Washington what can happen, only in Washington. Yet never was anything said about cutting spending. It was all about passing tax increases, and that is what we will be faced with tomorrow.  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 1335 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Colorado.
