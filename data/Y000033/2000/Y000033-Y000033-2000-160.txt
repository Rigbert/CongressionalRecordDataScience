Mr. Speaker, the purpose of this legislation is to convey to the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community (SRPMIC) the ownership of the irrigation works composed primarily of ditches, laterals, sump ponds and several wells on Reservation lands formerly operated by the Bureau of Indiana Affairs. Because the irrigation works is entirely on Reservation land and because the operational control of the irrigation works was transferred to the SRPMIC in 1997, this proposed legislative conveyance is anticipated to be a relatively straight-forward administrative transfer that should be carried out in keeping with the underlying goals of Indian self-determination, self-governance and economic self-sufficiency.  As early as August 1993, the SRPMIC held discussions in the Community concerning the potential transfer of the irrigation works. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), the Salt River Agency (the local BIA office), and the Branch of Land Operations and P.L. 93-638 Contract administration met at that time to explore this conveyance.  According to the Community, these consultations resulted in efforts by the SRPMIC toward assuming management and operation of the irrigation delivery system by: (1) its approval of SRPMIC Ordinance No. 199-95 Surface Water management (Ordinance) approved on May 3, 1995; (2) the partial completion of P.L. 93-368 Contract No. CTH55T61517--Water Resources Program (Contract) awarded on August 10, 1993 through the final submission in August 1995 by SFC Engineering Co. report titled ``Irrigation System Evaluation and Rehabilitation Study for Lands South of the Arizona Canal,'' (3) the request by the SRPMIC for financial records of the project; (4) the establishment of monthly meetings between the SRPMIC and the Salt River Agency and its Branch of Land Operations to review the status, coordinate activities and share information; (5) the origination by SRPMIC of a report entitled ``SRPMIC Irrigation Project--Transfer of Operation and Maintenance from the BIA to the SRPMIC Community'' dated January 10, 1996.  The irrigation works over the past 20 years or so unfortunately did not receive sufficient funding. As a result, the project facilities deteriorated, and if this deterioration were allowed to continue, the allotted landowners would receive less rent for a less efficient system. Even while the BIA operated the project, it was the Community which obtained non-BIA funds to line the main Evergreen Canal and some lateral mileage. Also, the Community is in the midst of a refurbishment program at a cost up to approximately $1.25 million over five years from the USDA/EQIP program. The cost to the Community above and beyond the amount collected currently from water users is approximately $200,000 per year. The original construction costs carried by the BIA are $3,313,192, which have long since been amortized to zero since the project dates back 84 years to 1916. It is important to note that the Pima people and their ancestors used gravity-fed irrigation for hundreds of years prior to federal involvement.  Today, the Irrigation Works employees are no longer BIA employees as they were prior to 1997. They are employees of the Community. The equipment and buildings that were used in BIA's operation were transferred from the BIA to SRPMIC which now provides irrigation services for landowners and water users.  The SRPMIC Water Resources Division manages this Irrigation Works Project. Based upon testimony from the Community, the irrigation system is managed with a staff of 12 full time employees including a division manager, an engineer, an agricultural engineer and other irrigation staff. It operates under a budget based on incoming water sales. About 8,000 acres of farmland are irrigated with the following system: (1) Evergreen Canal (main canal) 4.5 miles with 6 main check structures and 16 primary headgates; (2) 23.5 miles of lateral pipelines with 15 miles of lateral canals and 25 canal turnout structures; (3) 44 miles of drainage channels with service roads; (4) 12 irrigation wells (only 4 are useable); (5) 2 storage reservoirs and 2 sump ponds with 3 capable of pumping.  Since June 1999, the SRPMIC and its representatives have had numerous discussions, consultations and negotiations with the Department of the Interior to reach a common understanding and agreement on legislative language to transfer the ownership of the irrigation works to the SRPMIC, as well as any remaining authority and responsibility that the Secretary has regarding the administration of such works, except for the Secretary's trust responsibilities.  H.R. 2820 with the proposed amended text changes to be considered by the House fairly balances the interests of the Department of the Interior and the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community.  The SRPMIC Water Code provides a detailed method of distributing and using this limited and sometimes scarce resource. Combined with the irrigation regulations and assessment schedule adopted by the SRPMIC tribal council, they appear to provide for fair treatment, equitable allocation and sensitive use of this important resource.  The Community contends that the rights of allotted landowners will be enhanced by the operation of the system by the SRPMIC. And, while it appears that is the case, the legislation includes ample safeguards to help insure that allottee rights are protected.  The SRPMIC has been operating the irrigation works project for nearly three years. By doing so, as well as by its operating other businesses, it has demonstrated its ability to manage and operate the system. Its reputation is one that instills confidence that the Community is clearly capable of operating, and is expected to operate, the irrigation works efficiently, effectively, and equitably.  For the Community to operate this former BIA project and make it relevant in this millennium, the SRPMIC should have fullresponsibility and ownership of the irrigation works. The United States trust responsibility will continue unimpaired to the SRPMIC, to individual Indians, and to Indian allottees, as provided for in the legislation even as the Community assumes full ownership of and operations for the irrigation works.  In furtherance of the United States policies of self-governance, self-determination and economic self-sufficiency with respect to American Indians, H.R. 2820, as amended, should be passed by the Congress of the United States and sent to the President, who is expected to sign the bill into law based upon the attached Departmental letter report supporting the bill.                              bill summary       Section 1. Findings. The findings section sets forth the      underlying considerations that are the backdrop for the      enactment of this legislation. At its core, the bill      recognizes the federal policies of Indian self-determination,      economic self-sufficiency and self-governance and that the      conveyance of the irrigation works is in furtherance of those      policies. The findings also recognize and adhere to the trust      responsibilities of the United States to Indian tribes. They      recognize that the irrigation works are primarily a system of      canals, ditches, wells, storage reservoirs and sump ponds on      Reservation land. They convey too that, considering the      community has been operating the works since 1997, the      conveyance is viewed by Congress as an administrative action.      The findings take cognizance of the fact that the Community's      amended Water Code is currently in compliance with Section      2b. of the legislation.       Section 2. Conveyance and Operation of Irrigation Works.      (a) Conveyance: The Secretary is directed to convey the      irrigation works to the Community in accordance with the      legislation and other applicable law. The intent of this      provision is to ensure that, while applicable law is to be      fully adhered to, it is contemplated that the process      involved should be a straightforward, relatively      uncomplicated, and inexpensive administrative procedure. This      is especially so given the nature of the facilities being      conveyed and that the Community has been operating the      irrigation works for the past three years.       The bill language provides for the Community to continue as      it is doing currently and retaining and expending operations      and maintenance collections to be used for irrigation works      purposes. Once the conveyance takes place, the bill language      recognizes that the Community will then have full ownership      of and operating authority over the irrigation works as      provided in the bill.       (b) Fulfillment of Federal Trust Responsibilities: A key      provision of this legislation provides a balance between the      need of the Community to be able to operate the irrigation      works during the year 2000 and beyond and the need of the      United States to be able to fulfill its trust      responsibilities to Indian tribes, individual Indians and      Indians with trust allotments. The language seeks to      accomplish this by requiring that the Community's laws and      regulations regarding management, regulation and control of      water resources on the Reservation contain certain basic      requirements and standards. The Community has currently      brought its Water Code into compliance with the requirements      and standards contained in the legislation (that amended      Water Code is, and will be, on file with the Committee on      Resources and the U.S. Department of the Interior). The two      key requirements and standards are as follows:       (1) This paragraph requires that a process continue to be      included in the Community's laws and regulations to provide      members of the Community, including allottees, a water system      that, in turn, will provide a just and equitable distribution      of water to achieve the goals of maximum beneficial use and      conservation of water, while factoring in such considerations      as the demand on the water resource, land use changes, and      the varying quantity of water available to the Community.       (2) This paragraph requires that a due process system      continue to be included in the Community's laws and      regulations to ensure the consideration and determination of      a request from an Indian or Indian allottee for distribution      of water for use on his or her land. It also requires that      such laws and regulations continue to be provided through an      appellate process, including a means for adjudicating denied      or disputed distributions of water and resolution of      contested administrative decisions.       (c) Subsequent Modification of Laws and Regulations: The      bill seeks to ensure that if the Community needs to or seeks      to amend its laws and regulations after the legislation is      enacted, there be a process by which that should be carried      out. That process would involve generally a notice and wait      procedure. The community would publish the proposed changes,      and make them available to the Secretary at least 120 days      before the effective date of the changes. The process also      requires that, if a proposed change could ``significantly      adversely affect'' the rights of allottees, then it would      take the concurrence of both the Community and the Secretary      in order for such changes to become effective. Although it is      not expected that the community will need to amend its Code      as it pertains to this subsection, it may. It is expected,      however, that the Secretary will not seek to utilize this      provision unless there were to be, indeed, a proposed change      to the Community's Water Code that could significantly      adversely affect allottee rights.       (d) Limitations on Liability: This subsection provides that      the united States is not liable for damages based on the      Community's ownership and operation of the irrigation works      except for those damages caused by acts of negligence by the      United States before the date of enactment. Also, the      subsection makes clear that nothing in the subsection should      be construed to increase the liability of the United States      beyond what is provided in the Federal Tort Claims Act.       (e) Cancellation of charges: As has been the case in      similar, although not identical, legislation in the past, as      of the conveyance date, the charges for construction for the      irrigation works deferred under 25 USC 386 are canceled. This      is also, in part, in recognition that this project is      comprised of deteriorating laterals, ditches, sump ponds,      reservoirs and a few wells, some of which do not work      currently, and some of the ditches are not even lined. The      irrigation works is an aging gravity-fed system. It dates      back to the early 1900s. In recent years the Community has      contributed funds (as opposed to appropriated funds), that      have been devoted to the refurbishment of the works. The      construction funds committed to the project by the United      States have long ago been more than amortized. By the      Community assuming full responsibilities for the works, it is      recognized that the United States is taking the next logical      step to complete the process begun several years ago which      resulted in 1997 with the transfer of operational management      to the Community. If the United States were not to take this      next step, the Community has indicated that it would be      compelled to seek retroceding the irrigation works to the      United States at significant costs to the United States. In      such an eventuality, the U.S. would need to assign Bureau of      Indian Affair employees to operate the works and commit      federal funds to the works' refurbishment.       (f) Project No Longer a BIA Project: The legislation      provides that, once the conveyance has occurred, the      irrigation works will not be eligible for federal benefits      ``based solely on the fact that the irrigation works were      formerly'' a BIA irrigation project. It also recognizes      though that the legislation is not to be interpreted to limit      or reduce in any way funds the Community may be eligible to      receive under other federal law.       Section 3. Relationship to Other Laws: This section makes      clear that the provisions of this legislation are not to be      construed to ``diminish the trust responsibility of the      United States'' to the Community, to individual Indians or to      Indian allottees within the Reservation.       Enclosures: (1) Section-by-Section analysis; (2)      Departmental Report on H.R. 2820: Letter from Hon. David J.      Hayes, Deputy Secretary, U.S. Department of the Interior to      Chairman Don Young, Committee on Resources; (3) Resolution of      Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community Tribal Council.                      section-by-section analysis       Section 1. Findings. This section expresses the findings of      the Congress that--in light of a number of considerations,      including that, in fulfillment of federal trust      responsibility to Indian tribes, it is the policy of the      United States to promote Indian self-determination and      economic self-sufficiency--it is appropriate that the U.S.      convey to the Community the irrigation works.       Section 2. Conveyance and Operation of Irrigation Works.       (a) Conveyance. This subsection authorizes and directs the      Secretary to convey to the Community all rights and interests      of the U.S. to the irrigation works. It further provides the      authority for the Community to continue operating the      irrigation works during the period from the date of enactment      until the conveyance in accordance with this Act and 25 USC      Sec. 450, including retaining and expending operations and      maintenance collections for irrigation works purposes.       (b) Fulfillment of Federal Indian Trust Responsibilities.      This subsection provides that to assure compliance with      federal trust responsibilities, the Community will operate      the irrigation works under this Act and the Community's laws      and regulations to assure fairness in the delivery of water      to water users. It provides that the Community laws and      regulations must continue to include--       (1) A process in which all members of the Community are      provided a system of distribution, allocation, control,      pricing and regulation of water that will in turn, provide a      just and equitable distribution of water to attain the      maximum use and conservation of water; and       (2) A due process system to deal with requests by Indians      and Indian allottees for distribution of water.       (c) Subsequent Modification of Laws and Regulations. This      subsection provides that, if the Community's laws and      regulations are modified after the date of enactment of this      Act, the proposed modifications will be published and made      available to the Secretary before the effective date of those      laws and regulations. Additionally, the subsection requires      that the Community and the Secretary concur in any proposed      changes that could significantly adversely affect the rights      of allottees.       (d) Limitations of Liability. This subsection sets forth      the limits on the liability of the United States for damages      from the Community's ownership and operation of the      irrigation works.       (e) Cancellation of Charges. This subsection provides for      the cancellation of certain charges deferred under 25 USC      Sec. 386(a) for construction of the irrigation works.       (f) Project No Longer BIA Project. This subsection provides      that, after conveyance, the irrigation works will no longer      be a Bureau of Indian Affairs project and therefore not      eligible for federal benefits based only on its status as a      former BIA project.       Section 3. Relationship to Other Laws. This section ensures      that nothing in this Act diminishes the federal Indian Trust      Responsibility on the Community's Reservation.                                              The Deputy Secretary                                              of the Interior,                               Washington, DC, September 20, 2000.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Resources Committee,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: This letter sets forth the views of the      Department of the Interior on H.R. 2820, to provide for the      ownership and operation of the irrigation works on the Salt      River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community's reservation in      Maricopa County, Arizona, by the Salt River Pima-Maricopa      Indian Community. We understand that the Salt River Pima      Maricopa Indian Community (Community) will request that the      attached bill be introduced as a substitute for H.R. 2820.       The Department intends to support the attached substitute      bill which represents a compromise reached between the      Department and the Community with respect to original      provisions of H.R. 2820 that were objectionable to the      Department. Our support is contingent on the enactment by the      Community of the attached amendments to its water code that      will bring the code into compliance with the provisions of      the substitute bill. We understand that the Community intends      to enact these amendments to its water code before or shortly      after the substitute bill is introduced. We recommend that      action on the bill await assurances that the necessary      changes to the Community water code have been made.       Finally, the Department suggests Section 2(d) of the      substitute bill be amended by removing ``employees, agents,      or contractors'' from the clause.       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there      is no objection to the presentation of this report from the      standpoint of the Administration's program.           Sincerely,                                                   David J. Hayes.       Enclosures.                               Resolution       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has under      consideration the passage of H.R. 2820 to convey to the Salt      River Pima Maricopa Indian Community (``Community'') the      irrigation works formerly owned and operated by the Bureau of      Indian Affairs and located on Community tribal and allottee      land; and       Whereas, as a result of negotiations that led to the      development of H.R. 2820, and amendments thereto, the      legislation's language contemplates that the Community will      adopt certain amendments to its Surface Water Management Code      prior to enactment of the legislation: Now, Therefore be it       Resolved, That the Community hereby adopts the attached      amendments to this Surface Water Management Code; and be it       Resolved further, That such amendments are to become      effective immediately;       Resolved further, That, if substitute legislation for H.R.      2820 (1) is not passed by the Congress prior to the      adjournment sine die of the 106th Congress, or (2) if so      passed by Congress, but is not signed into law during the      106th Congress, the approval by the Community of these      amendments shall become null and void.       (i) in light of the foregoing and in order to--       (1) promote Indian self-determination, economic self-     sufficiency, and self-governance;       (2) enable the Community in its development of a diverse,      efficient reservation economy; and       (3) enable the Community to better serve the water needs of      the water users within the Community,     it is appropriate in this instance that the United States      convey to the Community the ownership of the irrigation      works.     SEC 2. CONVEYANCE AND OPERATION OF IRRIGATION WORKS       (a) Conveyance.--The Secretary, as soon as is practicable      after the date of enactment of this Act, and in accordance      with the provisions of this Act and all other applicable law,      shall convey to the Community any or all rights and interests      of the United States in and to the irrigation works on the      Community's Reservation which were formerly operated by the      Bureau of Indian Affairs. Notwithstanding the provisions of      25 U.S.C. Sec. 385, 385a., 385b., and 385c, and any      implementing regulations, during the period between the date      of the enactment of this Act and the conveyance of the      irrigation works by the United States to the Community, the      Community shall operate the irrigation works under the      provisions set forth in this Act and in accordance with the      Indian Self Determination and Education Assistance Act (25      U.S.C. Sec. 450 et seq.), including retaining and expending      operations and maintenance collections for irrigation works      purposes. Effective upon the date of conveyance of the      irrigation works, the Community shall have the full ownership      of and operating authority over the irrigation works in      accordance with the provisions of this Act.       (b) Fullfillment of Federal Trust Responsibilities.--To      assure compliance with the federal upon the concurrence of      both the Community and the Secretary.       (d) Limitations of Liability.--Effective upon the date of      enactment of this Act, the United States shall not be liable      for damages of any kind arising out of any act, omission, or      occurrence based on the Community's ownership or operation of      the irrigation works, except for damages caused by acts of      negligence committed by the United States prior to the date      of enactment of this Act. Nothing in this section shall be      deemed to increase the liability of the United States beyond      that currently provided in the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28      U.S.C. Sec. 2671 et seq.       (e) Cancellation of Charges.--Effective upon the date of      conveyance of the irrigation works on the Reservation of the      Community that have been deferred pursuant to 25 U.S.C.      Sec. 386a are hereby canceled.       (f) Project No Longer A BIA Project.--Effective upon the      date of conveyance of the irrigation works under this      section, the irrigation works shall no longer be considered a      Bureau of Indian Affairs irrigation project and the      facilities will not be eligible for federal benefits based      solely on the fact that the irrigation works were formerly a      Bureau of Indian Affairs irrigation project. Nothing in this      Act shall be construed to limit or reduce in any way the      service, contracts, or funds the Community may be eligible to      receive under other applicable federal law.     SEC 3. RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER LAWS       Nothing in this Act shall be construed to diminish the      trust responsibility of the United States under applicable      law to the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community, to      individual Indians, or to Indians with trust allotments      within the Community's Reservation.                              {time}  2000
