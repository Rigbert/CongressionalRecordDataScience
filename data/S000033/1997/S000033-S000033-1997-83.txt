 Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I will be brief and just make a couple of points. First, allegations have been made about improper behavior. Those allegations should be followed up. If people acted improperly, we should deal with them in accordance with the law. And I do not think that there is anybody who disagrees with that. And when somebody on the other side says, we do not care, that is wrong.  On the contrary, because we believe in these programs, we demand that they be administered properly. We do care, and we wanted to know about any illegalities, and we will work with anybody to address those problems. It is of concern that, as far as I understand it, the ranking member of that committee was not officially informed about these problems, and that does not suggest to me a nonpartisan way to address them. That is point No. 1.  Point No. 2 is, there is an enormous need for capital in low-income communities. And the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Frank] made a point a moment ago that needs repeating. I brought forth an amendment to cut funding for the intelligence communities after I learned that the National Reconnaissance Office had ``lost $4 billion.'' We were not successful in lowering funding for the intelligence agencies.  Time after time, cost overruns occur in the military; and through defense contractors, they continue to get increases in their programs. What we are saying is, we have a program here where the need is desperate. Low-income communities in Vermont and throughout this country need the capital to help small businesses and other institutions.  If people have acted improperly who are in the administration of that program, deal with that. But do not kill or paralyze the program because of the misdeeds of those people.
