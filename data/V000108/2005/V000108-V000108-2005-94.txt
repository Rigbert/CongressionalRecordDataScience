Speaker, it is with great pride that I recognize Mr. Carl ``Bronko'' Stankovic, a proud World War II veteran, and the men of the Eighth Armored Division Association. Bronko is also a dear friend of mine.  Bronko has recently brought to my attention an inspirational poem written by A. Lawerence Vaincourt, a newspaper columnist and Canadian World War II veteran himself, in 1987. This poem speaks powerfully about the aging of our heroes. The emotions it represents rings true with Bronko and many other veterans that this poem has touched in its years of existence.  It is with great pride that I submit an excerpt of the poem, Just a Common Soldier, as a tribute to the memory of all our World War II veterans:                         Just A Common Soldier                         (A Soldier Died Today)                       (By A. Lawrence Vaincourt)     He was getting old and paunchy and his hair was falling fast,     And he sat around the Legion, telling stories of the past.     Of a war that he had fought in and the deeds that he had            done,     In his exploits with his buddies; they were heroes, every            one.     And tho' sometimes, to his neighbors, his tales became a            joke,     All his Legion buddies listened, for they knew whereof he            spoke.     But we'll hear his tales no longer for old Bill has passed            away,     And the world's a little poorer, for a soldier died today.     He was just a common soldier and his ranks are growing thin,     But his presence should remind us we may need his like again.     For when countries are in conflict, then we find the            soldier's part     Is to clean up all the troubles that others often start.     If we cannot do him honor while he's here to hear the praise,     Then at least let's give him homage at the ending of his            days.     Perhaps just a simple headline in a paper that would say,     Our Country is in mourning, for a soldier died today.  Mr. Speaker, I hope this poem inspires my distinguished colleagues as it has inspired me. The Greatest Generation has given so much to younger generations that I am happy to give something back by submitting this poem to the House of Representatives. I would ask my colleagues to join me in honoring World War II veterans with a moment of silence.                          ____________________
