Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  I would like to make sure having assurance from my colleague from California that our vote on the issue of Karnal bunt will not be used against us by the Family Values Coalition?  I ask the gentleman in all seriousness whether or not the wheat growers who were affected by this quarantine have any protection from crop insurance for these losses?
