Speaker, as we all know, we launched this bipartisan effort about a year and a half ago, and with tomorrow's House vote, we mark a very important milestone in our quest for 21st century cures, one step closer to the finish line.  There have been so many individuals throughout our 18-month journey who have helped us get to where we are today: patients across the country, advocates, researchers, innovators, experts, academics, regulators, some of the Nation's brightest minds, even Nobel Prize winners. To all, we say thank you.  Thank you, too, to the hard-working staff, again, on both sides of the aisle, who took the meetings, who did the research, who drafted the language, and who sat at the negotiating table for countless hours to help us develop this incredible product: Gary, Joan, Alexa, Clay, Paul, Josh, Robert, John, Carly, Katie, Adrianna, Graham, Sean, Noelle, Macey, Mark, Tom, Bits, Marty, Tim, Jeff, and Tiffany.  And to the Democratic staff, the staff of our Members, thank you all.  Thanks to the House legislative counsel and the CBO for your efforts and dedication in working through many, many weekends.  Thank you to the Members of both parties, who really did bring their best ideas, who partnered with one another to make their cases, and who delivered so many of the policies that we welcome today because we listened.  I also want to thank Chairman Hal Rogers and his staff. The Appropriations Committee has been a critical partner in this effort for the last number of months, working with us and developing the right approach to achieve our shared goal of helping patients in a fiscally responsible way.  I especially want to highlight my partner, Diana DeGette, in her effort from day one. She came to my district in Michigan, and I have traveled to Colorado. We have been on a number of road trips for Cures across the country, and I look forward to the next journey down Pennsylvania Avenue.  I also want to thank Chairman Pitts, Mr. Pallone, and Mr. Green for their really strong partnership. We have made great strides, but our work continues, and we are not going to stop until the ink is dry.  I thank Chairman Pete Sessions, Dr. Burgess, and members of the Rules Committee for making sure that this legislation has gotten to the floor in a timely fashion.  I also want to give a hearty thanks to a young boy named Max, the 6-year-old ambassador for Cures. Yes, although he is faced with the challenges of Noonan syndrome, he has been a little warrior in that effort.  He joined us when we had a 51-0 vote back on May 21 in the committee, and I am delighted that Max will be by our side tomorrow on the House floor for its final passage.  Helping Max and others like him is why we are here, and helping my friends Brooke and Brielle, which will be part of my general debate discussion, is why we are here.  With a resounding vote tomorrow, we will send a signal to the Senate loud and clear that the time for Cures 2015 is now.  I look forward to working with my Senate counterparts on both sides of the aisle to continue the momentum of getting this bill to the President's desk. We have a chance to do something big, and this is our time.                              {time}  1515  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to close.  Mr. Speaker, the 21st Century Cures bill is a good bill. I want to thank Mr. Upton and Ms. DeGette for working in a bipartisan way to come up with this product. It invests in NIH. It invests in lifesaving medical research. It makes it more possible that we will find cures to diseases like cancers and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, diabetes, HIV, and so many other terrible diseases that afflict so many of our fellow citizens.  This is important stuff. Who knows, maybe we will even find a cure to the disease that resulted in so many in this House voting for the destructive sequestration initiative that, by the way, cut medical research and put off the day of some of these lifesaving cures. We need to do better than this, but this is an important start, an important step in the right direction, and I hope that my colleagues in a bipartisan way will support it.  Secondly, as I mentioned before, I want to urge my colleagues to vote against the previous question.  I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment I would offer in the Record if we defeat the previous question, Mr. Speaker.
