President, Maine is home to strong communities and compassionate citizens. Nowhere are those qualities more evident than in our State's commitment to end the scourge of homelessness.  This effort has taken a significant step forward through the establishment of a single continuum of care for the State of Maine. The merger of the Portland Continuum of Care and the Maine Balance of State Continuum of Care will better enable local service providers, the statewide homeless council, and State and Federal agencies to address homelessness throughout Maine while accommodating specific local needs. This consolidation began in 2012 with the merger of the Bangor/Greater Penobscot Continuum with the Maine Balance of State Continuum of Care. I particularly commend the Maine State Housing Authority for its leadership during this process.  Maine's unified continuum of care will create greater efficiencies in the use of Federal funding under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987, the first major national response to homelessness. As chairman of the Housing Appropriations Subcommittee, I am confident that this unification will enhance the ability of Maine's service providers to help guide Federal policies and programs that assist low-income Americans, families with children, young people, seniors, and our veterans in obtaining safe shelter and affordable housing.  With a 9-percent reduction in homelessness from fiscal year 2016 to 2017, Maine is making great progress in aiding our most vulnerable citizens. The creation of a unified continuum of care will accelerate this progress, and I congratulate all who made it possible.
