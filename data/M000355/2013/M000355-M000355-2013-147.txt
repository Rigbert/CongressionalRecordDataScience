 President, I congratulate our good friend from South Carolina on his maiden speech and the opportunity, obviously, to learn more about his inspirational early life and the bilingual nature of his beginning and the way he interpreted those lessons both from his mother and from his mentor into the extraordinary success he has had both in the private sector and the public sector. I wish to say, on behalf of my colleagues, it is an honor to serve with him.
