 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Donald and Anne Pavel of Shelton, WA, in celebration of their 50th wedding anniversary on January 31, 2002.  Mr. and Mrs. Pavel are life-long residents of Shelton. Mr. Pavel graduated from Shelton High School and went on to a 20-year career in the U.S. Air Force, which included decorated service during the Korean conflict. In 1969, he retired from the Air Force as a Master Sergeant. Following his service to this country, Mr. Pavel started his own successful dump truck business, Pavel Trucking. His company worked on many major projects in Washington State, including the ``Loop'' around the Olympic Peninsula. Mr. Pavel operated Pavel Trucking until his retirement.  Mrs. Pavel also graduated from Shelton High School and then received her nursing degree from St. Joseph's Hospital in Tacoma, WA. In addition to raising her family and pursuing her nursing career, Mrs. Pavel, a member of the Skokomish Tribe, was active in tribal politics. She was the Skokomish Tribe's first Judge and served as Chairwoman and General Counsel President of the Tribe for a number of years. Mrs. Pavel also served as the Tribe's first Health Director, overseeing the first dental and health clinics on the reservation.  Mr. and Mrs. Pavel have six children: three daughters, Victoria, Barbara, and Mary; and three sons, Joseph, Michael and Gregg, whom they lost in 1997. They are also blessed with nine grandchildren. All of the Pavel children graduated from Shelton High School and attended college and/or graduate school in Washington State. Today they are engaged in fulfilling careers, ranging from fisheries management to education.  I ask the Senate to join me in sending my warmest congratulations to Mr. and Mrs. Pavel for this very important wedding anniversary. I wish them many more happy years together. It is an honor and a privilege to represent them in the U.S. Senate.                          ____________________
