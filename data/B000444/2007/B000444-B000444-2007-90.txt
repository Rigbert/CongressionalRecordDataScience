 President, today I introduce, along with Senators Levin and Lautenberg, a piece of legislation which I hope will help the American victims of Libyan terrorism and their families move one step closer to receiving justice for the terrible crimes committed against them. Our legislation requires the administration to submit to Congress twice yearly reports on the status of the outstanding legal claims by these American victims and their families against the government of Libya. It also requires the administration to explain its own efforts on their behalf.  I believe it is in the United States' strategic interest to develop better relations with Libya. Colonel Qaddafi renounced terrorism and dismantled Libyan weapons of mass destruction programs. We need to demonstrate to the rogue regimes of the world that there is a path back to the civilized community of nations. Libya is an important country in its own right as a gateway between Europe and Africa, as a country which shares a border with the Darfur region of Sudan, and as an OPEC member.  But for this relationship to advance, we need to come to terms with the past. Several hundred Americans have been killed by Libyan terrorism and scores more have been injured. The Libyan regime has accepted responsibility for the heinous Pan Am 103 bombing, which killed 270 Americans. That admission also helped pave the way to the negotiations that led to Libya's renunciation of its support for terrorism and its WMD programs. But the families of the victims of Pan Am 103 are still waiting for the final settlement of their case. Last year, the Libyan government agreed to terms with the victims of the La Belle discotheque bombing in Germany. But they have since refused to honor the previously agreed upon terms. Other victims of Libyan terror are still waiting for justice. Their cases may be smaller in scale, but pain that the victims and their families have suffered is no less real.  The victims and families deserve to know what their government is doing on their behalf to settle these cases. Colonel Qaddafi needs to understand that the way forward needs to account for the past. And the State Department needs to begin to develop a coherent vision for what we hope to achieve in the Libyan--American relationship.  This piece of legislation we offer is modest, but I believe that it can help us to make progress in each of these three aspects.  Lastly, I would like to say a few words about the human rights conditions inside Libya. Yes, Americans are interested in Libya's external behavior.But we are also concerned about the human rights conditions within Libya. I am relieved that the death sentence of the six Bulgarian nurses and Palestinian doctor accused of infecting Libyan children with HIV has been commuted. But the case against them is preposterous, as confirmed by rigorous investigations into the allegations by UNESCO and the World Health Organization. That they remain in jail is outrageous.  For more than 3 years, years, I have been calling for the release of Fathi Eljahmi, a courageous democracy advocate with serious health problems whose only crime is to speak truth to power. I again call on the Libyan government to release Mr. Eljahmi.                          ____________________
