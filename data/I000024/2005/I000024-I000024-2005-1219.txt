President, today we will resume debate on the motion to proceed to highway legislation. On Friday, a cloture motion was filed to the motion to proceed. Under the order, that cloture vote will occur at 11:45 tomorrow morning.  On behalf of the leadership, we hope that cloture will be invoked and that we will be able to begin consideration of the underlying bill. If the Senate can proceed to the highway bill tomorrow, Senators should expect another rollcall vote as the Senate considers amendments to the bill. Finally, I would like to announce the Senate will this week also consider any conference report that may become available.                          ____________________
