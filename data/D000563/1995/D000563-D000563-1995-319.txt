Speaker, why have the Gingrich Republicans failed to meet the statutory deadline for passing a House budget resolution? The same Gingrich Republicans who were so proud of the fact that they met their hundred-day deadline for the Republican Contract With America, they read letters, fan mail, all sorts of comments from their districts about how proud they were, and yet when it comes down to the most basic thing, the spending bill for the Federal Government, the Gingrich Republicans have just dropped the ball.  Well, Mr. Speaker, the reason is pretty simple. The last item in the Republican contract was a Republican tax bill which adds $600 billion to our national debt over the next 10 years. When they sit down and try to figure out this $600 billion and how to make it up, they run out of solutions.  Well, where did they turn? They turned to one of the most important [[Page H4516]] programs in America, Medicare, a program not only important for seniors, but important for hospitals and doctors all across the United States.  The Republicans have found themselves in this box, they have painted themselves in this corner, because they insist on tax breaks for the wealthiest people and absolving corporations from paying their Federal taxes, and they want to make up the difference by cutting Medicare. That is not fair.  I hope the Republicans will get off this premise that they have to give these tax cuts to the privileged few and focus on the truly important programs like Social Security and Medicare.                          ____________________
