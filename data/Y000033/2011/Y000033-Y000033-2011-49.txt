Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the gentleman's amendment.  The amendment proposes to amend portions of the bill not yet read. The amendment may not be considered en bloc under section 3(j) of House Resolution 5, 112th Congress, because the amendment does not merely propose to transfer appropriations among objects in the bill, but also proposes language other than the amounts.  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on this point of order? The Chair will rule.  To be considered en bloc pursuant to section 3(j)(1) of House Resolution 5, an amendment must propose only to transfer appropriations from an object or objects in the bill to a spending reduction account. Because the amendment offered by the gentleman from Vermont proposes other changes to the bill, namely changing the level of a limitation, it may not avail itself of section 3(j)(1) of House Resolution 5 to address the spending reduction account. The amendment is not in order.                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Nadler
