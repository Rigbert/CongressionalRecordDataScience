 President, I yield myself such time as I might consume. I want to respond to the statements just made because it brings up the issue of the Federal debt.  We have heard from the other side that we are unconcerned about the Federal debt, as if they are concerned about it. I want to remind my colleagues--particularly those on the other side of the aisle--of how many amendments we had during the budget debate and during the omnibus appropriations bill debate back in January where there was amendment after amendment after amendment after amendment on the other side of the aisle to spend more money--spend more money.  When it came to the budget, there was amendment after amendment after amendment to take money away from the part of the budget of giving authority for tax relief and reducing that amount of money. Did it go against the bottom line? No.
