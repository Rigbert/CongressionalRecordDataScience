Speaker, I rise to congratulate Charles David Woodburn, Jr. on his retirement on November 2 after thirty-four years of distinguished service to this House.  Charles David ``Dave'' Woodburn, Jr. was first hired by former Clerk of the House Donn Anderson in September 1984 as a Sales Clerk in the Office Supply Store. He moved through the ranks of Special Order Clerk, Purchasing Department, to Inventory Control Specialist from 1984-2002. When the Chief Administrative Office underwent a reorganization, Dave joined the furniture organization.  Dave has always been recognized as a diligent and hard worker, with a strong work ethic. In the furniture organization he held many positions, including Supervisor and Manager for Receiving and Warehousing. Eventually, he was asked to serve as the Director of the Logistics and Distribution Department. This department was expanded to include Receiving and Warehousing, Logistics and Distribution, and Workflow Management. In addition to these duties, since 2008, Dave has played an integral role in the Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery (BCDR) team with the U.S. House of Representatives. His official title is Capability Manager, responsible for providing logistical support and furniture needs for all House emergency preparedness activities.  One notable contribution that Dave made to the House was his participation in the October 17, 2001 ``Response Project'' related to the anthrax incident on Capitol Hill. All Members, Committees, and Staff were able to be relocated to an alternate location, and Dave and his team were responsible for all logistical aspects of this project. He was commended for his contribution to this effort while ensuring that the business of the House went forward unhindered. Dave and his team have also been at the forefront of the Cannon Renewal Project since 2013. He received the CAO Knowledge Award, presented by Chief Administrative Officer Jay Eagan in 2007, for his extensive knowledge of the House and its operations.  Dave plans to spend his retirement years with his still very active parents, his wife of fourteen years, Marie, and his six children and ten grandchildren. He has said how much he is looking forward to returning to his hometown of Leonardtown, in Maryland's Fifth District, where he was born and raised, after a long and storied career with the House of Representatives. Just as important as the work he performed over the years, Dave passed along his extensive logistics and furniture experience to his staff and coworkers as a mentor.  On behalf of the entire House, I congratulate Dave for his many years of dedication and outstanding contributions to this institution. I wish him many wonderful years of fulfillment with family and community in his retirement.                          ____________________
