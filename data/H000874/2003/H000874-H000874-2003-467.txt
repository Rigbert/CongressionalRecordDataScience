Speaker, I had this and I was not going to use it. I am on the same side as the gentleman. I am in the minority of my party on this issue. But I want to tell Members that they cannot have it both ways. On December 13, 1995, our troops were deployed. Our troops were deployed in Bosnia. They were deployed for the purposes of keeping the peace. They were successful. Thousands of people were being killed. The gentleman remembers that, and our troops were deployed for the purpose of keeping the peace pursuant to an agreement by President Clinton and others in the NATO alliance.  There was a resolution on the floor. That resolution was a very brief resolution and it had one resolved clause, just one and it said this: That the House of Representatives unequivocally supports the men and women of the United States Armed Forces who are carrying out their mission in support of peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina with professional excellence, dedicated patriotism, and exemplary bravery.  The gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) voted ``no'' on that resolution. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay) voted ``no'' on that resolution. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), who spoke earlier, voted ``no'' on that resolution. The gentleman from California (Mr. Cunningham), who talked about the troops, voted ``no'' on that resolution.  I am with my friend on the substance, but when the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lofgren) gets up and makes her statement and she is criticized, remember December 13, 1995.
