President, I would commend one more time the two Senators from Virginia, both dear friends of mine, for the fact we worked as oneDemocrat, one Republican with the White House to get us past this impasse. And I commend President Bush for withdrawing controversial nominees and working toward consensus nominees. That is why this nominee will go through, I suspect unanimously, in this body.  I also commend the two Senators from Missouri, Senators Bond and McCaskill, for working together.  Has all time been yielded back?
