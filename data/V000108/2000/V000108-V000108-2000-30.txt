Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, the hour is late because many hours ago we started the final energy and water bill under the guidance of the gentleman from California (Mr. Packard). As we all know in this Chamber, the gentleman from California (Mr. Packard) has served all of us, his country and his family well, both in the military service, local and Federal service. I think as we conclude consideration of a well-done work product, which we have come to expect from the gentleman from California (Mr. Packard) day in and day out, that we owe the gentleman from California (Mr. Packard) our appreciation and a round of applause.
