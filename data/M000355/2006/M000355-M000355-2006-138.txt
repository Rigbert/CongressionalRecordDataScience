 President, I ask unanimous consent that the Foreign Relations Committee be discharged from further consideration of the following treaty and that it be placed on the Executive Calendar:  Protocol Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949, and relating to the Adoption of an Additional Distinctive Emblem, adopted at Geneva on December 8, 2005, and signed by the United States on that date.  I further ask unanimous consent that this protocol and those that remain in committee be assigned designations of ``A,'' ``B,'' and ``C'' respectively to reflect that three protocols were received as part of Treaty Document 109-10.
