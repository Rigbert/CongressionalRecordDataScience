 Our dear friend left a towering legacy of service and sacrifice. As Senator Graham reminded us last week, while none of us can hope to fill his shoes, we should all strive to follow in his footsteps. Today, the great State of Arizona has sent us a successor who is as well-equipped as you could imagine to do just that.  Our friend and former colleague, Senator Jon Kyl, is one of the most serious, most expert, and most effective legislators with whom I have had the pleasure of serving. In his 18 years of Senate service, he forcefully defended the interests of Arizonans on issues local, national, and international. He mastered the details of water and natural resource issues. He became a go-to point person on missile defense, nuclear modernization, strategy, and arms control. He built a reputation as a steady and energetic public servant who put his State and his country first.  On a point of personal privilege, I am glad we will have Jon back with us. He has great judgment and an even keel. He is a team player, a true friend, and an inspiring example of what a Senator can and should be.  It is a good thing, too, because Congress has a lot to accomplish in the coming weeks--like finalizing appropriations bills, completing our consideration of Judge Kavanaugh, and confirming more of the President's qualified nominees. It is going to be all hands on deck for the American people. I could not be happier that this new, not-so-junior Senator from Arizona will be here to help us through this period.                          ____________________
