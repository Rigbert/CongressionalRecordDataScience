 President, I yield my time to myself, 15 minutes out of what we control.  First of all, I remember before the President was sworn in he announced that--even though he ran on a platform of increasing taxes on higher income people--you do not raise taxes during a recession. So during the year 2009, there were no proposals to increase taxes from the administration, and, obviously, the Congress went along with that.
