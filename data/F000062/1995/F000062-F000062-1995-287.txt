  My northern California field representative for over 2 years, Kathy joined my staff after an incredibly successful career in women's tennis.  While at Stanford, she won four AIAW Collegiate titles, including both the singles and doubles championships in 1979. She still is considered the best women's tennis player who ever went to Stanford. [[Page S8304]]   She then turned professional and in her first year reached the final 16 at both Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.  During her professional tennis career that spanned a decade, Kathy won seven Grand Slam titles.  Kathy earned a reputation as a tough and tenacious competitor. And, as she defeated one challenger after another, Kathy proved she was one of the best players in the world and climbed to a ranking of No. 5. In just 1 year, she went from being No. 23 in the world to being No. 5.  During that time, Kathy beat Chris Evert in straight sets at Wimbledon in 1983, reached the finals of the 1983 Australian Open, and then went on to knock off Pam Shriver in the quarterfinal of the 1984 Wimbledon singles championship to reach the semifinals.  Kathy would later be described as Chris Evert's top nemesis, beating her three times.  Martina Navratilova, too, felt the sting of Kathy Jordan's passing shots. Not only did Kathy beat her in singles, but it was the team of Kathy Jordan and Liz Smylie that pulled a huge doubles upset and ended the 109-match winning streak of Navratilova and partner Pam Shriver in the Wimbledon final of 1985. Jordan and Smylie won by a score of 5-7, 6-3, 6-4. It was sweet victory for Kathy, who had lost 3 of the last 4 years to Navratilova and Shriver after winning the Wimbledon championship in 1980 with partner Anne Smith.  Looking back on the match, Kathy recounted how she and her partner, Smylie, were serving for the match at 5-4 in the third set. Kathy gambled, lunged across to Smylie's side of the court for a volley. They won the point, with Navratilova and Shriver looking stunned as the shot whipped by.  ``Pam and Martina were standing there looking at each other. I'm kinda like a roving linebacker and Liz is like a defensive back who sometimes has to cover behind me in case a ball gets over my head,'' Kathy said in 1991.  That roving linebacker attitude is exactly what made Kathy Jordan a legend on the tennis courts.  But, in the 1987 Virginia Slims of New England, Kathy's career was jeopardized with one of the most serious injuries an athlete can suffer--a tear of the right anterior cruciate ligament.  ``That's the Bernard King injury. The Danny Manning injury. You get scared. You never really know. A lot of people don't make it back,'' Kathy told the San Francisco Chronicle in 1990.  But, once again Kathy's determination paved the way and she once again became a potent threat in women's tennis. She reunited with her partner, Liz Smylie, and once again knocked off the expected winners to climb their way into the Wimbledon doubles final in 1990.  I've had the pleasure of getting to know Kathy over the course of the last 2 years.  After retiring from women's tennis, Kathy finished her undergraduate work at Stanford University and chose to direct her talents to public service. She worked on Lynn Yeakel's campaign for the U.S. Senate in her native Pennsylvania and then returned to California, where Palo Alto had become home.  Kathy joined my staff in 1993 as field representative for the northern California region of the State.  She has been one of the most outstanding staff persons I've worked with over the last 2 years.  Kathy assumed her field responsibilities with an incomparable level of compassion, intelligence, and diligence. And just as she did on the tennis court, Kathy has shown a fierce determination to fight for what is right.  She redefined the title ``field representative'' and was quickly promoted to the role of field director, overseeing projects for me statewide.  As a representative of over 20 counties, she was my eyes and ears for northern California. She identifies a problem and--more importantly--helps figure out how to solve a problem.  She has been a tireless advocate for the issues and concerns of the residents and elected officials in her jurisdiction.  I frequently have county supervisors and others approach and thank me for the work she has done and the results accomplished.  At a time when many feel alienated and are looking to the government's representatives to help them and respond to their needs and problems, I feel proud that I have a staff person who heeds the call and gets things done.  Kathy is a remarkable person whose compassion, respect, and talent for her work serves as a model for others.  I am grateful to have worked with her and benefited from her service to the U.S. Senate.  Madam President, I stand here to congratulate Kathy on all her accomplishments, and for the honor being bestowed her by Stanford University.  For all she has accomplished in both the world of tennis and in government service, it is an honor well deserved.                          ____________________
