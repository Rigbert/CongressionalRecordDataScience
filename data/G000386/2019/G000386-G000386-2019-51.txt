 President, November is National Adoption Month. This year, we have very good news.  In 2018, over 63,000 young people were adopted from foster care. That is an increase of 4,000 from the previous year. However, the number of children waiting for adoption also increased. That number rose to 125,000. Unfortunately, teenagers, sibling groups, and those with medical challenges often wait much longer to be adopted. Every child deserves a safe, permanent, loving home, so I want to commend all those who have chosen to adopt children in foster care.  If you wonder where I get the opinion that it is unfortunate that people want a permanent, safe, and loving home, all you have to do is listen to the kids in the foster care system, and you always get this response: What I would like to have is a mom and dad, and I would like to have a home. In other words, they get tired of being shuffled around from one foster home to another foster home, to another foster home. That is where I come from in recognizing November as National Adoption Month.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
