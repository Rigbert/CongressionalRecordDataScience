It is similar to statements he has made not only here but in private and in public. He has been one of Mr. Adegbile's strongest supporters throughout this matter.  Both he and I know this nominee well. We know he is qualified to be the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division in the Department of Justice. More than that, we know Debo Patrick Adegbile as a real person and not as the caricature we have heard from some on the other side. I think all of us have a responsibility to vote yes or no on any issue, and at least to deal with the facts as they are, not with distortions like some of the ones we have heard about this wonderful person.
