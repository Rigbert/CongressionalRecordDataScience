DeLay) is now, as the majority leader, not on the committee because he has been elevated to his present position. But the gentleman and I have sat in many conferences together, he on one side of the aisle, me on the other side of the aisle, in which we had probably 30 members of the Committee on Appropriations from our side, usually eight or nine from the majority side, 12 or 15, so 20 to 25 Members, and discuss issue by issue and go through it. That is what we expect the conference to be, because that is what we expect the democratic process provides in a conference committee to resolve differences that might exist.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, would the gentleman yield? I just remind the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) in that particular case the gentleman is absolutely right.

So, it is very easy to work in that configuration as the appropriators usually do.  And when everybody comes together and everybody knows that they are trying to get a bill and want a bill to be brought to the House, they are included. And it is no different than any other conference.
