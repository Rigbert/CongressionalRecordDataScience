President, it is not in opposition, but I will use that time if nobody else is seeking it.  This is much improved from what it was last year. It has included a proposal that Senator DeWine and I have worked on together. My one concern is the penalties. It does call for a new death penalty and new mandatory minimum.  I will tell the distinguished Senator from California and the distinguished Senator from Utah, these are issues that will be raised in conference.
