Speaker, I rise today to recognize Colleen Smith of Bowling Green,OH, who has retired as the city's administrator. Throughout her distinguished tenure, she was a model of a dedicated public servant.  Colleen began working for the city of Bowling Green in 1967 as a bookkeeper, monitoring maintenance costs of city vehicles. Working her way up through the municipal structure, she became the city's municipal administrator in 1989. As a testament to her talent and commitment to fiscal responsibility, the city's books held no operating debt upon her retirement.  In addition to leaving Bowling Green on sound financial grounds, Colleen may take pride in her retirement in knowing she played a key leadership role in the development and promotion of her community. As assistant municipal administrator and later as municipal administrator, she helped revitalize the downtown area and aggressively assisted in economic development. She was involved in recruiting commercial and industrial business and in negotiating an enterprise zone agreement between business, industry, and government. Ever mindful that a community is more than simply a collection of business enterprises, Colleen worked to ensure Bowling Green remained the warm and pleasant place to live and visit it has always been. Her efforts have grown trees, parks, and playgrounds which people have enjoyed and will for generations to come. She helped make Bowling Green a true slice of Middle America.  More than a municipal employee, Colleen expanded the boundaries of public servant by committing her time and talent to various volunteer groups and charities: the American Cancer Society, Muscular Dystrophy Association, and Arthritis Foundation to name a few. For her selfless efforts, Colleen was honored and recognized by many civic and community organizations. The recognition culminated in 1996, when she received an honorary alumnus degree from Bowling Green State University for a lifetime of achievement and civic-mindedness.  The English poet/philosopher John Donne wrote that ``no man is an island, entire of itself'' by which he meant that every person touches every other living being. Colleen Smith is an example of this sentiment. Although retiring from public service, I am certain she will carry on in the ideal of Donne's philosophy for many years to come. I know my colleagues join me in thanking Colleen Smith for 30 years of dedicated service, and wish her an enriching retirement.                          ____________________
