Lieberman, Mr. Voinovich, Mr.         Akaka, Ms. Landrieu, and Mr. Durbin):  S. 800. A bill to amend the District of Columbia Home Rule Act to provide the District of Columbia with autonomy over its budgets, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.  Ms. Collins. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation that includes the District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2005 and the District of Columbia Independence of the Chief Financial Officer Act of 2005. Last Congress, I introduced this legislation, which passed the Senate unanimously. This legislation would provide the District of Columbia with more autonomy over its local budget and make permanent the authority of the D.C. Chief Financial Officer.  Providing the District of Columbia with more autonomy over its local budget will help the Mayor and the Council of the District of Columbia better manage and run the city. Currently, the District of Columbia must submit its budget through the normal Federal appropriations process. Unfortunately, this process is often riddled with delays. For example, the average delay for enactment of an appropriations bill for the District of Columbia has been 3 months. The result of this delay is clear. For a local community these delays affect programs, planning and management initiatives important to the everyday lives of the residents of the city.  The ability of D.C., like any other city in the Nation, to operate efficiently and address the needs of its citizens is of utmost importance. Unlike other budgets that are approved by Congress, the local D.C. budget has a direct effect on local services and programs and affects the quality oflife for the residents of D.C. Congress has recognized the practical issues associated with running a city. As a result, in the 1970s, Congress passed the D.C. Home Rule Act which established the current form of local government. Congress also empowered D.C. to enact local laws that affect the everyday lives of District residents. And, now, I believe it is time for Congress to do the same with regard to the local budget.  The District of Columbia Budget Autonomy Act of 2005 would address these problems by authorizing the local government to pass its own budget each year. This bill would only affect that portion of the D.C. budget that includes the use oflocal funds, not Federal funds. In addition, the bill still provides for congressional oversight. Prior to a local budget becoming effective, Congress will have a 30-day periodin which to review the local budget. In addition, the local authority to pass a budget would be suspended during any periods of poor financial condition that would trigger a control year.  Having the locally elected officials of those providing the funds that are the subject of the budget process decide on how those funds should be spent is a matter of simple fairness. There are also the practical difficulties that the current system causes when the local budget is not approved until well into the fiscal year. By enacting this bill, Congress would be appropriately carrying out its constitutional duties with respect to the District by improving the city's ability to better plan, manage and run its local programs and services. This is what the taxpayers of the District of Columbia have elected their local officials to do.  The legislation also includes the District of Columbia Independence of the Chief Financial Officer Act of 2005 which would make permanent the authority of the District of Columbia Chief Financial Officer. The current Chief Financial Officer for the District of Columbia is operating under authority it derived from the D.C. Control Board, which is currently dormant due to the city's improved financial situation. That authority was set to sunset when the D.C. Control Board was phased out; however, the CFO's authority continues to be extended through the appropriations process, until such time as permanent legislation is enacted.  Ensuring continued financial accountability of the D.C. government is crucial for the fiscal stability of the city. The CFO has played a significant role in maintaining this stability. While providing the District with more autonomy over its budgets, it is also important that the CFO's authority is made permanent and that its role is clear.  I urge my colleagues to support this important piece of legislation.                                 ______                                       By
