President, Vermont is a farming State: dairy, livestock, vegetables or fruit, farms across Vermont are known for their innovative and sustainable approaches to farming and food production.  The dairy industry in particular is known throughout Vermont, and far beyond. Dairy cows are a familiar sight for those who live in or visit our State, and Vermont farms have been recognized both domestically and internationally for their dairy-based products. The cheese-making tradition in Vermont dates back to the early 1900s, when Vermont dairy farmers sought uses for their surplus milk. Since those early days, many farms have developed methods for artisanal cheese production.  Recently, Jasper Hill--a celebrated farm in Greensboro Bend, VT--won international recognition at the World Cheese Awards in London, when its Bayley Hazen Blue cheese won the award for the ``World's Best Unpasturized Cheese.'' Besting more than 2,600 submissions, Jasper Hill's award-winning blue cheese also took home a Super Gold award. Six other cheeses produced by Jasper Hill also won awards. And two other Vermont cheese makers--Grafton Village Cheese and the Vermont Creamery--were also recognized.  Some might skip over a story about the World Cheese Awards. But in Vermont, we take pride in the products we produce from the livestock nurtured and raised on Vermont's rich land. Farming remains a fabric of our American story, and in Vermont, it is a tradition that has spanned generations.  Congratulations to the Cellars at Jasper Hill, to Grafton Village Cheese, and to the Vermont Creamery for their recent recognitions. They represent the quality and high standards that are a hallmark of the Vermont brand.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of a story recently featured about these dairies on Vermont Public Radio be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From Vermont Public Radio, Nov. 17, 2014]   Cellars at Jasper Hill Wins ``World's Best Unpasteurized Cheese''                          (By Angela Evancie)       Before a recent batch of the Cellars at Jasper Hill's      Bayley Hazen Blue cheese was finished aging, before it was      ready to sell, and before it would be crowned--or rinded?--     ``World's Best Unpasteurized Cheese'' at the World Cheese      Awards in London, its makers knew they had something special.       ``I'm not lying when I say we were excited about it at a      young age,'' Vince Razionale, sales and inventory manager for      Jasper Hill, said by phone Monday. ``We tasted it on day 50,      and this particular batch was one that we thought was really      on point.'' (So on point, they thought, that it merited an      Instagram post.)       The more than 250 international cheese experts who judged      the 26th annual World Cheese Awards this weekend agreed.      Bayley Hazen Blue was selected from more than 2,600 cheeses,      first winning a Super Gold award and then its ``World's      Best'' award.       It isn't the only superlative Vermont can add to its list      of aged-milk achievements; Grafton Village Cheese also earned      two Super Golds, for its Shepsog and Bismark cheeses, while      Vermont Creamery took home one gold for its Bijou goat's milk      cheese, and seven bronzes. Six other cheeses by Jasper Hill      also won awards, including gold medals for its Cabot      Clothbound and Moses Sleeper. ``Ten years ago, American      cheese was something to be laughed at in England. Now,      collectively, we're a force to be reckoned with.''--Vince      Razionale, Jasper Hill Farm       Vermont cheese has certainly made a notable debut on the      domestic stage. Vermont's Secretary of Agriculture Chuck Ross      recently noted that cheeses made here have been named ``Best      In Show'' at the American Cheese Society Conference for the      past two years: Jasper Hill's Winnimere in 2013, and the      Farms for City Kids Foundation's Tarentaise Reserve this      year.       But Razionale says the international acclaim shows how far      cheese making, in the U.S. in general and Vermont in      particular, has come.       ``Ten years ago, American cheese was something to be      laughed at in England. Now, collectively, we're a force to be      reckoned with.''                          ____________________
