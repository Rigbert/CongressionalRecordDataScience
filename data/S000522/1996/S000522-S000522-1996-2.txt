Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, the language in this legislation that dealt with coercive abortion was stripped in the Senate. The issue was already covered by the CR, which had an identical provision. We are concurring with the Senate in taking that language out of the bill, so there is nothing in the bill on that subject.
