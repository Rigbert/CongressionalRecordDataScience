Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the Fishery Conservation and Management Amendments of 1995. In the last Congress the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee held 11 hearings in 5 different States and received testimony from over 100 witnesses. These witnesses represented all segments of the fisheries industries and other interested parties including fishermen, processors, environmentalists, State government officials, and administrative agencies. Near the end of the 103d Congress the Fisheries Management Subcommittee reported a bill which unfortunately was not considered by the full Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee.  Today, I am introducing legislation to re-authorize and amend the Magnuson Fisheries Conservation and Management Act. The bill contains nearly identical language to the bill reported by the subcommittee last year. The major differences involve the removal of certain controversial provisions, inclusion of stronger language addressing the bycatch issue and the unique needs of certain rural Alaskan fishermen, as well as some changes that would have been made had the bill been addressed by the full committee last year.  This legislation addresses all of the major concerns discussed during our series of hearings in the last Congress. While some may not totally agree with the way we address some of these concerns, I think this legislation takes a major step in continuing the management of our Nation's fisheries while also addressing some of the problems we have encountered in specific areas of fisheries management.  Mr. Speaker, there are two areas of concern that I feel must be addressed by this re-authorization legislation. We must allow the Regional Fishery Management Councils to address the issue of bycatch. The councils are in a unique position to create specific bycatch reduction measures, tailored for each fishery that they manage. I have also always believed that community development quotas [CDQs] are a legitimate tool of the councils for use in managing our fisheries resources. I have always believed that CDQ's did not have to be specifically authorized for the councils to include them in their first fisheries management plans and the courts have now finally agreed with me on this point. Community development quotas are just one of many tools which can be used by the councils to address the needs of fishery dependent communities. We will continue to look at this issue as we move those legislation.  Mr. Speaker, it is my intention to move quickly with the bill, so that we can get on with the sound management of our Nation's fisheries resources. Our fishermen and processors deserve no less.                          ____________________
