 President, today we are going to begin with a 1-hour period for morning business, and then we will resume consideration of the Department of Defense authorization bill. We made good progress on that measure yesterday by disposing of a very large number of amendments. Today, we hope to work through the remaining amendments, and it is possible that we could finish the bill this evening. The chairman and ranking member are expected to line up additional rollcall votes throughout today, and we will alert Senators as those votes are scheduled.  The majority leader has mentioned several appropriations conference reports that are available or soon will be available. We expect to consider the foreign operations conference report today or tomorrow and will vote on the remaining bills as we can clear them for action in the Senate.  Having said that, Mr. President, we look forward to further progress on the Defense authorization bill during the day.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Page S12553]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
