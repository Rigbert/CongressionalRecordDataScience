Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  I thank my colleague and good friend, Mr. Hoyer, for his comments. We did travel so many times to the Soviet Union, to the Eastern Bloc countries, and to Turkey. We raised issues methodically, persistently. But this issue has always been one of those unresolved, festering sores that if we could get it right--and this House going on record I think is the beginning of that process. So I thank him for his leadership over these years, for his friendship, and, above all, for that very eloquent statement.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
