President, on April 12, 2016, the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations held a hearing on violent extremism and the role of U.S. foreign assistance. We heard testimony from four distinguished witnesses, including my good friend and partner in humanitarian work, Bono, the lead singer of U2 and cofounder of ONE. As I said at the hearing, there are millions of people who may never know Bono by name or have the privilege of listening to his music, but their lives are better because of the profound impact his advocacy has had on the world's efforts to combat poverty.  At the hearing, Bono testified about what he called the three extremes: extreme ideology, extreme poverty, and extreme climate. His testimony was powerful. It complemented the opinion piece he wrote that was published in the New York Times on the morning of the hearing in which he highlighted the importance of investing in international development in a way that empowers local populations, including refugees and other displaced persons.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of Bono's article entitled ``Time to Think Bigger About the Refugee Crisis.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the New York Times, April 12, 2016]          Bono: Time to Think Bigger About the Refugee Crisis                               (By Bono)       I've recently returned from the Middle East and East      Africa, where I visited a number of refugee camps--car parks      of humanity. I went as an activist and as a European. Because      Europeans have come to realize--quite painfully in the past      year or two--that the mass exodus from collapsed countries      like Syria is not just a Middle Eastern or African problem,      it's a European problem. It's an American one, too. It      affects us all.       My countryman Peter Sutherland, a senior United Nations      official for international migration, has made clear that      we're living through the worst crisis of forced displacement      since World War II. In 2010, some 10,000 people worldwide      fled their homes every day, on average. Which sounds like a      lot--until you consider that four years later, that number      had quadrupled. And when people are driven out of their homes      by violence, poverty and instability, they take themselves      and their despair elsewhere. And ``elsewhere'' can be      anywhere.       But with their despair some of them also have hope. It      seems insane or naive to speak of hope in this context, and I      may be both of these things. But in most of the places where      refugees live, hope has not left the building: hope to go      home someday, hope to find work and a better life. I left      Kenya, Jordan and Turkey feeling a little hopeful myself. For      as hard as it is to truly imagine what life as a refugee is      like, we have a chance to reimagine that reality--and      reinvent our relationship with the people and countries      consumed now by conflict, or hosting those who have fled it.       That needs to start, as it has for me, by parting with a      couple of wrong ideas about the refugee crisis. One is that      the Syrian refugees are concentrated in camps. They aren't.      These arid encampments are so huge that it's hard to fathom      that only a small percentage of those refugees actually live      in one; in many places, a majority live in the communities of      their host countries. In Jordan and Lebanon, for example,      most refugees are in urban centers rather than in camps. This      is a problem that knows no perimeter.       Another fallacy is that the crisis is temporary. I guess it      depends on your definition of ``temporary,'' but I didn't      meet many refugees, some of whom have been displaced for      decades, who felt that they were just passing through. Some      families have spent two generations--and some young people      their entire lives--as refugees. They have been exiled by      their home countries only to face a second exile in the      countries that have accepted their presence but not their      right to move or to work. You hear the term ``permanent      temporary solution'' thrown around by officials, but not with      the irony you'd think it deserves.       Those understandings should shape our response. The United      States and other developed nations have a chance to act      smarter, think bigger and move faster in addressing this      crisis and preventing the next one. Having talked with      refugees, and having talked to countless officials and      representatives of civil society along the way, I see three      areas where the world should act.       First, the refugees, and the countries where they're      living, need more humanitarian support. You see this most      vividly in a place like the Dadaab complex in Kenya, near the      border of Somalia, a place patched together (or not) with      sticks and plastic sheets. The Office of the United Nations      High Commissioner for Refugees is doing noble and exceedingly      hard work. But it can't do everything it needs to do when it      is chronically underfunded by the very governments that      expect it to handle this global problem.       Second, we can help host countries see refugees not just as      a burden, but as a benefit. The international community could      be doing much more, through development assistance and trade      deals, to encourage businesses and states hosting refugees to      see the upside of people's hands being occupied and not idle      (the World Bank and the Scriptures agree on this) The      refugees want to work. They were shopkeepers, teachers and      musicians at home, and want to be these things again, or      maybe become new things--if they can get education, training      and access to the labor market.       In other words, they need development. Development that      invests in them and empowers them--that treats them not as      passive recipients but as leaders and partners. The world      tends to give humanitarian efforts and development efforts      their own separate bureaucracies and unlisted phone numbers,      as if they're wholly separate concerns. But to be effective      they need to be better coordinated; we have to link the two      and fund them both. Refugees living in camps need food and      shelter right away, but they also need the long-term benefits      of education, training, jobs and financial security.       Third, the world needs to shore up the development      assistance it gives to those countries that have not      collapsed but are racked by conflict, corruption and weak      governance. These countries may yet spiral into anarchy.      Lately some Western governments have been cutting overseas      aid to spend money instead on asylum-seekers within their      borders. But it is less expensive to invest in stability than      to confront instability. Transparency, respect for rule of      law, and a free and independent media are also crucial to the      survival of countries on the periphery of chaos. Because      chaos, as we know all too well, is contagious.       What we don't want and can't afford is to have important      countries in the Sahel, the band of countries just south of      the Sahara, going the same way as Syria. If Nigeria, a      country many times larger than Syria, were to fracture as a      result of groups like Boko Haram, we are going to wish we had      been thinking bigger before the storm.       Actually, some people are thinking bigger. I keep hearing      calls from a real gathering of forces--Africans and      Europeans, army generals and World Bank and International      Monetary Fund officials--to emulate that most genius of      American ideas, the Marshall Plan. That plan delivered trade      and development in service of security--in places where      institutions were broken and hope had been lost. Well, hope      is not lost in the Middle East and North Africa, not yet, not      even where it's held together by string. But hope is getting      impatient. We should be, too.
