Speaker, I am proud to pay tribute today to Dr. Thomas T. Haider, a constituent of mine from the 43rd congressional district, who was recently recognized with the American Medical Association's (AMA) top national honor, the inaugural 2001 Pride in the Profession Award. The award highlighted the work of six physicians nationwide who have not only healed patients, but enriched the communities and inspired the colleagues with whom they come into contact.  I once heard a quote that goes, ``It seems to me that a doctor's is the most perfect of all lives; it satisfies the craving to know, and also the craving to serve.'' I can think of no better words to describe the incredible devotion and duty that Dr. Haider has shown in his lifetime career as a physician.  Spurred to become a physician at the age of 12, Dr. Thomas Haider intended to use his medical skills to help people in his home country of Afghanistan. Ultimately, political turmoil has prevented that, but he has still managed to touch and improve the lives of thousands all over the world.  In 1994, Dr. Haider established the Children's Spine Foundation in the United States to provide free comprehensive spinal care for children without health insurance. And across the globe he sponsors a children's hospital in Afghanistan by supporting the salaries of 40 physicians and providing funds for all medication and food supplies.  Additionally, Dr. Haider's philanthropy includes: development of a new polyaxial pedicile screw for use in spine fusion surgeries, increasing their success rate; establishment of the first Spine Fellowship Program at the University of Colorado Medical Center; volunteer work to train doctors; creation of the American Board of Spine Surgery; and, endowment to the Biomedical Sciences Program at the University of California at Riverside, which bears his name.  Mr. Speaker, in my district of Riverside, California we are fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated individuals who give unselfishly of their time and talents to ensure the well-being of our city, state, nation and--in Dr. Haider's case--world. These individuals work tirelessly to enrich and brighten the lives of so many. Therefore, it is my distinct pleasure to take to the House of Representatives' chamber today to personally honor and commend Dr. Thomas T. Haider for all of his dedicated service to our community.                          ____________________
