Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time, and at this point I want to include a number of letters as part of the Record: Two from Chairman Barton, one from Mr. Boehlert and one from Mr. Young.         House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and            Infrastructure,                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2006.     Hon. Joe Barton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning the      jurisdictional interest of the Transportation and      Infrastructure Committee in matters being considered in H.R.      5852, the 21st Century Emergency Communications Act of 2006.       Our Committee recognizes the importance of H.R. 5852 and      the need for the legislation to move expeditiously.      Therefore, while we have a valid claim to jurisdiction over a      number of provisions in the bill, I do not intend to request      referral. This, of course, is conditional on our mutual      understanding that nothing in this legislation or my decision      to forego the referral waives, reduces or otherwise affects      the jurisdiction of the Transportation and Infrastructure      Committee.       The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure also      asks that you support our request to be conferees on the      provisions over which we have jurisdiction during any House-     Senate conference. I would appreciate it if you would include      a copy of this letter and of your response acknowledging our      jurisdictional interest as part of the Congressional Record      during consideration of the bill by the House.       Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,                                                         Chairman.                                       ____                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                    Washington, DC, July 25, 2006.     Hon. Sherwood L. Boehlert,     Chairman, Committee on Science,     Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Boehlert: Thank you for your letter in      regards to H.R. 5852, the 21st Century Emergency      Communications Act of 2006.       I acknowledge and appreciate your willingness not to      exercise your jurisdiction on the bill. In doing so, I agree      that your decision to forgo further action on the bill will      not prejudice the Committee on Science with respect to its      jurisdictional prerogatives on this legislation or similar      legislation. Further, I recognize your right to request      conferees on those provisions within the Committee on      Science's jurisdiction should they be the subject of a House-     Senate conference on this or similar legislation.       I will include your letter and this response in the      Congressional Record during consideration on the House floor.           Sincerely,                                                       Joe Barton,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                         Committee on Science,                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2006.     Hon. Joe Barton,     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning the      jurisdictional interest of the Science Committee in matters      being considered in H.R. 5852, the 21st Century Emergency      Communications Act of 2006. The Science Committee      acknowledges the importance of H.R. 5852 and the need for the      legislation to move expeditiously. Therefore, while we have a      valid claim to jurisdiction over the bill, I agree not to      request a sequential referral. This, of course, is      conditional on our mutual understanding that nothing in this      legislation or my decision to forgo a sequential referral      waives, reduces or otherwise affects the jurisdiction of the      Science Committee, and that a copy of this letter and of your      response will be included in the Congressional Record when      the bill is considered on the House Floor.       The Science Committee also asks that you support our      request to be conferees on any provisions over which we have      jurisdiction during House-Senate conference on this      legislation.       Thank you for your attention to this matter.           Sincerely,                                                Sherwood Boehlert,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,                                    Washington, DC, July 26, 2006.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure,          House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Young: Thank you for your letter in regards      to H.R. 5852, the 21st Century Emergency Communications Act      of 2006.       I acknowledge and appreciate your willingness not to      exercise your referral on the bill. In doing so, I agree that      your decision to forgo further action on the bill will not      prejudice the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure      with respect to its jurisdictional prerogatives on this      legislation or similar legislation. Further, I recognize your      right to request conferees on those provisions within the      Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's jurisdiction      should they be the subject of a House-Senate conference on      this or similar legislation.       I will include your letter and this response in the      Congressional Record during consideration on the House floor.           Sincerely,                                                       Joe Barton,     Chairman.                                  ____
