 Madam Speaker, my two friends on the other side of the aisle are obfuscating the real issue that is involved. I do not think John Adams and James Madison ever thought of first, third, and fifth graders being asked the questions that were recited by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy), the author of the resolution. The question here is whether this decision is right or wrong. It is wrong, and that is why the resolution ought to be passed.  Madam Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts).
