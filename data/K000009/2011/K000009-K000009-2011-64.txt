 It was such a pleasure today to join Vice President Joe Biden at Wrap-Tite, Inc., in Solon, Ohio, and to see the role that government must play when the market isn't fully functioning and when the banks aren't fully lending, and to see the Small Business Administration's 504 loan guarantee program at work creating jobs at this wonderful, wonderful company that now has millions and millions of dollars in sales.  When the regular banks weren't working, it was the SBA, Small Business Administration, that we support, some of us support, that was able to draw on the capital that made possible the investment for expansion, and they have hired five more people.  Imagine if there were 30,000 more companies in America that could do that, with the changes in the Jobs Act that the President is proposing, in order to reduce payroll taxes on individuals, as well as businesses and the other incentives for small business creation, we can really help lift this economy when she can't lift herself alone. It was a pleasure to be there today.  I congratulate Wrap-Tite and want to say it was great to celebrate that patriotic spirit of making the market work.                          ____________________
