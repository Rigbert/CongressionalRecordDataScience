President, on June 26, 2008, in the landmark District of Columbia v. Heller decision, the United States Supreme Court decisively confirmed what Oklahomans have known for a long time: we as Americans have an individual right to legally possess and use a firearm.  Prior to the Heller decision, DC, had the most restrictive gun control laws in the country. The District effectively banned handguns in homes and required all licensed firearms to be unloaded and dissembled or bound by a trigger lock or similar device.  Not only did the Supreme Court deem the DC gun ban unconstitutional, it also positively affirmed that ``(t)he Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home.''  I was very satisfied with the Supreme Court's decision in District of Columbia v. Heller. Before the Supreme Court heard this case, the entire Oklahoma delegation signed onto an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, urging theCourt to affirm that the second amendment protects an individual right to possess firearms. With the signatures of Vice President Cheney, 55 Senators, and 250 Members of the House of Representatives, this amicus brief had the support of more Members of Congress than any other amicus brief in known history.  Unfortunately, it did not come as a great surprise that soon after the Supreme Court decided the Heller case, the DC City Council began exploring new ways to restrict firearm possession in the District.  In response, on September 17, the House of Representatives passed the National Capital Security and Safety Act, H.R. 6842, by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 266-152. This bill prohibits the DC government from passing any law to restrict firearms in a person's home, business, or land. Additionally, the legislation rolls back the restrictions that the DC government has implemented that prohibit the registration of certain types of firearms. The bill also allows residents of the District of Columbia to purchase firearms from licensed dealers in the neighboring states of Virginia and Maryland.  After the House of Representatives passed this important bill, I joined 47 of my colleagues in the Senate in sending a letter to Majority Leader Reid asking him to bring up H.R. 6842 for consideration in the Senate. I sincerely hope that the Senate has the opportunity to debate and vote on this bill and send it to President Bush this year.  I have tenaciously fought to preserve the right of individual citizens to keep and bear arms since my first days in Congress. I will continue in this next stage of the battle over the interpretation of the second amendment.                          ____________________
