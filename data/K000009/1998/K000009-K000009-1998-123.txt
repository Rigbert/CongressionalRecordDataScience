Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a remarkably able man dedicated to his family, his church, and his lifelong love of the profession of law. John Stoepler, professor of law, former Dean of The University of Toledo Law School, and interim President of the University, put the justice and betterment of others above all else. He died on January 19, 1998, at 66 years of age.  In his early years, John attended school in Toledo, Ohio and then his high intelligence led him to the University of Notre Dame, where he took his first degree. He never forgot his roots, though, and after serving in the army and obtaining a master's degree in law from Yale, he came back to Toledo to teach and raise his family.  His classes at the local university were the first to fill up because the students knew that John really wanted them to succeed. He greeted the challenge of teaching with energy and enthusiasm that was always evident. As former student Tom Pletz remembers, John welcomed each day of teaching with ``a twinkle in his eye.''  The zest that John brought to his teaching was also found in the work he did for his church as parish operations manager. His love of education and respect for people of faith were combined when he sat on the education council of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Toledo, an organization which oversees area Catholic schools.  His commitment to education did not go unnoticed; he quickly ascended through the ranks at the university's law school, becoming dean in 1983 and interim university president in 1988. He played an integral role in the expansion of the school both academically and strategically as the ground was broken for a new facility on its own corner of campus. He also became a member of the Ohio Supreme Court's commission on continuing legal education and of the national education development committee of the American Institute of Planners.  Though he dabbled in politics as an extension of his respect for the lawmaking process, his own political campaigns were not successful. He was, however, appointed to many government positions in the city, county and state, and served the community with dignity and sagacity from those posts.  Long time friend Rev. Robert Kirtland said that John thought of the ideal lawyer ``as a person of integrity.'' That certainly describes him and earned for him the deepest respect, from a community that will never forget him.  Our thoughts are with his wife, Katherine; sons, John and Michael; daughter Charlotte; his brother and sister, Robert and Anne; and all of his grandchildren. It is our hope that they will be comforted by the prayers of a community bettered by his idealism, and a nation regirded in its fundamental precept of justice through law.                          ____________________
