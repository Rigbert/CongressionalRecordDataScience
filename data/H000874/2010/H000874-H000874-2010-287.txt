Speaker, the U.S. Capitol features statues from every State in our Union--statues that honor some of the most memorable and influential people in America's history. The people of the District of Columbia are part of our Union, as well: they pay federal taxes, vote in presidential elections, and share citizenship with us. But when it comes to seeing the District's most notable citizens honored here in the Capitol, in their own city, the people of Washington, DC have again been left out. That needs to change.  This bill would give the people of the District of Columbia--along with the people of the territories of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Northern Mariana Islands--their due in the U.S. Capitol. I believe, in fact, that the District of Columbia deserves two statues, just like any state; but failing that, I believe that some recognition is better than none.  The people of the District of Columbia have made remarkable contributions to America's history, its culture, and its ongoing work to guarantee equal rights to all--and it's time that those contributions are recognized here in the heart of our democracy. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.                          ____________________
