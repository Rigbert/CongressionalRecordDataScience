Speaker, I am honored today to pay tribute to the Inland Empire Harley Owners Group as they prepare to promote West Coast Thunder, a large police escorted parade of motorcyclists to the Riverside National Cemetery to honor our military veterans on Memorial Day. In my congressional district of Riverside, California, we are fortunate to have numerous community service organizations that not only unselfishly give their time and talents to the community but find their own lives enriched in return. The Inland Empire Harley Owners Group epitomizes this and more.  The efforts of the West Coast Thunder committee with thousands of parade participants over the years, has brought great recognition, unparalleled resources and multitudes of volunteers to Riverside's Memorial Day Remembrance Ceremony. This event provides a compelling way for people to pay their respects as well as raise funds for the Riverside National Cemetery Support Committee. The visual impact of thousands of motorcycles, led by a full flag-bearing honor-guard, proudly gives those interred at the Riverside National Cemetery the recognition it richly deserves.  The Riverside National Cemetery is currently the second largest resting place for our veterans, with over 150,000 men and women from our armed services standing silent vigil with us today. Within a short time it is expected to be the largest cemetery in the National Cemetery system and within 50 years will have more than 1.4 million honored veterans.  The months of work preceding this event lead to a large gathering of veterans, family and friends desiring to honor those who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our great nation. Their tireless efforts and dedication to honoring our brave veterans is evident as thousands participate in the Memorial Day Ceremonies.  Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the Inland Empire Harley Owners Group for their dedication and service to our Nations veterans.                          ____________________
