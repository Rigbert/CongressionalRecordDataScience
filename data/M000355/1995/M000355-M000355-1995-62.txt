 KASSEBAUM. No, there is no national formula established in this bill, based on geographic or population considerations. For allocating Job Corps funds, the only factors will be performance related. In fact, section 161(c) specifically provides that each State will continue to receive the same amount of funds for Job Corps even if any of the States' centers are closed. In that case, the State could then use those funds for other at-risk youth activities.  Among the factors that will be examined to determine the closure of centers are: Whether the center has experienced high incidents of criminal or violent activity; the physical condition of the facility; the degree to which the center has State and local support; and the costs of the center compared to other centers.  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Senator from Kansas for her explanation.
