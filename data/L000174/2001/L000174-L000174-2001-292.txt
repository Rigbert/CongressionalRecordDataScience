KYL. This amendment doesn't deal with any question of payment for agent services. I presume we could do that. This amendment doesn't have anything to do with that. The problem that we have here is the former Director of the CIA created the policy because of some things that occurred in our past--if we are going to recruit assets, people who would do work for us, those people cannot have in their background human rights abuses. They cannot have that kind of background. That is a principle policy if you are recruiting somebody to act against another government. But when you are trying to infiltrate a terrorist organization, you are probably going to have to talk to people who themselves have pretty checkered backgrounds. If you could use those people--whatever their motivation; maybe they do it for money, or for some other reason--but if they are willing to give you information based upon their ability to find out what a terrorist organization is doing, then it is very valuable.  As the distinguished chairman knows, our ability to collect information on these groups is very limited. Almost everybody in the community talks about the need for better human intelligence. Unless we are able to recruit the kind of people who could provide that intelligence, it is going to be pretty difficult for us to get it.
