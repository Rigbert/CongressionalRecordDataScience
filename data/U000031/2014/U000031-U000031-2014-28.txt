 Mr. Speaker, here we are at the very end of when the doc fix expires, March 31. That is next week. We have tried in a very responsible way for many months to try and resolve this issue, and I commend my friend Mr. Waxman and others for passing our bill out of committee last summer at 51-0. I think it was Speaker Boehner who said hedidn't think we could honor Mother Teresa for sainthood with a vote like that.  I commend my good friend Mr. Camp from Michigan and Sandy Levin, the gentleman from Michigan, who is on the floor now, as we worked together and worked with the Senate as well to actually lock in place a bill on literally the last day that Chairman Baucus was in the United States Senate in order to try and resolve this, and we knew all along that we were going to have to have a pay-for. Here in the House a couple weeks ago, we passed a bill, somewhat on partisan lines, I know--it was not 100 percent on either side--but we passed a 10-year fix with a pay-for.  Now, I had a great ninth grade civics teacher, Mr. Denekas, who is no longer with us. He is with the Lord. I will tell you, as I sit down with my students as I did this week--a lot of them are here in town, my Close Up groups and others--and as I speak to my high schools and colleges, they know there is never such a thing, maybe, as a perfect bill. One of the first lessons in civics is that you pass a bill in the House, and you pass a bill in the Senate, and they are always different. You go to conference, and you work out the differences, and it comes back.  Nobody wants this expiration of the doc fix--nobody. It hurts our physician community. They care about the folks that they treat. Literally, they are going to have almost a 30 percent reduction cut as early as next week in the services that they provide. Let's think about our most vulnerable, too--our seniors. They have got those doctor appointments, and they want to be there. Maybe, with a 30 percent cut, those physicians will say: Gosh, we just can't do this. That appointment is canceled. We are going to just stop serving Medicare patients--period--those over 65.  We don't want that. We don't want that hurting our most vulnerable. So we passed here in the House a couple of weeks ago a 10-year bill. The response from the Senate is--nothing. Yes, we have had some discussions. We have talked with Senator Wyden, a former member of our committee. He is diligently trying to get something done, but they have got no bill ready for passage on the Senate floor that matches what we did to go to conference. They have got nothing. There is a lot of talk about maybe just doing a bill without a pay-for or some phony savings. That is not what this House is about. It is a lot of money, and we have some rules in the House that you have got to have a pay-for for it, and that is the real difficulty in trying to get things done.  So here we are at the end of the week. The cuts come in next Tuesday, April 1, so we are trying to send another offer to the Senate. If you are not going to take the 10-year fix, let's try a 1-year fix. It is paid for. It is about $20 billion, and there are a number of little provisions that are in there that, I think, are important, again, in working with all sides. Last night, we were somewhat surprised that a number of groups came out against it, but the alternative is that the door gets shut. We don't have a backup plan, all right?  This is the bill. If we can get 290 votes--everybody is here--a two-thirds vote, that is great. We will send yet another offer to the Senate, and they can choose either one. They can take our 10-year bill. They can take a 1-year bill. They can pass something different, and we can go to conference. I must say that this bill is now a 1-year bill, but it doesn't stop us from still trying to negotiate something for a permanent fix, because that is what every one of us wants. It doesn't stop us from getting that done, but at least it stops what otherwise will be the denial of services to the most vulnerable, our seniors, who may not understand what is happening. It continues the process moving forward.  We have got a couple of options that we are teeing up, but, obviously, we have to pass it today, here, with a two-thirds vote. Then let the Senate decide which alternative or it can pass something else, but pass something so that we can go to conference; but if that happens, then the doc fix is not fixed, and for however long that period is the cuts go into place. It would be nice if we could actually pass this by voice. What do you think? It will get us off the dime, and, again, we will toss it to the Senate to try and get it done. No one wants it to expire, but without one of these two bills, it expires, and we don't want that to happen.  I would urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--my friend Mr. Pallone, my friend Mr. Waxman, and others--because, yes, we need to get this done. It is the best that we can do right now, and there is not a plan B for next week.  Mr. Speaker, the specter of physician cuts under Medicare, or SGR, has been an unwelcome threat to seniors' access to quality health care well for over a decade. I rise in support of Chairman Pitts' H.R. 4302, the Protecting Access to Medicare Act, so we can ensure that seniors' access to quality health care is not jeopardized as we continue the effort to permanently resolving this broken system.  While we're not yet over the finish line, we are closer than ever before. Republicans and Democrats of the House and Senate have agreed to the policy of a permanent solution, and this chamber has already passed a bipartisan, fully paid-for bill that would make it a reality.  We understand that our colleagues in the Senate may have a different vision for next steps, and we'd be happy to meet with them to find a package of true offsets that we can all get behind. But, while we wait for the Senate to join us, it is important for us to keep the promises we have made to seniors who depend on the Medicare program.  By coming together with this patch, we will ensure that care will be there when Medicare beneficiaries need it. This package prevents the scheduled 24 percent cut in payment rates, updates the rate through the end of the year, and maintains many of the so-called extenders programs for another year, including the Special Diabetes Program and abstinence program. Finally, it includes important mental health provisions like the Assistant Outpatient Treatment program from Chairman Murphy's H.R. 3717, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act of 2013. All of this is achieved in a fiscally responsible manner, saving $1.2 billion while we continue to strive for our permanent solution.  Our work is far from done, but today we restore some certainty to our seniors that their trusted doctor will be available when they are in need of care.  I ask my colleagues to support this bill.                              {time}  1000
