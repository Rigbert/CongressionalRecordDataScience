President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 762, S. 2412.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Thomas). The clerk will report the bill by title.  The legislative clerk read as follows:       A bill (S. 2412) to amend title 49, United States Code, to      authorize appropriations for the National Transportation      Safety Board for fiscal years 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003, and      for other purposes.  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the full Senate will now consider S. 2412, the National Transportation Safety Board Amendments Act of 2000.  The National Transportation Safety Board, NTSB, is one of our nation's most critical governmental agencies, charged with determining the probable cause of transportation accidents and promoting transportation safety. Among its many duties, the Board investigates accidents, conducts safety studies, and evaluates the effectiveness of other government agencies' programs for preventing transportation accidents. Since its inception in 1967, the NTSB has investigated more than 110,000 aviation accidents, at least 10,000 other accidents in the surface modes and issued more than 11,000 safety recommendations.  The Safety Board is currently experiencing a high level of major accident investigations, many of which are extremely complex. We must act to ensure the Board has the necessary personnel and resources to complete these challenging investigations and carry out its statutory mission.  Given the very limited time remaining during this Congress, the Commerce Committee has worked with the House Transportation and Infrastructure, T, Committee in an effort to develop legislation that both Chambers could accept without modification. Both of our Committees want to ensure the NTSB's authorizing legislation can be enacted as soon as possible.  I want to commend Senator Hollings, the Ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee and House T Chairman, Bud Shuster, and Ranking Member, Jim Oberstar for their assistance in developing the package I bring before the Senate today. The accompanying Manager's Amendment is the product of our joint discussions and resolves the differences in the House-passed and Commerce Committee-passed versions of the NTSB authorizing legislation.  S. 2412 authorizes funding for the Board through fiscal year 2003. The bill also includes a number of provisions requested in the Board's reauthorization submission. These statutory changes include: (1) clarification of NTSB's jurisdiction over accidents on the territorial seas to the twelve-mile limit and its investigative authority over accidents that may have been the subject of intentional acts of destruction; (2) permission to prescribe overtime pay rates for accident investigators; (3) authority to negotiate technical service agreements with foreign safety agencies or foreign governments; (4) authority to collect reasonable fees for the reproduction and distribution of Board products; and (5) permission to withhold voice and video recorder information from public disclosure.  In addition to the provisions requested by the Board, the legislation also includes a number of other provisions intended to improve fiscal accountability at the NTSB. For example, the legislation would statutorily establish a position of Chief Financial Officer, CFO, at the Board. The CFO would report directly to the Chairman of the Board on financial management matters and provide guidance on the implementation of asset management systems. It also directs the Board to develop and implement comprehensive internal audit controls for its financial programs to address shortcomings identified recently by the Department of Transportation Inspector General.  Further, the legislation includes a provision intended to curb what I and others view as excessive member travel expenditures. According to NTSB travel documents, only 15 percent of Board Member travel has been accident-related in the past five years. Non-accident domestic and foreign travel accounts for 85 percent of the total travel expenditures--with 51 percent for domestic travel and 34 percent for foreign travel. While I recognize a legitimate need may exist to participate in important seminars and to gain greater professional expertise that may necessitate travel, this is simply excessive. Therefore, the bill directs the Chairman of the NTSB to establish annual travel budgets, to be approved by the Board, to govern Board Member non-accident travel.  Finally, the bill authorizes the Department of Transportation Inspector General to review the business, financial, and property management of the NTSB. Currently, the Board has no standing Inspector General oversight. The bill ensures that necessary fiscal accountability oversight is provided, while prohibiting the Inspector General from becoming involved in NTSB investigations and investigation procedures.  The NTSB's authorization expired September 30, 1999. The NTSB faces budget difficulties as it seeks to cover the costs of major accident investigations. Therefore, I hope we can move this legislation expeditiously from the Floor and on to the House for its swift action, and then to the President's desk for signature.                           Amendment No. 4288
