Speaker, I stand here this morning as a member of the Appropriations Committee and its Subcommittee on Homeland Security. Our subcommittee is responsible for setting and overseeing funding for the operations of the Department of Homeland Security.  In 2 days, on February 27, astoundingly, funding for the Department of Homeland Security runs out because the Republican majority can't agree on a bill due to their internal disagreements on the immigration provisions which are contained in the same bill because it is in the same Department.  Although a clean funding bill, H.R. 861, could quickly be brought to this House floor for a vote to fund the entire Department for the remainder of this fiscal year, Republicans have defaulted to the rightwing extremists in their own party and instead have chosen to hold the security of our Nation hostage in order to contort the legislative process.  They would defund the President's immigration executive order merely because they want a partisan win more than they want to govern. What a tragedy.                              {time}  1015  To quote an editorial from yesterday's Washington Post: ``The fervor of Republican partisanship, especially in the House, is immune to logic beyond an insistence on victory at any cost.''  This is a Republican Party that just a year and a half ago shut our Nation's government down for 16 days, stopping critical services and doing significant harm to the U.S. economy; then, too, they seemed more interested in a political win than responsible governance.  Recall, their party also had the opportunity last Congress to bring a bipartisan comprehensive immigration bill to the floor for a vote but declined to act. They have chosen not to address a concern that an overwhelming number of Americans believe needs to be resolved.  There are grave consequences for forcing the Department of Homeland Security into a shutdown. The Republican Congress would cripple the Federal Emergency Management Agency's preparations for future disasters asmore than a fifth of personnel are furloughed.  The Republican Congress would end the Federal Emergency Management Agency's training activities with local law enforcement for weapons of mass destruction.  The Republican Congress would cut off pay to thousands of Department of Homeland Security employees who are personally tasked with protecting our homeland.  The Republican Congress would stop research and development work on countermeasures to protect us against devastating biological threats, on nuclear detection equipment, and on cargo and passenger screening technologies.  The Republican Congress would shutter the Department of Homeland Security's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, meaning there will be no alerts or coordination efforts with local law enforcement agencies if a nuclear event occurs.  This is so utterly irresponsible. In an era of amplified global threats, brutal terrorist attacks throughout Europe, and escalating tension throughout the Middle East, to cut off funding for the Department tasked with ensuring our homeland security is safe and secure is truly dangerous.  This sort of behavior throws sand into the gears of a great society, of a great country, the oldest Republic on the face of the Earth. The American people surely are looking for reassurance that their government will offer them the security and dependability they expect.  We have a responsibility to protect their security, even if it means we no longer can indulge in political brinksmanship.  Mr. Speaker, we have a working bipartisan majority here in this House that holds the power to govern this Nation. All it needs is the will.  Let's bring the clean Department of Homeland Security funding bill to the floor today. Let's stop playing political games with the safety and security of the American people.  We owe it to them to govern and to do the job we were elected to do.                          ____________________
