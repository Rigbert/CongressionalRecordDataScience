Mr. Speaker, today, I submit to theRecord documents that reveal deceptive practices used by the abortion lobby. It is critical that both the American and foreign public are made aware of these documents because they shed new light on the schemes of those who want to promote abortion here and abroad. It is especially important that policy makers know, and more fully understand, the deceptive practices being employed by the abortion lobby. These documents are from recent Center for Reproductive Rights (CRR) strategy sessions where, according to a quote from a related interview session, one of CRR's Trustees said, ``We have to fight harder, be a little dirtier.'' These documents are important for the public to see because they expose the wolf donning sheep's clothing in an attempt to sanitize violence against children. These papers reveal a Trojan Horse of deceit. They show a plan to``be a little dirtier.'' In their own words, these documents demonstrate how abortion promotion groups are planning to push abortion here and abroad, not by direct argument, but by twisting words and definitions. In discussing legal strategies to legalize abortion internationally they go as far as to say, ``. . . there is a stealth quality to the work: we are achieving incremental recognition of values without a huge amount of scrutiny from the opposition. These lower profile victories will gradually put us in a strong position to assert a broad consensus around our assertions.'' People should know about this stealth campaign, and that is why I submit these documents unedited and for public review.   International Legal Program Summary of Strategic Planning Through                             October 31, 2003       Staff lawyers in the International Legal Program, (ILP)      have met three times with Nancy Northup, Nancy Raybin and      Elizabeth Lowell (September 3, September 23, and October 16)      to discuss our strategic direction. In the periods between      those meetings, ILP staff met and worked on the memos      attached hereto, as well as two other working memos.       We have stepped back and considered the types of strategic      legal work the ILP has worked on to date, examining in      particular how we evaluate or measure our effectiveness. We      reflected on our key accomplishments, and the constant      challenge of being in far higher demand than we have      resources. This led us to discuss and further develop the      ILP's ``theory of change.'' (See Memo 2.) What is our      overarching programmatic objective and what should that mean      in terms of hard choices on how to focus our work in the next      3-5 years? We have made some solid progress in answering that      question, as outlined below:       The ILP's overarching goal is to ensure that governments      worldwide guarantee reproductive rights out of an      understanding that they are legally bound to do so.       We see two principal prerequisites for achieving this goal:       (1) Strengthening international reproductive rights norms.       Norms refer to legal standards. The strongest existing      international legal norms relevant to reproductive rights are      found in multilateral human rights treaties. Based on our      view of what reproductive rights should mean for humankind,      the existing human rights treaties are not perfect. For      example, at least four substantive areas of reproductive      rights illustrate the limits of international reproductive      rights norms in protecting women: (a) abortion; (b)      adolescents access to reproductive health care; (c) HIV/AIDS;      and (d) child marriage. One strategic goal could be to work      for the adoption of a new multilateral treaty (or addendum to      an existing treaty) protecting reproductive rights. The other      principal option is to develop ``soft norms'' or      jurisprudence (decisions or interpretations) to guide states'      compliance with binding norms. Turning back to the four      substantive areas noted above, in all four cases, it is      possible to secure favorable interpretations. Indeed, the      Center has begun to do so. (For an in-depth discussion of      this, see Memo 1.)       In theory, existing international norms are broad enough to      be interpreted so as to provide women with adequate legal      protections. Therefore, we are in agreement on the need to      work in a systematic way on strengthening interpretations and      applications of the existing norms. If, at the end of 2007.      we determine that the existing norms are proving inadequate      (as evidenced by the interpretations we seek), then we would      reconsider whether to undertake a concerted effort to secure      a new international treaty or addendum to address this gap.      We would supplement our own conclusions by convening a      conference or expert group to consider whether it would be      strategic to pursue such an effort.       (2) Consistent and effective action on the part of civil      society and the international community to enforce these      norms.       This action follows from the premise that the best way to      test existing international reproductive rights norms is to      make governments accountable for them. In other words, to      work for their enforcement or implementation. would seek to      do this by: (a) developing activities aimed at enforcement of      international protections of reproductive rights in regional      and international fora; and (b) working for the adoption and      implementation of appropriate national-level norms.       The regional and international fora with a quasi-judicial      character arguably offer the most promising venues for      securing justice and interpretations that actually change      governments' behavior. To date, we have used the Inter-     American Commission on Human Rights (three cases, one      pending) and the UN Human Rights Committee (which oversees      compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and      Political Rights) (one case pending). We believe that seeking      favorable interpretations from the ``quasi judicial      mechanisms of the European human rights system, the African      system, and other UN individual complaint mechanisms will be      particularly important in the next 3-5 years.       Ultimately, underlying the goal of strengthening      international norms and enforcement is that of ensuring that      appropriate legal norms are in place at the national level so      as to improve women's health and lives. Working on the above      prerequisites can help bring about national-level normative      changes (since one key way for governments to comply with      international norms is to improve national norms). But these      processes are not linear and the adoption of appropriate      national-level norms may be feasible first (without      advocates' emphasis on governments' obligation to apply      international norms). Such new national-level norms can, in      turn, influence and strengthen international standards. Our      goal above is reached only when governments in fact guarantee      women's reproductive rights; first by adopting appropriate      laws and policies, and, second, by adequately implementing      them.       We have begun the process of considering what the above      theory of change means for our work: It will mean      concentrating on securing strong interpretations the strength      of international reproductive rights norms. But the work      suggested by the discussion above is still greater than our      resources. We must think in terms of working in a concerted      way on certain reproductive rights is issues; in a smaller      number of focus countries; and on honing our ability to      provide cutting edge input on relevant international and      regional norms and on providing a comparative legal      perspective. (i.e., analysis of laws and judicial decisions      across countries).  memo #1--international reproductive rights norms: current assessment       Our goal is to see governments worldwide guarantee women's      reproductive rights out of recognition that they are bound to      do so. An essential precondition is the existence of      international legal norms that encompass reproductive rights      and guarantee them the broadest possible protection. Our      task, therefore, is to consider the current content of      international law relating to reproductive rights and assess      its adequacy for guiding government decision-making and      holding governments accountable for violations of      international norms.       This memo provides an overview of the sources of      international law that may be invoked to protect reproductive      rights, examining both binding treaty provisions (hard norms)      and the many interpretative and non-binding statements that      contribute to an understanding of reproductive rights (soft      norms). It examines four substantive areas that illustrate      the limits of international law in protecting reproductive      rights: (a) abortion, (b) adolescents' access to reproductive      health care, (c) HIV/AIDS, and (d) child marriage. The memo      then considers whether, given existing support for      reproductive rights in international law, reproductive rights      activists should seek new protective norms or whether our      efforts would be better spent seeking stronger mechanisms for      enforcement of existing norms. Assuming that our goal is to      pursue the development of international norms, there are      several approaches we could take:       Develop a jurisprudence of existing norms that guides      states' compliance with binding norms;       Strategically work toward developing customary norms; and       Work to create another binding instrument, such as an      international treaty or a protocol to an existing treaty.     I. The foundations of reproductive rights in international law       By way of introduction, international human rights law is      grounded in both ``hard'' and ``soft'' norms. Legally binding      or ``hard'' norms are norms codified in binding treaties such      as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights      (ICCPR) or the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of      Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). As a result of the      hard-fought efforts of human rights activists, hard      norms have gradually been extended to more and more of the      human family, including ethnic and racial minorities,      women, children, and refugees and internally displaced      people.       Supplementing these binding treaty-based standards and      often contributing to the development of future hard norms      are a variety of ``soft norms.'' These norms result from      interpretations of human rights treaty committees, rulings of      international tribunals, resolutions of inter-governmental      political bodies, agreed conclusions in international      conferences and reports of special rapporteurs. (Sources of      soft norms include: the European Court of Human Rights, the      CEDAW Committee, provisions from the Platform for Action of      the Beijing Fourth World Conference on Women, and reports      from the Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health.)       Reproductive rights advocates, including the Center, have      found guarantees of women's right to reproductive health and      self-determination in longstanding and hard international      norms, relying on such instruments as the Universal      Declaration on Human Rights (Universal Declaration), the      International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),      and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and      Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and the Convention on the      Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women      (CEDAW). This approach received international affirmation (in      a soft norm) at the International Conference on Population      and Development (ICPD) in the conference's Programme of      Action. Paragraph 7.3 of that document states:       ``[R]eproductive rights embrace certain human rights that      are already recognized in national laws, international human      rights documents and other consensus documents. These rights      rest on the recognition of the     basic right of all couples and individuals to decide freely      and responsibly the number, spacing and timing of their      children and to have the information and means to do so, and      the right to attain the highest standard of sexual and      reproductive health. It also includes their right to make      decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination,      coercion and violence, as expressed in human rights      documents.''       We and others have grounded reproductive rights in a number      of recognized human rights, including: the right to life,      liberty, and security; the right to health, reproductive      health, and family planning; the right to decide the number      and spacing of children; the right to consent to marriage and      to equality in marriage; the right to privacy; the right to      be free from discrimination on specified grounds; the right      to modify traditions or customs that violate women's      rights; the right not to be subjected to torture or other      cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment; the      right to be free from sexual violence; and the right to      enjoy scientific progress and to consent to      experimentation.       Our publications feature legal arguments resting on these      broad principles, many of which have been well received by      treaty monitoring bodies and other authoritative U.N. bodies.      Still, there are some arguments that could be considerably      strengthened with legal norms that relate more specifically      to reproductive matters. The next section will briefly      discuss four areas in which international law provides less      protection than desired.                       II. Gaps in existing norms                              A. Abortion       We have been leaders in bringing arguments for a woman's      right to choose abortion within the rubric of international      human rights. However, there is no binding hard norm that      recognizes women's right to terminate a pregnancy. To argue      that such a right exists, we have focused on interpretations      of three categories of hard norms: the rights to life and      health; the right to be free from discrimination; those      rights that protect individual decision-making on private      matters.       Bolstered by numerous soft norms, the assertion with widest      international acceptance is that a woman's right to be free      from unsafe abortion is grounded in her rights to life and      health. The right to life has been interpreted to require      governments to take action to preserve life. The right to      health guarantees the highest attainable level of physical      and mental health. Because unsafe abortion is responsible for      78,000 deaths each year and hundreds of thousands of      disabilities, criminalization of abortion clearly harms      women's life and health. The international community has      recognized the dangers of unsafe abortion. Statements to that      effect were adopted at the International Conference on      Population and Development in Cairo (1994) and the Beijing      Fourth World Conference on Women (1995), as well as the      recent 5-year reviews of these conferences.       While this has been an important stride, the global      community has fallen short of recognizing a right to      independent decision-making in abortion, providing us with      relatively few soft norms. We argue that the right to make      decisions about one's body is rooted in the right to physical      integrity, which has been interpreted to protect against      unwanted invasions of one's body. We assert that the right to      privacy protects a woman's right to make decisions about her      reproductive capacity. We also rely on the right to determine      the number and spacing of one's children. Here, the soft      norms arguably work against us, particularly given the phrase      repeated in both the Cairo and Beijing documents affirming      that under no circumstances should abortion be considered      a method of family planning.       We have also grounded our arguments in the right to be free      from gender discrimination, which is protected in every major      human rights instrument. Because restrictive abortion laws      deny access to health care that only women need, they      constitute discrimination in access to health care. This      position is supported somewhat obliquely in a CEDAW general      recommendation. In addition, we argue that by denying women      the means to control their own fertility, restrictive      abortion laws interfere with women's ability to enjoy      opportunities in other sectors of society, including      educational and professional opportunities. No soft norms      affirm this argument. B. Adolescents--Access to Reproductive Health Services and Information       The Center has taken a leading role in pressing for      protection of adolescents' right to access reproductive and      sexual health information and services. In creating a human      rights framework for such rights, we use the same hard norms      that form the foundation for non-adolescent women's right to      access reproductive health services. However, the challenge      is to assert that the hard norms apply to adolescents under      age 18. We rely almost exclusively on soft norms to do this      since none of the treaties explicitly discuss adolescents'      reproductive rights.          Rights Relating to the Right to Reproductive Health       The right to health (including family planning services and      education);       The right to life; and       The rights to education and information.       With respect to the first cluster of rights, the hard norms      relating to women's right to access reproductive health      services and information are well established and accepted.      However, there is no hard norm specifically stating that      these provisions also protect adolescents' right to access      reproductive health services and information. There is one      important, and somewhat ambiguous exception. A recent      interpretation suggests the provision on the right to health,      which asks states parties to develop family planning services      and education, applies to children/adolescents.        Rights Relating to Reproductive Decision Making/Autonomy       Right to privacy;       Right to plan the number and spacing of one's children; and       Rights to liberty and security of person.       In issues relating to adolescents' reproductive autonomy      and decision-making, there are even fewer hard norms and it      is even more difficult to say that these hard norms apply to      adolescents under the age of 18 and their reproductive      decision-making. For example, the Children's Rights      Convention (CRR) provisions on the right to privacy are      problematic, prohibiting ``arbitrary or unlawful interference      with his or her privacy.'' The provision is not explicit that      the right applies to health services and the use of      ``unlawful'' could imply that only interferences that      contravene national law would be prohibited. There are no      hard norms on: (1) confidentiality in provision of health      services or information; (2) prohibiting parental consent      requirements and (3) third party authorization for access to      reproductive health services and information.                The Right To Be Free From Discrimination       While there are hard norms prohibiting sex discrimination      that apply to girl adolescents, these are problematic since      they must be applied to a substantive right (i.e., the right      to health) and the substantive reproductive rights of      adolescents are not `hard' (yet!). There are no hard norms on      age discrimination that would protect adolescents' ability to      exercise their rights to reproductive health, sexual      education, or reproductive decisionmaking. In addition, there      are no hard norms prohibiting discrimination based on marital      status, which is often an issue with respect to unmarried      adolescents' access to reproductive health services and      information.       The soft norms support the idea that the hard norms apply      to adolescents under 18. They also fill in the substantive      gaps in the hard norms with respect to reproductive health      services and information as well as adolescents' reproductive      autonomy. Two important standards are applied in order to      fill in the gaps:       The ``Evolving Capacity of the Child'' standard, which      limits parental control to the extent that children take on      more autonomy as their capacities grow. (e.g., An adolescent      who is sexually active and is taking the initiative to seek      out means to protect herself from STIs and unwanted pregnancy      is demonstrating a level of maturity to justify access.)       The ``Best Interest of the Child'' standard, which mandates      that in the context of health, parental involvement that      prevents adolescents from accessing potentially life-saving      information and services is NOT in the child's best interest.      Rather, it is in the best interest of adolescents to have      access to the means to protect themselves. It is often in the      best interest of the child to be granted autonomy in      decision-making.        Soft Norms Relating to the right to Reproductive Health       The Treaty Monitoring Bodies (TMBs) have explicitly      interpreted adolescents' right to health as including the      right to access services and information on reproductive      health. In addition, they have called for sexual education in      the context of the rights to education and information. Both      the International Conference on Population and Development      (ICPD) and the Beijing Platform for Action (Beijing PFA)      further help to fill in the gaps in this cluster of      substantive rights, clearly stating that these rights apply      to adolescents.  Soft norms relating to the right to reproductive autonomy/decision-                                 making       Soft norms supplement the dearth of hard norms. The TMBs      have interpreted adolescents' right to privacy as ensuring a      right to confidentiality in reproductive health services as      well as the right to access services and information without      parental consent.    Soft norms relating to the right to be free from discrimination       There are no explicit soft norms on the right to be free      from discrimination based on age in the context of      adolescents' reproductive rights. There are soft norms      relating to the age of marriage, which would impact      adolescents' ability to access services since in many      countries married adolescents are granted access regardless      of their age while unmarried adolescents are effectively      denied access. This relates closely to soft norms on      discrimination based on marital status. In this regard, the      TMBs General Recommendations/Comments and Concluding      Observations have explicitly condemned discrimination based      on marital status in accessing reproductive health services.                              C. HIV/AIDS       The rights of women implicated by HIV/AIDS include: the      rights to life, dignity, liberty, and security of the person,      freedom from inhuman and degrading treatment,      nondiscrimination and equality before the     law, the right to health, including reproductive health care      and reproductive self-determination. There are no hard norms      in international human rights law that directly address HIV/     AIDS directly.       At the same time, a number of human rights bodies have      developed soft norms to secure rights that are rendered      vulnerable by the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In 1998, the Office of      the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and UNAIDS issued      ``HIV/AIDS and Human Rights: International Guidelines,''      which provide a roadmap for governments seeking to      incorporate human rights protections related to HIV/AIDS into      national law. In June 2001, the U.N. General Assembly Special      Session (UNGASS) on HIV/AIDS resulted in a Declaration of      Commitment on HIV/AIDS that included strong language on the      need to integrate the rights of women and girls into the      global struggle against HIV/AIDS.       In addition, the TMB's have interpreted existing treaties      in the context of HIV/AIDS and reproductive rights, creating      new and positive jurisprudence that safeguards women's      reproductive rights.       In the national-level courts, the South African.      Constitutional Court interpreted the ICESCR Covenant      progressively to enforce the right to HIV/AIDS prevention and      treatment in a case brought against the government by the      Treatment Action Campaign (an HIV/AIDS rights NGO) seeking to      compel the government of South Africa to provide Nevirapine      to pregnant women and their babies, to prevent the      transmission of HIV from mother to child.       Practices with implications for women's reproductive rights      in relation to HIV/AIDS are still not fully covered under      existing international law, although soft norms have      addressed them to some extent. Two of these include: (1)      denials of the right to consent to HIV/AIDS testing of      pregnant women and (2) the presumption of consent to sex in      marriage.            1. Pregnant women's consent to HIV/AIDS testing       There is a lack of explicit prohibition of mandatory      testing of HIV-positive pregnant women under international      law. General international law provisions relating to consent      or refusal to consent to medical treatment under the ICCPR      (article 15.1) and the ICESCR (article 7) has been applied.-       The legal and ethical foundations for HIV testing broadly      require respect for the conditions for informed consent, pre-      and post-test counseling and confidentiality. But on many      occasions in practice, HIV positive pregnant women are      subjected to mandatory routine tests, without adequate      counseling. These mandatory tests often owe their      justification to public health demands to curb transmission      of the HIV virus to their offspring.       HIV testing that is conducted without pre- and post-test      counseling violates a woman's rights to autonomy, dignity,      privacy and bodily and psychological integrity. The same      degree of consent pre- and post-test counseling and      confidentiality applicable to every other person undergoing      an HIV test should apply equally to a pregnant woman.       Among the most persuasive ``soft norms'' are the UNAIDS      Guidelines on HIV/AIDS and Human Rights, which call for      international human rights norms to be translated into      practical observance in the context of HIV/AIDS, point out      that programs emphasizing coercive measures directed towards      the risk of transmitting HIV to the fetus, such as mandatory      pre- and post-natal testing, seldom prevent perinatal      transmission of HIV/AIDS, because they overlook. the health      needs of women. In its policy statement on HIV testing and      counseling, UNAIDS states that pregnant women should not be      coerced into testing nor be tested without their consent. But      these guidelines do not carry the force of law as would be      the case if language prohibiting mandatory HIV testing of      pregnant women were included in an existing treaty.            2. Presumption of consent to sex within marriage       Human rights law should explicitly address the legal and      social subordination women face within their families,      marriages, communities and societies, especially as these      barriers expose women to the risk of HIV infection.      International protections for the right of women to autonomy      over their sexuality within or outside marriage can be found      in the principle of bodily integrity enumerated in the ICCPR,      which provides for the right to liberty and security of the      person. However, with the challenges provided by HIV/AIDS, it      is necessary to institute stronger protections of the rights      of women in the family, especially their rights to autonomy      over sexuality and reproduction. Some stronger language on      women's rights in the context of HIV/AIDS is found in soft      norms, including the recent UNAIDS guidelines on HIV/AIDS and      human rights. In addition, both the ICPD Programme of Action      and the Beijing PFA reflect an international consensus      recognizing the inalienable nature of sexual rights.      Paragraph 96 of the Fourth World Conference on Women      Platform.for Action states, ``The human rights of women      include their right to have control over and decide freely      and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality,      including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion,      discrimination and violence.'' Again, these rights are much      more clearly articulated as a matter of progressive      interpretation and jurisprudence than as hard norms in      themselves.               D. Child Marriage (Marriage Under Age 18)       None of the global human rights treaties explicitly      prohibit child marriage and no treaty prescribes an      appropriate minimum age for marriage. The onus of specifying      a minimum age at marriage rests with the states' parties to      these treaties.       Several treaties prescribe the hard norms we use to assert      human rights violations associated with child marriage. They      include (but are not limited to): the right to freedom from      discrimination; the right to choose a spouse and to enter      into marriage with free and full consent; the right to      health; and the right to protection from all forms of sexual      exploitation and sexual abuse.       We have to rely extensively on soft norms that have evolved      from the TMBs and that are contained in conference documents      to assert that child marriage is a violation of fundamental      human rights.       In the main treaties and conventions relevant to marriage      and the rights of women and children, the issue of minimum      age at marriage has been dodged by the use of phrases--such      as ``full age'' and references to full and free consent as      the proposed standard for determining the validity of a      marriage. Even the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum      Age for Marriage, and Registration of Marriages (1964) does      not clearly articulate an appropriate minimum age. Notably,      the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child,      does recommend a minimum age of 18 and is the only treaty to      do so.       Committees have issued general comments and recommendations      emphasizing the problematic aspects of child marriage. Most      have issued concluding observations that discourage and      condemn child marriage as a human rights violation.       The Beijing PFA echoes most treaty provisions relevant to      the issue of child marriage by calling upon governments to      enact and strictly enforce laws to ensure that marriage is      only entered into with the free and full consent of the      intending spouses. It also requires governments to ``raise      the minimum age where necessary.'' While thus provision does      mark a step forward, it does not take a position on what the      minimum age should be.                 III. More norms vs. better enforcement       Because we wish not only to set standards for government      behavior, but also to ensure that governments understand that      they are bound to those standards, our success depends on      some focus on enforcement of international law. Gaps in the      substance of human rights instruments are accompanied by      weaknesses in mechanisms for enforcing even the most accepted      norms. Accountability is rarely achieved even for governments      who engage in arbitrary killings and torture. It is even more      difficult to ensure the enforcement of economic, social and      cultural rights, which, while legally 'binding, offer few      measures for compliance. We are particularly sensitive to the      practical difficulties of enforcing the Women's Convention,      which enumerates a number of rights that are fundamental to      enjoyment of reproductive rights. A question arises as to      whether promoting the recognition of an expanding body of      rights might dilute the still untested gains that we have      made in the past 20 years.       Many human rights activists have focused on developing      better mechanisms for enforcing existing norms, rather than      filling the substantive gaps in binding 'instruments. The      campaign for the International Criminal Court is an example      of an effort to make highly accepted international legal      norms--the principles of the Geneva Conventions--more      practically enforceable in an international forum.       As a program, we should consider whether we would be better      served engaging in the process of enforcing existing norms--     through international litigation, factfinding, reporting to      the treaty monitoring bodies--rather than developing      the substance of international law. (In reality, both of      these goals can be pursued simultaneously, but our      question here is one of emphasis.) We could also focus on      developing new mechanisms for governmental accountability,      which could themselves be the basis of a new legal      instrument.       Should we decide, however, that we cannot move forward in      our work without the development of stronger substantive      norms, there are a few strategies we can take. These      strategies are not exclusive and each can reinforce the      others. However, because we wish to take a more self-     conscious approach to choosing our strategy, we have laid      them out in the following section.                     IV. How to fill normative gaps       A. Seeking Authoritative Interpretations of Existing Norms       This approach involves developing a jurisprudence that      pushes the general understanding of existing, broadly      accepted human rights law to encompass reproductive rights.      Such a jurisprudence is developed primarily through:       Report to the treaty monitoring bodies;       Bring cases to international and regional adjudicative      bodies (such as cases we have so far brought before the      Inter-American Commission); and       Bring claims based on international law to national-level      courts (such as the recent PMTC cases brought before the      South-African Constitutional court by the local HIV/AIDS      Advocacy group, Treatment Action Campaign.       While, given the variety of jurisdictions, the common law      concept of ``precedent'' has little bearing in this context,      international jurists are aware of how legal questions have      been resolved by their peers in other fora. Arguments based      on the decisions of one body can be brought as persuasive      authority to decision-makers in other bodies,       There are several advantages to relying primarily on      interpretations of hard norms. As interpretations of norms      acknowledging reproductive rights are repeated in      international bodies, the legitimacy of these rights is      reinforced. In addition, the gradual nature of this approach      ensures that we are never in an ``all-or-nothing'' situation,      where we may risk a major setback. Further, it is a strategy      that does not require a major, concentrated investment of      resources, but rather it can be achieved over time with      regular use of staff time and funds. Finally, there is a      stealth quality to the work: we are achieving incremental      recognition of values without a huge amount of scrutiny from      the opposition. These lower profile victories will gradually      put us in a strong position to assert a broad consensus      around our assertions.       There are also disadvantages to this approach. As decisions      are made on an ad hoc basis to apply to a variety of      situations, there may be a lack of clarity or uniformity in      the decisions.. It thus may be harder to point to one      position as an ``accepted'' interpretation. In addition, the      incremental nature of this approach escapes the notice of not      just our opponents, but also our potential allies. It is very      difficult to gain press attention to issues affecting a      relatively small group of.people or a narrow set of facts.      Finally, because we cannot rely on respect for precedent in      international and national bodies of overlapping      jurisdictions, gains that we achieve may be lost in      subsequent decisions. While we have seen an encouraging trend      in international jurisprudence, we are forever at risk of      losing ground in the same fora.                   B. Working Toward a Customary Norm       The second approach has much in common with the first. It      involves a gradual process of seeking repetition of      interpretations of existing norms to encompass and protect      reproductive rights. Again, we seek affirmation in      international adjudicative fora and national-level courts, as      well as at international conferences. The difference in      taking this approach is that it would require adopting an      overarching strategy for our interventions. We could first      develop a wish-list of international legal protections that      need to be developed, ideally through convening workshops      around the world designed to sound out additional gaps in      existing international law and reinforce the interest of      allies in following a set of strategic priorities. We would      then seek every opportunity to get items on our wish-list      incorporated into treaty interpretations and soft norms.       The advantages of such an approach are many. First, it      would give focus to our current work, forcing us to establish      a set of priorities. Our priorities could be reflected both      in our advocacy and in our efforts to shape public opinion.      The approach would draw a minimal level of distracting      opposition, while increasing our visibility with our allies.       The major disadvantage is that developing a customary norm      is a slow process and it is difficult to know when you have      accomplished your goal. Very few norms that are currently      considered accepted and mainstream can be attributed to      recent deliberate campaigns. While the standard for creating      a customary norm is open to some scholarly debate, most such      norms can be traced to centuries of practice and belief. In      addition, although we are talking about undertaking a      campaign of sorts, it is a difficult one to explain to non-     lawyers and it is not very sexy.             C. Seeking Adoption of a New Legal Instrument       Finally, if we determine that the foregoing options are      ineffective, we should consider whether the weaknesses in      international law can only be remedied with the adoption of a      new legal instrument. Such an instrument could be a protocol      to an existing treaty (such as the optional protocol to the      African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights or a      new protocol to CEDAW) or a free-standing treaty. A      campaign for the adoption of a new international treaty      would be an extremely involved, resource-intensive and      long process. It might begin with a campaign for a General      Assembly Declaration on Reproductive Rights or another      soft norm. Then there would be a process of drafting a      treaty, getting broad input from many key players. Again,      workshops would have to be held around the world to      establish buy-in. Then there would be a process of,      identifying sympathetic delegates in the General Assembly.      These efforts would be followed by years of campaigning,      with the leadership of a sophisticated, media savvy team.       There are clearly a number of advantages to this approach.      First, it offers the potential for strong, clear and      permanent protections of women's reproductive rights.      Further, having a campaign with clear objectives could serve      as a focal point for advocacy around the world. In addition,      the campaign itself could have an educational function with      the potential to influence national-level legislation.       There are also potential disadvantages to consider.      Embarking on a campaign for a new legal instrument appears to      concede that we do not have legal protections already, making      failure potentially costly. Moreover, during the many years      it takes to succeed in adopting an instrument, we create the      impression that women are ``protectionless.'' Second, the      campaign is unlikely to succeed in the near term, and thus      might be deemed a waste of limited resources. Finally,      depending of the timing of the campaign and the surrounding      conditions, it could stir up nasty opposition, which might      ultimately set the movement back, at least temporarily.                  V. Conclusion and further questions       There are a number of questions that we would need to      answer before we decided on a strategy. Some of these      questions may be. best answered by people outside the      organization. These might include Ruth Wedgwood, David      Weissbrodt, Oscar Schacter, Donna Sullivan, Ken Roth, Rebecca      Cook, Roger Norman, Widney Brown, Anika Rahman, and certainly      others. Whatever strategy we pursue, we should continue to      research our approach, perhaps by enlisting the assistance of      students at a law school clinic.       Here are some questions we would like answered:       1. Are the weaknesses in international norms protecting      reproductive rights of a severity that can only be remedied      by the adoption of a new legal instrument?       2. Do most governments currently think that they have a      duty to uphold reproductive rights? Do they care about      interpretations of hard norms and do these interpretations      shape their views about their obligations under international      law?       3. As a matter of public perception, does pursuing a new      instrument--without any assurance of success--undermine      current claims regarding the existence of reproductive      rights?       4. Would it be more strategic, to consider an instrument      covering other ``gaps'' in legal protections for women's      rights and include these?       5. How have other movements succeeded at creating norms      that governments consider binding?       6. What would be an appropriate timeline for pursuing a new      legal instrument?       7. Would we be the group to take the lead on a campaign for      a new legal instrument? MEMO #2--ESTABLISHING INTERNATIONAL REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS NORMS: THEORY                                OF CHANGE       Our goal is to ensure that governments worldwide guarantee      women's reproductive rights out of an understanding that they      are bound to do so. The two principal prerequisites for      achieving this goal are: (1) the strengthening of      international legal norms protecting reproductive rights; and      (2) consistent and effective action on the part of civil      society and the international community to enforce these      norms. Each of these conditions, in turn, depends upon      profound social change at the local, national and      international (including regional) levels.       Ultimately, the goal of strengthening international norms      and enforcement is to ensure that appropriate legal norms are      in place at the national level so as to improve women's      health and lives. Working on the above prerequisites can help      ensure. national-level normative changes, but these processes      are not linear and the adoption of appropriate national-level      norms may happen first and can, in turn, influence and      strengthen international standards. Our goal above is reached      only when governments in fact guarantee women's reproductive      rights, first by adopting appropriate laws and policies, and,      second, by adequately implementing them. Thus, a third      prerequisite is suggested that reinforces international      standards: adoption and implementation of appropriate      national-level norms.       Achieving the above goal does not depend on legal      strategies alone. Support for norms and their enforcement may      require sustained public awareness-raising campaigns, media      attention, and support from key sectors like the medical      community, among others. The role of law in social change is      a complex one. But the adoption of good reproductive rights      norms at the national, regional and international levels is      crucial because it indicates such norms' formal recognition,      and provides a firm basis for the government's duties,      including its own compliance and its enforcement against      third parties. With formal recognition of reproductive rights      through law, women's ability to exercise these rights is left      to chance.       The remainder of this memo attempts to concretize the      Center's theory of how such change can be achieved, with an      emphasis on the Center's possible role in this process. This      memo serves as an initial concept paper, not a work plan. In      some cases, activities identified are already well underway.      But, in any case, we recognize that we cannot undertake all      the work suggested by the analysis below, but that this      provides us with a more concrete starting point for      identifying what needs to be done and our appropriate roles.               1. Strengthening international legal norms       Our legal analyses to date are primarily based on      interpretations of well-accepted international norms. There      are at least three means of strengthening these norms to      ensure greater protection of reproductive rights: broadening      authoritative interpretations of existing norms; gradually      establishing an international customary norm; and adopting a      new legal instrument protecting reproductive rights. (For a      more detailed description of these approaches, see Memo #1.)       Regardless of the mechanism, expanding legal protections      requires action on multiple fronts. First, there is a process      of developing broad international agreement among our allies      and potential allies on what the norms should be. Second,      steps must be taken to put reproductive rights on the agenda      of international normative bodies. Finally, advocates must      foster broad support for reproductive rights among      governments while countering opposition. The following      subsections will address each of these activities in greater      detail.                    A. Developing Agreement on Norms       Much of the work of developing agreement on norms      protecting reproductive rights has been achieved at United      Nations conferences, including the International Conference      on Population and Development (1994) and the Fourth World      Conference on Women (1995). While documents adopted at these      conferences are not themselves legally binding, they are a      clear articulation of most of our institutional values, and      they have been formally accepted by nearly every government      in the world. There are (as noted in Memo #1) a number of      gaps in the content of these international agreements, and      much work is needed to gather support for the Center's      position on how these gaps should be filled. For example, the      Center needs to continue its advocacy to ensure that women's      ability to choose to terminate a pregnancy is recognized as a      human right. Advocacy of this nature can be carried out      through various means, including:       Public education and awareness-building, in part through      production of advocacy materials and publicity surrounding      their release;       Bringing reproductive rights into the mainstream of legal      academia and the human rights establishment; and       Collaboration with NGOs engaged in establishing legal norms      at the national level.       B. Putting Reproductive Rights on the International Agenda       Developing broad agreement on norms protecting reproductive      rights does not in itself ensure that they will find their      way into international law. Advocates have to look for      opportunities--such as international conferences and meetings      of treaty monitoring bodies and other UN human rights      bodies--to put norms relating to reproductive rights on the      international agenda. In some cases, the timing of such      efforts may depend upon strategic considerations. For      example, advocates for reproductive rights opted not to lobby      for an official 10-year review of the International      Conference on Population and Development, fearing that      negotiations would be hijacked by the right-wing, which      includes the current U.S. Government.       There are several means of putting reproductive rights on      the agenda of international normative bodies, including:       Identifying allies in government and civil society who can      champion reproductive rights;       Securing positive interpretations from the treaty      monitoring bodies related to reproductive rights, either      through the reporting processes or by bringing individual      complaints;       By seeking action from such UN and regional bodies as the      Human Rights Commission and its sub-Commission and the      European, Inter-American, and African commissions/courts on      human rights; and       Engaging the media in bringing reproductive rights to the      attention of relevant international, regional and national      normative bodies, including legislators, other government      officials, local and international judicial bodies, as well      as medical bodies that can influence law and policy.    C. Garnering Support Among Governments and Countering Opposition       Ultimately, we must persuade governments to accept      reproductive rights as binding norms. Again, our approach can      move forward on several fronts, with interventions both at      the national and international levels. Governments'      recognition of reproductive rights norms may be indicated by      their support for progressive language in international      conference documents or by their adoption and implementation      of appropriate national-level legislative and policy      instruments. In order to counter opposition to an expansion      of recognized reproductive rights norms, we have questioned      the credibility of such reactionary yet influential      international actors as the United States and the Holy      See. Our activities to garner support for international      protections of reproductive rights include:       Lobbying government delegations at UN conferences and      producing supporting analyses/materials;       Fostering alliances with members of civil society who may      become influential on their national delegations to the UN;      and       Preparing briefing papers and factsheets exposing the broad      anti-woman agenda of our opposition.     2. Enforcing international protections of reproductive rights       For legal protections of reproductive rights to be      meaningful, they must be tested through concerted enforcement      efforts. Enforcement of human rights norms can be pursued at      the national, regional and international levels. Some      enforcement strategies, such as the use of the treaty      monitoring bodies, also serve the goal of strengthening legal      norms, as described above.       Advocates' use of enforcement mechanisms can help cultivate      a ``culture'' of enforcement in which violations of      reproductive rights are recognized as such by victims, and      complaints are addressed under conditions of impartiality and      the rule of law. Specific activities that contribute to      enforcing international norms include:       Using adjudicative mechanisms at the national, regional and      international levels;       Documenting, and publicizing reproductive rights violations      and recommending appropriate reforms; and       Supporting efforts to strengthen existing enforcement      mechanisms, such as the campaign for the International      Criminal Court and the Optional Protocol to the Convention on      the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women      (CEDAW).   3. Adoption and implementation of appropriate national-level norms       An important measure of the extent to which a particular      government accepts its obligation to respect, protect and      fulfill reproductive rights is whether it has adopted and is      properly implementing appropriate legislation and policy.      This may come about through means other than an international      enforcement effort. For example, the national political      moment may be ripe for change, with or without the      influence of international standards. Such changes in one      or more countries, particularly key countries in a region,      may have a catalytic effect on neighboring countries or on      the solidification of international norms. Moreover, these      kinds of changes, whatever the impetus, must be encouraged      as they are more likely to have an immediate impact on the      health and lives of women previously unable to enjoy      reproductive rights.       Similar to activities outlined in #2 above regarding      enforcement, possible activities in this area include the      following:       Providing input to civil society or government actors to      change offensive laws or adopt progressive laws where none      had existed;       Examining the effectiveness of implementation of laws and      policies; and       Assessing whether courts are adequately enforcing existing      legislation.                                  ____ Domestic Legal Program Summary of Strategic Planning Through October                                 31, 2003       Staff attorneys in the Domestic Legal Program (DLP) have      met with our strategic planning consultants and Nancy Northup      to discuss our current work and to plan for the future. At      our initial meeting we focused on the following issues:       Abortion Litigation: Are the litigation strategies of the      last 10 years still viable? If so, for how much longer?      Should we be taking a different approach to some of the      issues that we have been litigating?       How can we influence the people who influence the legal      landscape around reproductive rights? How does CRR influence      these communities now? Are there new strategies we should      adopt? What are the key issues? What would it take to resolve      those issues?       Expanding Beyond Abortion. What are the other reproductive      rights issues we have not been addressing or that we should      put renewed energies into?       As a result of these discussions, we formed working groups      on the following four issues: (1) the future of our      traditional abortion litigation; (2) development of      systematic approaches to or ``campaigns'' concerning selected      core issues; (3) the development of non-abortion related      litigation; and (4) development of new approaches to      influencing the legal landscape. A summary of our thinking to      date follows:            I. The future of traditional abortion litigation       We believe that the traditional abortion litigation that      has formed the core of our legal program in the United States      has been, and is likely to remain, the most effective      strategy for protecting the right to choose abortion in      hostile political climates, like that we face today, as well      as in friendlier times. Even under pro-choice      Administrations, women's right to choose has always needed,      and will need again, the protection of the judiciary from      hostile majorities in many, if not most, states. Moreover,      Supreme Court decisions in litigation arising from these      hostile states have defined the contours of the right to      choose. If CRR is going to continue to have an impact on      legal developments in our field, we need to continue to be      involved in these cases. Therefore, we will carry on in this      area, informed by evolving standards in some areas, such as      TRAP and biased counseling cases. We have also made a plan      for reviewing our options to bring new ``affirmative''      litigation in areas such are Medicaid funding and parental      involvement. The attached memo (#1) discusses these issues in      some more detail.           memo #1--future of traditional abortion litigation                          I. Traditional work       When the Center was founded in 1992, its staff was already      well-known for the litigation conducted at the ACLU's      Reproductive Freedom Project. The Center built on that      reputation and, through the 1990's, solidified its position      as the preeminent team litigating on reproductive rights in      the U.S, with the largest caseload by far of any other group.      The Center's reputation developed because of its willingness      to litigate issues others had discarded (e.g., waiting      periods and, originally, the ``purpose'' prong of Casey      (which has since been eviscerated by the Supreme Court)), its      determination to push the envelope with legal theories that      were sometimes on the edge, and because of the sheer     volume of cases we have been able to handle with a fairly      small staff. We have also earned a reputation as being very      client focused--often assisting clients with issues that      arise in their day-to-day operations--issues that other      attorneys either cannot or will not handle (a recent example      is the litigation in Michigan over the payment provision in      the amendment to the waiting period statute, an issue the      ACLU RFP declined to litigate). Although often in a defensive      posture, challenging restrictive legislation enacted in the      states, the Center sought to use this litigation to restrict      the reach of Casey's undue burden standard and to strengthen      the ``state interest'' inquiry in privacy and equal      protection claims.       Recently, the frustration of funders with the current      Administration and anti-choice Congress, and their assault on      reproductive rights and the judiciary, has led some to      question the usefulness of traditional abortion litigation.      What good is all our work if the Bush Administration can      simply take it all away with the stroke of a pen, by, for      example, enacting the federal partial-birth abortion ban that      we are currently fighting?       Therefore, we are examining whether our traditional work      will continue or whether we need to anticipate a new legal      landscape, either because limitations on the right to choose      will be firmly established and viable legal challenges will      dwindle or because Roe v. Wade will be overturned or      substantially undermined, also eliminating the cases that      make up much of our current docket.       A. Will Our Traditional Work Continue in Its Current Form?       This group examined our traditional work, particularly      focusing on whether we should alter the standards we use to      evaluate whether to bring a case in one of our traditional      areas, such as TRAP, parental involvement, abortion bans,      biased counseling/mandatory delay laws. We believe this work      will continue, though in some altered forms. Two examples      are:       It is unlikely that we will bring another federal court      challenge to a requirement that women make two-trips to their      abortion provider, but we will continue to evaluate whether      these laws can be challenged on other grounds and whether a      state court challenge is appropriate;       We may bring limited challenges to TRAP schemes,      particularly where they threaten patient privacy (the outcome      of our Arizona TRAP case on appeal to the Ninth Circuit will      be important here). B. Additional ``Affirmative'' Litigation To Bring in Our Traditional                                  Areas?       We also examined whether there is additional      ``affirmative'' litigation we should bring. While we think      there is probably only one more viable state constitutional      challenge to a Medicaid funding ban left, we believe that we      should do additional research on state constitutional equal      protection case law to insure that this is the case. Coming      off our recent successes in Alaska and Florida, we have      considerable expertise in state constitutional challenges to      laws forcing parental involvement in a minor's decision to      have an abortion. We will determine whether to move forward      in any more states as part of our Systematic Campaign      discussed in Memo #2.       We are also following through with our cases challenging      Choose Life license plates and the fundraising these plates      do for so-called Crisis Pregnancy Centers. We are currently      seeking law firm support for new cases in two or three      states.        II. What is the framework for answering these questions?       In developing our plans for new litigation, we will balance      the following factors: impact on clients; impact on women;      helpful to jurisprudence; distinguishing ourselves from the      field by taking on issues others wouldn't; dominating      specific areas to insure CRR's impact in that area; other      organizations' involvement in these issues; institutional      resources; and costs.  MEMO #2--REPORT TO STRATEGIC PLANNING PARTICIPANTS FROM SYSTEMATIC                            APPROACH SUBGROUP       This group met to discuss ``systematic approaches'' or      ``campaigns'' that CRR might pursue. We considered five      possible topics for such an approach: (1) minors' access to      reproductive health care; (2) developing our use of equal      protection jurisprudence to protect reproductive rights; (3)      minimizing the burdens of the undue burden standard; (4)      abortion funding/Harris v. McRae issues; and (5) developing      our use of first amendment jurisprudence to protect      reproductive rights. These topics were suggested at the      initial strategy meeting of the domestic program. For each      topic, we considered whether a campaign would be useful to      the field, what the positives and negatives would be to      pursuing the campaign, whether the Center is well-positioned      to pursue the campaign, and how the campaign might be      effectuated.       It is our opinion that our field would benefit from a      systematic approach in the first two of these areas--minors      and equal protection--and that the Center is well-positioned      to pursue such an approach in those areas. We believe that      the Center needs to undertake work in the third area--undue      burden--but that such work may not be well-suited to the      context of a campaign. Finally, it is our opinion that a      systematic approach would not be productive or useful to the      field with respect to the last two areas--funding and first      amendment. This does not mean that we wouldn't do work in      these areas but just that they do not lend themselves as well      to a systematic campaign.       The following is a summary of our discussion of the five      possible campaign areas. For each area, we have included an      articulation of the possible campaign and some thoughts about      the positives and negatives of pursuing that campaign. With      respect to the three areas where we thought a campaign--or,      in the case of undue burden, other work--might be useful, we      have also included some possible elements for the campaign.                               I. Minors       Articulation: A project to secure the fundamental right of      minors to access all reproductive health services      confidentially. This includes: (1) undoing the notion that      parental rights are an adequate justification for imposing      additional burdens on minors seeking abortions or other      reproductive health care; (2) staving off efforts to require      parental involvement for minors seeking contraception and      abortion; (3) undoing child abuse reporting requirements with      respect to non-abusive sexual relations; (4) ensuring minors'      ability to consent to all reproductive health services; (5)      establishing minors' right to comprehensive information about      reproductive and sexual health.       Positives: (1) This has always been one of our priority      areas. (2) We are seeing the antis push hard to diminish      minors' rights, so we should see what we can come up with to      push hard back (i.e., being proactive in addition to      defensive). (3) The topic lends itself well to a systematic      approach. (4) The issue extends beyond abortion. (5) This is      a topic about which we can coordinate efforts with our      international program.       Negatives: (1) In terms of parental involvement for      abortion, we have large body of federal case law against us      (which makes our campaign harder), and the reasoning of that      case law could be applied to contraception. (2) It is very      difficult to garner public and legislative support on issues      concerning minors. (3) We will likely have to confront the      politically difficult issue of whether minors have a right to      have sex (and more generally, whether minors should be      treated as adults). (4) This area involves difficult line      drawing and subtle points that are difficult to convey to      the public in an appealing way. (5) There is growing      opposition amongst minors to abortion and being pro-choice      (or at least a national pro-life campaign aimed at teens      that is garnering more public attention).       Possible Elements:       (1) Legal research and writing to (a) debunk the extent of      parental rights currently recognized; (b) discuss the      development of minors' legal rights generally; and (c)      analyze sodomy and death penalty cases to see how courts and      litigants have relied on evolving societal norms and social      science evidence.       (2) Comprehensive survey of available scientific evidence      supporting our positions (e.g. re: competency of minors,      importance of confidentiality for access), to use to (a)      strengthen our position and to (b) assess where we need to      fill in the gaps.       (3) Follow up to fill in the gaps with additional studies,      development of expert witnesses, etc.       (4) Work with major medical groups to develop and expand      public policy regarding minors' ability to consent to medical      care and need for confidentiality.       (5) Advance legislation re: minors' ability to consent to      care and confidentiality of care.       (6) Develop litigation--bring facial challenges to non-     abortion consent and confidentiality issues in federal court;      as-applied challenges to parental involvement for abortion      laws in federal court; state courts cases to establish rights      or minors.       (7) Public education strategy to support legislative/     litigation efforts.       (8) Develop an international component, which looks at      international norms on the rights of children.                          II. Equal protection       Articulation: Project to expand the use of equal protection      doctrine to protect women's access to abortion and      contraception. This includes: (1) reversing decisions      indicating that pregnancy and abortion discrimination are not      sex discrimination; and (2) developing the fundamental rights      strand of equal protection to prevent singling out of      abortion and abortion patients from rest of medicine for the      imposition of special burdens.       Positives: (1) This is an area of law that we could do more      with. (2) Because this area of law is not yet firmly      established in the abortion arena, we don't have to overcome      lots of precedent to be able to make progress. (3) Equal      protection claims get us out from under some of the proof      difficulties we have with undue burden claims. (4) This      project is more accessible to the public than the undue      burden project. (5) This project gives us a way to talk about      abortion in terms of fairness and discrimination principles,      which are appealing and understandable to the public. (6)      This issue is important to our goal of ensuring access to      abortion. (7) This project might be able to be combined with      the undue burden project.       Negatives: None articulated other than the potential for      bad outcomes, which exists with all five possible projects,      and the fact that federal courts have not yet been receptive      to equal protection arguments where they have been advanced.       Possible Elements:       (1) Legal research and writing as to (a) abortion as sex      discrimination; (b) abortion discrimination under the      fundamental rights     strand; and (c) analyze sodomy and death penalty cases to see      how courts and litigants have relied on evolving societal      norms and social science evidence.       (2) Analysis of how equal protection jurisprudence has      evolved in other areas.       (3) Public education to talk about abortion laws (and other      obstacles to repro health care) as both discrimination      against women and unfair discrimination against abortion.       (4) Look to expand the litigation areas in which we push      equal protection claims and state ERA claims (e.g.      contraceptive equity, challenges to abortion restrictions as      applied to medical abortion).       (5) Analysis of the kinds of factual development we should      do in cases in which we bring equal protection claims.       (6) Development of studies helpful to our equal protection      claims such as (a) study comparing the morbidity and      mortality of abortion with that for other office surgeries;      (b) study establishing that other health care decisions women      make are comparable to the abortion decision in relevant      respects.       (7) Develop strategies for advancing legislation that would      add to women's protections against sex discrimination in      health care (e.g. establishing that disparate impact on      pregnant women is sex discrimination).                           III. Undue burden       Articulation: Project to limit the'application of the undue      burden standard and to increase its ``bite'' so as to bring      it as close to strict scrutiny as possible. This includes:      (1) limiting the application of the undue burden standard      (e.g. requiring a health exception and service of a      legitimate state interest regardless of burdens); (2)      developing meaningful purpose prong challenges; and (3)      developing case law establishing some burdens as undue.       Positives: (1) The law in this area is not yet fully      developed so we have some more room to make progress than we      do in other areas. (2) Progress in this area would positively      affect all our abortion cases. (3) This issue is important to      our goal of ensuring access to abortion.       Negatives: (1) This project is difficult to support through      public education or media (since it is so legally-focused).      (2) These kinds of cases are very resource-intensive. (3)      Successes in these factually-intense cases can be difficult      to apply more broadly.       Possible Elements:       (1) Analysis of federal courts' application of the undue      burden standard and assessment of where they have improperly      articulated the standard.       (2) Legal research and writing regarding (a) how the      standard should be interpreted; and (b) areas where we can      try to limit application of the standard (e.g., with health      exceptions, lack of legitimate state interest).       (3) Analysis of which types of abortion restrictions      actually have the effect of imposing the greatest burdens.       (4) Obtain studies demonstrating the effects of those most      burdensome laws.       (5) Litigation challenging those most burdensome laws in      favorable circuits.                              IV. Funding       Articulation: A project to overturn Harris v. McRae by      building upstate court opinions, state legislation and      factual bases to compel the Supreme Court to overrule its      prior decision as it did in Lawrence v. Texas with respect to      Bowers v. Hardwick. The strategy would be to showthat the law      and social standards have evolved since Harris v. McRae in      recognition of the fact that, for poor women, access to      public funding for abortion is part of their constitutional      right.       Positives: Funding is one of our priority issues, and the      Harris decision has had a very significant on women's access      to abortion.       Negatives: Unlike what happened with sodomy laws, we are      not going to be able to get an expansion of abortion funding      rights in the states: we are running out of state courts to      rule in our favor on the funding issue, and in most states we      have no chance of getting the legislature to act in our      favor.                           V. First amendment       Articulation: Project to enhance reproductive rights      through the development of first amendment theories in areas      like specialty license plates and biased counseling.       Positives: (1) We could try to develop this area of law, in      which we have had some success; (2) restrictions that are      imposed on speech about abortion, and preferences given to      antiabortion speech, undermine the right by contributing to      an anti-choice public dialogue about our issue.       Negatives: (1) First amendment theories have limited      application to restrictions on reproductive rights; (2) this      area does not lend itself as well to a ``campaign.''    Memo #3--REPORT TO STRATEGIC PLANNING PARTICIPANTS FROM ``OTHER                          LITIGATION'' SUBGROUP       This group met to discuss ``other litigation'' that CRR      might pursue in addition to areas in our current docket. We      focused on three main areas: (1) contraception; (2) women of      color; and (3) misleading information. These topics were      discussed at the initial strategic planning meeting of the      domestic program. For each of these topics, we considered      some of the possible ways that we might pursue work in these      areas; the positives and negatives of pursuing these      strategies; and possible elements pursuing these issues might      entail.                            I. Contraception       Articulation: The Center's commitment to reproductive      rights includes a woman's right to control if and when she      becomes pregnant. We considered possible ways that we may be      able to expand our work in the area of contraception,      including potentially focusing on: (a) funding restrictions      (e.g., restrictions in Medicaid, Title X, and in abstinence-     only programs); (b) government restrictions, both on a macro      and micro level (e.g., statutes and or regulations; police      harassment of sex workers by destroying condoms; school      policies that prohibit condom distribution); (c) Title VII      and Title IX cases, expanding the Title VII precedents into      the university setting; and (d) women of color's specific      concerns in this area (e.g., steering towards certain      methods; unique access issues; and implications in      sentencing).       Positives: (1) This is an area in which the Center has had      a long-standing commitment and it would affirm that      commitment to litigate issues affecting access to      contraception. (2) Work in this area could have a significant      impact on the lives of women. (3) Increasing access to      contraception is much less controversial than abortion. This      could be potentially significant to donors, press, public,      and courts. (4) Expanding our work in this area would      undercut the criticism that we are solely an abortion-rights      organization.       Negatives: (1) It is difficult to find legal theories to      pursue many of the areas identified. (2) In those areas where      legal theories are clearly articulated (e.g., Title VII and      Title IX), it is difficult to find women willing to be      plaintiffs and there are many groups pursuing these goals.       Possible Elements:       (1) Research and assess whether there are viable legal      avenues to pursue in this area;       (2) In those areas where there are well-articulated viable      legal avenues, assess whether or how much resources the      Center should direct in light of other groups' commitment to      these issues;       (3) Collaborate with groups that are working more directly      with these issues to see if we can educate ourselves to      possible litigation opportunities;       (4) Assess whether there are non-litigation opportunities      and consider if this is an area we would consider directing      resources.                           II: Women of Color       Articulation: Laws restricting access to reproductive      health services disproportionately affect women of color and      women facing economic barriers. Our litigation work on      funding bans is an example of our long-standing commitment to      this area; however, we need to explore other ways of      addressing the needs of this population head-on. While the      work of the International Legal Program deals with many of      these issues, we realize that the Domestic Legal Program      could place more specific emphasis in this arena. Some of the      possible areas of litigation which cross-over with ILP are:      (1) women in the criminal justice system; (2) immigration;      and (3) trafficking; and (4) safe motherhood/pregnancy.       Positives: (1) This has always been one of our priority      issues; (2) we cannot claim to be serving the reproductive      health needs of women in the U.S. if we are ignoring issues      specific to women of color; (3) the issue extends beyond      abortion; and (4) we may be able to coordinate efforts with      the International Legal Program.       Negatives: (1) We are not sure that legal strategies are      the most useful strategies to combat reproductive health      issues specific to women of color and economically      disadvantaged women; (2) we have little experience (and some      would say credibility) in this area, other than defense of      women being prosecuted for drug use and our Medicaid cases,      and, therefore, would first need to take a systematic look at      the needs of women confronting racial and economic barriers,      and would need to devote the resources to do this properly;      (3) cases in this realm might involve non-impact litigation,      which we aren't as accustomed to taking on; and (4) we are a      department/organization comprised largely of economically      advantaged white women, which undermines our credibility      in this area.       Possible Elements:        (1) Focus on areas in which we already have some      expertise, e.g., treatment of pregnant women who use drugs or      abuse alcohol, women in prisons and funding issues.        (2) Identify other areas in which specific issues facing      women with economic and social barriers could be remedied or      addressed through legal strategies, e.g., issues facing      immigrants and migrant workers, and safe motherhood/pregnancy      issues.        (3) Work in partnership and build relationships with other      groups working on issues affecting the health of women of      color.        (4) Identify legal strategies.                      III. Misleading Information       Articulation: This area includes the following issues,      which we believe contain misleading information by      definition, or often incorporate misleading information: (1)      abstinence-only education; (2) abortion/breast cancer link;      (3) crisis pregnancy centers (``CPC's''); and projects by      anti organizations such as Life Dynamics Inc. (``LDI'') that      distribute misleading information. The most noteworthy      project by LDI was their campaign to public schools      indicating that a school, or school employee, could be      legally liable for distributing reproductive health      information to students.       Positives: (1) Distribution of misleading information      regarding reproductive health care can have devastating      effects and undermines our goal of enabling women to be      knowledgeable and obtain safe and medically     appropriate reproductive health care; (2) this has been a      more recent and successful campaign by the antis, both to      the public and in the courts; (3) outing the antis as      liars would undermine their credibility; (4) although      several medical and health people and groups, as well as      legislators, are outraged by these tactics, there hasn't      been much success in countering these attacks; thus, we      could stand out on these issues. In fact, we are the only      group with significant experience litigating (and      refuting) the claims of an abortion-breast cancer link.       Negatives: (1) We have struggled for years without much      success to try to develop legal theories to attack these      issues proactively; (2) we think that there might be viable      non-constitutional legal theories, but we are not experts in      some of those areas and therefore don't even know of the      existence of some avenues; (3) cases in this realm might      involve non-impact litigation, which we aren't as accustomed      to taking on; (4) individual cases in this area often are      seen as less important than the impact litigation facing us      and, therefore, fall through the cracks; (5) LDI has been      quite careful to try to stay within legal bounds with their      misleading attacks.       Possible Elements:       (1) Decide if this area is a priority for us and determine      if that depends on whether we can litigate in the area or      not. If so, proceed to the following elements;       (2) Brainstorm regarding litigation versus non-litigation      tactics;       (3) Do fact research on types of misleading information and      then prioritize potential attacks on the different types of      dissemination;       (4) Do legal research in obvious areas with which we are      familiar--i.e., First Amendment entanglement/establishment      clause (see license plate cases and the Gibbons case in E.D.      La.);       (5) Determine how to familiarize ourselves with other areas      of law that we're not so familiar with--including business      torts such as interference with business, torts, false      advertising--both currently and how to keep abreast of      changes in the area (have a law firm do a CLE for us and be      our consultant on such matters?);       (6) If lawsuits are a viable option, decide how to proceed      with them (alone? With a law firm?).       What are our criteria for project and site selection? Do we      have ``clients''? Are they our NGO partners? Women in need?      UN agencies? Sister organizations in the US/Europe? How can      we make these ``clients'' more a part of our strategic      planning and priority setting?                C. Integrating the Center's Program Work       The Center's work in the U.S. and abroad has proceeded on      independent tracks (e.g., we have not used the international      human rights strategies in the U.S.). Should the new interest      by the Supreme Court suggest we should be taking a human      rights approach in the U.S.? What would that involve? Are      there other ways in which our domestic and international work      could be integrated?                                  ____            Strategic Planning: Communications--First Steps       Like the other programs at the Center, domestic and      international, Communications needs to be strategic. And for      Communications to be strategic, the Center must have a      clearly articulated goal.       So the first question we must ask is, Why communications?      What purpose does it serve for the Center?       Depending on the organization, Communications strategies      vary widely. Here are two examples from two organizations      whose Communications programs I directed before coming to the      Center.                       Two Communications Models       The Vera Institute of Justice had an entrepreneurial goal.      We wanted government officials to hire us to make government      justice systems fairer and more efficient. We believed that      without actual government investment in the research and      projects we piloted, there wouldn't be the necessary will to      change. And we wanted to be known, unlike government      bureaucracy, as an organization that got things done.       This goal meant that Communications strategy focused on      marketing more than advocacy. We developed strong research      reports and briefing papers, as well as attractive and      forceful ``identity'' materials (that described what we do).      We also established the president and other key staff and      colleagues as trusted and authoritative resources. But we      kept a very low media profile, with a few exceptions. For      example, when we launched our citizens' jury project, which      essentially acted as ombudsman for jurors in New York City      courts, Judge Kaye encouraged us to publicize it as much as      possible, because we wanted New York City residents to use      the service. For the most part, however, we sought less to      get our name in the media than, to change the quality of      reporting on criminal justice. So we held a seminar for      editors and reporters at which they and criminal justice      experts exchanged (no holds barred) views on how the media      could do a better job and how researchers could help them do      it.       An adjunct goal of Vera's was to encourage the next      generation of government official or public interest lawyer      who might become our partner in future projects or perform      pro bono work for us. For example, we invited law firms to      propose young partners to attend a series of after-work      seminars we held, introducing them to high-level officials in      NYC government who could explain how various parts of the      justice system worked.       The International Women's Health Coalition had a very      different goal: to promote and protect women's and girls'      reproductive and sexual health and rights. Our strategy      focused in inserting a gender perspective into international      policies and agreements, either directly through our own      staff's involvement with global entities such as the      World Health Organization or, on a country level, through      funding and technical assistance to groups trying to      change national and regional policy.       Communications developed and provided written and      audiovisual ``tools'' to these groups (case studies of      successful programs, how-to manuals, etc.), as well as policy      papers, disseminating them widely through our website, and,      when possible, publishing in peer-review journals.       We also engaged aggressively with the media, partly in      order to embarrass the Bush administration for its failure to      support the reproductive rights and needs of women globally.      This included the development of Bush and Congress Watch fact      sheets detailing the actions and appointments of this      Administration that held back progress on women's      reproductive rights both domestically and internationally.       Because IWHC also cared about involving the next generation      of leadership, we too brought together potential leaders      doing cutting-edge work from around the world to encourage      dialogue and generate momentum for change. Communications      sometimes published the results of those dialogues.             Center for Reproductive Rights: Key Questions       In order to develop effective Communications strategies, we      must first ask questions like these:       Is our goal to increase our visibility or is it to change      how people think about the Center? If it is to become better      known, for what and by whom?       What is different about the Center now as compared to      earlier in its history? What do we want people to understand      about how we've changed?       Is our goal to make people understand reproductive rights      as human rights?       What is unique about our organization that we want people      to know? What people?       Do we want to be known as a cutting edge organization that      generates innovative ideas, i.e. a think tank for litigation      and jurisprudence?       Do we have a special role to play to encourage thinking      about the proper role of the courts in protecting      reproductive rights?                                  ____ Center for Reproductive Rights--Strategic Planning Workshop, November                                 10, 2003                                 agenda     Overview       1.

We have not included descriptions of our state and      federal programs as well as our ongoing counsel to providers      and patients.)       Domestic Legal Program. Our core strategy domestically is      the use of high-impact litigation to secure the highest      constitutional protections for women's reproductive rights.      Our domestic staff attorneys are among the most senior and      experienced reproductive rights litigators in the country.      With 21 cases in 13 states--on issues ranging from abortion      bans to funding restrictions to forced parental involvement      laws--we have the largest and most diverse docket of any pro-     choice organization in the United States.       The Center has won two landmark cases before the United      States Supreme Court: Stenberg v. Carhart (striking down      Nebraska's so-called ``partial-birth abortion'' ban as an      unconstitutional violation of Roe v. Wade) and Ferguson v.      City of Charleston (affirming the right to confidential      medical care and informed consent by striking down a drug-     testing scheme targeting poor women of color). In addition,      we have:       Secured and restored Medicaid funds for low-income women      seeking abortions, with victories in 14 states;       Successfully fought ``partial birth abortion'' bans and      other access restrictions, with victories in 16 states; and       Challenged parental consent and notification laws, with      victories in 5 states.       International Legal Program. The Center's international      program works to establish reproductive rights as. human      rights by using international law and legal mechanisms to      advance legal norms and secure women's access to quality      reproductive health care globally. We are the world's only      organization of international human rights lawyers that focus      exclusively and extensively on reproductive rights. Nearly      all of our international legal advisors come from the regions      we cover; all have honed their skills at top law schools,      legal organizations and national-level NGO's before joining      the Center. At the heart of our international work is a      commitment to building a global network for reproductive      rights legal advocacy by building the capacity of NGO's to      use international human rights laws and mechanisms to advance      reproductive rights.       The Center's international program implements four key      strategies:       Researching and reporting on national laws, policies and      judicial decisions;       Advocating in international and regional human rights fora;       Documenting reproductive rights violations in fact-finding      reports; and       Training NGO's and lawyers through legal fellowships and      visiting attorney programs, workshops, published and online      resources and other technical assistance.       Key accomplishments under these strategies include:       Conceptualizing and publishing the Women of the World (WOW)      series. Non-governmental organizations must be able to      identify national and regional legal obstacles to furthering      reproductive rights in order to craft effective advocacy      strategies for removing them. No comprehensive listing of      laws and policies existed, however, until the Center launched      the WOW series in 1996. Researched and written with partner      NGOs, these regional reports document the laws and policies      of 50 nations. They cover a range of issues, including:      health, abortion, population and family planning,      contraception, safe motherhood and women's legal status. To      date, we have completed four regional reports: Anglophone      Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Francophone Africa,      and East Central Europe.       Publishing Bodies On Trial, which documents a significant      gap between reproductive rights law and judicial      interpretation in five Latin American countries. The Center's      150-page report serves as a resource not only in Latin      America and the Caribbean but in other regions where      advocates are evaluating potential litigation strategies to      advance reproductive rights.       Filing groundbreaking legal cases in the Inter-American      human rights system and in the UN Human Rights Committee,      with two successful settlements to date to ensure that Peru's      government abides by international agreements and its      existing reproductive rights-related laws.       Securing favorable interpretations of international human      rights law from UN and regional human rights bodies, and      documenting the increasingly progressive jurisprudence of the      UN Treaty-Monitoring bodies in our 300-page report, Bringing      Rights to Bear.       Investigating reproductive rights violations in over seven      countries, including two reports on Chile and El Salvador      that highlighted the role of criminal abortion laws in      maternal mortality and two reports that generated significant      public pressure to reform criminal abortion laws in Nepal and      to safeguard women's rights to informed consent in Slovakia.       Providing technical assistance and capacity to use legal      strategies to advance reproductive rights to over 100      organizations in over 45 countries, including training over      16 lawyers in reproductive rights advocacy at our New York      office for periods of at least three months.       Launching the Safe Pregnancy Project, a series of fact-     finding reports that document laws and policies contributing      to maternal mortality in select countries, and make      recommendations for change. Our first report, on Mali, was      released in February 2003 and presented at the landmark      Amanitare Conference in South Africa in March.       Advancing adolescents' access to reproductive health      services through reporting, fact-finding and legal advocacy.      Our WOW reports specifically isolate legal and policy      barriers to adolescents' reproductive and sexual health and      rights. Our analysis of the Convention on the Rights of the      Child is a definitive resource for advocates and key UN staff      alike, as is our fact-finding report, State of Denial, on the      inadequate legal and policy protections of adolescents'      access to services and information in Zimbabwe.       Establishing our website as the go-to online resource for      international reproductive rights legal advocacy. In the past      year, advocates in over 150 countries downloaded over 250,000      Center publications.                                  ____ The Center for Reproductive Rights Summary and Synthesis of Interviews       In August, September, and October of 2003, Nancy Raybin and      Elizabeth Lowell of Raybin Associates conducted some 18      strategic planning interviews with members of the Center's      Board of Directors (10), representatives of long-term      institutional funders (5), and colleagues at other      organizations concerned with reproductive rights (3). (We did      not discuss funding opportunities with any specificity during      these conversations because these issues were being addressed      in separate Development Assessment interviews by Miller/     Rollins.)       We also interviewed members of the management team and      other Center staff and facilitated several brainstorming      sessions with Center staff of both the Domestic Program and      the International Program. All of these (continuing)      conversations, either face-to-face or by telephone (when      geography or schedule did not permit a personal meeting),      focused on creating a vision and future strategies for the      Center. Raybin Associates' work intentionally did not focus      on internal management and organization, as that had been the      subject of fairly recent strategic planning work.       A ``white paper,'' prepared by President Nancy Northup, was      sent to each study participant prior to the interview. Some      interviewees read the material, some did not, and several      Trustees felt that they did not know enough to comment      intelligently on the issues and questions raised in the      paper. In most instances, they deferred on issues of strategy      to Center staff, whom they trust to define and set the      direction for the future. Board members unequivocally      welcomed the Center's new Director and praised the staff's      legal expertise.       The remarks below are both a synthesis and summary of what      we learned in our interviews with Trustees, funders, and      colleagues. There is no input here from the staff workshops.      We have separated the comments made by Trustees from those      made by funders and colleagues. A copy of our Interview      Guideline is appended; it is important to note that some      participants' lack of knowledge meant that many of our      questions were not addressed.                           mission and vision                       Differentiating the Center       Most Trustees noted that what differentiates the Center is      its law and legal work. They noted ``expertise around      Reproductive Rights (RR) and Human Rights (HR),''      ``brilliant, focused, sophisticated lawyers who can fight and      win,'' and ``who work on the `cutting edge.' '' One Trustee      noted that it is the only organization working on the legal      and     human rights aspects of RR, but most felt at a loss to speak      concisely and specifically about what the Center does that      makes it different from other ``players'' in the field.      Trustees also cited international work as a unique aspect of      the Center, but were unclear as to the specifics of this      work.       Funders and Colleagues could, and did, give definition to      the international role. They talked about the Center's role      in ``linking groups of people trying to advance women's      issues globally,'' how the Center helps ``to define and      challenge national legal systems,'' and how ``finely-honed      the legalistic work'' is. One funder declared, however,      that the legalistic often comes at the expense of economic      and social justice--and gave a stark example of a Somali      woman.       While one funder noted that the Center is unique because of      its strong commitment to RR, two others noted: ``other      organizations are also grappling with these issues.'' ``The      Center should place itself within the range of other groups      which do similar work. . . . It is not enough to assert you      are unique--you must describe why.'' ``The Center is not      unique in litigation; both Planned Parenthood and the ACLU      also litigate: How are the client base and issues different      and has the Center deliberately developed their expertise      accordingly . . . or has it just happened?'' One colleague      asked about how the Center views itself: ``as a litigating      organization or as a broader advocacy group?''          Articulating a broad vision for the next five years       Trustees hold the Center's staff in extremely high regard.      Their level of respect and trust is extraordinary. Most      Trustees would largely defer to staff in setting the vision      for the future and determining the direction. Having said      that, most believe that the domestic focus should still be on      abortion. Several Trustees mentioned that they would also      like to see work in the related areas of Emergency      Contraception (EC), contraceptive equity and comprehensive      sex education, including work with adolescents.       Most Trustees think that the image and reputation of the      Center needs clarifying and heightening and that      collaboration with other RR and HR groups would help to      improve the Center's visibility as well as move the agenda(s)      forward.       Funders and colleagues believe strongly that the broad      vision for the next five years must be ``ruthlessly      prioritized.'' ``Their approach should be outcomes-oriented.      It's not good enough just to research, write and present.      Engineer backwards from what they want to see happen.'' ``I      understand the causal model of theory of change; spell it out      for us; define the outcome you expect . . . not just winning      decisions.'' Most see this as requiring more sharing of      expertise. Indeed, partnering with other organizations, both      domestic and international, was a strong and recurrent theme      in all of their comments. Nepal and Slovakia were cited as      examples. where the Center had identified local groups with      which to work and had been successful. Acknowledging that the      Center cannot do it all, ``after the outcomes are defined,      then the Center needs to determine who best to work with      locally.'' ``Greater collaboration must be a defining      characteristic of the Center's future work.''       In speaking about the international program, one colleague      suggested that ``publicly shaming a country, so that it is      coerced in doing the right thing (the Amnesty International      model) will not work around Reproductive Rights. If, however,      the ILP saw itself as a midwife to the global choice      movement, that would be a longer-term, albeit, less glamorous      vision.''       Funders and colleagues also envision the need for      continuing emphasis on Reproductive Rights. ``We must `stay      the course.' '' Several commented: ``the Center must continue      as the legal reference point for policy implications and      shaping thinking and monitoring.'' Most called for a more      proactive stance identifying and analyzing trends--and      potential backlash. ``This is a real need--and one that      the Center could fill. They need to tell the rest of us      what's coming down the pike.'' Added another: ``The Center      needs to think through the leadership role it can play . .      . there is a gap at the national level, which the Center      could fill.''       They would also like to see the Center ``provide new and      useful information and training'' and ``more paper for      colleagues and constituents.'' ``We should get something      every three to six months from the Center about what's      happening in the field.'' ``But, there is so much information      reaching people in the RR arena that if the Center were to      spend time better packaging and abbreviating materials, it      would get more mileage out of its work.'' ``Electronic      newsletters are effective.'' Several funders proposed a      serious analysis of Roe v. Wade soon to ascertain the      roadblocks lying ahead and the best options for addressing      them. None thought that Roe v. Wade would fall, but that it      ``might be left out there, hanging all by itself . . . Then      what? We need to think that through now.'' ``What happens      after PBA? If we win? If we lose? The legal win should not      become the public relations loss. There must be a strategy      for this.''                 Involving and energizing constituents       Trustees, finders and colleagues agree that shaping the      Center's focus and making it more easily articulated will      help constituents become more involved. ``If we comprehend it      ourselves and can explain it to others, we are more likely to      activate people.'' Trustees noted: ``our inability to clearly      articulate makes us poor ambassadors for the cause.''      Trustees would also like to see a succinct list of successes,      both domestic and international, with a timeline, and an      explanation of the impact and practicality of these      successes. A visual of what has been accomplished in RR--     since the Center's founding would help to bring home the ``so      what factor''--``So what difference have we made?''       Funders and colleagues emphasize that consistent partnering      with other groups will strengthen the Center's overall      visibility, present constituents with the bigger picture and      bigger numbers, thereby offering more assurance - ``there's      some safety in numbers.'' They stress that the Center should      take the time now to identify who those long-term partners      might be, both domestic and international, and if      relationships do not now exist, begin to build them. They      further cautioned that in all collaboration the ``emphasis      should be on the success of the work rather than the      credit.'' ``The need to be the dominant partner can sap      energy and good will.''                          STRATEGY and PROGRAM                       Assessing progress to date       Most Trustees said that the Center ``does program and      strategy well,'' but they were short on specifics. Most      believe that the Center ``litigates well.'' Backing up this      assertion, two Trustees cited the Center's role in the      Nebraska case and its work on Partial Birth Abortion      (PBA). Several others referred to its pro-active role      around EC. They noted that, despite domestic ``wins,'' the      current political climate undercuts the Center's work.       One Trustee cited progress in Chile and Mexico, which could      not have happened without the Center's activities. All knew      that litigation around abortion was a domestic hallmark, but      most could not explain the essential components of the      international programs. One did, however, single out the      ``spectacular WOW reports, their use at the UN and their      import to other international organizations working in the RR      and HR arena. Another cited the work in Nepal.       Funders and colleagues alike felt that ``the Center has      moved well since its founding.'' More familiar with the      international component than the Trustees, three mentioned      ``fabulous'' reports . . . but ``want to know what happens      next.'' One said candidly, ``I am unable to assess--it's been      all over the place,'' but remarked that the Center is most      effective bringing attention to the issues.'' Nearly all      funders and colleagues were familiar with and spoke highly of      the work in Nepal. ``It demonstrated change processes, the      train of intervention, the change itself and needed follow-     up.'' And one referred passionately to the ``practical,      hands-on-quantifiable, usable-elsewhere, most effective work      in Slovakia.''       With one exception (who did not think the Center should      devote itself to international work at all), funders and      colleagues felt that the international program could be more      effective by ``working on a country by country basis.''      ``Legislative debates are needed; they have proven useful and      educational elsewhere.'' One argued for taking more cases      internationally through the European Court of Human Rights.      And, returning to the issue of collaboration, one funder said      that the Center has been least effective internationally      ``when it goes off on its own initiatives that are not well-     developed with other partners.''                           Measuring success       Trustees, funders and colleagues were unaware of any      systematic or specific efforts to measure the Center's      success. All agreed, however, that measurements and      benchmarks will be important moving forward. Some said, ``the      hard data--what's quantifiable--is the easy part--number of      cases won, number of cases lost.'' What's harder, but equally      valid is the soft data--the gnalitative--which takes note of      ``laws changed (although perhaps not immediately), lives      improved, learnings which help the Center in other cases.''      ``If we lost, did we educate, create a precedent?'' There was      strong consensus overall that as new strategies are      developed,-they must be evaluated against the Center's      vision.                   Substance guiding future strategy       Several Trustees identified the ``shoring up of favorable      state constitutions'' as core to the domestic work ahead.      They also want the Center to ``identify trends.'' Funders and      colleagues looked for a more proactive role around the      intersection of needs, e.g., RR and HIV/AIDS. Again, they      stressed network building (domestically and overseas),      collaboration and outcome oriented strategies rather than      identifying specific goals, litigation or issues per se (as      requested by the interviewer). They also expressed their      belief that new leadership at the Center would embrace      these tactics.        Domestic and International programs informing each other       Trustees were not sure how the domestic and international      programs could inform or better inform each other, but they      were quite insistent that it needs to occur. They do not know      the frequency of interchange between the two staffs, although      they assume that there is some and that there should be more.       Funders and colleagues spoke about thinking collectively      with other groups to move the agenda forward, broadening the      discussion well beyond the Center staff. A greater     awareness of what others are doing nationally and      internationally ``can make us all more effective as we focus      on what each does best.'' Most talked of identifying ``cross      country issues,'' where both domestic and international could      bring experience and expertise to bear, e.g., medical      abortions, access to various forms of contraception, RR and      HIV/AIDS. Said one ``be more clear about the connection      between global and national. Look at the US impact      globally.''         Race and Ethnic Discrimination as a Program Component       All study participants recognized that minorities and the      poor are underserved in RR and HR. How this should factor in      to the Center's program development, non could specifically      say.                            Domestic Program             Expanding domestic litigation beyond abortion?       The Trustees believe that abortion is still the key issue.      But many also think that the Center should ``move beyond''      and address linked issues. They cited EC, HIV/AIDS, work,      with teens, and family planning ``wherever there are legal      issues (e.g., women denied prenatal care.)'' ``If Medicare      funding changes, will there be a legal issue there? Is there      a legal issue around the misinformation around abortion on      the government website?'       Trustees have a deep concern that the image of the Center      is ``only around abortion'' and believe that image must      change, so that the public has a greater understanding of the      overall impact on women's lives of what the Center does. One      suggested that every time the Center is litigating a case,      there be a full explanation of how the case fits into the      larger context.       One Trustee believes that Roe v. Wade could be overturned      and that the Center should begin now to develop strategy.      Another said, ``If it is overturned, we'll know in advance      and have time. We need to keep the thought in play, but we      can't focus completely on it.'' Most felt that Roe itself      would remain intact, but several concurred that, given the      current political climate, its impact could be gutted.       Only two funders commented on Roe v. Wade. One said, ``it's      not going to be overturned, but everything else will be.      Therefore, look to work at the state level.'' Another stated:      ``We need a serious analysis of the decision and come out      with an opinion whether or not to continue to defend it.      There are lots of weaknesses in the legal approach to Roe v.      Wade. If it is flawed, we need to come up with a remedy. Is      the Center satisfied that it can continue to defend it?      Commenting on other issues, one funder commented: ``Look at      the things that are winning and advancing. What is the      principle that appeals and the legal strategy that can be      derived and applies?'' Asked one colleague: ``Would the      Center take up a broader rights issue, e.g., women's access      to the full array of health services and gender choice and      what that means for women's advancement in society? Who is      active on college campuses and universities--there is a role      here that needs to be filled.''        Other Strategies To Make Forward Progress in the Courts       Most Trustees felt that there was nothing to be learned      from the Conservative Right ``because they just play a      different game.'' Another, however, remarked, ``We're not      vocal enough. People pay attention to the loud voices. We      have to fight harder, be a little dirtier. Be graphic and      show all the roadblocks.'' Said yet another, ``We should      shine a bright light on the U.S. internal policies.''       There were no specific strategies suggested for succeeding      in non-litigation areas, but many Trustees felt that the      Center should be thinking in terms of education. ``Young      women don't know what they are losing.'' ``Abortion is a      medical procedure and all medical students who enter the OB/     GYN specialty should be required to learn the procedure.      Medical school curricula must address this.'' All agreed that      collaboration is a strategy that the Center must use. Law      schools, bar associations, universities, the Alan Guttmacher      Institute, and the Brookings Institution were suggested as      potential partners.       Funders and colleagues said: ``Keep fighting.'' They      returned, yet again, to the issue of collaboration and while      most did not identify specific partners (``other mainstream      human rights groups''), they urged working together. One      quite specifically said ``the Center and the ACLU should work      reach out together to clergy, so that there are religious      voices for choice--so that we're not called `barbaric,      irreligious, immoral'--we need to have the ethical leaders of      our society with us at press conferences.'' Another noted      that the ``litigation messages need to be coordinated'' and      went on to say ``litigation alone is not going to carry the      day. It's also how to position and leverage the court cases,      so that the Center can do its long-term strategy. It's very      hard to think that way when you're preparing a brief at 120      mph.''                         International Program Global, Political, Health-Related Factors Driving Scope and Direction                          of International Work       Most Trustees felt that they did not know enough to comment      on the direction of the international work, except to say      ``helping NGO's understand and implement their laws seems      appropriate.'' One with a deeper knowledge of the      international scene remarked: ``There's a need for a catalyst      in developing countries. Help the women in Eastern and      Central Europe get their laws enforced and that new laws      don't violate basic human rights. The Center can be a      catalyst rather than an active litigant.'' Another said,      ``Step up the international work and link it with the      domestic. The US domestic policy is affecting      international programs, and we need to link with other US      organizations and do advocacy, as well as testify how the      US is affecting the health of women. We also need to train      NGO's in developing countries to make their concerns      known.'' ``Do more and link more with other HR and RR      groups.''       Funders and colleagues say that ``one size does not fit      all'' and that the Center needs to do a quick assessment on      the work already done and make a long-term commitment in a      few key places, where they can support and transfer skills to      in-country advocates, rather than coming up with an overall      rationale.'' ``Choose litigation where it will work.'' ``It      is more important for the ILP to choose well than it is for      domestic--pick certain countries because they're key priority      areas, or long-term relationships, or because--you can leave      something behind.'' ``Make smart political judgments.''      ``Collaborate with NGO's.'' Said one, ``Push the expertise      down and out.''       One interviewee talked at length about the need for      developing contacts within the European Union because ``there      is no real debate in Europe on abortion and, there is funding      available.'' Noted one colleague, ``All these factors (i.e.,      global, political, economic and health-related) drive the      scope and spectrum of the program, but it is how an issue is      seen politically, socially and culturally that makes it a      flashpoint and drives the work forward. Something often      becomes a symbol and that's what you work with. The Center      needs to be able to jump on these.''      Balancing Tensions in the Focus and Commitment of Resources       Once again, most Trustees felt themselves unequipped to      talk about this. One said, however, that the Center ``should      select issues such as abortion laws, violence against women,      adolescent law, and a more minor role in genital mutilation,      where we are better suited to be the data gatherers.'' Said      another ``select the strategic issues, those that will      command attention, linking RR and HR with rights of child/     girl. The HR link is education and protection. The Center      needs to bring out the whole discriminatory process against      groups associated with AIDS and everyone with AIDS.''       Funders and colleagues noted that the Center cannot work at      the ``wholesale'' (global) level, because the resources are      not there. ``Track and report country by country, within the      context of all other international agencies working in these      countries.'' Several commented ``it's not an `either/or.' ''      Both the human rights approach and the comparative legal      approach have merit and must work together. ``One creates an      opening and the other backs it up.'' No one wanted to see the      Center locked into mega projects, preferring ``prioritized      focus where you can make an impact'' and staying ``nimble      around opportunities.''       Asked one: ``Has there been a mapping of pro-Choice groups      in various, parts of the world, because donors need to know      who they are and how the Center can serve as a backstop?''                      ORGANIZATION and OPERATIONS       Most Trustees said that they really did not know enough to      comment on the organization and operations. All expressed      their pleasure with new Center leadership. Several voiced      concern about the expense of the Washington, DC office and      wondered aloud about its role and necessity. Most are      concerned about Center communications. They want more and      better coverage in the press. Several commented that there      needs to be ``rigorous media training for the main      spokespeople.''       When it came to talking about the Board of Directors      itself, the operative word is more.       Trustees expressed a desire for: A bigger Board; more      people on the Board with money and access to money; more      lawyers on the Board; more younger people (especially women)      on the Board; a few more doctors; and more international      representation.       They also talked about the need for substantive Board      education, more effective and efficient Board Meetings and      training in their fund-raising role. Most recognized that      they could indeed play a much more active role for the Center      and be of greater assistance with education and training than      they have been in the past.       Funders and colleagues could not comment on the Board, but      they spoke highly of staff. One said, ``They are a precious      resource with skill and focus and `on the attack.' '' Another      said, ``Given the importance of collaboration in moving      forward, it is the bridging skills that may need      strengthening. And, you may need some on-the-ground      communications/community people.'' Yet another spoke of the      need for ``better coverage in the international press.''      Another suggested that there is ``a role for a broader      education program and perhaps putting more resources into      advocacy, public education, media.''       One colleague did suggest that, in terms of structure, the      Center needs a working i.e., ``giving and getting,'' Board      and another entity composed of ``non-traditional allies--     Fortune 100 CEO's, heads of universities,     heads of major religious denominations'' to give heft and an      ethical imprimatur to its work.                         FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS                        Money for new strategies       Trustees, funders and colleagues alike have no sense of how      much money will be needed to finance new strategies. Several      Trustees and one funder spoke of redirecting more, if not      all, of the unrestricted money into the domestic program.      Said one Trustee: ``The ratio should be 6:1 Domestic to      International. It's where we need to focus our efforts.''      Most Trustees suspect that new strategies will have leaner      resources with which to be implemented and therefore, the      strategies will have to be ``very focused.''                           Source(s) of money       All study participants concur that the source of future      monies will need to be individuals. Funders said ``it's a      tough time for us. Some have left the population field; some      have been affected by the stock market. (We) don't see much      new money and the existing money is shrinking.'' One funder      pointed to a great deal of government funding available in      Europe, should the Center choose to involve itself there.                           Building capacity       Trustees worry about the age of individual donors. ``This      is an area largely funded by donors over 60 years old. Where      are the people in their 30's and 40's?'' They see a critical      role for the Center's Board in attracting the next generation      of donors who will keep the issues alive and fund them.       One colleague noted that ``the Center is way ahead of      others in capacity building,'' and without offering any      suggestions, is confident that funding will be found Funders,      colleagues and Trustees expressed confidence and hope in the      Center's new leadership and other staff (specifically,      Development, Domestic and International Program leaders) to      articulate the needs and to identify and solicit the funding      necessary to carry the Center forward.

Reactions to White Paper                           Mission and vision       What does the Center do that differentiates it from other      organizations and individuals?       What have been the Center's emphases in the ``mission and      values'' statement in the last 5 years?       How would you articulate a broad vision for the next 5      years? How will this affect: Scope of activities/projects/     docket; size; ``Competitive advantage; and Image/reputation,      etc.?       How will the Center involve and energize both internal and      external constituents, in a new and/or expanded vision?                          Strategy and Program                                Overall       How would you assess the Center's progress to date?       What does the Center do well? Less well? Why?       What have been the essential components of the domestic and      international programs?       Where/when has the Center been most effective? Least      effective?       Where/when should the Center be more pro-active?       How has the Center measured past success? How should the      Center think about and measure future success?       What should be the substance guiding the future strategy?       Specific goals we should accomplish? (Identify)       Projects that we should undertake? (Identify)       Substantive issues we should address that we are not      addressing now? (Identify)       Litigation we should pursue proactively. (Identify)       Other. (Identify).       How can the international work be more informed by the      domestic work, and vice versa?       How should the Center's concern about race and ethnic      discrimination factor into program development?    Specific (at a level of detail appropriate for the interviewee)       Should the Center expand the domestic litigation agenda      beyond its primary focus on abortion?       Do clients have other issues that we should understand and      pursue? If so, what are they?       While we have a broad set of abortion cases on our docket,      do we run the risk of running out of interesting/effective      strategies or losing our fenders' interest and support?       Do we need to develop a strategy now if Roe v. Wade is      overturned?       Are there more important/different issues that we are      missing because of our focus on abortion? Does this matter?       What other strategies can the Center pursue to make forward      progress in the courts?       What are the programmatic components of a more      comprehensive strategy?.       What can be learned from the Conservative Right as they      pursue their multi-faceted strategies to change      jurisprudence?       How can the Center succeed in non-litigation areas, e.g.,      education and training?       With whom can the Center collaborate, e.g., similar legal      organizations, advocacy and policybased reproductive rights      organizations, law schools, etc.?       What are the global political, economic, and health-related      factors that drive the scope and direction of the      international work?       How all of the different strategies required in different      parts of the world recognizing that ``one size does not fit      all?''       Given a rapidly changing world, where should the Center      focus its work to be most effective and demonstrate results?       With whom should the Center collaborate?       How should the international program balance tensions in      the focus and commitment of resources, e.g.,       ``Promoting the application of international human rights      standards to reproductive rights issues at global and      national levels (human rights approach) vs. providing      expertise on developing national-level legislation/policies      (comparative legal approach)''?       ``Focusing on certain core issues (abortion, quality of,      care, safe pregnancy, etc.) vs. consistent strategies/     activities (litigation, documenting violations, legislative      reform)''?       ``Wholesale (``global'') vs. retail (national-level)      impact''?       ``Locking ourselves into mega-projects vs. nimble and      responsive to sudden opportunities.''                      Organization and operations       What are the talents and resources-managerial, legal,      programmatic, policy, political, communication, etc-that we      need to pursue different strategies?       How should the Center shape the organization to support/     implement new strategies and take advantage of new staff and      Board leadership?       What additional structures and systems are needed to      support the Center as it grows and evolves?       What are the talents, size, and mix of star and Board we      need to successfully implement the new strategic plan? What      does the transition look like?                         Financial implications       (Not intended to be redundant with Development Audit      questions.)       How much money is needed to finance the new strategies?       Could the Center redirect current unrestricted money to      more effective new strategies?       What is the financial plan to support the new strategy?       Where will the money come from to fund our new vision/     strategy/plan?       Who are the likely donors?       What is the timing?       What are the appropriate phases?       What might we be doing now to build capacity for the      future?                  table of abbreviations and glossary                             General terms       Comparative Law--The study of legal standards from several      countries or systems.
