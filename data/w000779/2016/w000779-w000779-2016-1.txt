President, in accordance with my policy to put a notice in the Congressional Record whenever I place a hold on legislation, I object to any unanimous consent request to pass H.R. 6438, a bill to extend the waiver of limitations with respect to excluding from gross income amounts received by wrongfully incarcerated individuals. I object not because I disagree with the policy underlying this proposal--in fact, I support it--but because the Senate cannot pass this singular bill ignore the long list of other tax proposals that are outstanding or expiring at end of this Congress; among them clean energy and infrastructure incentives that create good-paying jobs, an education incentive that makes a college degree more affordable, provisions to make homes more affordable to the middle class and protect struggling homeowners from a tax bill if they negotiate mortgage debt relief.                          ____________________
