 Without sounding like a poor rendition of Johnny Cash's song ``I Have Been Everywhere, Man''--one of my favorites, I might say; he actually mentions Brattleboro, VT. If you vote for my amendment, which will be the third one, here are the States that do not lose or break even. These are the States that will be protected under current funding: Alabama, Alaska--these are States I hope will support the amendment of the Senator from Vermont, because it is to their State's benefit: Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming--I realize the District of Columbia can't vote, but if they could, they would vote with us.  Mr. President, how much time is remaining to the Senator from Vermont or is any time remaining?
