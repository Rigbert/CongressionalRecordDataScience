Madam Speaker, today Ti-Anna Wang spoke on Capitol Hill toa group of human rights advocates about her recent visit with her imprisoned father, the heroic Chinese democracy activist Wang Bingzhang. Dr. Wang is a founding father of the post-Mao Chinese democracy movement; he personally founded or co-founded a magazine, a movement, and a political party dedicated to promoting democracy.  Dr. Wang is an incredibly brave man who is serving a life sentence in China for ``espionage'' and ``terrorism''--these are the Chinese Govermnent's words for promoting democracy. In fact ``espionage'' and ``terrorism'' come close to describing the Chinese Government's own behavior in pursuing Dr. Wang, a permanent U.S. resident whom Chinese Government agents abducted from Vietnam in June 2002, smuggled back into China, and secretly held incommunicado for 6 months, before subjecting him to a ``star chamber'' trial in January 2003. The U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has ruled that Dr. Wang's detention is arbitrary.  Madam Speaker, any father would consider himself extremely blessed to have a daughter like Ti-Anna. When I first met with her, a few months ago, I was deeply moved by how determinedly she has been working for his release. I'm sure the love she is showing for her father is bearing fruit in his life, comforting him while he is in prison.  Today, Madam Speaker, is the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights--an inspiring document, much of which remains a promissory note, unredeemed by so many governments of the world. It is our duty to continue pressing the governments of the world, including our own, to live up to this declaration. Let's keep working, and keep praying, in solidarity with Dr. Wang and Ti-Anna and all those denied the rights that the Universal Declaration promotes.  Madam Speaker, I would like to introduce into the record Ti-Anna's report on her recent visit with her father and his condition.       I would like to start by thanking everyone here, on behalf      of my family, for taking the time to come to this event.      Since I started my work in DC, I've been lucky enough to be      surrounded by supportive, generous and kind people who are      genuinely concerned about my father's case. I want to take      this opportunity to thank everyone who has been involved in      his fight for freedom. More specifically, I would like to      thank Dr. Yang, Congressman Wolf, Congressman Smith,      Congressman Ros-Lehtinen, and Senator Feinstein for their      recent work on my father's case. It is the compassion of      every one here that gives my family hope and reason to      believe that the unlikely is possible.       I'm here today to tell you about my recent visit with my      father just two weeks ago. To give a little background, my      father's sentence allows for only one visit a month. Each of      these visits last about 30 minutes.       The standard procedure is that my family receives a      visitation notice in the mail that lets us know the date of      the visit.       As my whole family lives in North America, we usually have      a very short amount of time to make the necessary travel      arrangements for a long trip to China. Once there, we have to      go through a lengthy authorization process before we are      allowed to see him. For my latest visit, I had some      difficulties getting my visa as scheduled, and didn't have      the proper paperwork, which added a lot of additional stress      to this already difficult process.       The visit takes place in a bare concrete building that      borders the gate of his remote prison, several miles away      from the closest city. It is so secluded that we have to be      driven there by the prison officials, as some of the terrain      in that area has yet to be paved.       Right before we can meet, the prison authorities remind us      of the rules and regulations, which include only speaking in      Chinese, and staying away from topics that will cause my      father anxiety. These visits are conducted in visitation      booths and are monitored by four prison officials, two      standing behind the each of us.       Separated by metal bars and two layers of Plexiglas, my      father and I can only communicate using a telephone.       I was very nervous about seeing my father this time. It had      been over a year since my last visit, and my family had lost      contact with him for two months without any clear      explanations from the prison, so I was worried about the      state that my father was in. I was so relieved when I was      finally able to see him, cheerful enough to smile.       My first concern was his health. My father said that while      he is stable, his chronic allergies and severe phlebitis      continues to plague him. We talked mostly about my family, my      educational future and the work that we are doing on his      behalf. As we spoke, it was clear to me that my father's      untreated depression and psychological health continues to      worsen.       He had difficulty making steady eye contact and sometimes      repeated the same sentences several times. The prison      officials monitoring our conversation were kind enough to      allot us an extra 10 minutes.       My father wanted me to let everyone know that he is      eternally grateful for all the work that has been done on his      behalf and that he remains hopeful that justice will prevail.       As our conversation came to an end, my father began to cry.      He said the thought of never seeing his ailing 87-year-old      mother again often brings him to tears and that his only wish      is that they will be reunited before it's too late.       It has now been over 6 years that my father, now almost 62      years old, lingers alone in prison. I come here today in      hopes of conveying the message that my father's situation has      become ever more critical and his time is running out. This      is the third time I've visited my father, and it is obvious      that both his physical and mental health are deteriorating.      He has aged so much in the last few years, and his depression      is becoming dangerously severe. The prison authorities have      told my family that my father's only chance of receiving      medical parole is if he admits guilt to the charges of      ``terrorism'' and ``espionage'' . . . but I know that my      father would never, nor does my family want him to confess to      claims that are not only false, but that will comprise his      dignity and values.       As we commemorate the 60th Anniversary of the Universal      Declaration of Human Rights, I just want to remind everyone      that it is because of my father's unwavering commitment to      this cause that he is being so unjustly punished today.       As the founder of the Chinese overseas pro-democracy      movement, there was nothing harder that my father fought for      than the values of human rights, freedom and democracy for      the people of his homeland.       His contribution to his beliefs has now cost him 6 years of      solitary confinement, and possibly his life if we do not      continue to fight for his freedom.       So I would like to close today by asking the present and      new administration to call for my father's immediate release      on medical and humanitarian grounds.       I also invite everyone here, along with your friends and      family to visit www.initiativesforchina.org to sign an online      petition addressed to President Hu Jintao, also calling for      my father's release.       Lastly, I would like to work with congressional leaders      toward the goal of obtaining honorary U.S. citizenship for my      father as recognition of his lifelong service to democracy      and as a statement of America's recommitment to making human      rights a priority in its agenda.       On behalf of my family, I would like to thank everyone here      for coming and for your sincere concern for my father.                          ____________________
