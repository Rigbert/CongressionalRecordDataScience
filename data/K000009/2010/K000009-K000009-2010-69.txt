Speaker, Wall Street speculation and the disaster it caused have been clear since the bailout in the fall of 2008. More foreclosures on Main Street, higher profits for Wall Street.  I fought against that bailout, and I continue to fight for Main Street and the people who are not high powered gamblers nor high paid investors nor the mega banks. My fight is for people to regain their jobs, for people to save their homes, and for people to have their hope restored.  I've been observing the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission taking a baby step, long overdue, as watchdog of the markets that they are supposed to be regulating as enforcers of securities law.  As the New York Times reports today, rather than asserting that Goldman misrepresented a product it was selling, the most commonly used grounds for securities fraud, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a civil lawsuit filed on Friday that the investment bank misled customers about how the product was created. In fact, the SEC can only file civil cases, so it's high time to look, rather, at the apparent criminal fraud involved in and around the hidden works of Wall Street and the financial crisis it precipitated.  Last year I introduced H.R. 3995, the 2008 Financial Crisis Investigation and Prosecution Act, authorizing the Director of the FBI to hire 1,000 additional agents and additional forensic accounting experts to probe down into the misdeeds that brought down the economy of our Nation.  Though the FBI is slightly beefing up their ranks on investigating fraud, during the savings and loan scandal of the late 1980s and early 1990s 1,000 agents, as well as forensic experts, exacted justice. Today, if there are even 300 over there doing part-time work on this, that would be a high number.  Back in the eighties and nineties, that savings and loan crisis cost the people of our country $170 billion placed right squarely on the back of our taxpayers. The 2008 financial crisis could cost our people trillions of dollars. So it must be the focus of the Department of Justice to find and fight the fraud in our financial system. And they simply need more financial white collar crime agents to do so.  Citizens following the law have nothing to fear. Those committing criminal acts should know they will be caught. That is why, in addition to authorizing more FBI agents, H.R. 3995 also authorizes the hiring of more prosecutors in the Department of Justice to take those cases to trial.  In addition, the SEC has an important role in enforcement, as shown on Friday of last week, and H.R. 3995 strengthens the SEC by authorizing the hiring of more investigators.  Many groups support this effort and recognize the necessity of ensuring our financial system is rid of these criminals, and also pointing out who's profited from the harm that has been caused to the American people through their moral hazards.  No one knows exactly how much the financial crisis of 2008 will cost our taxpayers, but one way to lessen that blow to them is to claw back to the assets of those who rigged the system to their benefit and our Republic's detriment. Our citizens want those who committed crimes to be held accountable, and H.R. 3995 supports the agencies who can work for real justice.  I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill and work to support the agencies tasked with finding and fighting massive fraud in our financial system.  Furthermore, Congress should be assured that the Department of Justice is on task to find and fight this fraud.  The charges against Goldman Sachs, the speculators there, by the SEC have released a wave of response across this country. And in today's New York Times Letters to the Editor, Oliver Revell, who served for 30 years as Special Agent and Senior Executive of the FBI and as an Associate Deputy Director, wrote to the Times, ``It is clear to me that the SEC charges should be held in abeyance, and that the FBI and Justice Department should immediately open an investigation in the apparent fraud that occurred in this area.''  He states that out of concern that the SEC's civil charges might result in future criminal actions being impossible, as evidence in civil trials can be excluded as inadmissible from criminal trial if it is used first in a civil trial.  I agree. And I'm circulating a letter among my colleagues asking Attorney General Holder to investigate Goldman Sachs and other related cases to find and fight fraud in our financial system.  Many questions are yet to be answered and situations investigated. How much of this was under the watch of then CEO of Goldman Sachs, Henry Paulsen, the former Secretary of the Department of the Treasury, who then bailed out the big banks with which he was so intimately implicated?  AIG must be one of these cases since Goldman Sachs was the largest domestic recipient of counterparty payments through AIG. Goldman's excessive profits in this first quarter have gone up more than $3.5 billion. Imagine if you could borrow at one-half percent interest from the Federal Reserve and then lend that money out at 3.5 percent interest rate. You'd be making billions, too.  And it's not just all about Goldman Sachs. It's about Lehman Brothers, Washington Mutual, other banks, our speculative firms, hedge funds, mortgage companies. Fraud is against the law, and right now fraud appears to be rampant and getting away with it. We need to be investigating and catching the criminals and leaving those who abide the law alone.  I fought the bailout in part because I was concerned that rampant fraud was highly likely. And Congress needs to fight for Main Street and support those agencies that are responsible for fighting fraud in our system.  I ask my colleagues to join me by also signing the letter we have composed to Attorney General Holder asking for a criminal investigation with fraud related to these institutions; and also invite my colleagues to cosponsor H.R. 3995.               [From The New York Times, April 20, 2010]                     The Uproar Over Goldman Sachs       To the Editor:       It is clear to me that the Securities and Exchange      Commission charges should be held in abeyance and that the      F.B.I. and the Justice Department should immediately open an      investigation into the apparent fraud that occurred in this      situation.       Goldman Sachs officials who approved of this insider      manipulation, including Fabrice Tourre, the apparent creator      of the Abacus 2007-AC1 fund, should be the immediate targets      of this investigation, as should John A. Paulson, the      apparent beneficiary of the fund.       If the S.E.C. proceeds with a civil case, much of the      evidence may be inadmissible in a criminal proceeding because      of Fifth Amendment issues. In my experience as an agent and      former associate deputy director of the F.B.I. who was in      charge of criminal investigations, this case should go to the      top of the F.B.I.'s priority list. There should be an      intensive investigation of all potentially criminal acts in      this apparent scam.       Oliver Revell,       Zurich, April 17, 2010.       To the Editor:       Re ``S.E.C.

Money that could, and should, have been used      to add value to society was not invested; it was squandered      as surely as if the parties had wagered on a horse race.

Caroline Poplin,       Bethesda, Md., April 18, 2010.       To the Editor:       Goldman Sachs's ethical failures and hypocrisy are more      important than whether it is legally guilty of fraud. Goldman      presents itself as having higher standards than other Wall      Street firms. It even posts ``Our Business Principles'' on      its Web site, something most firms do not do. Among these are      ``Our clients' interests always come first'' and ``Integrity      and honesty are at the heart of our business.''       In the Abacus 2007-AC1 transaction, according to the      Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit, Goldman knowingly      sold a product that was designed to fail, favoring its own      interests and the interests of one client (John A. Paulson, a      hedge fund manager) over the interests of other clients.      Further, it failed to fully disclose how the Abacus portfolio      was assembled. Goldman clearly did not adhere to its stated      business principles in this deal.       Jeffrey Cohen,       Arroyo Seco, N.M., April 18, 2010.       To the Editor:       As a real estate agent on the North Fork of Long Island in      the roaring housing market here from 1998 to 2005, I was      puzzled by the willingness of banks to give ``no doc'' (no      documentation) and ``liars'' (self-explanatory) bans. Some of      these buyers were borrowing more than the cost of their new      homes.       Today we can see why the banks were so generous. The      Securities and Exchange Commission charges that at least one      bank, Goldman Sachs, knowingly sold packages of subprime      loans that were meant to fail so that a savvy investor could      most profitably short a pool of them.       Some subprime mortgage borrowers who are underwater, owing      more on their homes than they are worth, are walking away,      leaving their homes and the payments they have already made      to the banks.       These days the North Fork real estate sales market isn't      roaring anymore, but many of those former homeowners are      keeping the rental market purring.

This ignores the fundamental issue in this case: fraud is      fraud, whether the perpetrator profits from his misdeeds or      not. The Securities and Exchange Commission is alleging that      Goldman omitted material information from a prospectus that      it was required by law to disclose so that the investors      could make an informed decision about whether to buy the      securities being offered.       Moreover, if Goldman did lose money--whether from the      actual trades or the recent drop in share price--and the      S.E.C. proved that Goldman had committed fraud, then      Goldman's shareholders have been hurt by this activity and      would have a right to sue to recoup their losses from those      responsible.       James O. Chamberlain,       Forest Hills, Queens, April 17, 2010.       To the Editor:       Re ``So Many Ways to Almost Say I'm Sorry'' (Week in      Review, April 18):       Its the ``say you're sorry'' season for highly compensated      bankers, but the apologies ring hollow. An apology without a      commitment to make amends by way of financial reparations is      similar to the ``thank you'' note that arrives six months      after the gift has been received.       It's better than nothing, but not by much.       Joan Evangelisti,       Racine, Wis., April 19, 2010.                                       ____               [From the New York Times, April 19, 2010]                    A Difficult Path in Goldman Case                        (By Binyamin Applebaum)       Washington.--In accusing Goldman Sachs of defrauding      investors, regulators are not only taking aim at a company      with deep pockets and a will to fight--they are also pursuing      an unusual claim that could be difficult to prove in court,      legal experts said.       Rather than asserting that Goldman misrepresented a product      it was selling, the most commonly used grounds for securities      fraud, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a civil      suit filed Friday that the investment bank misled customers      about how that product was created.       It is the rough equivalent of asserting that an antiques      dealer lied about the provenance, but not the quality, of an      old table.       To a layperson, the case against Goldman may seem clear      cut.       After all, investors did not know some information about      the product that they might have considered vital, and they      lost $1 billion in the end. But the rules that govern these      kinds of transactions are not so plain.       Several experts on securities law said fraud cases like      this one, which focuses on context rather than content, are      generally more difficult to win, because it can be hard to      persuade a jury that the missing information might have led      buyers to walk away.       They added, however, that the strength of the S.E.C.'s case      is impossible to gauge until the agency discloses more of the      evidence it has assembled. So far it has provided only a      sketch.       The stakes are huge. The S.E.C., battered by its failure to      identify or prevent several major frauds in recent years, is      eager to re-establish its credibility as an enforcer. But in      choosing such a difficult battlefield, the commission also      risks losing a case at a time when it is trying to re-     establish its reputation as a tough watchdog.       Goldman's sterling reputation, a foundation of its      financial success, is also on the line. Rather than settling      with the government, it has so far chosen to fight back. The      company says it provided its investors with all the      information required by law. It has also stressed that it      sold the securities to financial firms that were      sophisticated investors.       The commission's core accusation is that while Goldman      provided to those firms a detailed list of the assets      contained in a security it built and sold in 2007, it      concealed the role of John Paulson, a hedge fund manager who      worked with Goldman to pick what assets went into the      security. Mr. Paulson then placed bets that the security      would lose value.       In essence, the buyers bet that housing prices would go up,      while Mr. Paulson bet that prices would fall.       Goldman was not legally required to provide any information      to the investors, because Goldman found the buyers without      offering them on the open market. But for any information      that Goldman chose to provide, it was required by law to give      a complete and accurate account.       Goldman outlined its likely defense arguments in two      letters sent to the S.E.C. in September in response to a      notice from the agency that the company was under      investigation and could be sued.       In the letters, Goldman's lawyers at Sullivan & Cromwell      wrote that the company Goldman hired to manage the deal, ACA      Management, was ``no mindless dupe that could be easily      manipulated.'' Furthermore, the letters said that the      downturn of the housing market was not a foregone conclusion,      and that it was therefore misleading for the S.E.C. to      consider the transaction through the lens of ``perfect      hindsight.''       The letters went on to argue that, contrary to the S.E.C.'s      assertions, Goldman disclosed all information about the deal      that was material. In particular, the letters drew a sharp      distinction between information about the security, which the      company said it provided in full, and information about Mr.      Paulson's role.       The second letter said, ``It is this concrete information      on the assets--not the economic interest of the entity that      selected them--that investors could analyze and use to inform      their decisions.''       To win its case, the S.E.C. must prove that Goldman was not      merely silent about Mr. Paulson's role but actually gave      investors the wrong impression, experts in securities law      said. Then it must prove that the missing information was      material, a legal term meaning that investors armed with that      knowledge might have decided not to buy the product from      Goldman, or to do so at a lower price.       Allen Ferrell, a law professor at Harvard, said the suit      rested on an unusual definition of material information.       ``We normally think of material information as specific to      the mortgages, not somebody's prediction about the future      course of macroeconomic events,'' Professor Ferrell said.      ``So who cares whether Paulson is bullish or bearish?      Whatever his personal opinion is about the future course of      housing prices, the question is, did the investors have      access to the underlying mortgages?''       But Donald C. Langevoort, a law professor at Georgetown      University, said the case was consistent with other      government efforts in past years to broaden the definition of      material information. ``The S.E.C. has long insisted that      context is important,'' Professor Langevoort said. ``If you      think of it more broadly in that way, this isn't an      unprecedented case.''       Professor Langevoort cited as an example the commission's      2003 settlement with 10 investment banks over accusations      that their research departments were providing      recommendations to investors without disclosing that      favorable reviews were used to attract underwriting business      from the companies issuing the stock.       Adam C. Pritchard, a law professor at the University of      Michigan, said that the S.E.C.'s focus on the construction of      Goldman's security reflected the increased complexity of      financial instruments. Construction has simply become a more      important part of the process, he said. But he added, ``The      basic idea that an undisclosed conflict of interest could be      misleading is pretty much as old as stockbrokers.''       In pursuing a new twist on an old idea, however, the S.E.C.      has deeply unsettled the financial markets, opening the way      for investors to file claims against banks that sold similar      products, and forcing firms to reconsider their own      liability.       Richard W. Painter, a corporate law professor at the      University of Minnesota, said the novel nature of the fraud      charges made it important for the S.E.C. to disclose more      details quickly, so that markets were not paralyzed by      uncertainty over the boundaries.       ``The S.E.C. needs to step to the plate with very specific      facts and make it clear what they think Goldman did that was      wrong,'' Professor Painter said.
