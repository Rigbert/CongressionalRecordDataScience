 Today is a little different approach to it, though, because earlier today the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions began marking up S. 1082, the Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act. For the first time in almost a decade we have an opportunity to reform, to improve, and to reestablish the FDA as an institution committed to making patient safety as important as bringing new drugs to the market.  S. 1082 presents a framework for the future of drug and device safety. I am gratified by some of its current contents and I express some disappointment about others. That is the purpose of my speaking to my colleagues.  First, I am gratified the bill attempts to address some of the overarching issues plaguing the FDA that have been repeatedly revealed by the investigations I conducted of the FDA over the last 3 years. In particular, S. 1082 takes a number of steps to address the issue of transparency, the issue of accountability, and the issue of respect for the scientific process that has been lacking for some time at the FDA. S. 1082, for example, requires that within 30 days of approval, the action package for approval of a new drug must be posted on the FDA's Web site. This requirement, however, only applies to a drug with an active ingredient that has not been previously approved by the FDA. The action package would contain all documents generated by the FDA related to the review of a drug application, including a summary review of all conclusions and, among other things, any disagreements and how these disagreements were resolved. If a supervisor disagreed with the review, then the supervisor's opposing review would be available to the public. And to address the many allegations that the Food and Drug Administration safety reviewers are sometimes coerced into changing their findings, I greatly welcome the provision that states a scientific review of an application is considered the work of the reviewer and must not be changed by FDA managers or the reviewer once that review is final.  The bill also takes steps to bring more resources to the FDA for drug safety, another matter I have been discussing for years. In addition, the bill requires the Food and Drug Administration's Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee to meetat least two times a year to address safety questions and to make recommendations regarding post-market studies.  I am also heartened to see that the bill incorporated several elements from the Dodd-Grassley bill entitled the Fair Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2007. S. 1082 ensures that the clinical trial registry includes trials of devices approved by the FDA. The bill requires a drug sponsor to certify at the time of the submission of a drug, biologics, or device application to the agency, that the sponsor has met all of the clinical trial registry requirements.  Last but not least, S. 1082 attempts to give the Food and Drug Administration some teeth by requiring specific civil penalties, monetary penalties for submission of false certification, and false or misleading clinical trial information.  These are, in my mind, some of the good things that are proposed in S. 1082. I wish to thank Chairman Kennedy and Ranking Member Enzi in this regard.  I hope additions such as these, which strengthen S. 1082, will make it through the HELP Committee's vote as the committee considers further changes. As I said earlier, I am both gratified and disappointed by the contents of S. 1082.  I turn now to some of what I consider to be lacking in the bill, that in my mind fails to address some of the issues that are critical to reestablishing the FDA's mission and putting John Q. Public and not PhRMA at the helm of the FDA.  I commend the HELP Committee's attempt to ensure that the office responsible for post-market drug safety is involved in, among other things, decisions made regarding labeling and post-market studies by making specific references to that office throughout S. 1082. However, the bill does not address the outstanding critical problem that the office responsible for post-market drug safety lacks the independence, lacks the authority to promptly identify serious health risks and take necessary steps that will protect the public.  As I think we all agree, the Federal Drug Administration is in desperate need of major overhaul. Over the past 3 years, my investigations have demonstrated that the depth and the breadth of the problems plaguing the FDA on both the drug and device side ought to stand out in everybody's mind as something Congress ought to be dealing with. Senator Dodd and I have written two bills that we believe will greatly enhance drug and device safety and improve transparency at the FDA and, most importantly, prevent another Vioxx debacle.  The Federal Drug Administration's Safety Act of 2007 and the Fair Access to Clinical Trials Act of 2007 are intended to address some of the problems plaguing the FDA at its very core. Those are the bills that are the Grassley-Dodd bill and the other is a Dodd-Grassley bill.  Let me be clear: Big PhRMA does not like these bills. FDA management does not like these bills. Lobbyists are spending hours upon hours lobbying against these bills. The Food and Drug Administration Revitalization Act does not embrace all the critical elements of the Dodd-Grassley and the Grassley-Dodd bill.  Let me ask each and every Member of the Senate the following: What is wrong with establishing a separate center within the FDA--not outside the FDA, within the FDA--with its only job being that of a watchdog for those drugs already in the market? What is wrong with supporting a group of committed FDA scientists who only watch for serious adverse effects that may pop up only occasionally, perhaps only 1 in 10,000 or 1 in 20,000? What is wrong with ensuring that all clinical trial results, regardless of their outcome, are available to the scientific community, health care practitioners, and the public? What is wrong with supporting a clinical trial registry and results database that also requires sponsors to reveal their negative trials? And what is wrong with giving the FDA strong enforcement tools to combat bad players?  I propose there is nothing wrong with any of these proposals, particularly the proposals that a new, separate, and independent center be created to address post-market surveillance, a proposal supported by Senator Dodd and me, not once but twice.  I have heard the naysayers and the naysayers' many bogus arguments about why a new post-market drug safety center will not work. The arguments range from the absurd to the ridiculous.  I will also address a few of those for you today. One argument is the creation of a separate center will slow down the drug approval process and delay much needed drugs from those who need them.  This argument is, in plain English, a nonstarter. Why? Because this new center will be devoted to keeping an eye on drugs once they are already on the market, postmarketing surveillance.  Another argument is that a new postmarket drug safety center will create an unmanageable bureaucracy at the FDA. That is a bogus argument. Why would taking an already existing office at the Food and Drug Administration, moving it on an organizational chart and providing it with new authority to watch for unknown and unexpected adverse events be bad? It does not make sense.  These arguments at first blush made an impression on Dr. Steven Nissen, chair of the Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at Cleveland Clinic and immediate past president of the American College of Cardiology, who was not an original supporter of establishing a separate center within the FDA to address postmarketing surveillance.  But, over time, his views have changed. Dr. Nissen probed more, evaluated the facts more, and as he talked more to on-the-ground FDA staff members, Dr. Nissen changed his mind and told the American public so.  Dr. Nissen recently sent me a letter stating that not only does he support the Fair Access to Clinical Trials Act but also the Food and Drug Administration Safety Act. In other words, Dr. Nissen said:       In particular, I support the creation of a new independent      center within the FDA called the Center for Post-Market      Evaluation and Research for drugs and biologics. Although I      had previously expressed some concern about creating this      center, I have become convinced that the separation of post-     market surveillance from the Office of New Drugs represents      the best opportunity to improve the performance of the FDA in      handling drug safety issues.  I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             Cleveland Clinic,                                    Cleveland, OH, March 29, 2007.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I share your concern about the need      for a significant overhaul of the Food and Drug      Administration to improve drug safety. Over the last several      years, we have endured a series of disturbing revelations      about the lack of vigilance by the FDA in monitoring drugs      following approval. I have reviewed the two Bills that you      and Senator Dodd introduced, the Food & Drug Administration      Safety Act of 2007 and the Fair Access to Clinical Act of      2007. I strongly support the passage of both of these Acts      and believe that they will help protect the public health.       In particular, I support the creation of a new and      independent center within the FDA called the Center for Post-     Market Evaluation and Research for drugs and biologics      (CPER). Although I had previously expressed some concern      about creating this center, I have become convinced that the      separation of postmarket surveillance from the Office of New      Drugs represents the best opportunity to improve the      performance of the FDA in handling drug safety issues.       Finally, I want to thank you and Senator Dodd for your      tireless efforts to promote public health through aggressive      oversight of the Food and Drug Administration. Your      leadership in this vital area has been invaluable and all of      the 300 million Americans who rely upon drugs to protect      their health are grateful for your steadfast efforts.       The views expressed in this letter are my own personal      opinion and do not necessarily reflect the official views of      my employer or the American College of Cardiology.           Sincerely,     Steven E. Nissen, M.D.,       Chairman, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, Cleveland      Clinic, Immediate Past President, American College of      Cardiology.
