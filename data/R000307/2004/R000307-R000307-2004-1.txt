 Mr. President, one day after the 62nd anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor, and 3 years and 82 days after the 9/11 terrorist attacks on our country, we will now pass the National Security Intelligence Reform Act of 2004.  I rise in strong support of this conference report which is a remarkable first step in our goal to strengthen and improve our Nation's intelligence capabilities.  My colleagues, we should start--and others have said this, and it is certainly true--by recognizing Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman and their staff for their efforts to get a bill which will have a positive impact on our intelligence community.
