 President, on November 1, the Committee on Foreign Relations conducted a business meeting to consider several matters.  The motion to report the nomination of Roland Arnall to be U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands failed on a 9-to-9 tie. The chairman then ruled that the nomination was ordered reported by an 8-to-2 vote, which reflected the vote of those physically present.  With all respect to my friend and chairman, Senator Lugar, I disagree with his ruling, which negated the proxy votes cast by me and several of my colleagues; I believe it to be inconsistent with the rules of the Committee on Foreign Relations. So that the record of the proceedings at the meeting will be available to all members, I ask unanimous consent that the relevant portion of the transcript of that meeting be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Business Meeting of the Committee on Foreign Relations, U.S. Senate                             November 1, 2005       The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:32 p.m. in Room      S-116, The Capitol, Hon. Richard G. Lugar [chairman]      presiding.       Present: Senators Lugar [presiding], Hagel, Chafee, Allen,      Coleman, Voinovich, Alexander, Sununu, Murkowski, and      Sarbanes.       Senator Sarbanes. First of all, on the point about filing      lawsuits to delay the nomination, there are a number of      individual suits that have been brought regarding some of      these matters. I don't premise the position I'm taking on      that.       I think in effect a screening process has been done by the      State attorneys general, and therefore I think it raises the      issue to a much higher level, that these State attorney      generals are considering bringing charges in this instance.       Mr. Arnall asserts that his motto is to do the right thing.      That's what we're trying to get him to do in this instance.      He owns this company. It's privately held. We had testimony      from people that were at the company telling about how      intimately he was in its activities, how much he's essential      to the sort of direction and the drive, the vitality of the      company.       He does have an impressive life story and I alluded to that      in the course of the hearing and said as much.       But you've got a real problem here in terms of these      practices, and Mr. Arnall ought to resolve this matter in my      opinion before he goes off to the Netherlands in order to      assume this ambassadorship.       The Chairman. Well, the committee will now vote on the      nomination. I will ask the Clerk to call the roll.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Hagel.       Senator Hagel. No.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Chafee.       Senator Chafee. Aye.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Allen.       Senator Chafee. Aye.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Coleman.       Senator Coleman. Aye.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Voinovich.       Senator Voinovich. Aye.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Alexander.       Senator Alexander. Aye       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Sununu.       Senator Sununu. Aye.       Ms. Oursler. Ms. Murkowski.       Senator Murkowski. Aye.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Martinez.       The Chairman. Votes aye by proxy.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Biden.       Senator Sarbanes. No by proxy.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Sarbanes.       Senator Sarbanes. No.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Dodd.       Senator Sarbanes. No by proxy.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Kerry.       Senator Sarbanes. No by proxy.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Feingold.       Senator Sarbanes. No by proxy.       Ms. Oursler. Mrs. Boxer.       Senator Sarbanes. No by--I'll pass for the moment.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Nelson.       Senator Sarbanes. No by proxy.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Obama.       Senator Sarbanes. No by proxy.       Ms. Oursler. Mr. Chairman.       The Chairman. Aye.       Senator Sarbanes. Boxer, no by proxy.       The Chairman. The Clerk will please report the vote.       Ms. Oursler. The vote is nine to nine.       The Chairman. Now let me make certain that the committee      knows what the reporting requirement is, because I'll ask the      Clerk then to give the report on members physically present.      Our rule says ``No nomination can be reported unless a      majority of the committee members are physically present. The      vote of the committee to report a measure or matter shall      require the concurrence of a majority of those members who      are physically present at the time the vote is taken.''       Now, what is the vote among those who are physically      present?       Ms. Oursler. Of those physically present, eight voted in      favor of the nomination and two voted against.       The Chairman. Now, the chair believes that Rule 4[c] on      reporting would indicate that in this particular instance the      nomination be forwarded to the full Senate. But that is--I      ask those who may have question about that to refer to Rule 4      on quorums and [c] on reporting.       Senator Sarbanes. Mr. Chairman, as I read this rule, in      order to report it out you will need a majority physically      present, but that doesn't vitiate the proxies voted against.      The rule makes no reference to that and those proxies are      valid, and therefore we wouldn't--the vote is not carried.      This applies of you to try to use proxies to constitute the      majority for reporting it out, but it doesn't apply to the      use of proxies to negate reporting it out, I respectfully      submit to you, and I think that's a fair reading of the rule.      And that's the way we've done it here in the past.       The Chairman. Well, that is an important reading, but the      chair believes that the reading at least gives credence at      least to my interpretation, which is that a majority of those      voting and physically present, given the fact a majority was      here to create the quorum, would lead to a favorable      decision.       Senator Sarbanes. Well, I think we need to sort this out. I      make the point of order a quorum is not present.       The Chairman. Well, a quorum is not present, but the quorum      was present at the time of the vote and that is what is      required, and the chair declared that the vote was in favor      of reporting this nomination to the Senate floor.       Senator Sarbanes. On what basis is the chairman reaching      that conclusion?       The Chairman. On the basis that we had a quorum and that a      majority of those physically present voted in favor of the      nominee.       Senator Sarbanes. But the majority of the committee didn't      do that. In fact the vote here was a tie vote.       The Chairman. Counting in the proxies.       Senator Sarbanes. It was a tie vote. Yes, it was a tie      vote.       You can't bring it out with proxies. The chairman--what      this rule is designed to do is the chairman can't come in      with a bunch of proxies in his hands and then on the basis of      that bring a measure out of the committee. You can be called      on that in terms of having a majority.       The Chairman. I appreciate the point the chair is making--     rather, the Senator is making. I believe that my      interpretation is correct and I would just indicate that that      at least is what is going to occur. Now, the member may think      of a means for appealing that in some fashion.       Senator Sarbanes. Think what?       The Chairman. Of a means of appealing my decision. But for      the time being, my decision is that we had a vote and we have      reported the nominee.       Senator Sarbanes. Well, I think it's an abuse of the rules      and I want to state that to the chairman.       The Chairman. I understand.       Senator Sarbanes. Absolutely.       The Chairman. I thank the members of the committee.       [Whereupon, at 3.07 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]                          ____________________[Pages S12602-S12603]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]              FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE BUSINESS MEETING
