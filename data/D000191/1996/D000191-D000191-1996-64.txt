Chairman, our national policy regarding immigration is overdue for change. We need to balance our proud history of diversity with the economic reality of high national unemployment and over-burdened social services. We must consider reforms that address the needs of U.S. citizens first and recognize the fiscal reality of Federal and State government.  Congress is now considering a major proposal to dramatically change our Nation's immigration policy. I support the goal of ending illegal immigration. But I also believe we must reduce the number of people legally immigrating to our Nation. We simply cannot hold the door open for every one of the world's dissatisfied citizens. Continued high immigration hurts our environment, it hurts our low wage workers and it is increasingly hurting higher skill and higher wage workers, as well. High levels of immigration may have been a boon to our Nation at one time. They have ceased to make any sense today.  Representative Berman has proposed an amendment to strike the legal immigration provisions of the bill. I'm concerned that if we eliminate the attempt in this bill to reform the Nation's legal immigration policy--as flawed as this bill's legal immigration reforms may be--the impetus for reform will die. I, therefore, cannot support his amendment.  I'll continue to work for tighter borders and responsible immigration control, and press for strong protection for our Nations work force.
