 I would say this: We have a very short period of time to wind up. I would have to say that all of these ridiculous examples, such as the one the Senator from Illinois just came up with and the flag examples, have nothing to do with this amendment. It might be some other amendment that was referred to. This merely recognizes and declares English to be our national language. We have exceptions for anything that is in there in law or would refer to anything else that is accepted.  Mr. President, I would like to ask, how much time do we have remaining?
