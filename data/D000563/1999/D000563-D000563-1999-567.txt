 What the Senator from California is suggesting is, if it is an old computer, one that goes back over 5 years, they would have to pay the cost of whatever the repair; if it has been purchased in the last 5 years--a period of time when everyone generally sensed this problem was coming--the computer company would fix it without charge.  A lot of businesses would retain the ability to keep going, making their products and keeping their people working.  This is not just proconsumer, this is probusiness. It troubles me to see so many business groups lined up against this amendment. It seems to me counterintuitive.  I think what the Senator from California is doing is showing sensitivity that virtually all friends of business should show in this legislation.
