But, number two, the gentleman and I have a disagreement factually as to what the bill does. We don't believe this kills the right of the employees to have a free election at all. Period.  We believe in fact the employee has that choice. The employee has the absolute right to respond, ``No, I don't want to sign your card. Let's have an election. And I will sign it for that purpose, and that purpose only, to give you the 30 percent you need to get the election.''  I think I'm right on 30 percent. But, in any event, we believe this is the employees' choice of how they want to organize, not the employer's choice.  So we are not and did not by passage of this legislation take away from the employees the right to have an election if they so choose.
