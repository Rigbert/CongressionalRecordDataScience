Mr. Chairman, my interest in here is because I am from Alaska, and we have the finest wild salmon in the world. And we have people that are trying to--and especially under NOAA and FDA--trying to approve the fact that they have genetically engineered a salmon. That's not natural.                              {time}  2010  And our goal is, we have a supply of natural wild salmon for the State of Alaska and for this Nation, because I think that's crucially important, especially in this day when we have all those that accuse us of having artificial things, you know, pesticides, et cetera.  This is a good amendment. It's an amendment supported by both sides of the aisle. It's not just Alaska. This is also for California, Oregon, and the rest of it. But mostly, I am the Congressman from Alaska. I think it's crucially important we understand that this should not be allowed, for the FDA to say, okay, a genetically raised salmon--I call it a Frankenstein fish--should never be allowed in our markets.  I have a group of individual Alaskans who not only make their living, but they are proud of their product. To have this occur and be promoted by the Federal Government is wrong.  So I'm trying to save money. But I'm also saying genetically we should never allow it to happen in the fishing industry.  I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Farr).
