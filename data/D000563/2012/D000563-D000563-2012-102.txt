I do believe that is history in the making. But that is why this appetite for the filibuster in the Senate has to change.  What an abuse, that we cannot have a majority vote on something the Republicans proposed and the Democrats were prepared to vote for. This would have been a true bipartisan measure, good news--maybe leading the news--across America. It really is unfortunate.
