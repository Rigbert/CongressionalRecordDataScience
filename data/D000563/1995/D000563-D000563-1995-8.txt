Speaker, why did this bill arrive on the President's desk 75 days late? It arrived there because it became the playground of special interest groups while it was still on Capitol Hill.  The longest-running taxpayer ripoff in the history of the United States is the Mining Act of 1872. It allows companies, in many cases foreign companies, to mine taxpayer-owned land in the United States and not to pay the taxpayers adequately for that. So we have been engaged in a battle for a long time with those special interest groups.  Unfortunately for my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle, many of them, most of them, supported the mining interests, wanted to keep this ancient law on the books, this law that gave a windfall to so many companies. So this bill was dragged down time after time after time when these special interest groups kept running into resistance on Capitol Hill.  The next thing you know, the committee failed to meet its deadline of October 1, then they failed to meet a November 1 deadline, then they failed to meet a December 1 deadline. And finally, finally, finally in the middle of December, they submitted their bill to the President.  Part of it was right. They finally got part of this Mining Act of 1872 provision correctly, but there are other parts that were not right. Unfortunately, this bill turned out to be an environmental disaster when it was sent to President Clinton.  I am sorry to say that, too, because the gentleman from Ohio, who is a friend of mine, is a moderate person on his record on the environment. In fact, he has been very good on many of his votes, in fact occasionally very, very good in his votes.  But he is an endangered species, just like those addressed in the bill, a moderate Republican committed to the environment. He has labored long and hard to fight off the worst of the environmental provisions in this bill, but unfortunately for my colleague from Ohio, he just could not keep all of the bad provisions out, and forced a veto by President Clinton for good reason.  The American people want change in this Government but they want us to protect our natural resources. We only get one crack at it when it comes to national parks, when it comes to species and plant life in this country. It is something the American people expect us to do right. When the special interests railroad through a bill and put in these awful provisions, the President was right to veto it.  Having said that, though, this veto has nothing to do with shutting down the Government. The Republicans understand, we all understand, a simple temporary spending bill called a continuing resolution could keep this department, every department that is touched by this bill and all the other departments that have been closed in business.  But my friends on the Republican side of the aisle do not want that to happen. This Christmas gift to 200,000 Federal employees is no temporary spending bill, send them home without pay, with the promise that maybe they will get paid at some future date.  Well, tonight they are trying to blame President Clinton for that. They should not. They ought to blame the special interests for dragging this bill down and making it 75 days late. They ought to blame their own leadership for failing to pass a continuing resolution which would keep the Government in business.                              {time}  1830
