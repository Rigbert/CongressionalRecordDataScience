President, I often come to this floor to thank various staff for their long, tireless and often anonymous work on behalf of the U.S. Senate and the 100 Senators who serve here. But it is not often that I come down here to acknowledge a public servant who has made such an incredible contribution to this institution and our shared State of Vermont.  Today, I would like to honor the 25 years of service of Susan Boardman Russ, who has served Senator Jeffords and the people of Vermont with extraordinary distinction.  Vermont is a small place. I have known Susan most of her life. Her father delivered two of my three children.  Over the years, I have watched her grow with a mixture of awe and admiration. Susan is brilliant, articulate, and has always kept her eyes focused on what is best for Vermont.  Senator Jeffords is to be commended for recognizing her talent early on and for keeping her in the fold this long. While Susan has moved with her husband and beautiful daughter to Houston, TX, I know she will always be a Vermonter at heart.  Recently, one of Vermont's finest journalists, Christopher Graff, wrote a beautiful tribute to Susan. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           Susan Russ Steps Down as Jeffords' Chief of Staff                         (By Christopher Graff)       Montpelier, VT. (AP)--Susan Boardman Russ was 14 years old,      handing out campaign literature at the old Seaway Shopping      Center in South Burlington for her Uncle Bob Boardman, who      was running for the state Senate from Chittenden County.       The year was 1968.       Her school friend, Kathleen McGreevy, was handing out      flyers for her uncle, Jim Jeffords, who was running for      attorney general.       ``My uncle was Democrat and hers was a Republican, but that      did not matter much to two 14-year-olds,'' says Russ.       ``Soon, we were efficiently sharing the load. To everyone I      handed a Democratic Bob Boardman flyer I also handed a      Republican Jim Jeffords flyer and she did the same.''       Both Boardman and Jeffords were winners that year, their      two nieces began a lifelong friendship and Russ' life became      intertwined with Jeffords' political career.       In 1972 she worked during the summer on Jeffords'      unsuccessful bid for governor and on ``the night of his      primary defeat I swore I would NEVER participate in another      election,'' she says. ``I was 18 and heartbroken.''       That loss, though, was a minor setback for Jeffords, who      went on to win the state's lone seat in the U.S. House in      1974 and moved to the U.S. Senate in 1988. Every step of the      way Susan Russ has been there, starting as his front office      manager in 1978, then four years later as his administrative      assistant in the House office and finally as chief of staff      of his Senate office.       Now, 35 years after she handed out her first Jeffords'      flyer and 25 years after she went to work in Washington, Russ      is leaving.       ``It's been a perfect relationship,'' says Jeffords, adding      that the two of them were a ``great combination.''       ``Her ability to understand me, her common sense and her      instincts to keep us out of trouble have been remarkable,''      he says.       The accolades come from all corners: Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-     Vt., calls Russ ``a Vermont treasure. For 25 years she has      devoted her life to working for Senator Jeffords to make the      lives of Vermonters better.'' In the small world department,      Leahy noted that Russ' father delivered two of Leahy's      children.       Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., the No. 2 Senate Democratic      leader, also has high praise for Russ, whom he first met      through Russ' husband, Jack, who served as sergeant at arms      in the House when Reid and Jeffords served there. Reid says      Susan Russ was especially ``politically savvy'' in a job      that required it.       ``Chief of staff is a unique position because you need to      have that political savvy, plus you have to a good manager of      people, you have to recognize talent, and you can't be afraid      to tell the senator when you think he or she is wrong,'' says      Reid.       ``I believe I have been blessed with having the best job      imaginable and the most interesting job tolerable,'' says      Russ. ``I have had a front row seat to some of the most      challenging moments in Washington for the past two and a half      decades.''       When Jeffords first went to Washington he was a little-     known congressman from a tiny state who was a member of the      minority party. Today he is one of the best-known senators in      the world, achieving celebrity status with his decision in      2001 to abandon the GOP and become an independent, a decision      prompted by opposition to the politicies of President George      W. Bush.       Russ says at the time she opposed Jeffords' decision      although she knew that ``Jim was clearly miserable.       ``It was not because of any long held political or      philosophical beliefs that I resisted Jim switching,'' she      says, but that Jeffords had a long history with the      Republican members and leadership. ``We knew the GOP family--     who to trust--who not to trust.       ``It is my nature to try to keep things smooth, no rocking      the boat. This would surely rock the boat.       ``With nearly three years since the decision behind me, I      do realize that for Jim, it was the only decision he could      have made.''       Asked to pick her favorite legislative experiences, she      says there have been too many to do so, but mentions the 1985      Farm Bill with its whole herd buyout from among the     House experiences and the several victories with the dairy      compact from among the Senate years.       ``Each time, no one really believed it was possible but Jim      refused to throw in the towel,'' she says.       Luke Albee, Leahy's chief of staff, gives Russ credit for      extension of the compact. ``She was focused and tenacious and      she said to us every day when we were exhausted and      dispirited, `This is going to happen because it has to      happen.' ''       Russ has no hesitation in what she treasures the most from      her decades in Washington: How Jeffords stood by her and her      husband when Jack Russ, then the House sergeant at arms, was      swept up in a federal probe into how congressmen misused the      House bank.       ``It would have been understandable for Jim the politician      to try and distance himself from the House Bank Scandal,''      she says. ``By 1994, when Jim was facing a difficult re-     election race, Jack had come to represent the `scandal' in a      very public way. Jim never hestitated in his support.'' Russ      says the tone of Washington and the intensity of the battle      have changed dramatically since 1978.       ``Members of different parties used to have intense battles      over issues on the floor of the House or Senate and when it      was over go out and have dinner together. They never went      into each other's districts to help challengers. There was a      general sense of camaraderie that does not exist anymore      between members of the two parties.''       Russ is moving to Texas to be closer to her husband's      family. She has formed her own firm to advise businesses and      non profits on the ways of government. She hopes the move      will allow her to keep a hand in government but allow her      more time to spend with her family.       Russ leaves Washington painfully aware that ``politics is      not a game for the meek,'' but more importantly, ``I learned      when all is said and done, you have to live with yourself and      your decisions, so you better do what you think is right and      let the chips fall where they may.''                          ____________________
