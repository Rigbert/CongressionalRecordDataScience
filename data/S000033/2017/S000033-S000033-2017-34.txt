 I would yield time to my friend from Pennsylvania to assure--now, I see Senator Rubio down here as well. He just the other day--correct me if I am wrong, Senator Rubio. I know you have just walked in, and I have gotten you into this debate. But correct me if I am wrong, if you did not say yesterday that the Senate would now proceed to an ``entitlement reform,'' which, in fact, will mean cuts to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.  I will yield to my friend from Florida to tell me whether I am accurately portraying what he said just the other day.
