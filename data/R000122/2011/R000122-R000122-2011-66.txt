President, I rise today to pay tribute to an exceptional officer in the U.S. Army. LTG Robert E. Durbin will retire on August 1 after more than 36 years of distinguished service to the Army and the Nation.  Throughout his career, General Durbin has personified the Army values of duty, integrity, and selfless service across the many missions to which he has contributed.  General Durbin, a resident of Pennsylvania, graduated from the U.S. Military Academy in 1975 and then went on to receive a master's degree in mechanical engineering from Pennsylvania State University.  He has served in a variety of command and staff assignments, leading men and women during times of peace and war. Over the course of almost four decades of service, he has commanded at the platoon, company, battalion, and brigade levels.  Furthermore, he served as the commanding general of the Combined Security Transition Command--Afghanistan, the command that plays such a critical role in training the Afghan National Security Forces. He subsequently became the commanding general of the 1st Infantry Division and Fort Riley.  General Durbin has spent the last 3 years serving as the director of the Army's Office of Business Transformation, where he was responsible for leading the Army's efforts to operate more cost-consciously while still providing the best trained and equipped force. During one of the most challenging economic periods in our history, General Durbin has helped foster and institutionalize better business practices among our Army's senior leaders. His personal efforts were instrumental in leading the Army through significant changes in the way it grows, resets, modernizes, and transforms. He made these processes more relevant to current operational requirements and significantly increased the Army's capability to support combatant commanders.  In all of his assignments, General Durbin has provided outstanding leadership, integrity, and sound advice on numerous issues of importance to the Army and our nation.  I would like to thank General Durbin, his wife Diana, and his entire family for their commitment, sacrifices, and service to our nation. Congratulations and best wishes.                          ____________________
