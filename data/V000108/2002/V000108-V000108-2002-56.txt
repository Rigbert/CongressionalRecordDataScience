Speaker, it is with great honor and esteem that I wish to congratulate Homer Drew, head coach of the men's basketball team at Valparaiso University, located in Valparaiso, Indiana, for achieving his 500th victory on February 21, 2002. Coach Drew is the embodiment of the true spirit of college athletics. He emphasizes teamwork, scholastic excellence, and community involvement. The people of Valparaiso as well as the entire Northwest Indiana community can be proud of the positive influence he has had on our youth.  A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Homer received Bachelors of Arts degrees in physical education and social studies from William Jewell College in Liberty, Missouri in 1966 and later earned his Master of Arts degree in education at Washington University in St. Louis and his Doctorate in educational administration from Andrews University in Berrien Springs, Michigan. His coaching career began in 1971 as an assistant at Washington State University, where he spent one season before moving to Louisiana State University as an assistant to legendary coach Dale Brown.  Coach Drew earned his first head-coaching job at Bethel College in Mishawaka, Indiana in 1976. During his 11 seasons at Bethel, his teams compiled a record of 252-110, making the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) and National Christian College Athletic Association (NCCAA) playoffs each year. He was honored as the NCCAA District Coach of the Year during five of those eleven seasons. In 1987 Coach Drew became the head coach at Indiana University-South Bend, where he inspired a team which had won only six games the previous season and led them to a 17-12 record, the first winning season in school history.  Homer Drew was hired as the head basketball coach of Valparaiso University prior to the 1988-1989 season, and it marked a turning point not only for the basketball program but the university and community as a whole. His personal commitment to faith, family, and service has carried over into professional excellence. He has earned more victories than any other head coach in school history after leading the Crusaders to a record of 235-184 in his 14 years at Valparaiso University, including guiding this year's team to a school record 25 victories. He has been named Mid-Continent Conference Coach of the Year four times, and has led the Crusaders to the NCAA Tournament five times in the last six years. His teams have won the Mid-Continent conference regular season and tournament championships in six of the last eight years, and have captured either the regular season or tournament championship each year during that time.  Coach Drew brought national attention to himself and the university in 1998, when he coached the Crusaders to an upset victory over nationally ranked Mississippi in the NCAA Tournament. An experienced team led by Homer's son, Bryce Drew, the Crusaders defeated Florida State in the second round of the tournament to advance to the Sweet Sixteen. The national media focused its attention on the small school from Northwest Indiana and marveled not only at the success of the team, but at the kindness and graciousness of the players and their coach. The nation learned what we in Northwest Indiana already knew; that Homer Drew is an outstanding role model for the youth who put their trust in him.  Beyond his exceptional professional achievements, Homer Drew takes significant pride in his personal activities within his community. He is an active civic speaker who has created numerous community activities in which his players and coaches participate. In 1998, Drew was honored with the prestigious Naismith Good Sportsmanship Award, given by the Naismith International Basketball Foundation. He has also been awarded with the Lumen Christi Medal, Valparaiso University's highest honor, in recognition of a lay person's distinguished service to church and society. Coach Drew admits that one of his finest achievements is that he has sent over 50 of his players into either the coaching and/or teaching profession. A dedicated family man, Drew enjoys spending much of his free time with his wife, Janet, and their three children, Scott, the associate head coach of the Crusaders, Dana, and Bryce.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Coach Homer Drew of Valparaiso University for achieving his 500th victory as a head basketball coach. His leadership both on and off the basketball court is valuable resource to the Northwest Indiana community, and I hope that we will benefit from his influence for many years to come.                          ____________________
