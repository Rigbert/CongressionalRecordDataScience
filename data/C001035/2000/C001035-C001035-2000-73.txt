President, I rise today to join my good friend Senator Levin in offering an amendment to provide much needed relief for apple and potato producers across America. Senator Levin and I share a deep concern for these farmers, who have endured such unexpected hardship over the past year. I am grateful for having the opportunity to work with my friend from Michigan on this critical matter.  Over the past three years, America's apple growers have lost more than $760 million according to U.S. Department of Agriculture statistics. Market conditions, beyond the control of our farmers, and unfair trade practices have contributed significantly to these loses. There has been a reduction in demand for U.S. apples in much of the world because of poor economic conditions in foreign markets. The domestic demand for apples has been affected by conditions abroad as well. With dimished demand oversees, we have seen an increase in the foreign supply of apples in our domestic markets. The U.S. Department of Commerce and the International Trade Commission recently found that our producers have been victimized by unfairly priced imports of Chinese apple juice concentrate.  Unusual weather also has hurt our potato and apple producers. The Maine Pomological Society, a group that primarily represents apple producers in my State, reports that a summer-long drought, coupled with the heavy winds and rains of Hurricane Floyd in the fall, had a disastrous impact on the quality of apples produced in Maine last year. On average, only 49% of Maine's 1999 apple crop could be sold at the ``fancy grade'' quality. To provide my colleagues with a sense of what this means, I would note that in 1998, 78% of the apples produced in Maine were labeled as fancy grade.  Maine potato farmers also found themselves victims of weather-related disasters in 1999. In Maine, some potato farmers found their fields covered in as much as 15 inches of water following the drenching that accompanied Hurricane Floyd last fall. Because many of Maine's farmers leave their crop in storage over the winter, we did not realize the full extent of the damage caused by Floyd's rains until this spring. Mr. President, potato farmers pour their hearts and souls into their fields. It is profoundly disheartening to hear from a farmer who has lost an entire crop that took many months of hard work to cultivate.  The amendment Senator Levin and I offer today provides much-needed assistance to both potato and apple producers. Under our proposal, the Secretary of Agriculture would allocate $100 million in market loss assistance payments to our nation's apple producers. The market loss payments authorized by our amendment will help thousands of apple growers from Washington State to Michigan to Maine survive the losses they have endured due to conditions beyond their control. This amendment directs a modest amount of funds to producers who have received very little of the nearly $15 billion in emergency agriculture spending that we have passed this fiscal year.  Our amendment also directs the Secretary of Agriculture to provide $15 million in quality loss payments to apple and potato producers who suffered losses as a result of a hurricane or other weather-related disaster. This assistance will be important to those farmers who were unable to produce their finest product because of adverse weather conditions.  Mr. President, the provisions of our amendment are similar to language in the House-passed version of the FY 2001 Agriculture Appropriations bill. The provisions recognize that potato and apple producers, like other farmers across the country, are subject to the vagaries of international markets and the weather. I ask my colleagues to join us in providing assistance to our apple and potato producers in their time of need.  If anyone questions the emergency nature of this request, I would refer them to a news story that ran on the evening news in Maine this past Tuesday. The segment focused on a long-time apple grower from Alfred, Maine. The grower, with much regret, has come to the conclusion that after thirty-five years this will have to be his family's last crop. The dwindling profits are not enough incentive for the next generation of the family to contend with the government regulations and uncertainty that comes with running an apple orchard. I encourage my colleagues who missed this broadcast from Maine to read the story in Tuesday's New York Times about the hardships being endured by apple growers in New York who watched hail storms this spring wipe out much of their crops. This amendment and the aid it represents is certainly an emergency to these producers.  Mr. President, the federal government must be a partner in our farmer's efforts to feed America and much of the world. The Levin-Collins amendment ensures that our apple and potato producers get the help they need to overcome the difficulties of the past year and continue to produce a quality product. I urge my colleagues to support our amendment, and I yield the floor.                           amendment no. 3933(Purpose: To provide relief for apple growers whose crops have suffered             extensive crop damage as a result of fireblight)       On page 2, lines 16 through 23, strike all after ``(b)''      and insert,       ``Quality Loss Payments for Apples and Potatoes.--In      addition to the assistance provided under subsection (a), the      Secretary shall use $60,000,000 of funds of the Commodity      Credit Corporation to make payments to apple producers, and      potato producers, that suffered quality losses to the 1999      and 2000 crop of potatoes and apples, respectively, due to,      or related to, a 1999 or 2000 hurricane, fireblight or other      weather related disaster.                                  ____                           amendment no. 3965  (Purpose: To ensure that nursery stock producers receive emergency    financial assistance for nursery stock losses caused by Hurricane                                  Irene)       At the apropriate place, insert the following:       Sec. ____.--In using amounts made available under section      801(a) of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug      Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000      (7 U.S.C. 1421 note; Public Law 106-78), or under the matter      under the heading ``crop loss assistance'' under the heading      ``Commodity Credit Corporation Fund'' of H.R. 3425 of the      106th Congress, as enacted by section 1001(a)(5) of Public      Law 106-113 (113 Stat. 1536, 1501A-289), to provide emergency      financial assistance to producers on a farm that have      incurred losses in a 1999 crop due to a disaster, the      Secretary of Agriculture shall consider nursery stock losses      caused by Hurricane Irene on October 16 and 17, 1999, to be      losses to the 1999 crop of nursery stock: Provided, That the      entire amount necessary to carry out this section shall be      available only to the extent that an official budget request      for the entire amount, that includes designation of the      entire amount of the request as an emergency requirement      under the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act      of 1985 (2 U.S.C. 900 et seq.), is transmitted by the      President to Congress: Provided further, That the entire      amount necessary to carry out this section is designated by      Congress as an emergency requirement pursuant to section      251(b)(2)(A) of that Act (2 U.S.C. 901(b)(2)(A)).
