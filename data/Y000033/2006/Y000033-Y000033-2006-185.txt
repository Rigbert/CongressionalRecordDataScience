Mr. Speaker, I come to the House floor today to express my profound sadness for the loss of a constituent and a friend, Lloyd Wayne Waggoner. He was a husband, father, father-in-law, grandfather, brother, and a friend. Known by most people as ``Wayne'' or ``Gotebo,'' the little town in Oklahoma in which he grew up, Wayne was an Alaskan for more than 40 years. He arrived shortly after the 1964 earthquake with a friend who asked him to ride along on his trip to the last frontier. And like many people in Alaska, Wayne fell in love with the beauty, independence and kind people that Alaska had to offer, and he never left.  When he first came to Alaska, he worked on an oil rig on the North Slope. During his years in the Last Frontier, he pursued such varied career interests as holding the first Seiko watch distributorship in the State, running for state office, operating a wholesale jewelry business, serving on the Anchorage Zoning Commission and opening Wayne's Diamond Center stores in Anchorage, Wasilla, and Fairbanks. He also gave his time generously to the Anchorage Lions Club, the Shriners, and the Freedom Frog program, which promotes recovery from substance abuse and addiction.  Wayne had experiences, met people, and lived a life that most people only dream about. He regaled his family and friends with stories he told about the little bar in Laguna Beach that he gave to a friend when he decided not to return from Alaska; his dislike for salmon because that was all he ate for 3 weeks on a cargo ship he boarded as a stowaway in the Mediterranean; his one and only hole-in-one that he shot in 2001 at Fort Richardson Golf Course; the night he met the beautiful pianist--the love of his life, Karen--at the bar up at Stuckagain Heights; and the time he and his daughter saw a moose calf taken down by a sow bear right in front of them while fly-fishing in Naknek River.  Wayne was a patriot, a great American who served his country honorably and a true sourdough Alaskan. With a story and a smile for everyone, he was a person that made people think, ``boy, am I glad I met him.'' We are all better for having known him, for having loved him, and for having been loved by him. For the person he was, for the lessons he taught us, for the love he shared with us, he will always be in our hearts. We celebrate his life and cherish our memories. Mr. Speaker, in Wayne's words I leave you with his favorite toast ``may you work like you don't need the money, may you dance like no one is watching, and may you love like you've never been hurt.''                          ____________________
