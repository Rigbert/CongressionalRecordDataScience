Speaker, is the gentleman aware that the major deliverer of health services to women in Puerto Rico is through Planned Parenthood? Is the gentleman aware of that?  I yield to the gentleman.  Mr. McCARTHY. Did the President request, when he requested money, that it get delivered that way? Or in here may I remind the gentleman what I am requesting, ``the funding goes for health services provided by public health departments, hospitals, or reimbursed through public health plans.''  Public health means that is the way the health care is provided, so we are funding the entities that provide the health care, exactly when the President had requested it.
