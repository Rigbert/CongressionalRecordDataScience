 President, my office and I are closely monitoring a significant explosion of a natural gas transmission pipeline early this morning near Danville, in my home State of Kentucky.  As of this morning, one fatality and five more injuries have been reported, and others may be unaccounted for. We hope and pray that these figures do not increase. Several structures have been damaged or destroyed.  The Lincoln County emergency manager reported: ``The part of the area that has been compromised, there is just nothing left.'' The fiery explosion was so large that it was picked up by weather satellites, and witnesses report the smoke can be seen from my hometown of Louisville, almost 70 miles away.  Obviously, the investigation is just beginning. My staff and I will continue to stay on top of this and be a resource for everyone affected.  This morning, our prayers are with the families whom this disaster has touched, and our gratitude is with all the first responders who rushed toward the towering flames to protect their neighbors and communities.                          ____________________
