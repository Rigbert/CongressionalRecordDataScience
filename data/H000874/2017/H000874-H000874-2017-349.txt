Speaker, I rise today to speak about a very special event taking place next week in my district.  Maryland's Fifth District lost a number of brave and extraordinary military personnel since 2001 in Iraq and Afghanistan or in support of our operations there. One of them was U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Christopher W. Swanson of Rose Haven, in Anne Arundel County, who fell in action on July 22, 2006, in Iraq's Anbar Province. Staff Sergeant Swanson gave his life to save his fellow soldiers when insurgents ambushed their patrol. He had been serving there with the 2nd Battalion, 6th Infantry Regiment, 1st Armored Division.  On Friday, May 12, family, friends, neighbors, and state and local officials will gather in Edgewater, Maryland, to rededicate the South River Bridge in Staff Sergeant Swanson's memory, a moving tribute to a young man from our area who lived by the highest ideals of our country and made the ultimate sacrifice under our nation's flag. His parents, Kelly and Gary Swanson, and his brother Kenny and his family, will be on hand to witness the renaming of the four-lane bridge, which connects southern Anne Arundel County with the state capital of Annapolis across the South River--a major thoroughfare serving commuters and commerce in the area. While so many in Rose Haven and its surrounding communities have known for years about what Staff Sergeant Swanson did for our country, now thousands of Marylanders will pass by the sign each day bearing his name and noting his extraordinary service and sacrifice. I hope they will take a moment each time to remember him and all those who were killed in action wearing our nation's uniform.  Staff Sergeant Swanson was proud of his roots in Southern Maryland. He graduated from Southern High School in 1999, where he had been captain of its soccer team, and enlisted that summer in the U.S. Army. It just made sense to him to serve, particularly given that both of his parents worked in law enforcement. Throughout his youth, he had often volunteered with the First Baptist Church in Upper Marlboro to go on service missions to Florida, Ohio, and West Virginia to help communities in need. At school, he gave his time to help out in the administrative office, and his teachers and peers alike saw him as a natural leader. It surprised no one at all that Staff Sergeant Swanson was on his third tour of duty in Iraq when, after being injured by an improvised explosive device, he insisted on going back into combat with his fellow soldiers instead of taking medical leave. As soon as his wound was stitched and he was given permission, he was right back with his unit, on the front lines.  It was less than two weeks later that Staff Sergeant Swanson was killed in action. He had served with distinction in Kosovo as an Army paratrooper and was later among those who participated in the initial stages of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Now, he rests among heroes in Arlington National Cemetery. His parents and brother launched a service organization in his memory, the SSG Christopher W. Swanson Support Charity for Veterans and their Families, which, among other projects, funds scholarships for the children of local fallen, wounded, or active duty soldiers to attend summer camp.  I hope my colleagues will join me in remembering Staff Sergeant Christopher W. Swanson, in thanking his Gold Star family for their sacrifice and charity work in tribute to him, and in paying tribute to all those from Maryland and across the country who gave their lives in service to our nation.                          ____________________
