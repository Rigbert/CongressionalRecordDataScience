 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Tedra Guyett and Harmony Hariman, high school students from Washington County, VT, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       My name is Harmony Hariman, and I'm a Student Area      Coordinator for Amnesty International, and I'm an intern with      the Vermont Refugee Assistance.       My name is Tedra Guyette; I'm also a Student Area      Coordinator for Vermont, and I'm also an intern with Vermont      Refugee Assistance.       The first thing we really want to talk about is a Bill that      was passed on March 21st in the House, HR 2202. That's really      upsetting to me, because it effectively banned people who      have genuine political claims . . . from ever entering the      U.S., or ever staying, because . . . When a person flees      their country with the fear of safety, and they come here, do      you think they're going to come off the plane and say,      ``Whoops, we better get a lawyer and file some papers?'' No,      they're worried about their safety. And often spend months      trying to save their families, and just getting settled,      which pretty much bans them from ever filing. The Bill HR      2202 would ensure that any immigrant or refugee who is caught      entering or crossing the border illegally will be permanently      barred from ever legally entering the country. Yet there are      instances where a refugee has no other option. Immigrants      lack knowledge about specific opportunities of become a      citizen, and often do not understand the process itself, or      how to negotiate the I.N.S. bureaucracy.       There is a section of the bill that says that immigrants      who are here illegally, or undocumented immigrants, are      unable to receive health care through out public system.     And there's a myth that the reason that the health care      system is in the ground is because it's the immigrants, it's      the poor people that are just dragging it down. But really,      immigrants use health care less than the general public. A      1992 U.S. Dept. of Justice report found that immigrants use      federally funded services less than the general population,      and there have been several studies that show that it's not      immigrants that are pulling us down, it's everyone else's      stupidity and ignorance about the immigrants. Most hospital      care costs for undocumented immigrants were paid by private      insurance, which was 47%; or by the immigrants and their      families themselves, which was 45%. That only leaves 8% of      the immigrants in the country that were paid for by the      government.       This Bill would also deny immigrants benefits under any      means-tested programs funded by the federal government, or by      state government, as well as being ineligible to receive      grants, to receive Earned Income tax credits, to receive      SSI benefits, Medicaid, Food Stamps, housing assistance,      unemployment benefits, college financial aid, among      others. Although, undocumented immigrants alone paid $7      billion per year in taxes. In 1990, undocumented      immigrants paid $2.7 billion in Social Security, and $160      million in Unemployment Insurance; and this is according      to a publication by the Urban Institute. (signal)       I'm just going to do a quick story about a man that I know.      He's 18 years old, and is from Sudan, and is now lost in the      ``war zone'' of the American immigration system. He's      actually living in Woodbury; he is apparently some kind of      dangerous criminal because he came here with a false      passport; so, now he's in jail, and the first time I met him      I asked him, ``Well, how long will you be here?'' meaning,      how long would he be staying with family that he was staying      with. And he misinterpreted me to mean, ``How long will you      be in the U.S.,'' and just said, ``immigration,'' and      shrugged his shoulders. And that was probably the saddest      thing I've ever seen in my life, was this man-just lost.       Due to time restrictions, we are unable to address all the      myths and . . . overstatements, but I can say that to blame      immigrants is to scapegoat an easy, unpopular target, and to      divert responsbility from more proper parties.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much. Let me ask you a      couple of questions: what does political asylum mean, and why      is that important?       Answer. Well, to me, it means someone who because of their      benefits, because of their actions, needs to flee their home,      needs to leave, whether it's because they were against their      government in this country . . . like the [last] girl was      saying, or the wrong color, in the wrong country; come to a      place where they can be safe, where they can wake up in the      morning and know that, ``okay, nobody's going to shoot me      today.'' That's what asylum means.       Congressman Sanders: Okay. Were you immigrants?       Answer. Yes, my family was . . . [there's] a history of      immigrants in my family.       Answer. Being that we are white, I think we are all      immigrants, in this country.       Congressman Sanders: so, essentially what you're saying is      that everybody other than the Native Americans are immigrants      if we are in this country?       Answer. That's true.       Answer. That's correct.       Congressman Sanders: Okay. Thank you very much--excellent      presentation.                          ____________________
