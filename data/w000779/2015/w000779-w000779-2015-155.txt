Before my colleague leaves the floor, I just want it understood in this body that Senator Cardin has championed for decades the cause of labor rights, environmental rights, human rights. I so appreciate his leadership in this area.  For the first time, as a result of Senator Cardin's work, human rights will be a principle negotiating objective because Senator Cardin has been spot-on in saying trade must be about human rights. So that is No. 1.  Point No. 2, my colleague was absolutely right in saying how important it is that we have more votes here. That is why I am going to be spending all day into the night trying to bring that about. I want my colleague to know I will also be very interested in working with him on this additional amendment he has to further build on what we have in the bill. I thank my colleagues for their patience.  I yield the floor.
