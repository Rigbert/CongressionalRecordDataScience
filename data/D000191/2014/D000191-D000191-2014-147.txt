Speaker, I will vote for H.R. 3811 with significant reservations. There is no question that Americans must be quickly notified if their personal information on Healthcare.gov or a state exchange website is compromised. Current law accomplishes this without a hard and fast deadline. H.R. 3811 aims to add a hard deadline for notification, and that is why I voted for it. Unfortunately the bill is poorly drafted. H.R. 3811 fails to provide any delay for public disclosure if immediate disclosure would derail a federal investigation. Americans have a right to know if their personal information has been stolen or misused, but it is also critical that our federal law enforcement agencies be able to hunt down and prosecute those responsible for a data breach. Republicans need to work with the Administration and Democrats in Congress to come up with a bipartisan solution that makes sure that enforcement can do their job and establishes prompt but reasonable disclosure requirements to protect consumers.
