 President, today, along with Senator Baucus and others, I am introducing the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act of 1999. This bill gives farmers a necessary tool to manage the risk of price and income fluctuations inherent in agriculture. It does this by encouraging farmers to save some of their income during good years and allowing the funds to supplement income during bad years. This new tool will more fully equip family farmers to deal with the vagaries of the marketplace.  Farming is a unique sector of the American economy. Agriculture represents one-sixth of our Gross Domestic Product. It consists of hundreds of thousands of farmers across the nation, many of whom operate small, family farms. These farms often support entire families, and even several generations of a family. They work hard every day to produce the food consumed by this country and by much of the world.  Yet, farming remains one of the most perilous ways to make a living. The income of a farm family depends, in large part, on factors outside its control. Weather is one of those factors. In 1997, for instance, the income of North Dakota farmers dropped 98% due to flooding. Weather can completely wipe out a farmer. At best, weather can cause a farmer's income to fluctuate wildly.  Another factor is the uncertainty of international markets. Iowa farmers now export 40% of all they produce. But what happens, for example, when European countries impose trade barriers on beef, pork and genetically-modified feed grain? And what happens when Asian governments devalue their currencies? Exports fall and farm income declines through no fault of the farmer, but because of decisions made in foreign countries.  Today, farm families face their most severe crisis since the 1980's. Forces beyond the control of the individual farmer have led to record low prices for grain and livestock. The outlook for these families is dismal. Above normal production in 1998 led to nearly unprecedented grain surpluses. In fact, the USDA predicts soybean carry-over stocks will be 95% higher for the 1998-99 marketing season than for the same period last year--the largest since 1986. With this much grain in the bins, a quick recovery in grain prices is highly unlikely.  At present, the only help for these farmers is a reactionary policy of government intervention. The USDA recently committed $50 million in direct aid to hog producers to help them combat the current crisis. In his State of the Union Address, the President pledged additional support for farmers. While we must do all we can to help farmers pull through the current crisis, we must also realize that this aid is merely a short-term solution. Why must farm families wait for a crisis before getting the help they need?  Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today is a proactive measure that will help farmers prevent future crises on their own. It equips them with the ability to offset cyclical downturns that are inherent in their profession without government intervention. In that way, this bill is complementary with the philosophy of the new farm program. Many farmers I have talked to are pleased with the new program, which returned business decisions to the farmers, not bureaucrats at the Department of Agriculture, and not elected officials. Under the new program, farmers determine for themselves what to plant according to the demands of the market. Likewise, the Farm and Ranch Risk Management Act allows the farmer to decide whether to defer his income for later years and when to withdraw funds to supplement his operation.  The volatile nature of commodity markets can make it difficult for family farmers to survive even a normal business cycle. When prices are high, farmers often pay so much of their income in taxes that they are unable to save anything. When prices drop again, farmers can be faced with liquidity problems. This bill allows farmers to manage their income, to smooth out the highs and lows of the commodity markets.  Mr. President, I will take just a moment to explain how the bill works. Eligible farmers are allowed to make contributions to tax-deferred accounts, also known as FARRM accounts. The contributions are tax-deductible and limited to 20% of the farmer's taxable income for the year. The contributions are invested in cash or other interest-bearing obligations. The interest is taxed during the year it is earned.  The funds can stay in the account for up to five years. Upon withdrawal, the funds are taxed as regular income. If the funds are not withdrawn five years after they were invested, they are taxed as income and subject to an additional 10% penalty.  Essentially, the farmer is given a five-year window to manage his money in a way that is best for his own operation. The farmer can contribute to the account in good years and withdraw from the account when his income is low.  This bill helps the farmer help himself. It is not a new government subsidy for agriculture. It will not create a new bureaucracy purporting to help farmers. The bill simply provides farmers with a fighting chance to survive the down times and an opportunity to succeed when prices eventually increase.  Mr. President, I ask that the bill be printed in the Record.  The bill follows:                                 S. 642       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
