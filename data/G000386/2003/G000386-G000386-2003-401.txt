 President, I am happy we are here today on what I think is the first day of maybe 2 weeks of work in the Senate to pass a bill many Members thought would pass last summer but got tied up in some election year political maneuvering in the Senate and did not happen.  We have an opportunity this year--because this bill has broad bipartisan support based on the vote of 15-6 out of our committee, such a vote gives an opportunity to bring this issue to fruition--to present a bill to the President of the United States yet this summer.  Last Thursday, the Finance Committee did report out a breakthrough bill that would make prescription drug coverage a reality for 40 million Medicare beneficiaries. The committee approval was of a sweeping package of new comprehensive prescription drug benefits and other program improvements that makes very good sense but also keeps good our commitment to our seniors.  Since 1965, seniors have had drug insurance without prescription drugs. We have had health insurance without prescription drugs. By passing our bill last Thursday, the Finance Committee made history and came one step closer to changing the fact that prescription drugs were never a part of the Medicare Program unless they were administered in a hospital situation.  How did we get to the point we are today, where it looks as if we have broad bipartisan support for this legislation? This important breakthrough came because of the tireless work of our committee members, both Democrat and Republican, that has been going on over the last 5 years, going back to the time when Senator Breaux, who just spoke and deserves alot of credit for bringing us this far--and also Senator Frist--led the way on prescription drugs before any of us were paying much attention or even listening. Then Senators Snowe, Hatch, and Jeffords carried the torch for 2 years, working with Senator Breaux and this Senator from Iowa on what we called then the tripartisan bill. It is tripartisan instead of bipartisan because Senator Jeffords officially, even though he sits with the Democrats, considers himself not a member of that party but an independent Member of the Senate.  The tripartisan effort, of which I was a part, was something on which I was proud to work but, more importantly, not just as an end in itself but, in hindsight, now I can say it set the stage, the foundation work, for where we are today on a bill that is even better than the tripartisan bill.  How do you get this far? The breakthrough came because of the President's unyielding commitment to getting something done for seniors once and for all. It takes more than just the Senate, it takes more than just the Senate and the House, it takes the President--all three--to bring legislation to what we call law.  This budget that the President put forth put real money on the table for prescription drugs--$400 billion over 10 years. So the Finance Committee wasted no time in taking advantage of that $400 billion that was in the budget for a specific proposal of prescription drugs and reporting out this good bill. I am glad about that; otherwise, we would not be here--without this budget leeway.  The bill we passed out of committee last Thursday night is a balanced, bipartisan product that flowed from good faith, from fair dealing, and from a commitment to consensus across party lines. So it is my hope that this same spirit will prevail on the floor of the Senate during the debate on this bill. I have no reason to believe it will not. I believe the debate in our committee, by both Republicans and Democrats, was just the type of debate you ought to have but do not often see in committees, particularly on very sweeping legislation, which is what this bill happens to be.  I intend to do everything I can to ensure a safe and successful passing of this legislation. To do that, I intend to work hard to keep the climate on the Senate floor as reasonable and most certainly bipartisan as it was in our Finance Committee through the course of last Thursday.  Of course, legislation of this size and scope does not make everybody happy. You cannot expect that it would. This bill cannot and will not be all things to all people. I expect to hear from many Senators about provisions, whether they be large provisions or smaller, less significant provisions in the bill, with which Members might not be happy. Of course, in the process of legislating, I welcome those who want to tell me about those with which they are happy as well. Sometimes we tend more toward the negative than the positive. I think there is a lot about this legislation--most of this legislation--that is very positive.  I pledge to work with all Senators in the days ahead to address concerns people have in the underlying bill. But I will keep my eyes on that larger prize, the promise we have expressed in so many elections, both Republican and Democrat, to modernize and strengthen Medicare, to move Medicare into the practice of medicine of the 21st century. One of the major steps in that move to improve Medicare is providing a prescription drug benefit.  If we were writing a Medicare bill for the first time and we were doing that in the year 2003, it would not be like 1965 when prescription drugs were only 1 percent of the cost of medicine. Today it is a much larger part of the cost of medicine and is part of keeping people out of hospitals. Obviously, we would write prescription drugs in that 2003 brandnew Medicare bill if we were writing a brand-new bill.  I am keeping my eye on that larger prize. That prize is passage of a comprehensive prescription drug benefit that will give immediate assistance, starting next January, 2004, and continuing as a permanent part of Medicare, to every citizen in America. If I were to generalize about a prescription drug benefit: First, it is voluntary. People don't have to buy into it if they don't want. It is very comprehensive and it is universal.  The bill before us puts that prize in our path. The Prescription Drug and Medicare Improvement Act brings Medicare, then, into the 21st century. The bill provides affordable prescription drug coverage on a voluntary basis to every senior in America. The coverage is stable. It is predictable. It is secure. Most important, the value of the coverage does not vary based on where you live and whether you have decided to join a private health plan. For Iowans and others in rural America who have too often been left behind by most Medicare private health plans, this is an important accomplishment that I insisted be in our bill when delivered to the Senate floor.  Overall, we rely on the best of the private sector to deliver drug coverage, supported by the best of the public sector to secure consumer protections and important patient rights. This combination of public and private resources is what stabilizes the benefit and helps keep the costs down.  Keeping costs down is essential because what I hear from the seniors in Iowa is not about a specific program, it is: Why are prescription drug costs so high? To them, so unreasonable. Keeping drug costs down is essential, not just for seniors but for the program as a whole.  Across this bill we have targeted our resources very carefully, giving additional help to our lowest income seniors. Consistent with a policy of targeted policymaking, we have worked hard to keep existing sources of prescription drug coverage viable. Our goal, ever since we started on the tripartisan proposal 2 years ago, was not to replace private dollars with public dollars. This bill accomplishes that by keeping Medicare State pharmacy assistance programs and retiree health benefits strong. Surely any change of this magnitude will have some ripple effect on other sources of coverage.  Regarding company-based benefits, our bill gives employers more flexibility than ever to participate fully in the new drug benefit.  We all know about the pressures employers face in maintaining health care coverage under mounting cost pressures. Decisions about scaling back coverage or even a company dropping it altogether are bound to be made regardless of whether we pass this bill. In the days ahead, we will work to encourage employer participation in the new drug benefit. But I am confident the balanced policy before us is a good place to start.  I would like to speak about our fee-for-service improvements in this bill designated as S. 1.  There is a very important aspect of this bill. It is called the Medicare Improvement Act for a reason. Beyond just prescription drugs, our bill is a milestone accomplishment for improving traditional Medicare, especially Medicare being delivered to rural America.  Included in our bill is the best rural improvement and Medicare equity package that the Senate has ever seen. I insisted on including it in the committee mark because the most important Medicare reforms involved fixing outdated and bureaucratic formulas that penalize rural States. This package passed the Senate 86 to 12 last month on the jobs and growth package. But it was tabled in conference between the House and the Senate.  I hope that vote is very strongly regarded today by the Senate so that we don't even have to deal with this discussion on the floor of the Senate as we did then on the tax bill.  Because this rural health package, or Medicare equity package--whatever you want to call it--was dropped in conference, the President wrote a letter shortly thereafter endorsing these same provisions. I am pleased to include them here today with his support.  At this point, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the President's letter.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              The White House,                                         Washington, May 22, 2003.     Senator Charles Grassley,     Committee on Finance,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Grassley: I want to congratulate you on      Senate passage of the jobs and growth bill, and also on the      passage of     your amendment to that bill which increased federal      assistance to rural providers through the Medicare program.       When we met in the Oval Office in early April, we discussed      our concerns that rural Medicare providers need additional      help, and we committed to addressing their problems. We      agreed on the need to address issues faced by rural      hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies,      and physicians.       You demonstrated your commitment by passing your amendment      last week with tremendous bipartisan support, and by pushing      hard for it in the conference negotiations on the jobs and      growth bill.       I will support the increased Medicare funding for rural      providers contained in your amendment as a part of a bill      that implements our shared goal for Medicare reform.           Sincerely,                                                   George W. Bush.
