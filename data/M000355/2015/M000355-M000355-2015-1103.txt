 President, I would just like to announce that Senator Corker was inadvertently detained in getting to the floor of the Senate. Had he been here, he would have voted yea on the cloture motion.  Mr. President, I also just want to say to our colleagues that this is a very important day for our country. We have demonstrated we can work together on a bipartisan basis to achieve something that is extremely important for America. Not only when we confirm this trade promotion authority will we have the mechanism in place for the President to finalize an extraordinarily important deal with a number of different Asian countries, but it will indicate that America is back in the trade business. It will also send a message to our allies that we understand that they are somewhat wary about Chinese commercial and potentially military domination and that we intend to still be deeply involved in the Pacific.  So I want to congratulate Senator Hatch and Senator Wyden. This has been a long and rather twisted path to where we are today, but it is a very important accomplishment for the country.
