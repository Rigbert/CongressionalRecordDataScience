Chair, I thank the gentleman for drawing attention to the issue. It is my hope that we can move forward with the fiscal year 2018 process, and my colleague and I can continue to work together with the relevant agencies to address this issue so that his constituents and others around the Nation can continue to enjoy all that the Park Service and other Interior lands have to offer without compromising military readiness.
