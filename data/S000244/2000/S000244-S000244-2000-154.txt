Speaker, today I am introducing legislation, the Freedom from Unfair Energy Levy Act or ``FUEL Act,'' to alleviate the impact of current high fuel prices. My legislation would place a six-month moratorium on federal motor fuel excise taxes, including the 18.3 cent per gallon tax consumers pay for gasoline and the 24.3 cent per gallon tax on diesel fuel, and eliminate permanently the 4.3 cents per gallon tax increase approved in 1993.  The need for this legislation is evident. Crude oil prices have more than doubled in the past 12 months, resulting in the largest gas price increase in history. In 1993, when fuel prices were low, Democrats in Congress, President Clinton, and a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Gore combined to increase federal fuel taxes. Now that prices are high and consumers are feeling the pinch, shouldn't we reduce federal fuel taxes?  Some have argued that money from fuel taxes is more useful in Washington than in Americans' pockets, helping motorists afford the high price of gasoline. In reality, the economic damage caused by high fuel prices far outweighs any impact on federal spending that a six-month moratorium could cause. High fuel prices have the potential to bring our strong economy to a grinding halt. In the 1970s, when the retail price of gasoline doubled, the U.S. was hit with double digit inflation and unemployment rose to over eight percent. Oil prices dropped precipitously in the '80s and the U.S. economy greatly improved, but, with the crisis in the Persian Gulf in 1990 and 1991, retail prices of gasoline increased nearly 20 cents per gallon. Predictably, this price hike corresponded with a recession and a rise in unemployment to over seven percent. Congress must work to reduce fuel costs if similar economic dislocation is to be avoided.  This record-breaking increase in the cost of gasoline follows a string of misguided Clinton-Gore Administration energy policies. Besides supporting the 1993 increase in the gas tax, the Administration also locked up the cleanest burning coal in the lower 48 states, which could be used to meet America's heating and electricity needs, by designating massive amounts of land in Utah as a National Monument. Further, the Administration has done nothing to increase U.S. oil production. As a result of the Administration's policies, domestic oil production is at its lowest point since before World War II.  With the onset of rising oil prices, the Clinton Administration has had the opportunity to reconsider its energy policies. However, the Administration's response to the growing national problem of rising oil prices has been to target aid to one region, the Northeast, and to only one group of people, those receiving federal energy subsidies for home heating oil. Other fuel users, including truckers, farmers, and family drivers, are realizing no benefits from the Administration's actions. In contrast, a moratorium on the collection of the federal fuel tax would provide immediate assistance to every American who now bears the burden of rising fuel costs.  The Fuel Act's six-month moratorium on transportation excise taxes and permanent elimination of the 4.3 cent increase will immediately help Americans weather the current oil price storm that is directly impacting their daily lives. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.                          ____________________
