 Speaker, I rise today to discuss the issue of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity as it relates to both our civilian population and our Gulf war veterans.  Multiple Chemical Sensitivity or MCS is a chronic condition marked by heightened sensitivity to multiple different chemicals and other irritants at or below previously tolerated levels of exposure. Sensitivity to odors is often accompanied by food and drug intolerance, sensitivity to sunlight and other sensory abnormalities, such as hypersensitivity to touch,heat and-or cold, and loud noises. MCS is often accompanied by impaired balance, memory and concentration.  As a member of the Human Resources Subcommittee, which has oversight jurisdiction for the Veterans' Affairs, I have been involved in the issue of Gulf war illness and Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. I have been concerned for many years about the role that chemicals may be playing on human health, not only in Gulf war veterans and their families, but in civilian society as well. I have talked to many people who are suffering symptoms not dissimilar from the symptoms that our Persian Gulf veterans are experiencing because of chemicals in their homes or workplaces.  As has been well-documented, the military theater in the Persian Gulf was a chemical cesspool. Our troops were exposed to chemical warfare agents, leaded petroleum, widespread use of pesticides, depleted uranium and burning oil wells. In addition, they were given a myriad of pharmaceuticals as vaccines. Further, and perhaps most importantly, as a result of a waiver from the FDA, hundreds of thousands of troops were given pyridostigmine bromide. Pyridostigmine bromide, which was being used as an anti-nerve agent, had never been used in this capacity before. In the midst of all this, our troops were living in a hot, unpleasant climate and were under very great stress.  The Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs have downplayed the presence of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity in Gulf war veterans. In the very beginning, the Defense Department and Veterans' Affairs actually denied that there was any problem whatsoever with our veterans' health. Then, after finally acknowledging that there was a problem, they concluded that the problem was in the heads of our soldiers--of psychological origin. The DOD and the VA responded very poorly to our veterans' concerns. Tragically, our veterans were discounted. They were called malingerers.  Ever so slowly, the truth about chemical exposure in the Persian Gulf has begun to surface. On July 24, 1997, the Defense Department and the Central Intelligence Agency gave us their best estimate--that as many as 98,910 American troops could have been exposed to chemical warfare agents due to destruction of ``the Pit'' in Khamisiyah, an Iraqi munitions facility.  Not waiting for the DOD and VA, many other Federal, State, and local government agencies have recognized the existence of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity. I want to submit for the Record the latest ``Recognition of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity'' newsletter which lists the U.S. Federal, State, and local government authorities, U.S. Federal and State courts, U.S. workers' compensation boards, and independent organizations that have adopted policies, made statements, and-or published documents recognizing Multiple Chemical Sensitivity disorders.              Recognition of Multiple Chemical Sensitivity       Multiple Chemical Sensitivity or MCS is a chronic condition      marked by heightened sensitivity to multiple different      chemicals and other irritants at or below previously      tolerated levels of exposure. Sensitivity to odors is often      accompanied by food and drug intolerances, photosensitivity      to sunlight and other sensory abnormalities, such as      hypersensitivity to touch, heat and/or cold, and loud noises      and impaired balance, memory and concentration. MCS is more      common in women and can start at any age, but usually begins      in one's 20's to 40's. Onset may be sudden (from a brief      high-level toxic exposures) or gradual (from chronic low-     level exposures), as in ``sick buildings.'' The syndrome is      defined by multiple symptoms occuring in multiple organ      systems (most commonly the neurological, gastrointestinal,      respiratory, and musculoskeletal) in response to multiple      different exposures. Symptoms may include chronic fatigue,      aching joints and muscles, irritable bowel, difficulty      sleeping and concentrating, memory loss, migraines, and      irritated eyes, nose, ears, throat and/or skin. Symptoms      usually begin after a chronic or acute exposure to one or      more toxic chemical(s), after when they ``spread'' to other      exposures involving unrelated chemicals and other irritants      from a great variety of sources (air pollutants, food      additives, fuels, building materials, scented products,      etc.). Consistent with basic principles of toxicology, MCS      usually can be improved, although not completely cured,      through the reduction and environmental control of such      exposures. Many different terms have been proposed in medical      literature since 1869 to describe MCS syndrome and possibly      related disorders whose symptoms also wax and wane in      response to chemical exposures.                    Alternate Names Proposed for MCS       Acquired Intolerance to Solvents, Allergic Toxemia,      Cerebral Allergy, Chemical Hypersensitivity Syndrome,      Chemical-Induced Immune Dysfunction, Ecological Illness,      Environmental Illness or ``EI,'' Environmental Irritant      Syndrome, Environmentally Induced Illness, Environmental      Hypersensitivity Disorder, Idiopathic Environmental      Intolerances or ``IEI,'' Immune System Dysregulation,      Multiple Chemical Hypersensitivity Syndrome, Multiple      Chemical Reactivity, Total Allergy Syndrome, Toxic Carpet      Syndrome, Toxin Induced Loss of Tolerance of ``TILT,'' Toxic      Response Syndrome, 20th Century Disease.

Listed alphabetically below are the U.S. Federal, State,      and local government authorities, U.S. Federal and State      courts, U.S. workers' compensation boards, and independent      organizations that have adopted policies, made statement,      and/or published documents recognizing MCS disorders under      one name or another as a ligitimate medical condition and/or      disability. An introductory section summarizes recognition or      MCS in peer-reviewed medical literature, and the last section      lists upcoming MCS conferences as well as past conferences      sponsored by Federal Government agencies.       The exact meaning of ``recognition'' varies with the      context as each listing makes clear. Recognition by a court      of law, for example, usually refers to a verdict or appeal in      favor of an MCS plaintiff, while recognition by government      agencies varies tremendously--from acknowledgement of the      condition in publications and policies to research funding      and legal protection of disability rights.              Recognition of MCS by 25 Federal Authorities       U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances & Disease Registry in a      unanimously adopted recommendation of the ATSDR's Board of      Scientific Counselors, which calls on the ATSDR to ``take a      leadership role in the investigation of MCS'' [1992, 24      pages, R-1]. To coordinate interagency research into MCS,      the ATSDR co-chairs the Federal Work Group on Chemical      Sensitivity, which it convened for the first time in 1994      (see below). The ATSDR has helped organize and pay for      three national medical conferences on MCS: sponsored by      the National Academy of Sciences in 1991, the Association      of Occupational and Environmental Clinics in 1991, and the      ATSDR in 1994. The combined proceedings of these three      conferences are reprinted in Multiple Chemical      Sensitivity, A Scientific Overview, ed. Frank Mitchell,      Princeton NJ: Princeton Scientific Publishing, 1995 (609-     683-4750 to order). ATSDR also contributed funding to a      study conducted by the California Department of Health      Services to develop a protocol for detecting MCS outbreaks      in toxic-exposed communities via questionnaires and      diagnostic tests (see entry below on California Department      of Health Services). Officially, however, ATSDR has not      ``established a formal position regarding this syndrome''      [1995, 1 page, R-2].       U.S. Army, Medical Evaluation Board on US Army Form 3947      (from the U.S. Army Surgeon General), Army Medical Evaluation      Board certified a diagnosis of ``Multiple Chemical      Sensitivities Syndrome'' for a Persian Gulf veteran on 14      April 1993 [1 page, R-3]. MCS is defined on this form as      ``manifested by headache, shortness of breath, congestion,      rhinorrhea, transient rash, and incoordination associated      with exposure to a variety of chemicals.'' The Board's report      further recognizes that this patient's particular MCS      condition began approximately in April 1991 (while the      patient was serving in the Gulf and entitled to base pay),      that the condition did not exist prior to service, and that      it has been permanently aggravated by service. At least five      other active duty Persian Gulf veterans have been diagnosed      by the Army with MCS, as reported by the Persian Gulf      Veterans coordinating Board in ``Summary of the Issues      Impacting Upon the Health of Persian Gulf Veterans,'' [3      March 1994, 4 page excerpt, R-4]. The Army Medical Department      also has requested funding for a research facility to study      MCS (reported in an Army information paper on ``Post Persian      Gulf War Health Issues,'' 16 November 1993).       U.S. Congress in a VA/HUD Appropriations Bill for FY1993      signed by President Bush in 1992 appropriating ``$250,000      from Superfund funds for chemical sensitivity workshops.''      These funds were used by the U.S. Agency for Toxic Substances      and Disease Registry (see above) to co-sponsor scientific      meetings on MCS with various other organizations [1992, 3      page excerpt, R-5] and support an MCS study (see California      State Department of Health Services below). For FY 1998,      Vermont Congressman Bernard Sanders proposed and Congress      appropriated $800,000 to start a new 5-year civilian agency      research program into MCS among Gulf War veterans. Congress      also requested that the administration report back by January      1998 on how it planned to spend the funds (text of      appropriations is quoted in report; see below: U.S.      Department of Health Services, Agency for Health Care Policy      and Research).       U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission, U.S. Environmental      Protection Agency, American Lung Association, and American      Medical Association (jointly) in a jointly published booklet      entitled Indoor Air Pollution     An Introduction for Health Professional [US GPO 1994-523-217/     81322] under the heading ``What is `multiple chemical      sensitivity' or `total allergy'?, these organizations state      that ``The current consensus is that in cases of claimed or      suspected MCS, complaints should not be dismissed as      psychogenic, and a thorough workup is essential.'' The      booklet is prefaced by the claim that ``Information provided      in this booklet is based upon current scientific and      technical understanding of the issues presented . . .``      [1994, 3 page excerpt, R-6]       U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service in its Final      Environmental Impact Statement on ``Gypsy Moth Management      in the United States: a cooperative approach'', people      with MCS are mentioned as a ``potential high risk group''      who should be given advance notification of insecticide      treatment projects via ``organizations, groups and      agencies that consist of or work with people who are      chemically sensitive or immunocompromised.'' MCS also is      discussed in an appendix on Human Health Risk Assessment      (Appendix F, Volume III of V) under both ``Harzard      Identification'' and ``Groups at Special Risk'' [1995, 11      page excerpt and 1 page cover letter from John Hazel, the      USDA's EIS Team Leader, to Dr. Grace Ziem of MCS Referral      & Resources, R-130].       U.S. Department of Education in the enforcement by its      Office of Civil Rights of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation      Act of 1973 which requires accommodation of persons with      ``MCS Syndrome'' via modification of their educational      environment, as evidenced by several ``agency letters of      finding'' (including San Diego (Calif) Unified School      District, 1 National Disability Law Reporter, para. 61, p.      311, 24 May 1990; Montville (Conn.) Board of Education, 1      National Disability Law Reporter, para. 123, p. 515, 6 July      1990; and four letters (along with an individualized      environment management program) in the case of the Arminger      children of Baltimore County, MD [in 1991, 1992, 1993 and      1994; 20 pages total, R-7]. These accommodations also are      required under the terms of Public Law 94-142, now known as      the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (CFR34 Part      300). The Department of Education as a whole, however, has no      formal policy or position statement on the accommodation of      students with MCS.       U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge National Laboratory in      being the lead sponsor of the 11th Annual Life Sciences      Symposium on ``Indoor Air and Human Health Revisited.'' This      1994 conference was co-sponsored by the US Environmental      Protection Agency and Martin Marietta Energy Systems'      Hazardous Waste Remedial Action Program. The proceedings are      published in Indoor Air and Human Health (Gammage RB and      Berven BA, editors, Boca Raton FL: CRC Lewis Publishers,      1996) and contain several peer-reviewed papers of critical      relevance to MCS by DoE, EPA and other federally funded      researchers.

Dr. Eisenberg proposes spending $300,000 in 1998 for      a ``consensus building'' and research planning conference,      $400,000 for research into the health effects of chemical      mixtures, and $100,000 for an Interagency Coordinator in the      Office of Public Health and Science [January 1998, 7 pages      including MCS R press release, R-168]. Congress requested      the report in 1998, as part of an $800,000 appropriation for      a new civilian research into MCS (see U.S. Congress, above).       U.S. Dept. of HHS, National Institute on Deafness and Other      Communication Disorders in the funding of MCS-related      olfactory research by its Chemical Senses Branch since      NIDCD's creation in 1988; including $29,583,000 in fiscal      year 1998. The Chemical Senses Branch supports both basic and      applied research, with most of its funds going to just five      ``chemosensory research centers'': the Connecticut      Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (860-679-2459), Monell      Chemical Senses Center (215-898-6666), Rocky Mountain Taste      and Smell Center (303-315-5650), State University of New York      Clinical Olfactory Research Center (315-464-5588), and      University of Pennsylvania Smell and Taste Center (215-662-     6580). Free information is available from NIDCD Information      Clearinghouse, 800-241-1044.       U.S. Dept. of HHS, National Institute of Environmental      Health Sciences in ``Issues and Challenges in Environmental      Health,'' a publication about the work of NIEHS, research      priorities are proposed for ``hypersensitivity diseases      resulting from allergic reactions to environmental      substances'' [NIH 87-861, 1987, 45 pages, R--8]. It is not      clear from the context if this statement was meant to include      or exclude MCS, since the condition was still thought by some      at the time to be an allergic-type reaction. In 1992, the      director Dr. Bernadine Healy responded in detail to an      inquiry from Congressman Pete Stark about the scope of NIEHS      research into MCS: ``It is hoped that research conducted at      NIEHS will lead to methods to identify individuals who may be      predisposed to chemical hypersensitivities. . . . NIH      research is directed toward the understanding of the effect      of chemical sensitivities on multiple parts of the body,      including the immune system.'' [1992, 3 pages, R-9]. In 1996,      director Dr. Kenneth Olden wrote US Senator Bob Graham that      ``NIEHS has provided research support to study MCS. . . .      NIEHS has also supported a number of workshops and meetings      on the subject.'' [15 April 1996, 2 pages, R-101]. Dr. Olden      also states that ``Pesticides and solvents are the two major      classes of chemicals most frequently reported by patients      reporting low level sensitivities as having initiated their      problems.''       U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National      Library of Medicine . . . in the 1995 Medical Subject      Headings (MESH) codes used to catalog all medical references,      which started using Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (and its      variations) as a subject heading for all publications indexed      after October 1994 [3 pages excerpt, R-10].       U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office for      Civil Rights (OCR) . . . in the final report by the Regional      Director (of Region VI) regarding OCR's investigation of an      ADA-related discrimination complaint filed by a patient with      MCS against the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer      Center for failing to accommodate her disability and thereby      forcing her to go elsewhere for surgery. Prior to completion      of the investigation and the issuance of any formal      ``findings,'' the OCR accepted a proposal from the Univ. of      Texas to resolve this complaint by creating a joint      subcommittee of the cancer center's Safety and Risk      Management committees. This subcommittee's three tasks (as      approved by the OCR) are to ``identify a rapid response      mechanism which could be triggered by any patient registering      a complaint or presenting a special need which is environment      related; develop a `protocol' outlining steps to be taken to      resolve environmental complaints by patients . . . ; and      inform the medical staff through its newsletter of the      mechanism and the protocol so that they will better      understand how to address such questions or concerns.'' The      OCR has placed the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center ``in      monitoring'' pending completion and documentation of these      changes, but it may initiate further investigation if M.D.      Anderson fails to complete this process within the 13 months      allowed.

In 1997, the U.S. District Court      in Massachusetts required Acting SSA Commissioner John      Callahan to spell out the agency's position on MCS in a      formal memo to the court (31 October 1997, 2 pages, R-164;      see Creamer v. Callahan below, under Recognition of MCS by US      Federal Court Decisions). With this memo, SSA now officially      recognizes MCS ``as a medically determinable impairment'' on      an agency wide basis. MCS is also recognized in several      ``fully favorable'' decisions of the SSA's Office of Hearing      and Appeals: in case #538-48-7517, in which the      administrative law judge, David J. Delaittre, ruled that      ``the claimant has an anxiety disorder and multiple chemical      sensitivity,'' with the latter based in part on the fact that      ``objective [qEEG] evidence showed abnormal brain function      when exposed to chemicals'' [1995, 7 pages, R-12]; in case      #264-65-5308, in which the administrative law judge, Martha      Lanphear, ruled that the claimant suffered severe reactive      airways disease secondary to chemical sensitivity and that      this impairment prevented her from performing more than a      limited range of light work [1996, 8 pages, R-120]; in case      #239-54-6581, in which the administrative law judge, D. Kevin      Dugan, ruled that the claimant suffered severe impairments as      a result of pesticide poisoning, including ``marked      sensitivity to airborne chemicals,'' which prevent her from      ``performing any substantial gainful activity on a sustained      basis [1996, 4 pages, R-135]; in case #024-40-2499, in which      the administrative law judge, Lynette Diehl Lang, recognized      that the claimant suffered from severe MCS and could not      tolerate chemical fumes at work (as a result of overexposure      to formaldehyde in a state office building), as a result of      which he was awarded both disability benefits and      supplemental security income [1995, 8 pages, R-140]; in case      #184-34-4849, in which administrative law judge Robert Sears      ruled that the claimant suffered from ``extreme environmental      sensitivities,'' and particularly ``severe intolerance to any      amount of exposure to pulmonary irritants'' [11 June 1996, 7      pages, R-156]; and in case #256-98-4768, in which the      administrative law judge, Frank Armstrong, classified the      claimant's ``dysautonomia triggered by multiple chemical      sensitivities'' as severe and said it ``prevents the claimant      from engaging in substantial gainful activity on a sustained      basis'' [18 March 1997, 8 pages, R-157].                               ____________________
