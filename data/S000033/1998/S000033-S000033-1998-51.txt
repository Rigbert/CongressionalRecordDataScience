 Stenholm), Mr. Chairman, is that in terms of Mexico between 1995 and 1997, after the so-called bailout, more than a third of Mexico's businesses declared bankruptcy. We have one-third of the work force is unemployed or in imminent danger of unemployment, nearly 2 million peasants have been forced to migrate in search of work, real wages have fallen almost 25 percent. If my colleague went to the Mexican Congress today, they would not tell him that it has been a successful bailout. They would tell him it was a disaster.
