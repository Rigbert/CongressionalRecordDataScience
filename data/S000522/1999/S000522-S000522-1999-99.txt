Madam Chairman. I rise to support the amendment of my colleague from Nevada, Mr. Gibbons, which adds safeguards to the issuance of first-time passports to children. By requiring the consent of both parents, or proof that the person executing the application has legal custody of the child, it will be an important weapon in the fight against international child abduction by noncustodial parents.  The problem is very real. In numerous cases, estranged parents who are foreign residents have abducted their children to foreign countries, flagrantly violating the orders of courts in the United States. The problem is serious enough that the United States has become a party to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. That Convention establishes an international standard according to which children abducted to foreign countries will be returned to the country of their habitual residence.  Unfortunately, the problem persists, even under the Convention. there are continuing, credible allegations that some countries have become havens for child abductors, and ignore return orders issued pursuant to the Hague Convention. For that reason, Section 203 of the underlying bill extends and expands the State Department's annual reporting on the compliance of signatories to the Convention.  The Gibbons amendment is an additional safeguard that will help ensure that children are not wrongfully removed from the United States in the first place. I hope it receives wide support from my colleagues on both sides of the aisle.
