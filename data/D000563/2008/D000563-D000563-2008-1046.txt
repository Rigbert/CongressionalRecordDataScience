Prior to my election to the House of Representatives, I served as parliamentarian of the Illinois State Senate for 14 years. It is a very important role in that body, as Marty's role has been here. You don't spend much time before a microphone, but you spend a lot of time preparing the Members to say the right things before the microphone, and Marty has done that I think in the best possible tradition of the Senate.  Time and again, Members on our side of the aisle, and I believe on the other side as well, knew they could trust his word, trust his judgment, that he understood this institution, not just the rules but the history and the tradition. He served this institution well, as his wife has, and I wish him the very best in his new endeavors.  I am also happy to hear Lula Davis is going to replace Marty in his position. She has a tough act to follow, as has been said, but she is an extraordinary woman, who has served this Senate well for 25 years, and I am certain she will continue on in this fine tradition.  Mr. President, I yield back to the majority leader.
