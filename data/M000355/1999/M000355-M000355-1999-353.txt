 President, Senate Standing Rule XXVI requires each committee to adopt rules to govern the procedures of the Committee and to publish those rules in the Congressional Record not later than March 1 of the first year of each Congress. On February 25, 1999, the Committee on Rules and Administration held a business meeting during which the members of the committee unanimously adopted the rules to govern the procedures of the committee.  Consistent with Standing Rule XXVI, today I am submitting for printing in the Congressional Record a copy of the rules of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration.  The rules follow: Rules of Procedure of the Senate Committee on Rules and Administration                   title i--meetings of the committee       1. The regular meeting dates of the committee shall be the      second and fourth Wednesdays of each month, at 9:30 a.m., in      room SR-301, Russell Senate Office Building. Additional      meetings may be called by the chairman as he may deem      necessary or pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 3 of      rule XXVI of the Standing Rules of the Senate.       2. Meetings of the committee, including meetings to conduct      hearings, shall be open to the public, except that a meeting      or series of meetings by the committee on the same subject      for a period or no more than 14 calendar days may be closed      to the public on a motion made and seconded to go into closed      session to discuss only whether the matters enumerated in      subparagraphs (A) through (F) would require the meeting to be      closed followed immediately by a recorded vote in open      session by a majority of the members of the committee when it      is determined that the matters to be discussed or the      testimony to be taken at such meeting or meetings--       (A) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in      the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct      of the foreign relations of the United States;       (B) will relate solely to matters of the committee staff      personnel or internal staff management or procedure;       (C) will tend to charge an individual with crime or      misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing      of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to      public contempt or obloquy, or will represent a clearly      unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;       (D) will disclose the identity of any informer or law      enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating      to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense      that is required to be kept secret in the interests of      effective law enforcement;       (E) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets      or financial or commercial information pertaining      specifically to a given person if--       (1) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept      confidential by Government officers and employees; or       (2) the information has been obtained by the Government on      a confidential basis, other than through an application by      such person for a specific Government financial or other      benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to      prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such      person; or       (F) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential      under other provisions of law or Government regulations.      (Paragraph 5(b) of rule XXVI of the Standing Rules.)       3. Written notices of committee meetings will normally be      sent by the committee's staff director to all members of the      committee at least 3 days in advance. In addition, the      committee staff will telephone reminders of committee      meetings to all members of the committee or to the      appropriate staff assistants in their offices.       4. A copy of the committee's intended agenda enumerating      separate items of legislative business and committee business      will normally be sent to all members of the committee by the      staff director at least 1 day in advance of all meetings.      This does not preclude any member of the committee from      raising appropriate non-agenda topics.       5. Any witness who is to appear before the committee in any      hearing shall file with the clerk of the committee at least 3      business days before the date of his or her appearance, a      written statement of his or her proposed testimony and an      executive summary thereof, in such form as the chairman may      direct, unless the chairman and the ranking minority member      waive such requirement for good cause.                           title ii--quorums       1. Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(1) of rule XXVI of the      Standing Rules, 9 members of the committee shall constitute a      quorum for the reporting of legislative measures.       2. Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(1) of rule XXVI of the      Standing Rules, 6 members shall constitute a quorum for the      transaction of business, including action on amendments to      measures prior to voting to report the measure to the Senate.       3. Pursuant to paragraph 7(a)(2) of rule XXVI of the      Standing Rules, 4 members of the committee shall constitute a      quorum for the purpose of taking testimony under oath and 2      members of the committee shall constitute a quorum for the      purpose of taking testimony not under oath; provided,      however, that in either instance once a quorum is      established, any one member can continue to take such      testimony.       4. Under no circumstances may proxies be considered for the      establishment of a quorum.                           title iii--voting       1. Voting in the committee on any issue will normally be by      voice vote.       2. If a third of the members present so demand, a record      vote will be taken on any question by rollcall.       3. The results of rollcall votes taken in any meeting upon      any measure, or any amendment thereto, shall be stated in the      committee report on that measure unless previously announced      by the committee, and such report or announcement shall      include a tabulation of the votes cast in favor of and the      votes cast in opposition to each such measure and amendment      by each member of the committee. (Paragraph 7(b) and (c) of      rule XXVI of the Standing Rules.)       4. Proxy voting shall be allowed on all measures and      matters before the committee. However, the vote of the      committee to report a measure or matter shall require the      concurrence of a majority of the members of the committee who      are physically present at the time of the vote. Proxies will      be allowed in such cases solely for the purpose of recording      a member's position on the question and then only in those      instances when the absentee committee member has been      informed of the question and has affirmatively requested that      he be recorded. (Paragraph 7(a)(3) of rule XXVI of the      Standing Rules.)        title iv--delegation of authority to committee chairman       1. The chairman is authorized to sign himself or by      delegation all necessary vouchers and routine papers for      which the committee's approval is required and to decide in      the committee's behalf all routine business.       2. The chairman is authorized to engage commercial      reporters for the preparation of transcripts of committee      meetings and hearings.       3. The chairman is authorized to issue, in behalf of the      committee, regulations normally promulgated by the committee      at the beginning of each session.  title v--delegation of authority to committee chairman and ranking                             minority member       The chairman and ranking minority member, acting jointly,      are authorized to approve on behalf of the committee any rule      or regulation for which the committee's approval is required,      provided advance notice of their intention to do so is given      to members of the committee.                          ____________________
