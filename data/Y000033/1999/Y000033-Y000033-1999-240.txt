Mr. Speaker, today, on behalf of myself and 126 cosponsors I amintroducing the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act. Last Congress, this bill, known as H.R. 901, passed the House by a vote of 236-191. I am confident that this Congress will pass the American Land Sovereignty Protection Act.  H.R. 901 will: (1) prevent the Executive Branch from using World Heritage Site, Biosphere Reserve, and RAMSAR designations to guide domestic land use policies without consulting Congress, (2) restore meaningful Congressional oversight of these programs, (3) protect the rights of owners on non-federal lands adjacent to or intermixed with these land reserves, and (4) protect our domestic land use decision-making process from international interference.  United Nations' land designations, such as UNESCO Biosphere Reserves and World Heritage Sites, currently take place without the approval of Congress and virtually no Congressional oversight. The Constitutional power of Congress ``to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States'' cannot be bargained away by the President in a Treaty.  International land use designations, such as the Biosphere Reserve program, also enable the Executive Branch to implement international treaties, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity, without ratification by the United States Senate. For example, a prime objective of the biosphere reserve program is to create a national network of biosphere reserves that will implement Article 6 of the Convention on Biological Diversity.  The Biosphere Reserve program is not authorized by a single U.S. law nor is it even governed by an international treaty. That is wrong. Executive branch appointees cannot and should not do things that the law does not authorize.  Congress must act to keep international commitments from interfering with Constitutional rights, such as the right to own property, guaranteed all American citizens. Our system may be messy at times, but it is designed to protect rights that Americans value, rights which are only a dream for citizens of many other countries. Otherwise, the rights of our citizens and the boundary between public land managed by the government and private property can be too easily ignored.  The public and local governments are almost never consulted about creating World Heritage Sites and Biosphere Reserves. Designation efforts are almost always driven by unelected federal bureaucrats. Despite claims to the contrary by proponents of these programs, World Heritage Sites and Biosphere Reserves face strong local opposition.  So that everyone understands, my concern is that the United States Congress--and therefore the people of the United States--have been left out of the domestic process to designate Biosphere Reserves and World Heritage sites. This legislation restores the Constitutional role of Congress in governing lands belonging to the United States thereby making the people of this country relevant in this process.  The American Land Sovereignty Protection Act requires that Congress approve international land designations in the United States on a case by case basis, because according to the United States Constitution, Congress possesses the ultimate decision-making power over lands belonging to the people of the United States.                          ____________________
