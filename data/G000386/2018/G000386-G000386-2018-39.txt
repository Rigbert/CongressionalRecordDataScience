 President, during this season of Advent, millions of Americans join Christians around the world to celebrate the coming of Jesus Christ.  A central tenet of Christianity is born in the belief that Jesus is the Light of the World.  On December 25, we celebrate the light, the hope, and the joy our Lord and Savior brings into the world.  Today, I come to the floor of the U.S. Senate to pay tribute to a servant of Christ who dedicated her life to bring light, hope, and joy to children and families around the world.  Her name is Becky Weichhand.  Becky blazed a trail of hope and love to spread joy to children, especially those awaiting adoption.  To those who knew her best, Becky was an unconditional prayer warrior, who graciously shared love and loyalty to friends and strangers alike.  By all accounts, Becky shared uncommon devotion in her advocacy for children, especially those in our Nation's foster care system.  Since 2014, Becky served as executive director of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute.  Before that, she served as director of policy, where she shined light on the needs of children here in the United States and abroad, including the United Kingdom, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Cambodia, Vietnam, South Korea, and Haiti.  Since first joining the corps of dedicated professionals working to help the foster youth community, Becky had a plan.  She had a plan for kids who went to bed each night praying for a forever home.  She had a plan for young people who were growing up without a mom or dad.  She had a plan to connect as many kids as possible with a forever family.  Becky worked tirelessly to educate, organize and advocate here on Capitol Hill and at the grassroots.  She devoted her life and career to making dreams come true for adoptive parents and their children.  Among her priorities and achievements, I know that Becky was committed to growing the Foster Youth Internship Program that connects foster youth and congressional offices.  The program provides opportunities for foster youth to work on Capitol Hill.  Through this program, foster youth collaborate and bring real-life perspective to the policymaking tables.  I have been fortunate to have an intern through this program who worked with my staff to help develop Federal child welfare reforms.  They identified more effective ways to serve foster kids, including those who age out of the system.  Becky also worked to grow the Angels in Adoption Program.  It brings recognition to families who go above and beyond the call to action in their local communities to open their hearts and homes to children awaiting adoption.  Shining light on the good deeds and unmet needs of others was her way of bringing light to the world.  As a founder and cochair of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth, I would like to turn the spotlight on Becky's good works.  She was driven to find a forever family for every child. She was a problem solver brimming with energy. Her advocacy led to important reforms. She believed in miracles. She made every effort to work miracles for children and families.  Becky mentored foster youth and paved the way for kids to dream big. She gave them reason to hope that their dreams can come true.  I extend my condolences to Becky's family, friends, and loved ones.  At age 36, Becky lost a brave battle to cancer.  Her legacy will live on and bring joy to countless children and moms and dads where it matters the most: in a forever family united through the blessing of adoption.  On Saturday, December 15, a celebration of life will take place at the First Church of God in Becky's hometown of St. Joseph, MI.  On this day, her loved ones will celebrate the light, joy, and hope she brought to this world.  May the blessings of God's Heavenly embrace welcome Becky into her new forever home for life everlasting.                          ____________________
