Hank Stram, one of the most successful coaches in professional football history, will also be in attendance at this memorable event. Hank was raised in Gary, Indiana, and graduated from Lew Wallace High School where he played football, basketball, baseball, and ran track. While attending college at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Hank won four letters in baseball and three letters in football. During his senior year he received the Big Ten Medal, which is awarded to the conference athlete who best combines athletic and academic success. After college Hank entered the NFL, where he became best noted for coaching the Kansas City Chiefs to a Super Bowl victory in 1970.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in commending the Silver Bell Club, Lodge 2365 of the Polish National Alliance of the United States, for hosting this celebration of success in sports and academics. The effort of all those involved in planning this worthwhile event is indicative of their devotion to the very gifted young people in Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
