 For purposes of clarifying the intent of this legislation, I would like to ask an additional question. The legislation includes provisions to prohibit a balance calculation method known as ``two-cycle'' billing. This provision would have the effect of prohibiting the card issuer from assessing interest on balances from the immediately preceding billing cycle as a result of a loss of a grace period. Is it the Senator's understanding that this provision would not affect a credit card issuer's ability to offer deferred interest programs?
