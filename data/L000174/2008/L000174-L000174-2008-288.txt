President, today, I join with Senator Hatch to introduce a bipartisan bill to address the resource needs of our men and women on the Federal judiciary and people around the country by authorizing additional U.S. courts of appeals and district court judgeships. It has been 18 years since the last time a comprehensive judgeship bill was enacted to address the growth in the workload of the Federal judiciary by adding new Federal judgeships. That legislation established 11 additional circuit court judgeships and 61 permanent and 13 temporary district court judgeships.  Since 1990, case filings in our Federal appellate courts have increased by 55 percent and case filings on our district courts have risen by 29 percent. Without a comprehensive bill, Congress has proceeded to authorize only a few additional district court judgeships and extend temporary judgeships when it could. For instance, in 2002 we were able to provide for 15 new judgeships in the Department of Justice authorization bill. However no additional circuit court judgeships have been created since 1990 despite their increased workload.  In 2006, the weighted number of filings in district courts, which takes into account an assessment of case complexity, were 464 per judgeship, well above the Judicial Conference's standard. The same year, the national average circuit court caseload per three-judge panel approached the record number of 1,230 cases, recorded a year earlier.  Our Federal judges are working harder than ever, but in order to maintain the integrity of the Federal courts and the promptness that justice demands, judges must have a manageable workload. The bill that we are introducing today would add 12 permanent circuit court judgeships, 38 permanent district court judgeships, and convert five existing temporary judgeships into permanent positions. These additional judgeships would address the significant increase in caseloads that the Federal courts have seen over the nearly two decades since the last comprehensive judgeship bill was enacted. It is based on the recommendations of the Judicial Conference and its analysis of caseloads and needs.  Our bipartisan bill would also add 14 temporary district court judgeships, two temporary circuit court judgeships, and extend one existing temporary district court judgeship. These additional temporary judgeships allow Congress some flexibility with regardto future judgeship needs. If caseloads continue to increase, Congress has the option to introduce legislation making permanent or renewing these temporary judgeships.  By providing that these new judgeships become effective the day after the inauguration of the next President, we attempt to insulate this effort from partisan politics.  This bill has the support of the Judicial Conference and Senators on both sides of the aisle. I thank Senators Feinstein and Schumer for joining us in this effort. A comprehensive bill to respond to the increasing workload of our Federal judiciary is long overdue.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2774       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be      necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act, including      such sums as may be necessary to provide appropriate space      and facilities for the judicial positions created by this      Act.     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.       (a) In General.--This Act (including the amendments made by      this Act) shall take effect on January 21, 2009.       (b) Coordination Rule.--The amendments made by this Act      shall take effect after the amendment made by section      509(a)(2) of the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007      (Public Law 110-177; 121 Stat 2543).  MR. HATCH. Mr. President, Americans are blessed to have the best and most independent judicial system in the world. In our constitutional framework, Congress has responsibility to both make the laws and ensure that the judiciary tasked with interpreting and applying those laws has the appropriate resources. This includes addressing the staffing and compensation needs of the judicial branch, and we should strive to do so without political gambles or speculation about the outcome of a Presidential election.  For that reason, when I chaired the Judiciary Committee I sponsored and cosponsored judgeship bills in 2000 when Bill Clinton was President and in the 108th Congress under the current President. And that is why I am cosponsoring this bill with Senator Leahy, the current Judiciary Committee, chairman. It is based on the judicial conference's assessment of their needs, not on backroom political deals, and it reflects the changes to the allocation of appeals court seats made in S. 378, the Court Security Improvement Act, which I also cosponsored.                                 ______                                       By
