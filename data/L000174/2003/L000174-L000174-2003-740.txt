I wanted to remind them that while Senators are merely constitutional impediments to the staff, in the minds of some, we could still have the vote at 5:30. I am trying to keep this schedule to what the distinguished majority leader wanted and do what was told others. Frankly, I don't care when the vote is, but I do thank the staff for trying to keep us on other schedules.  If we go the full time, then the vote would be, am I correct, unless some time is yielded back, it would be around 20 minutes to 6 and not 5:30?
