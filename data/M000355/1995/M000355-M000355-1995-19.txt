 The new gift rule contains an exception for employments benefits, such as a pension plan. It permits a Member, officer, or employee to participate in an employee welfare and benefits plan maintained by a former employer. Current Senate rules and practice also permit such continued participation, with one limitation. To the extent a Member, officer, or employee participates in such a plan of a former employer, the participant may not accept continued contributions from that former employer. Is it intended that the new gift rule incorporate this current Senate practice?
