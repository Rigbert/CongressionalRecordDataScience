President, yesterday, during consideration of the fiscal year 2002 foreign operations, export financing, and related programs appropriations bill, a colloquy between myself and Senator McConnell concerning American companies doing business in Colombia was printed in the Record.

Among other things, it omitted a copy of an amendment that Senator McConnell and I had considered offering to the foreign operation bill. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that our complete colloquy, a well as our proposed amendment, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            amendment no. --       On page 144, line 3, after the colon insert the following:      ``Provided further, That of the funds appropriated under this      heading for Colombia, $10,000,000 shall not be obligated or      expended until the Government of Colombia resolves      outstanding international arbitration decisions which favor      United States corporations more than 50 percent owned and      controlled by United States citizens:''.
