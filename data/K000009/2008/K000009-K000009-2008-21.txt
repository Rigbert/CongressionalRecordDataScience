 Number one, financial reform must come first. America needs reform, not a bailout. Over the last 20 years, legislation has been passed by this Congress, H.R. 1278 in 1989 called FIRREA, interstate banking in 1994 which created those big mega banks, and H.R. 10/S. 900 in 1999, which overturned the Glass-Steagall Act that allowed banking, real estate and insurance all to be under the roof of the same firm.  Well all those bills together have created a highly concentrated financial system, particularly in housing finance, rather than a decentralized one like that which we had for most of the 20th century. This bailout is the result of high-risk misbehavior by distant financial giants. They have sucked equity out of local communities and turned local markets into derivative, debt-ridden communities rather than independent, robust, credit markets with prudent savings and lending practices.  Reform should restore those prudent and transparent banking practices defining the difference between banks and investment houses and protecting and restoring the protections that existed prior to 1999 when that Glass-Steagall Act was eliminated. Conflicts of interest at bond rating agencies should be addressed by such agencies becoming public. Reform, as I say, and regulation should come first out the door before the money, not later.                              {time}  2000  Number two, Main Street housing market deflation must be stabilized as step one. A moratorium should be placed on all home foreclosures for 120 days. That will take us into the new year. And deflation in the housing market really is what has triggered this credit crunch. The Federal Reserve could use its influence through its regionalized structure to bring parties together to work out affected loans in places like Ohio to stabilize local real estate and housing markets. That is where the real assets are and where the markets must clear and adjust.  What a crime it would be if people are thrown out of their homes and an institution somewhere over in England like Barclays becomes the owner of those assets and gets them at fire-sale prices. We need to put those assets back in the hands of the American people.  The traditional home loan backed by savings deposits was converted into a bond during the 1990s and then securitized into those international markets. The time-tested loan standards of character, collateral and collectibility were shelved, and therefore to reform this system it must be decentralized again, with the community savings and home loan bank system being reestablished with an emphasis on increasing savings deposits with enhanced local mortgage origination and oversight, as opposed to concentration of activity in Wall Street investment houses.  Number three, a new Financial Assets Management Board should be formed to manage this mortgage refinancing and workouts at the local level, similar to FDR's Homeowner Loan Corporation.  Fourth, the Department of Justice should be authorized to investigate the wrongdoers, to track down the fraud, misrepresentation of asset value, insider trading and related crimes in this scandal. There should be over 500 attorneys and accountants and support staff to conduct thorough investigations, forensic accounting and prosecution.  Fifth, any Federal dollar that is expended must result in equity to our taxpayers. If our people are going to be forced to fund unlimited private sector bad debt, our people must receive an equity share in every Wall Street financial company proportional to the amount of bad debt held that is shifted to the taxpayer.  Our people are being asked to take 100 percent of the risk. They should be afforded the benefit of any future profits. A 0.25 percent transaction fee should be charged on every Wall Street trade or Chicago Board of Trade transaction, and that $150 billion a year that will be yielded should pay the American people back over time.  Sixth, a select congressional committee should be established to hold hearings, do proper oversight and advise the next President and Congress on mortgage and financial recovery operations and additional means to assure any necessary repayment of public investment.  Seven, standards for executives and compensation structure in the financial services industry should be established. Those outlandish salaries that they get should be curbed, and all bonuses, stock options and exceptional compensation for those individuals and their boards of directors should be discouraged. We should help to pay the bill by going after some of their assets.  Finally, Madam Speaker, I would like to place this in the Record, and also include bankruptcy reform as one of the major changes that we need to make in any measure. These are the steps that would actually result in market recovery, not just bailing out unknown assets and bad debts from Wall Street.    Kaptur: Real Reform or Nothing--Financial Reform Must Come First       America needs real financial reform first, not a bailout.      Over the last 20 years, legislation passed by Congress (HR      1278 in 1989, HR 3841 in 1994, and HR 10/S 900 in 1999) has      highly concentrated financial activities on Wall Street--     particularly housing finance--rather than decentralized them.      This bailout is the result of high risk misbehavior by      distant financial giants. They have sucked equity out of      local communities and turned local markets into derivative,      debt-ridden communities rather than independent robust credit      markets with prudent savings and lending practices.       Such reform should restore prudent and transparent banking      practices. Reform of the deregulated financial structure      should start with defining the difference between banks and      investment houses and restoring protection that existed prior      to 1999 when the Glass-Steagall Act was eliminated. Each      should have defined activities and be regulated separately.       Conflicts of interest at bond rating agencies should be      addressed by such agencies becoming public.       Reform and regulation should come first, not later.      Franklin Delano Roosevelt invented the basic framework that      served     America well for the last century. Congress should adapt it      to current challenges on a Jeffersonian model, not the      proposed Hamiltonian approach.  main street housing market deflation must be stabilized as step one       Legislation should mandate a moratorium on all home      foreclosures for 120 days. Deflation in the housing market      has triggered this credit crunch. The Federal Reserve must      use its influence through its regionalized structure to bring      parties together to work out affected loans to stabilize      local real estate and housing markets. That is where the real      assets are and where the market must clear and adjust. Before      the Federal Reserve and Treasury, or its consultants, can      foreclose upon any home, it must first certify under criminal      penalty that a workout was attempted with the mortgage. A      workout certification on every home will be required.      Additionally, a 120-day moratorium will drastically reduce      the amount of capital needed. Otherwise, millions more of our      citizens will be foreclosed and financial giants like      Barclay's will pick up local real estate at fire sale prices.       The cowboy banking that accelerated in the last 20 years      concentrated financial power on Wall Street and huge regional      mega-banks. The traditional home loan, backed by savings      deposits, was converted into a bond that was securitized into      international markets. The time tested loan standards of      character, collateral, and collectibility were shelved. They      must be restored. To reform the system, it must be      decentralized, with the community savings and home loan bank      system being reestablished, with an emphasis on increasing      savings deposits, enhanced local mortgage origination and      oversight, as opposed to concentration of activity in Wall      Street investment houses. These local institutions should be      empowered to do workouts and supported through any housing      finance provided. The federal incentives for savings and home      loan institutions, as existed pre-FIRREA, should be restored.       In a letter to Congress the CEO of BB states, ``The      primary beneficiaries of the proposed rescue are Goldman      Sachs and Morgan Stanley.'' This is essentially unfair and      improperly focused. Attention must be placed on restoring      value to local housing real estate markets.  a new financial assets management board should be formed to manage   mortgage refinancing and workouts (similar to fdr's home owner loan                               corporation)       Board Members: Secretary of Treasury, Federal Reserve      Chairman, Comptroller General of the United States,      Appointees of House Speaker, House Minority Leader, Senate      Majority Leader, and Senate Minority Leader, Appointee from      the States Attorneys General, U.S. Attorney General.       Department of Justice Should Be Authorized to Investigate       Creation of a Special Prosecutor position at the U.S.      Department of Justice with authority and adequate funding to      track down the fraud, misrepresentation of asset value,      insider trading, and related crimes in this scandal.       Funds should be allocated to hire 500 or more attorneys and      accountants and support staff to conduct thorough      investigation, forensic accounting, and prosecution.       Recovery of assets fraudulently or illegally obtained by      individuals, Boards of Directors, and institutions involved      shall be required retroactive to the decade of the 1990s to      the present.                  equity to taxpayers must be mandated       If U.S. taxpayers are forced to fund unlimited private      sector bad debt, they must receive an equity share in every      Wall Street financial company proportional to the amount of      bad debt held that is shifted to the government.       Since taxpayers are assuming 100 percent of the risk, they      should be afforded the benefit of any future profits. Those      profits should be placed in a special lock box account for      Social Security. The trustee should be restrained to      investments in AAA state and local bonds.       Taxpayers who have been up-do-date on home mortgage      payments but who will be required to help fund the bailout      should be afforded lower interest rates on their existing      home mortgages to total the amount being borrowed from them.       A .25 percent transaction fee should be charged on every      Wall Street or Chicago Board of Trade transaction and the      funds yielded should be used to pay back the loan for U.S.      taxpayers, this fee will yield about $150 billion annually.         a select congressional committee should be established       A cross-jurisdictional Select Committee of Congress should      be established in both chambers to hold hearings, do proper      oversight, and advise the next Congress and President on      mortgage and financial recovery operations and additional      means to assure any necessary repayment of the public      investment. standards for executives and compensation structure in the financial                      services industry established       Compensation for financial executives at all levels should      be limited to five year rolling average, made public on a      quarterly basis, similar to Securities and Exchange      Commission filings.       Alternatively, compensation for top executives at financial      houses should not exceed the salary of the President of the      United States until such time as the federal government      recovers or receives repayment for any financing that may be      provided.       Anyone who had major responsibility for buying or selling      these junk bonds should be permanently banned from holding      any position in any company dealing with financing of any      sort.       All bonuses, stock options, and exceptional compensation      (present and post for 10 years) for those individuals and      their Boards of Directors should be disgorged. This should be      a responsibility of the Department of Justice's      investigations. Since executives and Boards of Directors were      paid for fraudulent transactions and likely insider trading,      their earnings were assumed under false pretenses.       New leverage ratios should be devised and incorporated with      this law, probably 10:1, not 30:1.       Anyone or any company involved in leveraging or selling any      sub-par mortgages involved in the bailout should be banned      from employment by Treasury to help in these workouts.       Secretary Paulson and all political appointees in the U.S.      Treasury and the Federal Reserve should be required to renew      their public disclosure statements as circumstances have      changed since their original filings.       All financial institutions and executives that will benefit      from this bailout in any way should be banned from making any      political contributions this election cycle and during the      111th Congress.  Additional Financial System Reporting and Transparency Requirements                             Must be Required       The Financial industry, including hedge funds, shall comply      with new regulations involving disclosure, capital      requirements, conflicts of interest, and market manipulation.       All hedge funds must immediately disclose holdings.       Hedge fund profits must be taxed at the sane rate as other      financial corporations, their current rate is 15% on current      income with a capital gains rate of only 5%.       Consumer credit debt must be reported quarterly to assure      Congress has complete information on market conditions that      may impact future solvency.       The source of the bailout money must be explicitly      identified as well as the costs and nature of the financing      agreement. If foreign nations, banks, or sovereign wealth      funds provide monies, and trade or defense concessions are      inherent in the agreement, Congress shall require      certification from Treasury and the Federal Reserve that no      side deals were transacted as a part of the agreement.       A provision should be included that if such side deals of      any kind that may be implied or thought to exist, the United      States is not bound by it.       As part of the legislation, the Secretary of Treasury and      the Federal Reserve Chairman are required to provide a      statement as to how the arrangement will be executed in order      to avoid fueling inflation and rising interest rates.                           Bankruptcy Reform       Bankruptcy law should be changed to give bankruptcy judges      the authority to: Reset primary mortgages during personal      bankruptcies; and Release credit card holder from that debt      in personal bankruptcy.       Our nation, our taxpayers, and our communities need real      reform or nothing.                          ____________________
