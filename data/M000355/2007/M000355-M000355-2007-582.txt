 We were there last week when the majority leader indicated that he would agree to an amendment on each side but that he wanted to pick our amendment. So I am constrained to object on the basis that we on this side would choose, if we were to only have one resolution, what it would be. I, therefore, object.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, February 27, at a time determined by the majority leader, after consultation with the Republican leader, the Senate proceed en bloc to the following concurrent resolutions under the following agreement: a concurrent resolution, if received from the House, the text of which is at the desk; S. Con. Res. 7, the Warner resolution which is to be discharged from the Foreign Relations Committee; McCain-Lieberman-Graham regarding benchmarks; and Gregg related to funding.  I would further ask consent there be a total of 12 hours of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees; provided further that no amendments be in order to any of those measures; further, that at the use or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to four consecutive votes on the adoption of the concurrent resolutions in the following order, with no further action or intervening debate: the Gregg amendment; S. Con. Res. 7, the Warner resolution; the House resolution; and the McCain-Lieberman-Graham benchmarks.  Finally, I ask consent that any resolution that does not receive 60 votes in the affirmative, the vote on the adoption be vitiated and the concurrent resolution be returned to its previous status.
