 Today, it is my sincere privilege to pay tribute to my friend who has answered this call and used his considerable gifts with compassion and grace. At the end of May, Dave Stone stepped down as the senior pastor of Southeast Christian Church in Louisville, KY. I would like to take a moment to honor his years of pastoral leadership and to sincerely thank him for his care and dedication to our church family.  Elaine and I have been attending Southeast for nearly two decades, drawn by the moving preaching and the warm community. Dave has been an integral part of that spiritual life for 30 years, and there are so many of us in Louisville who have been made better by his friendship and leadership. Throughout his 13 years as senior pastor, Dave was our shepherd and used his many talents to point tens of thousands to the Lord.  When Dave first joined Southeast, his devotion to Christ and His church instantly became clear. Dave came not only with an inspirational vision, but also with a deep sense of humility. To anyone who walked into this church, he made a point to welcome them like a lifelong friend. In both the easy and the difficult times, Dave shared his sense of joy in everything he did for the church. His warmth and humor made a positive and tangible impact on me and many other members.  Dave assumed the responsibility of senior pastor after the retirement of Bob Russell, who had served the church community in leadership roles for 40 years. The next year, Southeast announced the establishment of a second location, a remarkable sign of growth and a testament to Dave's leadership. Southeast has continued adding more campuses to the church, and now it reaches believers on TV, on the radio, and at seven locations. Through this development, Southeast has become the largest church in Kentucky and the seventh largest in the entire country.  Southeast's impressive growth also brought more responsibilities for Dave, his team, and his family. Whatever challenge presented itself over the years, Dave's skilled ministry helped the community thrive. Thousands of people have watched Dave preach, relied on his mentorship, and enjoyed his friendship.  Dave admitted that he hates the word ``retirement,'' but he also knew it was time to pass the baton. When he announced his departure, Dave expressed his deep gratitude to the church leadership, staff, and all the faithful. He once again showed himself the humble pastor who fulfilled his mission from God.  Now that he has officially stepped down as Southeast's senior pastor, Dave is looking for his next calling. I am confident he will continue using his many gifts to draw the faithful to the Lord. He will also get to spend more time with his wife Beth, his children, and his grandchildren. Although Elaine and I will certainly miss his Christian spirit and good humor, we wish Dave and his family all the best on their next adventure.                          ____________________
