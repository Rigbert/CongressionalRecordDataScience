Mr. Speaker, Janice and Len Nachbar of Freehold, New Jersey, who lead the Central New Jersey Dystonia Support and Action Group, eloquently addressed a congressional briefing yesterday on dystonia--a neurological movement disorder characterized by muscle contractions causing abnormal and often painful body movements and postures. Dystonia can cause a range of impairments, in some cases leaving a person legally blind or unable to walk or communicate.   Janice and Len are the loving parents of Joanna, a remarkably brave and smart woman who is afflicted with dystonia. Janice and Len explained their daughter's multi-year battle with this condition, saying in part:   ``Eventually, her dystonia became so advanced and painful; she was approved for Deep Brain stimulation surgery, or commonly known as, DBS. She underwent seven hours of brain surgery while wide awake to implant electrodes in her brain with a second surgery to follow.''   Ultimately, says Janice, ``[Dystonia's] largest tolls are emotional. How hard it is to see a bright child with the world open to her disintegrate daily.''   Today, though Joanna faces significant mobility and communication challenges, she serves as an online mentor for dystonia patients around the globe.   Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit the Nachbars' compelling testimony from the briefing, along with testimony from Janet Hieshetter, executive director of the Dystonia Medical Research Foundation. I urge my colleagues to read their statements and seek to join us in expanding improved research and treatments for this little-understood condition.   testimony of janet hieshetter, executive director of the dystonia                       medical research foundation        Thank you all for being here today and joining us for      Dystonia Awareness Month. If you don't know a great deal      about dystonia, you are in the right place. We have a great      line up of speakers that can talk extensively about these      conditions.        My name is Janet Hieshetter, and I am Executive Director      of the non-profit Dystonia Medical Research Foundation. The      DMRF works to advance medical research and support      individuals and families impacted by dystonia. We also work      collaboratively with four other patient-driven dystonia      organizations, the Benign Essential Blepharospasm Research      Foundation, DySTonia, Inc., the National Spasmodic Dysphonia      Association and the National Spasmodic Torticollis      Association to improve patient care through a nationwide      grassroots effort known as the Dystonia Advocacy Network.        Briefly, dystonia is a neurological movement disorder that      is characterized by persistent or intermittent muscle      contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements,      postures, or both. The movements are usually patterned and      twisting, and may resemble a tremor.        There are multiple forms of dystonia, and dozens of      diseases and conditions may include dystonia as a symptom.      Dystonia can affect a single body area like the eyelids      leaving the person legally blind or be generalized throughout      multiple muscle groups in the body--often placing people in      wheelchairs.        Dystonia affects men, women, and children of all ages and      backgrounds. Estimates suggest that no fewer than 300,000      people are affected in North America. Dystonia causes varying      degrees of disability and pain, from mild to severe.        Thanks in large part to our federal investment in medical      research, significant advancements have been made in our      understanding of these conditions. While there remains no      cure, clinical research has led to meaningful treatment      options including botulinum toxin injections and deep brain      stimulation.                       testimony of janice nachbar        Joanna was a very bright, articulate child. She walked at      ten months. She had a high and big voice.        Her hands always had tremors, but so did those of my      mother and grandmother, so we shrugged it off. She also never      vomited. A good thing, right.        She was in the gifted class in first grade. She attended      dancing school and gymnastics and was good at both.        Strange symptoms started appearing between the ages of six      and ten. Her handwriting became cramped and her reading was      not advancing properly. In the third grade, she was moved out      of the gifted class.        By the sixth grade, she was on the verge of repeating the      grade. Although she moved up to the seventh grade, her work      was still below grade level.        We took her to a multitude of specialists, including an      eye therapist, reading labs and psychologists, thinking she      had a learning disability. Nothing was helping. She became      frustrated and felt she was a failure.        While in High School, Joanna had braces on her teeth.      Coincidentally, her speech started to become cluttered and      hard to understand. We attributed it to the braces.        She was classified as a learning disabled student and was      placed in a special academic program in school. She was given      individual help with her work. We also hired tutors, but her      work was still unsatisfactory.        We knew something was radically wrong when her braces came      off and we still could not understand her.        Physically, she was still functional. She drove her car.      After graduation, she became licensed as a home and nursing      home aide and briefly was able to work.        By age 21, her speech was almost gone and she was having      pain and spasms. Her back was pulled to the side and her hips      were uneven. Her balance was off and she fell repeatedly.        The first neurologist she saw told us she had Fazio-Land      disease. This was a form of muscular dystrophy and we were      told she would slowly strangle to death.        We next took her to a well-known neurologist in a large      teaching hospital in NYC. He admitted her to their testing      center and spent three days having various medical staff      poke, prod and test. He came up with nothing, other than to      watch her.        As parents, we were panicking as we watched her diminish      and were fortunate enough to obtain an appointment with Dr.      Mark Hallett, Senior Investigator of the Human Motor Control      Section of the NINDS.        Joanna and I traveled to Bethesda and spent an afternoon      with Dr. Hallett.        Thanks to him, and after 15 years of searching, we finally      had a diagnosis.        He referred us to a movement disorder specialist who,      coincidentally, was in the same building and one floor below      the neurologist she had been seeing for two years, but who      had never mentioned the movement disorder clinic in his own      department.        This kind of disconnect by physicians is a huge issue for      those seeking a diagnosis and treatment. If a physician does      not recognize a movement disorder or avoids a referral to a      movement disorder specialist, the patient is helpless.        After seeing the new movement disorder neurologist, Joanna      began taking medications for Dystonia. At this point, the      mystery of her school failure was revealed. Her hairdresser      commented that her head no longer had minute tremors.      Tremors? I never saw them. When the tremors stopped, she      could read.        She didn't have a learning disability; she just couldn't      see the page. Imagine how different her school experience      would have been with an early diagnosis and treatment? Now      she was able to go to a local college and obtain an      associate's degree, something none of us could have imagined.        Eventually, her dystonia became so advanced and painful;      she was approved for Deep Brain stimulation surgery, or      commonly known as DBS. She underwent seven hours of brain      surgery while wide awake to implant electrodes in her brain      with a second surgery to follow.        Some people have miraculous results. Joanna had minimal      results, but the DBS did lessen her pain.        Remember she never vomited? It seems she has no gag      reflex. She also cannot cough. As a result, Joanna has had      numerous pneumonias, with the last one requiring 11 days in      CCU, five days of which on a ventilator. It was a devastating      experience for all of us. I spent the entire 11 days next to      her, only leaving her side to eat or shower in the hospital      or to take a short break when another family member sat with      her. All patients need advocates, but a non-verbal one is      even more vulnerable.        Because her dystonia affects her mouth so intensely, she      cannot take in enough nourishment to sustain health.        At 5'3 inches in height, she weighed about 88 pounds. She      now has a permanent feeding tube and takes all nutrition and      hydration through it.        She can eat very little, since just about everything is a      choking risk and she can't cough to move the food out. Her g      tube became infected and she spent 7 weeks in a rehab center.      Of course, her dad and I spent 7 weeks there, as well.        Despite all of these treatments, Joanna's dystonia      worsened. She lost all speech, most of the use of her hands      and the ability to walk safely.        My husband and I are aging and were fearful for Joanna's      future security. As a family, we made the most difficult      decision of a lifetime. In March of 2014, Joanna moved to a      long-term care facility in Philadelphia.        It's a wonderful place and she has many friends, but it's      still not the life any of us envisioned for our bright and      lively child.        Dystonia has affected Joanna and us in many ways.      Economically, we made huge changes in our work so as to be      able to care for her. Her medical bills, hospitalizations and      trips to see doctors added up.        Socially, our family became hermits, avoiding social      activities either because Joanna couldn't keep up or we had      nobody who could stay with her. We missed birthdays,      weddings, family vacations and other important events due to      Dystonia.        The largest tolls are emotional. How hard it is to see a      bright child with the world open to her disintegrate daily.      How hard is it for Joanna?        That's our family story and Joanna's journey. Thank you.                        testimony of len nachbar        My wife, Janice, spoke to you about how dystonia has      affected our daughter, Joanna, and our family. I'm going to      tell you about how dystonia changed the lives of members of      our New Jersey and Philadelphia support groups and of friends      of ours around the country.        Last week, a bright, beautiful and talented friend in her      twenties wrote: ``Feeling so completely broken. Why was I      even born? I live in such pain and agony. There is no end in      sight.'' She's a graduate student who should have a promising      career and life, but the constant pain caused by her dystonia      hasn't allowed it.        Sometimes the pain, the inability to work and the      resulting poverty becomes too much to bear. A few years ago,      a member of our New Jersey support group attempted to commit      suicide. She is also a bright woman and was a graduate      student at Rutgers University when dystonia struck.        Another member of our support group was the Facilities      Administrator at a major Philadelphia hospital before he      developed dystonia. His neck is involuntarily pulled to the      side. He's unable to straighten it. He tried to continue      working, but the constant pain made him retire.        A member of our New Jersey support group has been a      teacher for many years. She loves the career and wants to      continue teaching, but says that her school district is      trying to force her to resign. A second grade teacher who's a      member of our Philadelphia group is still working, but      sometimes needs assistance. So far, her colleagues have been      able to help her hide the problems.        A New Jersey Special Ed teacher is an ``expert'' on the      accommodations that people with disabilities need. She's      angry because her school makes accommodations for her      students, but has refused to do so for her. She asked for a      chair and a program that would enable her to dictate because      she has difficulty writing.        Dystonia has impacted or ended the careers of many other      friends and support group members. The bass member of a      singing group can no longer sing. A travel agent can no      longer drive and has difficulty speaking to clients. An      attorney has similar problems. A guitarist friend, who was a      Grammy winner, lost the ability to finger the strings. A      French Horn player's lips stopped working properly.        A half year ago, a story about a Midwest woman in her      thirties received a lot of Internet and media attention. Her      story was featured on national news programs and she was      interviewed on the Today show. The woman had been diagnosed      with CP, was treated unsuccessfully for that disease for over      thirty years and led a very disabled life. After living as a      CP patient for over three decades, she finally received the      correct diagnosis: dystonia. Her story is even more      frustrating. The woman is one of a minute percentage of      dystonia patients who have dopa responsive dystonia. The      symptoms that those people have can be controlled by      medication. After thirty years, the woman is now leading an      almost ``normal'' life.        Misdiagnosis is common. Many patients are told that their      symptoms are psychosomatic.        A third of the hundreds of thousands of dystonia patients      in this country are children. An eight and a half year old      girl from New Jersey and a fifteen year old young woman from      Connecticut were both diagnosed with CP. Both had unnecessary      and very painful surgeries that cut their leg tendons in an      attempt to straighten their feet. Both actually have      dystonia. A foot turning in is often a first symptom. It      wasn't recognized by their pediatricians or by their      orthopedists.        When we started our New Jersey support group, it took our      daughter and many of the original members over ten years to      be diagnosed correctly. Research conducted by the NIH has      shortened that time for many patients. It has also improved      the types and number of treatments that are available.      However, as our presentations have illustrated, there's much      more to learn and it's important to continue funding the      research.        Please help us.        Thank you.                          ____________________
