President, the President has nominated three extraordinarily well-qualified Americans--appellate lawyer Patricia Millett, Georgetown Law professor Nina Pillard and DC District Judge Robert Wilkins--to serve on the DC Circuit, the second most important court in the Nation. The DC Circuit currently has 8 active judges out of 11 authorized judgeships.  These nominees should be given an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor.  Patricia Millett is the first nominee up for consideration. Ms. Millett, who is currently in private practice, is recognized as one of the leading appellate lawyers in the country.  She has argued 32 cases before the Supreme Court and dozens more in other appellate courts.  Ms. Millett served in the Solicitor General's office under both Democratic and Republican presidents. Seven former Solicitors General--including prominent Republicans Paul Clement, Ted Olson and Ken Starr--sent a letter in support of Ms. Millett saying she ``has a brilliant mind, a gift for clear, persuasive writing, and a genuine zeal for the rule of law. Equally important, she is unfailingly fair-minded.''  At her hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, no Senator questioned Ms. Millett's qualifications or fitness for the Federal bench. She is simply an outstanding nominee.  Let me tell you why I have a personal interest in her nomination.  Ms. Millett is also a proud daughter of Illinois. She grew up in Marine, a small town in the southern part of the State that I know well. Her mother was a nurse and her father was a history professor at Southern Illinois University--Edwardsville, one of my favorite campuses.  Ms. Millett graduated summa cum laude from the University of Illinois and magna cum laude from Harvard Law School. She clerked for two years for Judge Thomas Tang on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  She is part of a military family. Her husband, Robert King, served in the Navy and was deployed as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom.  Ms. Millett also comes highly recommended by distinguished members of the Illinois legal community.  I received a letter from Patrick Fitzgerald, the former U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, expressing ``strong support'' for Ms. Millett's nomination and urging ``prompt consideration of her candidacy on the merits.''  I also received a letter from 28 prominent attorneys including former Illinois Governor James Thompson, a Republican, and current Illinois State Bar Association president Paula Holderman.  They expressed their strong support for Ms. Millett, saying that: she embodies the evenhandedness, impartiality, and objectivity required for the Federal judiciary, as evidenced by her more than 10 years of service in the Solicitor General's office in both the Clinton and Bush administrations.  The bottom line is that Ms. Millett is an outstanding nominee with broad support from across the ideological spectrum. There is no question that she is well-qualified to serve on the bench, and she will serve with distinction.  I urge my colleagues to give her a chance with an up-or-down vote. She does not deserve to have her nomination filibustered. If there is anyone who can step forward and question this nominee's qualifications, they should do so. They have not to date.  Some of my Republican colleagues have accused the President of trying to ``pack'' the DC Circuit by making nominations to fill the outstanding vacancies in that court. This argument is simply not credible. Filling vacancies for existing judgeships is not court packing. These judgeships are authorized by law, and it is incumbent upon the President to nominate qualified candidates to fill them.  Others across the aisle have argued that the DC Circuit does not have a high enough caseload--there are just not enough cases--to justify a full complement of 11 judges. I note that these same Republican Senators did not make that argument in 2005 when the Senate confirmed Janice Rogers Brown and Thomas Griffith to the 10th and 11th judgeships on the DC Circuit. When the Senate confirmed the 10th and 11th judgeships in the DC Circuit in 2005, they were the choices of the Republican side of the aisle, even though these confirmations, which we approved, reduced the Court's workload to fewer cases per active judge than what we would see if President Obama's nominees were confirmed.  On April 5, the Judicial Conference of the United States, which is led by Chief Justice John Roberts, made its Federal judgeship recommendations for the 113th Congress. The Judicial Conference is nonpartisan, and according to its letter, its recommendations ``reflect the judgeship needs of the Federal judiciary.'' The Judicial Conference did not recommend stripping any judgeships from the DC Circuit. So this argument on the other side of the aisle finds no support in the non-partisan Judicial Conference's recommendations.  My Republican colleagues like to argue about workload statistics when it comes to the DC Circuit, but according to the Washington Post fact checker Glenn Kessler, who I have come toknow, ``The voluminous and detailed statistics on the appeals courts allows each side to pick and choose the stats that support their position.''  Republicans may claim the DC Circuit's workload is too light, but in the Washington Post Mr. Kessler points out that by some metrics, the DC Circuit ``could be very well in first place'' when it comes to workload.  I also note that one of my Republican colleagues came to the floor today and explained his opposition to Ms. Millett's nomination. In doing so he cited a letter that the Senate Judiciary Committee Democrats sent in 2006 seeking a hearing postponement on Peter Keisler, who was nominated to fill the 11th seat on the DC Circuit. I would like to point out that this letter dealt with filling the 11th seat on the DC Circuit. Ms. Millett is seeking the 9th seat. I also wish to point out that the Senate had already voted to confirm a nominee to be the 11th judge on the DC Circuit, Thomas Griffith, just 1 year before this 2006 letter. I voted for Mr. Griffith on the floor.  The bottom line is that these judicial vacancies currently exist, it is the President's job to nominate qualified men and women to fill them, and there is no question that the President's nominee for this position, Patricia Millett, is one of the most well-qualified persons he could have found to fill this important position. No one comes forward to criticize her background and her resume because, frankly, it is hard to find a nominee with any stronger credentials for the Federal bench.  Let's not play political games with this important nomination, nor with people such as Patricia Millett, who have put their names forward, have gone through this process, and have waited for us politicians to work our will on the floor. She deserves an up-or-down vote.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from Illinois lawyers supporting Patricia Millett for the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit as well as the letter, dated October 24, from former U.S. attorney for the Northern District Patrick Fitzgerald of Chicago.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        Patrick J. Fitzgerald,                                    Chicago, IL, October 24, 2013.     Re Patricia Millett.     Hon. Dick Durbin,     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mark Kirk,     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Durbin and Kirk: I write in strong support of      the President's nomination of Patricia Millett to the United      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and      urge the Senate to promptly confirm her to this position.       I support the nomination of Patricia Millett because I      believe our system of justice will be positively impacted      with her as a member of our judiciary. Her career      accomplishments as a lawyer are extraordinary. Over the past      20 years, Patricia has argued 32 cases before the United      States Supreme Court and even more in the federal appeals      courts, including the D.C. Circuit. Her cases have spanned      the spectrum of legal issues that the D.C. Circuit confronts,      including constitutional law, administrative law, civil and      criminal procedure, commercial disputes, national security,      and civil rights. Importantly, she has represented parties on      both sides of those many issues, handling cases for the      government at every level (federal, state, and local),      private individuals, businesses, employers, employees, civil      rights plaintiffs, prosecutors and criminal defendants.      Patricia is a lawyer's lawyer who is committed to the rule of      law and stare decisis. She embodies the evenhandedness,      impartiality and objectivity required for the federal      judiciary, as evidenced by her more than 10 years of service      in the Solicitor General's office in both the Clinton and      Bush Administrations.       Patricia grew up downstate in the small farm town of      Marine. Her father was a history professor at Southern      Illinois University--Edwardsville and her mother was a      registered nurse and hospice practitioner. Patricia graduated      summa cum laude from the Univeristy of Illinois with Highest      Distriction in political science, before going on to the      Harvard Law School. The country would be well served to have      someone with her tremendous qualifications--and deep ties to      our state--hold such an important judicial appointment.       I would urge a prompt consideration of her candidacy on the      merits.           Sincerely,     Patrick J. Fitzgerald.                                  ____  Illinois Lawyers Supporting Patricia Millett for the United States                  Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit                                               September 27, 2013.     Hon. Dick Durbin,     U.S. Senate Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mark Kirk,     U.S. Senate Hart Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Durbin and Kirk: We write in strong support      of the President's nomination of Patricia Millett to the      United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia,      and urge the Senate to promptly confirm her to this position.      As lawyers here in Illinois, we care deeply about the rule of      law and the quality of our system of justice. We strongly      believe that stellar nominees with broad bipartisan support,      like Patricia, should be quickly confirmed to ensure our      justice system works effectively and efficiently. We feel      even more strongly about that knowing that Patricia is an      lllinois native.       We support the nomination of Patricia Millett because we      believe our system of justice will be positively impacted      with her as a member of our judiciary. Her career      accomplishments as a lawyer are extraordinary.

We would be extremely proud to have someone with      tremendous qualifications--and deep ties to our state--hold      such an important judicial appointment.       We believe it is critically important that the country rise      above partisan politics when it comes to judicial      appointments. Such unwarranted politicization can become a      threat to the citizens' trust in the integrity of our great      judicial process. We, and the citizens of Illinois, are      counting on you and the U.S. Senate to do the right thing by      putting aside partisan politics and supporting Patricia's      nomination.
