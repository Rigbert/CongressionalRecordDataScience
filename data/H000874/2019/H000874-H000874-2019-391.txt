Chairman, my fellow colleagues, I rise with great sadness to announce the passing of one of this House's great and good Members, former Representative John David Dingell, Jr., who served in this House for almost a full six decades. His father preceded him for 22 years, and his wife, our beloved colleague, Debbie Dingell, serves now.  At the request of his beloved wife, I have the sad task of informing the House that John died yesterday after a long, distinguished, and committed career of service to community, to this House, and to his country.  John served with honor in wartime and with distinction in this House. He worked for the advancement of his fellow veterans and their care and benefits in peacetime, and he fought all of his life for fairness and opportunity for all. He defended vigorously the working men and women of the auto industry and working families everywhere.  His wit, his humor brought smiles to our faces, and his fearless questions of witnesses in committee brought grimaces to those who believed they had undermined the safety and health of our citizens.  Much will be said. I know that each of you have your own memory of Chairman Dingell. I know that each of you will want to rise at some point in time over the next number of days to give your observations of this colleague with whom we were honored to serve.  Let us begin our remembrances of him, however, by celebrating the love that he had for this great institution about which he cared so deeply. He believed its powers to be: improving people's lives and delivering on the promises of those who came before us and to those who will come after us.  May John's legacy guide us forward as we seek to make this House all he believed it could be and all he did to make it so better than it might have been.  I now yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), the distinguished Speaker of the House of Representatives.
