 I am pleased to hear that homeless children will be able to receive services while their families are taking actions to comply with immunization and other health and safety requirements.  Regarding enrollment while other required documentation is obtained, the bill language requires that States use procedures to ensure such enrollment occurs after an initial eligibility determination is made. Yet, eligibility documentation is among the required documentation homeless families must produce. However, we know that homeless families struggle to produce documents, due to their poverty and mobility. Can Senator Mikulski, please clarify the intent of the phrase ``after an initial eligibility determination?''
