  And yet, 2.8 billion people on this planet live in abject poverty--getting by on $2 a day or less. That's less than a cappuccino at Starbucks. Close to 1 billion people are undernourished; 1.2 billion lack access to even safe drinking water; and 2.5 million do not have access to adequate sanitation.  In the wake of September 11, I introduced a resolution to triple our foreign aid budget over the next 5 years, a resolution which was passed by the Senate just this week.  So I was pleased when president Bush committed to increasing the United States foreign aid by an additional $10 billion over 4 years, beginning in 2004. The President is to be commended for this initiative.  But although this additional funding represents a significant increase in foreign aid it is still well short of historic levels, and well short of the level I believe is needed to engage and win the war against terrorism.  In 1946, the United States devoted 3 percent of its Federal budget to foreign assistance--a high water mark which was reached again under the Kennedy administration.  But since then, spending has gone downhill. According to a Congressional Budget Office report entitled ``The Role of Foreign Aid in Development,'' United States spending on foreign assistance has fluctuated from year-to-year but has been on a downward path since the 1960's. A tripling of our foreign aid budget--a level that I consider to be appropriate and which the Senate is now on record as supporting--would simply bring it back in line with historic levels.  If the United States is to be successful in the war on terrorism--if we are to be successful in helping to spread democracy and free-markets around theglobe--we must be willing to step up and bear the burden of leadership.  Even looking beyond the humanitarian rationale--which I believe is sufficient reason alone for action--the United States will never be secure in a world in which: Sub-Saharan Africa is ravaged by the AIDS pandemic; more than half the people of the world go to bed hungry every night; civil wars are a constant; and where failed or failing states, unable to meet the needs of their peoples, and allow terrorists and terrorism to thrive.  Reducing poverty, promoting equitable economic growth, and developing democratic institutions advances United States national security interests. The failure to address these issues through a significant increase in foreign assistance spending, and the resulting risk of social, economic, and political instability and violence, places United States national security interests and the welfare and safety of United States citizens at risk.  I look forward to working with my colleagues in the days and years ahead to address this important issue, and to assure that U.S. foreign assistance spending levels are appropriate to the challenges that our nation faces and our leadership position in the international community.  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague. Our foreign assistance is absolutely critical for people in war-ravaged, politically unstable, impoverished nations. The children, the elderly, and the civilian people are not responsible for the political and economic turmoil in their homelands, but they are the ones who always end up suffering the most. I look forward to working with you to continue to help these folks around the world. We have a moral obligation to stay committed to these people.                             litening pods
