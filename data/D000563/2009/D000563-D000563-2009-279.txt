I am going to proceed to speak in the same manner and yield to the Senator from Vermont. Our time will be less than that in total.  I see the Senator from Louisiana is here. We are going to be speaking less than 42 minutes. We guarantee him that much. We will follow the same process, if there is no objection, that was just followed with three Republican speakers who spoke in that 42-minute period of time.  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Sanders be recognized after me to speak and that our total time be no more than 42 minutes.
