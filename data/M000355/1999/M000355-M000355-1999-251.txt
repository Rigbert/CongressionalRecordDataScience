 President, we are down to a precious few.  What we are considering doing is propounding an agreement, and I am going to go on and propound it even though I know there may be some objection, but to give a sense of what the roadmap here is to completion. We believe we are down to the amendment we have been discussing all day, the Brownback amendment, as second-degreed by myself and Senator Abraham regarding section 907, and the amendment we are in the process of debating, the Leahy-Dodd amendment with regard to travel restrictions to Cuba. And final passage. That is where I believe we are at this moment--with the need to wrap up the debate on the Dodd-Leahy amendment, the need to give Senator Kerry an opportunity to speak on the 907 issue and Senator Torricelli an opportunity to speak to the 907 issue.
