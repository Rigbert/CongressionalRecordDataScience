 I will just take 2 minutes here.  One, I want to make it clear, when I was making a case to my friends from Virginia and New York about the comparison of Turkey and Poland, it did not relate to whether there was merit in defending Turkey. There is. Not only merit, there is an obligation. I was making the larger point which goes to the serious issue the Senator from Virginia has raised honestly--and the only one who has done it forthrightly so far--and that is, is there a consensus in America to defend any European country?  Whatever commitment we make, we must keep. And he is right in raising the issue: Are the American people--do you all understand, all America, that if we expand, we are committing our sacred honor to defend Poland as we have Germany, to defend the Czech Republic as we have England, to defend the country of Hungary as we have Denmark? Are we prepared to do that? That should be discussed, and it should be discussed forthrightly. And I thank him for raising that issue.  There is much more to say, but I will have plenty of chance to say it, so I yield to my friend from Connecticut.
