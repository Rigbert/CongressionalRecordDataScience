 If he were to use ground forces. But I acknowledge there is a constitutional argument that says that if the Congress had voted and the House did not, but if they had voted, as we had, for the use of air power, that he would not need that additional authority.  I do think there is a constitutional requirement for the Congress to assent to this action. I understand I am in the minority. Beyond that, I think there is a political necessity that we be united.  My friend and I have talked about this privately before. We can all disagree about the lessons from Vietnam, but I think we both agree that one of the lessons out of Vietnam was that no matter how smart, no matter how brilliant a foreign policy is, it cannot be sustained without the informed consent of the American people and their elected representatives being signed on to it.  That is my primary motivation. The place my friend from Arizona and I disagree is, I am not doing this to embolden the President to do the right thing. The reason I signed on to it is to make sure the Congress goes on record saying that we will back whatever action the President takes to meet the four goals that he has stated. There is legitimate constitutional disagreement, but I fall down on the side that I think it is necessary.
