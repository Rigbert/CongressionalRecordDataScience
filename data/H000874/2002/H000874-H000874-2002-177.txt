 Mr. Speaker, our conservative friends must have checked their compassion at the door when they put this bill together.  Make no mistake, government assistance is not a free meal. If you receive assistance, in my opinion, you have the responsibility to work, if you can. Work builds self-esteem, increases independence and strengthens our families, our communities and our society. That is why, Mr. Speaker, I strongly supported bipartisan welfare reform in 1996.  But this Republican bill is a step backwards. It sets up unrealistic requirements, it fails to provide necessary funding and it imposes an $11 billion unfunded mandate on the States.  This bill would double the number of required worker hours for mothers with children under 6. However, it would flat-fund assistance for child care even though 15 million eligible children today go uncovered. It is nice to talk about opportunity, but if you do not have the necessary child care, you will not be able to avail yourself of those opportunities.  This bill, in my opinion, discriminates as well against legal immigrants, prohibiting States from using Federal funds to assist them, not giving them the choice, the option, in Federalism.  It even would eliminate education from the list of activities that count toward work requirements, and it would flat fund temporary assistance to needy families. I ask my Republican friends, where is the compassion in that? You voted a few months ago to give Enron $250 million in corporate welfare and a handful of major corporations billions of dollars more, and now, now you want to crack down on a single mom who is trying her best to work and still take care of her kids.  That is not common sense. It is not compassionate. It is not even conservative. It is, however, shortsighted and punitive, and, therefore, may well be consistent.  I urge my colleagues to vote for the substitute and against the underlying bill.
