 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Virginia, as a former Governor, for adding his unique perspective on that. I say unique; there are other Governors who have had similar experiences, but I think that does help us understand what I hope will be the conclusion on this amendment. I know it is well intentioned, but it seems to me it should be defeated. I thank the Senator from Virginia for his support and contribution to this debate.
