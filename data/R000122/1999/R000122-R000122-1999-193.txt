President, it is my pleasure to inform my colleagues that the U.S. Military Academy Class of 1958 is naming the debate room at Lincoln Hall, West Point, NY, in honor of their classmate, 2d Lt. George W.P. Walker.  George Walker was an outstanding soldier, scholar and leader. He graduated from the U.S. Military Academy No. 1 in his class. George Walker received many prestigious awards for his educational and military prowess. He was admired and respected by his classmates as a man of honor and a true friend. Tragically, 2d Lt. Walker died in an airplane accident in 1959 while he was en route to Oakland, CA, for an overseas assignment.  I wish to recognize the remarkable life of 2d Lt. George W.P. Walker by printing in the Record the February 2, 1959, remarks of Congressman Francis Dorn who appointed 2d Lt. Walker to the U.S. Military Academy. I ask that Congressman Dorn's remarks be printed in the Record.  The remarks follow.                       2d Lt. George W.P. Walker
