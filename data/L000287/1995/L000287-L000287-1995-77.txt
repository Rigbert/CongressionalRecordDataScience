Well, let me just say to my friend and colleague from Georgia, I will never forget some 30 years ago in the little town of Selma, AL, in the heart of the black belt in Dallas County in 1965. Only 2.1 percent of blacks of voting age were registered to vote. They had to take a so-called literacy test. People were afraid. There were black men and women teaching in the local college, black doctors and lawyers, but they flunked the so-called literacy test. They could only go down to attempt to register on the first and third Mondays of each month.  On the third Monday in January 1965, it was my day to lead a group of people down to the Dallas County Courthouse. To be exact, it was January 18, and we walked up to the steps of the courthouse, and there was a sheriff named Jim Clark. He wore a gun on one side, a night stick on the other, and he carried an electric cattle prod in his hand, and he did not use it on cows, he used it on people, and he said to me, ``John Lewis, you're not some agitator. You're the lowest form of humanity.''  At that time I was almost 25, and I had all of my hair. I was a few pounds lighter, but I looked him straight in the eye, and I said, ``Sheriff, I may be an agitator, but I'm not an outsider. I grew up 90 miles from here, and we're going to stay here until these people are allowed to register and vote.''  And he said, ``John, you're under arrest,'' and he arrested me along with many other people.  A few days later in a little town near Selma a young black man by the name of Jimmy Lee Jackson was leading the march for the right to vote. He was shot in the stomach by a state trooper, and a few days later he died. In the course of what happened to him we said that we were marching from Selma to Montgomery to dramatize to the Nation and to the world that people wanted the right to participate in the democratic process. And on March 7 we decided to march in twos, leaving downtown Selma, walking through the streets of Selma, about 525 of us, elderly men and women and a few young children.  We came to the apex of the bridge. We saw a sea of blue. It was the Alabama State troopers. We continued to walk until we came within hearing distance of the State troopers, and a man identified himself and said, ``I'm Major John Cloud of the Alabama State troopers. I give you 3 minutes to disperse and go back to your church.''  In less than 1\1/2\ minutes he said, ``Troopers, advance,'' and they came toward us, beating us with night sticks and bull whips, trampling us with horses and using tear gas.  This became known as bloody Sunday, and because of what happened in Selma, President Johnson came to this hall, and spoke to a joint session of Congress, and introduced the Voting Rights Act, and it was passed, and since then I must say, my colleague, we have seen hundreds and thousands and millions of new registered voters because this Congress had the courage to pass the Voting Rights Act in 1965, and Motor Voter is another step down that long road toward opening up the political process and letting all of the people come in.  Ms. McKINNEY. You know you said something about accountability, and the fact that we enlarge the voting pool also indicates that we would enlarge the attentive public; that is, the public that is paying attention to what we do with the laws that we pass and the impact that what we do here has on those peoples' lives. I cannot help but believe that there is a group of people, and I am sure they are a small group of people, who want to escape accountability for the things that they do, and therefore they introduced legislation to repeal Motor Voter, or they try to call it an unfunded mandate in an effort to escape the accountability that the American people would bring on them for the kinds of policies that we are seeing put into play now.                              {time}  2015  Also, I have to say that it has never been so easy, particularly in the South, in Georgia, to register people, as it is today, and that is because of motor voter. We have a simple little form.  I remember in 1992, we had Jesse Jackson come down to the 11th district to do some voter registration for us because we knew we needed that. We found all kinds of voting registration barriers. And in one little small town, Milledgeville, I know you know Milledgeville, GA, we had to stage a protest march, because for some reason it was inconvenient for the folks down at the courthouse to register a lot of people in the town, who happened to be African-American and who happened to be students in the town.  So we have got these impediments that have been removed. And now it is so easy, all people have to do is want to be registered and they can register. And it sure makes it a whole lot easier for those of us who want them to be registered.  I think this new move on the part of this small group of people is perhaps, well, we know it is wrong-headed and ill-founded, but it takes us in the wrong direction. It takes us backwards, and we do not need to be going back. We need to be going forward. Our democracy is stronger when the American people feel that they have an investment in their Government. Right now the American people do not feel that they have an investment, and a lot of people sit on the sidelines at election time because it is so darn hard to go out there and register to vote. We, of course, as you know, have the purges that go on.  Motor voter cures all of that. You can register to vote at midnight in your home if you want to, and that is the beautiful thing about motor voter.  So I just think this move that is afoot is wrong-headed and ill-founded, [[Page H5566]] but there are 170 cosponsors on the repeal bill, so it is a threat that is imminent. And that is why I am so happy that the gentleman is alerting the rest of us here to the importance of motor voter, and at the same time the American viewing public that is interested and is looking at C-SPAN right now, to let them know that motor voter is good and motor voter is not safe.
