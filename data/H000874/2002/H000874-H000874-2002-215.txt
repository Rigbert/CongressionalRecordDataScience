Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Davis), the distinguished ranking member of this subcommittee, I am pleased to join my colleague, the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Jo Ann Davis), in the consideration of H.R. 3789, which names, as she has pointed out, a postal facility after Congressman Roncalio.  I am sure that the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin) will speak of Mr. Roncalio. It is interesting that the gentlewoman and Congressman Roncalio were of different parties, but represent a State that has a distinction of having a representative who really is like a United States Senator, in that they are elected statewide.  Mr. Roncalio was an outstanding member of this House, ran for the United States Senate unsuccessfully, but the people of Wyoming did not want to lose his service and reelected him for another three terms to the House of Representatives.  So we on this side of the aisle are very pleased to join the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Cubin) and the subcommittee and full committee in supporting this appropriate recognition of his service to Wyoming and his service to the country.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
