 President, I rise in support of S. 1, the Safe and Affordable Schools Act. I am pleased Senator Coverdell has introduced this important legislation which will provide our children with an affordable, quality education. By making this bill the first bill of the 105th Congress, it demonstrates to the American people the importance this Senate has placed on the education of our children.  I would like to comment on a very important provision contained in this bill which will make higher education more affordable. For the past several years, I have worked to allow the earnings invested in State-sponsored tuition savings accounts to grow tax-free when used for higher education expenses. This bill also will cover room and board cost. These changes will help families offset the rising cost of education by rewarding those who save.  For the past several years, I have worked to eliminate the tax on education savings. In 1994, I first introduced S. 1787, to make a family's investment earnings tax-free when invested in a State tuition savings plan. Again, in the 104th Congress, I introduced a similar bill, S. 386. Both bills were endorsed by the National Association of State Treasurers and their College Savings Plan Network, which represents the individual State programs.  On July 9, 1996, Congress passed many of the reforms proposed in S. 386, as part of the Small Business Tax Relief Act of 1996. This legislation was signed into law by the President on August 20, 1996.  While we made important gains last year, we need to finish what we started and fully exempt investment income from taxation. This legislation does that. It also expands the definition of qualified education expense to include room and board. Such costs make up nearly 50 percent of annual college expenses.  The facts are clear; education costs are outpacing wage growth and have created a barrier for students wanting to attend college. According to the General Accounting Office, tuition costs at a 4-year public university rose 234 percent between 1980-94. During this same period, median household income rose only 84 percent. It is no wonder fewer families can afford to send their children to college without financial assistance.  As tuition costs continue to increase, so does the need for assistance. In 1990, over 56 percent of all students accepted some form of financial assistance.  Today, it is increasingly common for students to study now, and pay later. In fact, more students than ever are forced to bear additional loan costs in order to receive an education. In 1994, Federal education loan volume rose by 57 percent from the previous year. On top of that, students have increased the size of their loan burden by an average of 28 percent.  So, not only are more students taking out more loans, they are taking out bigger loans as well. This year, nearly half of college graduates hit the pavement with their diplomas in one hand and a stack of loan repayment books in the other.  I believe we need to reverse this trend by boosting savings and helping families meet the education needs of their children before they enter college. If we continue to ignore this problem, more and more children will be forced to burden themselves with an increasing debt load when they go in search of their first job. This can be avoided with passage of S. 1.  Mr. President, in an effort to build on the accomplishments of last year, I look forward to working with Senator Coverdell, the sponsor of this legislation, and the Senate Labor and Finance Committees to help families meet the rising cost of higher education.                          ____________________
