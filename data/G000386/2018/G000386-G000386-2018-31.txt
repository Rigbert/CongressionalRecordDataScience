 President, I would like to pay tribute to an Iowan whose stewardship at a leading television news station in Des Moines, IA, has strengthened the principles of good government, transparency and the public's right to know.  As a member of the broadcast press corps for four decades, Dave Busiek understands that freedom of the press is fundamental to liberty in this country. I often say that journalists serve an important role in our system of checks and balances, which preserves liberty. They are integral to keeping an engaged and infoimed citizenry. They report corruption, weed out wrongdoing, and hold government accountable to the American people.  Throughout my public service and political life, I hold myself accountable to Iowans by making myself accessible to members of the media. I hold regular news conferences and answer their questions in the hallways of the U.S. Capitol and after my county meetings at home in Iowa.  It is a commitment I have kept since my first campaign for the U.S. Senate back in 1980. And that happens to be the year my political path crossed with Dave Busiek. In fact, for as long as I have served Iowans in the U.S. Senate, Dave Busiek has served the people of Iowa in broadcast journalism: as a reporter, anchor, and news director atKCCI-TV in Des Moines, where he started in 1979 after working for 3 years at WHO Radio.  Dave has led coverage of breaking news events, natural disasters, government and politics, and human interest stories that keep Iowans informed. When there has been a story to tell and information that matters to Iowans, Dave has led the coverage over the span of four decades. Twenty-nine years ago, he covered the United Flight 232 plane crash in Sioux City. He made sure Iowans knew what they needed to know during the historic floods of 1993 and during the tornadoes in Marshalltown, Pella, and surrounding communities this past summer. With fairness, accuracy and objectivity, Dave has led a team of journalists to report the news that affects the lives of Iowans, including decades of coverage of one my favorite places in Iowa: The Iowa State Fair.  Of course, Iowa is considered ground zero for the presidential campaign trail and all things politics. Dave's political coverage extends to six Iowa Governors and dates back to George H.W. Bush beating Ronald Reagan in the 1980 caucuses. As I mentioned earlier, he covered my first Senate campaign in 1980 and 35 years later, partnered with CBS News and the Des Moines Register to cosponsor the Democratic Debate for President at Drake University.  His 29-year tenure as news director at KCCI helped the station win countless awards for journalistic excellence. In 2002, he was elected chair of the Radio-Television News-Directors Association and was named News Director of the Year in 2014 by Broadcasting and Cable Magazine. He was inducted this summer into the Iowa Broadcasters Association Hall of Fame. He understands that good content is integral to survival from an economic standpoint and obviously, good content matters to good government and quality journalism. He pursued KCCI's expansion into social media where the news station provides weather and breaking news coverage across all digital platforms to its consumers. Whether on-air or online, Dave has worked to stay on top of the news, day after day, for four decades.  Dave Busiek is not a native Iowan, but we sure are glad he has called Iowa home since graduating from the Missouri School of Journalism. Remarkably, he is only the third news director at KCCI since it first aired in 1955. From viewers to voters, I know that Iowans carry a high bar of expectations. Dave earned his rise through the ranks and certainly has raised the bar even higher for his peers in the profession.  I would like to thank Dave Busiek for his service, professionalism and integrity in broadcast journalis also like to thank him for his testimony at a congressional hearing I led back in 2000. He testified in support of my bipartisan legislation to allow cameras in Federal courtrooms. The Supreme Court has affirmed that the public has a right to know what happens in our courts. Dave and I agree that the media can serve as an important surrogate to allow the court of public opinion to bear witness to the court of law through the unfiltered lens of a camera. Specifically, audio/visual streaming and broadcasting of the Federal courts would enhance better appreciation and understanding of the Federal judiciary, a coequal branch of the Federal Governnent. That was 18 years ago. And I am not giving up on getting this bill signed into law. They say slow and steady wins the race. The people of Iowa graciously put me on this fence post and I am committed to fighting the fight as long as I am serving in the U.S. Senate.  I congratulate Dave Busiek on a remarkable career. His legacy will continue to shine long after he signs off as news director through the lens of countless journalists he has trained and mentored along the way.                          ____________________
