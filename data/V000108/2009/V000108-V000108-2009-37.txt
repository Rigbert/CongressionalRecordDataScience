Before her detail with the Committee, Ms. Minto served the United States Army Corps of Engineers as Legal Clerk and Assistant District Counsel at the Corps' Louisville Office of Counsel for over six years. There, she supported the implementation and regulation of Corps projects funded through the appropriations process. Reviewing legislative language, responding to Congressional requests, and evaluating policy compliance, Ms. Minto developed a strong understanding of the relationship between Congressional legislation and on-site execution as well as a unique level of legal expertise required to facilitate the process.  It is no surprise, therefore, that Ms. Minto quickly became an invaluable member of the Committee staff when she joined the team in February 2008. Her in-depth knowledge of the legal implications of bill language and policy compliance, as well as her technical experience with the Corps' civil works projects, made her an indispensible addition to the staff. A remarkably fast learner and tireless worker, Ms. Minto quickly mastered the responsibilities assigned to her. Her refined analytical skills and exceptional attention to detail have been critical to our success in reviewing requests, synthesizing disparate information, and, ultimately, producing the bills and reports for the fiscal year 2009 and American Reinvestment and Recovery Act.  Perhaps her most noteworthy contribution, however, has been to the development of the Energy and Water Subcommittee's Member Request Database. A relatively new system, the database is meant to facilitate the review and processing of requests made to the Subcommittee. Ms. Minto had the unfortunate experience of being one of the first to deal with the system. In her typically tireless way, she not only overcame any of the unforeseen obstacles, but took an active role in updating and reforming the database. Working closely with our IT department, Ms. Minto made targeted suggestions to perfect the system and, because of her work, our jobs, and those of future staff members will be easier. Indeed, Members' offices have expressed their appreciation for the standardized system of authorized projects that are now generated automatically. Ms. Minto's efforts have lead to more reliable, accurate requests and more transparency. This has enabled Members to focus more on the policy behind the earmarks and less on the technical aspects of entering requests.  For these innovations, and for her overall diligence, ingenuity, and consistently positive attitude over the past year, all of us at the Energy and Water Subcommittee would like to thank her. She will be sorely missed. We wish her all the best in her future endeavors, and are confident that she will go on to do great things.                          ____________________
