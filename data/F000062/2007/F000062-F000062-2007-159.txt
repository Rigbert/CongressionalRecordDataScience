 President, I wish to honor one of the Senate's own, a man who went above and beyond the call of duty to save another's life.  Frederick ``Tim'' McClintock has been a fixture in the Senate for over 30 years. He is a skilled carpenter and a familiar face in the Senate.  He has come to my office on numerous occasions to perform various tasks. He does his job well and is always ready with a smile and a kind word.  Yet, on Friday, July 6, 2007, Tim McClintock was confronted with a terrible scene, well outside the routine of the Senate.  As he headed home at the end of the day, he noticed a man laying face down in the reflecting pool in Lower Senate Park. Without hesitation, Tim McClintock came to his aid. He turned the man over and performed CPR until he was resuscitated. Then with the assistance of a Capitol Police officer, he pulled the man out of the water.  That afternoon, Tim McClintock selflessly and courageously saved a man from drowning.  He would deny that he is a hero.  He was quoted in Roll Call newspaper as saying, ``A hero is someone who risks their own well-being or life. The worst that was going to happen to me is that my feet would get wet.''  His modesty is astounding.  The fact is that acts of compassion and bravery such as these display the true character of a man.  On that day, Tim McClintock demonstrated quick thinking, resourcefulness, bravery, and, above all, compassion and humanity for a stranger. The brave actions that Friday afternoon, as many others rushed home eager to start the weekend, were the actions of a true hero.  So, on behalf of the Senate, I commend the heroism of Frederick ``Tim'' McClintock, who on July 6, 2007, demonstrated the principles of kindness, bravery, and compassion that we value so much.                          ____________________
