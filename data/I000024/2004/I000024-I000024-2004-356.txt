 Section 1618 is in regard to the air quality monitoring data influenced by exceptional events.  This bill directs EPA to promulgate regulations governing the handling of air quality-monitoring data influenced by exceptional events, such as forest fires or volcanic eruptions, certainly something of great interest to the Senator from Arizona. These types of natural activities should not influence whether a region is meeting its Federal air quality goals.  The EPA is also required to reevaluate its approach to modeling carbon monoxide emissions from motor vehicles to ensure that it is appropriate for cold-weather States, such as Alaska.                          ____________________
