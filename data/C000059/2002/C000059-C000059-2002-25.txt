Speaker, my congressional district in Riverside, California is extremely fortunate to have a dynamic and dedicated group of community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give of their time and talents to ensure the well-being of our cities and county. These individuals work tirelessly to develop voluntary community action to improve the region's economy, its education, its environment and its overall quality of life. One individual, who is a member of this group, is Richard Gonzales. He has been active in so many community groups and activities that it is hard to imagine how he found the time to become a career law enforcement officer with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), as the Chief of Police for the City of Coronoa, a husband and a father of two.  On the 9th of March, Mr. Gaonzales will be honored with the Ira. D. ``Cal'' Calvert Distinguished Service Award by the Corona-Norco Family YMCA. The award is given in memory of my father, ``Cal'' Calvert, and his innumerable philanthropic gifts to the community and his efforts to encourage others to serve their community in a similar fashion. The award recognizes Mr. Gonzales for his exceptional devotion to developing community volunteerism.  Richard's career with the LAPD lasted for an impressive 26 years where he commanded many divisions. During those years, he served as a police officer, detective, sergeant, lieutenant and captain. After retiring from LAPD, Richard was named the police chief of Corona in 1998. Richard holds a Master of Arts in Public Administration and a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice, both from California State University, Long Beach. He is a graduate of the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Virginia and holds a POST certificate for Command Development. He is also an adjunct professor at Golden West College, where he teaches a POST Discipline course at the Criminal Justice Training Center.  With all of these career and family commitments, Richard's unselfish giving of time and energy to volunteering is all the more impressive and serves as a model to his community, neighbors and own children. His strong commitment to the Inland Empire is displayed in his participation in the Corona Police Community Partnership, Coalition for Family Preservation, Corona Rotary, as a board member for UNITY which deals with community youth sports and the Coronoa-Norco YMCA. Chief Gonzales has actively instituted partnerships with our local school district, ministerial groups and other services in keeping our community safe and raising the quality of life in Corona.  Mr. Speaker, I take this opportunity to thank Richard Gonzales for his dedication, influence and involvement in our community. I know that we will continue to benefit from his longtime experience in the 43rd congressional district and deep commitment to the region. It is a great pleasure for me to congratulate Richard on his outstanding career with the LAPD and his lifelong devotion to the community.                          ____________________
