 This amendment in turn sets up a deficit-neutral reserve fund that will allow the Finance Committee to reform corporate and individual taxes in a revenue-neutral way.  The President got his $612 billion tax increase January 1. We should not raise taxes another $1 trillion with unemployment at 7.7 percent. We should not close loopholes for more spending. We won't grow the economy by raising taxes by $1 trillion as the majority wants to do. We will grow the economy with more efficient progrowth tax reform.  My amendment is progrowth, pro-small business, and pro-jobs. The Democrats' budget taxes the middle class to spend more. It is balanced and fair because they have finally come to the conclusion they cannot raise taxes just on the wealthy; they have to raise it on the middle class.
