At times this is a very stressful job. They remain even-tempered. They remain gentle and kind and good humored. We have lost one of those just recently. Maybe you did not know his name, but you saw him, usually through the center door, or sometimes other doors. His name was Lou Costantino.  As a member of the House security team for over 28 years, Lou Costantino has been a fixture at the House Chamber's front door and was beloved by Members and staff who were greeted by him every day. I never failed to come through that door that he did not have a kind and gentle world.  He was a ``purveyor of pork,'' if you will. He loved sausage, and he allowed some of us to share in that sausage.  I am very sad to report to all of you that Lou died of a heart attack last Saturday. He was young, 71 years of age. Many of you will remember Lou for the homemade sausage he made for his friends and colleagues every day.  We will miss Lou. He made this institution a better place.                           Moment of Silence  I would ask you therefore to join me in a moment of silence in remembrance of a part of this institution who will be sorely missed, Lou Costantino.                          ____________________
