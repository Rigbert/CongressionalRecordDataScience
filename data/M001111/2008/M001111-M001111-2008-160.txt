 President, in the tax portion of the aviation bill, Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley are keeping their word. This provision in this bill authorizes that there will be enough money to continue highway projects under SAFETEA-LU--the Federal transportation planning bill.  As I said, this addresses an urgent need. If the highway trust fund provision is stripped from this bill, my subcommittee could be required to cut highway spending for 2009 by $14 billion just to keep the trust fund out of bankruptcy next year. That will represent a cut of more than one-third in a single year.  I think all of our colleagues should know exactly what is being put at risk if the highway trust fund provisions were to be stripped out of this bill.  I ask unanimous consent that a table that has been prepared by the Federal Highway Administration be printed in the Record.
