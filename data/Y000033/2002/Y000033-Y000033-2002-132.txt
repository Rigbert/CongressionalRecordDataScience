There are two reasons. One is I am not terribly fond of what originally this Congress did about the Florida Everglades. This is one of the largest pits we have ever created as far as dollars and expenditures. And we have some difference of opinion from science about the benefit of what they are trying to do. I have heard this as Resources chairman.  Secondly, although small in number, there are about 200 people that are directly affected by the actions that you propose. Now, that may be small in number for a lot of people in this room, but I am one that believes that the individual is all-important, not the mass.
