I want to really follow up on one of his last points. I say to Senator Reed, I have in my hand a letter signed by some 80 businesses and business organizations objecting to the increase in the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 67. These are not just a few odds and ends when it comes to the business profile of America. We not only have a letter signed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, but also the National Association of Manufacturers, companies like ARCO and Bell Atlantic, Chrysler Corp., Ford, General Motors, and the list goes on and on. Making the point my colleague from Rhode Island made, they have already made a commitment to their employees and it is this: We will protect you with health insurance as a member of our family, our corporate family, after retirement untilyou are eligible for Medicare. Now, if we raise the Medicare eligibility 2 years, these companies having made that commitment have a new liability that they had not anticipated. It is not only a cost but a disincentive to these and other companies to make that kind of promise. That is the real world. For people to see the simple symmetry between Social Security and Medicare--oh, it is going to 67 by the year 2027 on Social Security, and let's go to 67 for eligibility on Medicare--is to overlook the real world that people live in. The employees who are faced with troubling medical conditions late in their lives who may not have health insurance coverage, who cannot afford to buy it at that point in their lives, where are they? Who speaks for them in this Chamber? Who will stand up and say that these people deserve protection and coverage? Well, we have it today--at least beginning at age 65.  I hope that, in the name of balancing the budget and having some budget impact in the next century, we will not throw away a basic commitment to those in our country who have worked so long and so hard. I will be making a point of order at this point in the debate, unless others would like to speak.
