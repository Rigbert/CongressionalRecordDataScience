 President, I rise to pay tribute to a woman who has answered a call to service, and given so freely of herself over the course of her fruitful lifetime. Ms. Pauline White of Cumberland, KY, has not ceased giving to her fellow man, even though she is entering her 80s. Contrary to what one may think, Ms. White has not let her age stop her from participating in the missionary work that is so dear to her heart.  Ms. White, who was working as a missionary in Sebring, FL, at the Association for Retarded Citizens in 2002, felt that she was called by God to come and bring aid to eastern Kentucky. She put up a ``For Sale'' sign in her yard, and called a few of her lady friends to come over and help her begin to pack her belongings. Just a few hours later a couple knocked on the door, asked about the price of the house, and ended up buying the house in cash later that day. Ms. White did not worry about selling her house for long, which she believed was just another sure sign from God that her journey to Kentucky was part of His plans.  Ms. White is now the director of Shepherd's Pantry, an outreach program in Cumberland, KY, that provides food for 500 to 900 low-income families on the second Wednesday of each month. Families that participate in the program are assigned appointments to come to the pantry and receive what Ms. White and her volunteers have worked so hard to prepare for them. At the pantry, the families are given food, personal hygiene items, and treats for their children. But according to Ms. White, the most important thing the families receive from Shepherd's Pantry is the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The volunteers at the pantry drop gospel tracts in each of the bags that the families receive, and then they wait for the Lord to move. The staff is always available to provide those in need with spiritual counseling.  Along with their aid of food to families in need, Shepherd's Pantry also distributes government commodities to low-income families, supplies breakfast for schoolchildren, and provides snacks to mission groups throughout the area.  Shepherd's Pantry has attracted volunteers from as far as Florida, and as close as London, KY. The volunteers come to witness God's work in the community. And according to Ms. White, they have yet to be disappointed. She says that God performs miracles week after week.  Ms. White recalls one instance when the computer wiped out all of thenames of the Pantry's clients and addresses. The staff tried just about everything to get the computer to turn back on, but nothing seemed to help. After much praying, the computer miraculously booted up and printed all 500 names, addresses, and emails. Upon hearing about the phenomenon, the mail station company said ``No way!'' Ms. White responded with, ``Yes, God's way!''  Ms. White has no intentions of ending her mission work anytime soon. She has handpicked a Bible verse in Psalms Chapter 91, Verse 11, which is very dear to her heart: ``For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways.'' In Sebring, FL, in 2002, Ms. White heard a preacher speak of a lady who was still serving the Lord at 86 years old. She thought to herself, ``I still have 14 years to go!'' Ms. White offers this advice to other ``old folks'': ``When he calls, I think you need to consider his call and not your age.''  The service and good works of Ms. Pauline White and Shepherd's Pantry have contributed mightily to the town of Cumberland, the surrounding region, and the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky. Ms. White is providing nourishment not just for her neighbors' bellies, but also for their spirits. Mr. President, at this time I would like to ask my colleagues in the U.S. Senate to join me in commemorating the great service of Ms. Pauline White.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
