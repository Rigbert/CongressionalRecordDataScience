The Senator from Rhode Island is a member of the Armed Services Committee. I think it raises some questions and bears repeating that we left the Department of Defense authorization bill, which was on the floor of the Senate, the bill for our Department of Defense that covers oursoldiers and their families, buys the necessary equipment so they can execute the war successfully and come home, with amendments pending relative to payments to widows and orphans for soldiers who died in the line of duty, with amendments pending to provide additional assistance to totally disabled veterans, with an amendment pending that would have provided additional compensation to members of the Guard and Reserve who happen to work for the Federal Government and are activated.  I would like to ask the Senator from Rhode Island, can the Senator from Rhode Island tell me, before we moved to this special interest legislation to protect the gun industry manufacturers and dealers from personal responsibility for their wrongdoing, would the Senator from Rhode Island describe for those following the debate what was on the floor of the Senate when the Republican leadership decided to move to this bill?
