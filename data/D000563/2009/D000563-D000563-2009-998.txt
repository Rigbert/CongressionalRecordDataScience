President, I thank my colleague from Ohio for joining in. He certainly recalls those infamous hearings in the House of Representatives when the tobacco company executives stood up and ceremoniously testified under oath that nicotine was not addictive. That, I think, was the beginning of the end of the tobacco lobby in Washington, DC. Everyone knew that they were, at best, misleading and, at worst, just plain lying to the American people. When it came to their advertising, they denied for years that kids were their targets.
