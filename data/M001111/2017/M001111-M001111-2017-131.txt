 President, I want to thank the Senator from Minnesota, who came the other night to talk passionately about her own mother, who was a teacher and her favorite course to teach was about the monarch butterfly and how she would come dressed up as a butterfly and how she impacted a young student in her classroom who is now a young adult and still remembers the learning experience that her mother, as a teacher, gave to him. That spark is so important for every child in this country--that spark for education--no matter who you are, your disability, or what brings you to school that day. That is what is so important about the term ``public education.'' Every child in this country deserves a public education and to reach their full potential, no matter what they look like, how they come to school that day, whether they have been fed or have a disability. That spark is what is so important.  That is why so many people have spoken out in this country about this nominee, who knows nothing or very little about IDEA--not even that it is a Federal law that is under the jurisdiction of the Department that she is seeking and that she would oversee and protect those students. That, to me, is deeply disappointing. It says to me that this President should say: I don't want this nominee to go forward. I will send you someone who understands this law.  I appreciate the question from the Senator from Minnesota.  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?
