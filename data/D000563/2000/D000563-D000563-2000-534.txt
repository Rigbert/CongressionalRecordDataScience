President, I hope the Senate goes on record unanimously, on a bipartisan basis. If it doesn't, I hope families across America who are worried about the safety of their kids ask each and every Senator how we can vote against a resolution saying we are going to make it a national priority in the sense of the Senate to make schools safe and implement policies that reduce the threat of gun violence.  I yield for a question.
