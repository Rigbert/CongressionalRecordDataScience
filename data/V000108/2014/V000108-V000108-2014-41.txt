I am very concerned that the impulse here is related to sexual orientation and the limitation in serving as a chaplain in the United States military.  I would tell the gentleman at one time in my life--and I obviously took a bad turn in the road because I got involved in politics--I was in a Roman Catholic seminary. My God is a loving God. My God is a tolerant God. My God passes judgment on the goodness of a person's soul. In this day and in this world, where there is so much hate and violence and anger, I think it is very disappointing that we in public life would try to accentuate that there are differences between us that may cause us not to like each other.  Each of us seeks our God differently. We have different religions, we have different customs, we have different preferences. But it is important to find that chaplain and spiritual guide who meets those needs to help us to find that just and forgiving and kind God.  I think it is wrong to foreclose any avenue for any American, and particularly those who put the uniform of this country on and risk their lives for us and are under incredible stress. To foreclose any avenue of spiritual guidance and relief for them is wrong.  I would simply close by noting that there is a monument--Thomas Jefferson--in Washington D.C.                              {time}  1845  One of the writings of Jefferson is on the southeast portico. It says:       Laws and constitutions must go hand in hand with the      progress of the human mind. As that becomes more developed,      more enlightened, institutions must advance to keep pace with      those times. We might as well require a man to wear still the      coat which fitted him when a boy as a civilized society to      remain ever under the regimen of their barbarous ancestors.  My vote would be a vote to have a tolerant policy in a tolerant country. I oppose the gentleman's amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.
