President, it is my understanding there are two or three Senators on the floor who would like to pay tribute to Mr. Liebengood, as Senator Frist did. I will ask unanimous consent they be recognized, if we can get an idea how much time they will use, and then if we could return to the scheduled morning business with the remaining time on the Democrat side and then the balance on the Republican side.
