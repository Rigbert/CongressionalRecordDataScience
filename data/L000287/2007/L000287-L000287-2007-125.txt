Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2007. I commend my colleagues on the Ways and Means Committee for working in a bipartisan way to reach an agreement on provisions that will not only help small businesses grow and thrive, but will provide small businesses with incentives to hire disadvantaged workers. Not only that, it will not pass any costs onto our children.  The most important thing that will come out of passing this piece of legislation today, is that it will ensure that we finally pass a minimum wage increase. As I have said before, we have waited far too long--10 long years--to give our working poor a pay raise. We should be ashamed of that delay, but I am proud that we are taking that important step to restoring dignity and fairness for our minimum wage earners. This minimum wage increase will help millions of our brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers.  My fight in Congress is the fight against poverty. We must do more for working families, for families who are playing by the rules and still cannot get ahead. I just don't understand how people survive under these circumstances. We cannot stand by and watch millions of people continue to fall into poverty. This minimum wage increase is not the end, but the beginning of our fight against poverty in this nation.  Passing this legislation today will smooth the path to the passage of the minimum wage increase. This bill is also a symbol of how much we can accomplish to help hard working families when we work together, across the aisle--Democrats and Republicans. And I look forward to continued progress in the fight against poverty in the 110th Congress.
