Chairman, I think the gentleman has a point of view that I do not support, but in terms of this amendment, it really is not necessary. It is redundant. On March 28 of this year, Executive Order No. 13783, signed by President Donald Trump, has rescinded every one of the analyses that the gentleman referenced in his proposed amendment. So this amendment does less than nothing. It has already been dealt with through executive order.  I would just encourage my colleagues to let's move the agenda along this evening where we will have significant debate perhaps on other matters.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment because it is redundant at this point, and I yield back the balance of my time.
