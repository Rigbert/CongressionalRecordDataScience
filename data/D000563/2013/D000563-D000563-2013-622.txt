 In this circumstance, the decision was made by the State of Tennessee--and West Virginia as well--as to what the sales tax would be by the people living in the State and making purchases in the State. We don't change that at all. That is up to the States to decide.  As I mentioned, four States, maybe five States, when it comes to sales tax, have no sales tax. What we are putting in this bill will not change that in any way. If you live in Oregon, you will pay no sales tax because of this bill for what is sold over the counter or over the Internet.  Our friends from Delaware are supporting this bill because they think because they are a no-sales-tax State surrounded by Pennsylvania and New Jersey and Maryland, they are going to have an advantage. They believe people will cross the borders to buy in Delaware. So they have calculated this actually helps them.  But we are respecting the decisions made by each State as to the taxes that will be imposed. We are doing it on a fair and equalized basis for those who have brick-and-mortar stores as well as those over the Internet. And I would say that is consistent with the 10th Amendment and consistent with States rights in this area.
