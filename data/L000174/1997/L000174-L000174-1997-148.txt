President, I want to bring to the attention of the Senate that Human Rights Watch, the International Labor Rights Fund, and Mexico's National Association of Democratic Lawyers have asked the U.S. National Administrative Office [U.S. NAO] to investigate reports of widespread pregnancy-based sex discrimination in Mexico's maquiladora industry.  These organizations report that maquiladoras routinely administer pregnancy exams to prospective female employees in order to deny them work, in blatant violation of their privacy. Female employees face invasive questions about contraceptive use, sexual activity, and menses schedules. In some cases, women who become pregnant after being hired are forced to resign. Maquiladora owners fear that pregnant women will reduce production standards and that legally mandated maternity benefits will drain industry money. The report concludes that the Mexican Government has failed to investigate these discriminatory practices in violation of their own laws and NAFTA.  The request for an investigation is the first of its kind that has been brought before the U.S. NAO. The case represents an important opportunity to convey to our trading partners and United States corporations who have operations in Mexico that sex discrimination is intolerable, illegal, and in violation of NAFTA.  As we consider expanding NAFTA benefits to the Caribbean Basin and other South American countries, the United States should demonstrate to our trading partners that we take labor rights violations seriously. I hope the U.S. NAO will consider this case expeditiously and I look forward to its report. The priviledge of free trade and its economic benefits should be conditional upon the trading partners abiding by the same labor and environmental laws.                          ____________________
