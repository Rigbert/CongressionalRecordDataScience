 President, earlier this afternoon we voted on a good government proposal that would have improved accountability for taxpayer dollars. That amendment focused on grants awarded by the Department of Justice. Soon we will be voting to repeal another good government measure; that is, the provision to ensure that government contractors pay their taxes by requiring that governments withhold 3 percent from payments to contractors as prepayment for their taxes. The provision was enacted in direct response to a series of Government Accountability Office, or GAO, reports about Federal contractors not paying their taxes.  I have always said that taxpayers should pay what they owe--not a penny more, and not a penny less. And several GAO reports indicate that information reporting and upfront withholding significantly improve compliance. In fact, that is why the Federal Government withholds taxes from individual paychecks.  Since the provision was enacted, I have heard repeatedly about the costs of implementation. I am disappointed by the misinformation that has been spread by the various outside groups--just like the ones that lobbied against my Justice Department grant amendment today.  Specifically, one fictitious estimate by an outside group states that the cost to implement this provision is $75 billion. There is another made-up estimate that it would cost the Department of Defense $17 billion to implement this provision.  I have a very long history, over 30 years in the Senate, of doing oversight of various Federal agencies. I cut my teeth in oversight by combating waste, fraud, and abuse at the Defense Department. I knew both the 75 billion and 17 billion numbers were bogus the first time I heard them.  The Congressional Budget Office, or the CBO, the nonpartisan, objective scorekeeper for Congress, has estimated the cost of implementation to the Federal Government, including the Defense Department, to be $85 million over 5 years.  Mr. President, I am a firm believer in reviewing laws that aren't working. This provision never even had a chance to work. However, I have heard from small business owners across Iowa about the burdens the withholding provision would impose on them, particularly with the economy still being in the dumps.  For that reason, I support repealing this provision. My preference would have been to fix the provision so that small businesses and State and local governments would be exempted. However, that would have likely created even more complexity.  Let me just say that, despite the rhetoric, large corporations would not have been impacted in the same way that small businesses would have been.  They, especially defense and Medicare contractors, are not operating on a cash flow basis or on profit margins of 3 percent. They are just riding the coattails of small businesses in pushing for repeal of this provision.  As we proceed to vote on repeal of this provision, let me remind my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that tax cheats are a very real problem. Tax delinquent contractors continue to be awarded Federal contracts, despite the administration's efforts to clamp down on awarding contracts to them. The most recent example is the award of stimulus contracts.  A GAO report from May of just this year indicated that $24 billion in Federal contracts were awarded to contractors who owed more than $750 million of back taxes. This is not chump change.  In the past year or so, Members of the House and Senate have supported measures to ensure that Federal employees pay their taxes. Well, Federal contractors should not be treated any differently. The country is in the midst of an unprecedented fiscal crisis. Tax increases are off the table so we need to ensure that we are collecting every dollar that is owed to the Federal Government.  Senator Baucus and I continue to work on an alternative to 3 percent withholding. This alternative would prohibit the Federal Government from awarding contracts to tax cheats.  In order to assist contracting agencies in identifying tax cheats, we would enable those agencies to check a contractor's tax status with the Internal Revenue Service. This new approach would be much narrower in focus than the 3 percent withholding provision. It should only impact the bad actors. When we have an opportunity to consider this provision, I would hope that my colleagues would support us in enacting it. Preventing tax cheating should be a bipartisan issue.  I ask unanimous consent that the CBO estimate be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record,  as follows: PRELIMINARY ESTIMATE--CHANGE IN AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO APPROPRIATION ARISING FROM SECTION 511 OF THE TAX INCREASE PREVENTION AND RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2005                                                         [In millions of dollars by fiscal year]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          2012             2013             2014             2015             2016            Total--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Federal Implementation Costs:    Nonrecurring..................................               35                0                0                0                0               35    Recurring.....................................               10               10               10               10               10               50                                                   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------        Total.....................................               45               10               10               10               10               85Costs to Federal Contractors:    Nonrecurring a................................            7,500              400              400              400              400            9,100    Recurring b...................................

Implementation costs of federal contractors are not directly billable to federal agencies. CBO expects that such costs will eventually be passed on  to federal agencies in the form of higher prices for goods and services, although not necessarily in the same year that those costs are incurred.b. Ongoing implementation costs arise from regular turnover of federal contractors. New vendors will need to modify their accounting systems to provide  goods and services to federal agencies.
