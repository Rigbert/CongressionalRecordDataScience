Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The Junior Duck Stamp Program was developed 20 years ago and first authorized by Congress in 1994. Today, more than 28,000 students participate in the conservation curriculum and annual nationwide wildlife art contest.  During hearings of this legislation, one of the witnesses was a teacher from an elementary school in Frederick, Maryland. In her statement, she noted: ``As a teacher, I believe that the Junior Duck Stamp Program is an excellent learning opportunity for students at all grade levels. What is difficult for me to put into words is the looks on the curious faces of my students as they research to learn about various waterfowl and their habitat; the looks of determination as they work hard to capture the likeness of the birds; and the smiles when their entries are finally completed.''  This is an excellent program, Mr. Speaker, and a sound investment of U.S. taxpayer dollars. The Junior Duck Stamp Program should be extended for an additional 5 years.  I would also like to compliment the authors of this bill, Congressmen Solomon Ortiz and Henry E. Brown, Jr., for their leadership on behalf of wildlife conservation of this Nation.  This is a good piece of legislation, Mr. Speaker, and I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 3537.
