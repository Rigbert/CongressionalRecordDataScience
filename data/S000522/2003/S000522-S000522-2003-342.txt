Mr. Speaker, as you may know, this week marks the 29th Anniversary of National Catholic Schools Week, a week dedicated to honor the achievements and successes of the more than 2.6 million children enrolled in the 8,114 Catholic Schools throughout our country. Today is National Catholic Schools Appreciation day.  It is fitting then that today I introduce legislation designed to ensure the Federal Government appropriately assists parents with the financial burdens associated with their child's education. My legislation, the Education, Achievement, and Opportunity Act will provide refundable tuition tax credits for the educational expenses incurred by parents for elementary and secondary school. The legislation would provide parents sending their child to an elementary school with up to $2,500 in tax relief, while parents with children in a Catholic or parochial high school could claim up to $3,500 in assistance.  The tax relief contained in my proposal can be utilized by parents to pay for a variety of educational expenses that are frequently incurred on behalf of their children. Most significantly the tax credit is designed to help with the cost of tuition. But, beyond this, the tax credits can be used to help meet the costs of other educational needs: (1) computers, educational software, and books required for courses of instruction; (2) academic tutoring; (3) special needs services for qualifying children with disabilities (within the meaning of the Americans With Disabilities Act); (4) fees for transportation services to and from a private school, if the transportation is provided by the school and the school charges a fee for the transportation; and (5) academic testing services.  Parents know the interests and needs of their children better than anyone else. If we are truly going to ensure that ``no child is left behind,'' in our national education agenda, then we must make sure our children have every tool at their disposal to academically succeed.  The wealthy in America already have the choice to send their child to the school that best suits them. But middle and working class families often do not. Between tuition costs and out-of-pocket expenses like tutoring, computers, and transportation, the costs can add up and pose an enormous obstacle to the child's lifetime leaming opportunities.  In my own district in New Jersey, a parent who feels a Catholic elementary school is best suited for their child, will pay somewhere between $1,840 and $2,566 in tuition costs per child, per year. If you want to send your child to a parochial high school in the central New Jersey area, a parent is looking at an average tuition bill of $5,571 per student, per year. In other areas of the country, the costs are very similar.  Without federal support, many parents struggle--and in some cases forgo--a Catholic school education, or any education in a spiritual setting, because the costs are so high. Learning in a religious setting is not for every one, and America's public school system is critical to providing educational opportunities for all. We must continue to vigorously support our public schools at both the federal and local levels. At the same time, however, we should support those who seek the benefits of Catholic school and choose a religious setting as the best, educational environment for their children.  In effect, parents of Catholic school children pay twice--they pay their fair share of taxes necessary to support the public school system, and they pay tuition at the school their children actually attend. I urge my colleagues to join me in addressing this inherent unfairness and work for the passage of my tuition tax credit program as the best way to help offset the double payment endured by those who send their children to Catholic and parochial schools.  In America today, we have 59 million youngsters in elementary and secondary school across the U.S.; about 10 percent of these students are enrolled in private, parochial and rabbinical schools. Those families who are already sending their children to such schools, and others planning to send their children to them, would benefit enormously from my proposal, because they are often struggling to make ends meet.  It is important to note that my education proposal is a tax credit, rather than a voucher, so the total amount of education resources available for all school age children will increase. Under a voucher system, if a school loses enrolled students to a competing school, thatschool may lose funding and have fewer resources available for their educational program. Under my plan, that outcome is avoided. It is a ``win-win'' scenario, whereas some have argued that voucher programs can become a zero-sum situation with ``winners and losers.''  A tuition tax credit for education is a benefit that should be available to all, no matter what their race, creed, or national origin. And make no mistake: the public school system will and must continue to remain the backbone of our nation's education system. But we must never forget that the public school system was created to serve students--not the other way around. If a student is performing poorly, parents should have the opportunity to augment the child's education with help from the federal government.  If we are to truly make good on our promise that ``no child is left behind,'' we must ensure that Catholic schools are included in this national promise and goal. A child is a child, regardless of which school system they are enrolled. The children enrolled in Catholic, private, and rabbinical schools deserve nothing less than our full support and compassion.  I urge my colleagues to support the Education, Achievement, and Opportunity Act.                          ____________________
