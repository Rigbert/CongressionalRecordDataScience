 President, I rise today to discuss the issue of religious freedom. The freedom to believe and worship how one chooses is essential. However, as we strive for greater religious freedom and tolerance throughout the world, we have witnessed activist judges chip away at our own religious freedoms. These activist judges have worked diligently to restrict our rights to express our religious beliefs under the guise of separation of church and state.  Many of the court decisions that have broadened Americans' first amendment right to free speech, overreach. In an effort to promote tolerance, religious expression is in fact, being censored.  Our Founding Fathers proclaimed liberty to be an unalienable right bestowed by our Creator--``We hold these Truths to be self-evident, that all men are . . . endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness . . .'' Yet unelected, activist judges are rewriting history. They have decided that, in fact, the Founding Fathers did not intend for there to be freedom of religious expression but, rather, freedom from religious expression.  Thirty years of public opinion polls have shown that more than 75 percent of Americans support a constitutional amendment to protect voluntary school prayer. However, the Supreme Court has said such an act violates the constitutional separation of church and state--again, another act that forces freedom from religious expression rather than freedom of religious expression.  It is not simply this decision but a growing and disturbing trend in our Federal courts to deny the rights of our States and our citizens to acknowledge God openly and freely. In fact, reciting the words ``one Nation under God'' in the Pledge of Allegiance has been ruled unconstitutional as has displaying the Ten Commandments in a State building in my home State of Alabama. These tortured legal decisions distort our Constitution, our Nation's history and its tradition in an effort to secularize our system of government and divest morality from our rule of law.  We simply cannot divest God from our country. Our country has no foundation without a basic recognition that God invests us at birth with basic individual rights that we all enjoy as Americans. In fact, our Government and our laws are based on Judeo-Christian values and a recognition of God as our Creator.  Our motto is ``In God We Trust.'' It is enshrined on our currency.  Our national anthem recognizes our motto as ``In God is Our Trust.''  As Federal officials, each of us has taken an oath of office. The President takes a similar one. State and local officials and our military personnel all swear a similar oath. Jurors and witnesses in our State and Federal courts take an oath as do witnesses before Congress. We all swear to uphold the Constitution or tell the truth, ``so help me God.''  Our courts, including the Supreme Court, recognize God in their official proceedings, both the House and Senate acknowledge God through an opening prayer every morning. Our public buildings and monuments honor this heritage through various depictions of the basic moral foundations of our laws and system of government.  My point is that you simply cannot divest God from our country. Despite the actions of these activist judges, our country has no foundation without a basic recognition that God invests us at birth with basic individual rights--such as the blessings of liberty--that we all enjoy as Americans.  Again, I believe that the courts have exceeded their power. They have overreached. To that end, I have introduced the Constitution Restoration Act. This legislation recognizes the rights of the States and the people as embodied in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution--9th and 10th amendments--to acknowledge God.  The Constitution Restoration Act goes to the very foundation of our country and the legitimacy of our system of government. Thomas Jefferson in his first inaugural address said that ``The wisdom of our sages and the blood of our heros have been devoted to [the] attainment'' of our liberty and form of government.  If we are to maintain our form of government, we must ensure that activist judges are not permitted to take away our religious liberties. The very foundation of our government cannot and should not be expunged from public view--an unelected Federal judiciary should not be allowed to outlaw all public acknowledgments of God. We must protect our very basic freedom of religious expression.  Mr. President, I encourage my colleagues to work with me to protect this basic freedom by supporting the Constitution Restoration Act.                          ____________________
