President, I want to repeat something in perhaps a little bit of a different way that I mentioned yesterday because we talked about a lot of things on this floor that are very significant, such as our health delivery system and such as the deficit. But our Nation's defense perhaps is the most significant subject that we could have to talk about.  I was so dismayed and shocked yesterday when I read what the President was saying through Secretary of Defense William Perry that we now are going to leave our troops over in Bosnia for a period longer than the 12 months that they agreed to.  I am on the Intelligence Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee. I can tell you that at the time this happened, I could not believe that we were sending troops into a warring area with an exit strategy that was geared to time, 12 months, as opposed to events. I do not know of any time in history that this has been the case.  So during the October 17 Senate Armed Services Committee meeting and several other meetings, and on the floor, we talked about the fact that we did not believe it was going to be a 12-month operation. I asked specifically Secretary Perry, as well as other people asking him in the same meeting--one was Senator Robb from Virginia and one was Senator Bingaman from New Mexico--``Are you absolutely committed to bringing the troops home in 12 months?'' The answer was always, ``Yes, we are committed.'' It was hard for me to believe that could be possible.  So I went over to the northeast sector of Bosnia where we were planning at that time to send our troops. When I got there and went up to the northeast sector, finding out no other American had been up there, I found out from General Haukland, from Norway, who was in charge of the U.N. troops of that sector, that, in fact, it was laughable.  I said, ``Are you aware that our troops are coming back in 12 months?'' He said, ``You mean in 12 years?'' That is when he drew this analogy, when he said putting the troops in there is like putting your hand in water, and you leave it there for 12 months and take it out and nothing has changed; it is still there.  So we are making a longer term commitment than the President of the United States promised the American people. I can tell you right now, I stood right here on December 13 of last year when we had the resolution of disapproval that was authored by the junior Senator from Texas and myself, Senator Hutchison and myself. We lacked four votes of passing a resolution of disapproval. Mr. President, we would have had those four votes and many more if the American people had known, and if the Senators in this Chamber had known, that it was going to be a long-term proposition.  Right now it does look like it is open-ended. We could talk about the cost of it, we could talk about the mission, but the point is, they told us something that they knew was not true on December 13, at the time they passed the program to send American troops over into an area we have no vital security interest in.  I am not saying, ``I told you so.'' I am just saying, it was so obvious at the time and everyone is on record and the President is on record and John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is on record and Secretary Perry is on record, all of them assuring it was going to be 12 months, and now we know it is not going to be 12 months.  As I said yesterday, we have to serve notice on the administration that when they try to extend that time, we in this Chamber will do everything we can to support our troops who are over there, but they are going to have a fight in keeping our troops over there for an undetermined period of time.                          ____________________
