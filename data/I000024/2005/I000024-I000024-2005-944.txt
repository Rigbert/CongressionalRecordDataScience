President, I thank the Senator from Montana for his comments and a very excellent explanation as to how the Finance Committee is coming up with some more money to try to make this a better bill.  Senator Jeffords and I have been trying to get people to come down with amendments for several days now. We are pleased that Senator Hutchinson and Senator Nelson of Nebraska have an amendment. It is one to which we have agreed, but there may be others who want to be heard on it.  I yield the floor.
