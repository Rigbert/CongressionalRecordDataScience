 President, I rise today in support of the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff and many members of this body have expressed concern over the state of our military forces. One of the most serious problems identified by the Joint Chiefs is the recruitment and retention of dedicated and highly trained personnel. This legislation begins the process of rectifying that situation. Our Armed Forces must not only be able to fight and win on the battlefield, they must be able to compete for high quality personnel against robust private sector employers. I am proud to say that this bill gives our military a much more equitable chance to recruit and retain the best persons this country has to offer.  This legislation authorizes a significant and long overdue military pay raise. It enhances two long time staples of recruitment and retention; the military retirement system and the Montgomery G.I. bill. It authorizes a subsistence allowance for enlisted personnel so that no military member will be forced to live on food stamps. Finally, I am very pleased that this bill includes an authorization for military personnel to participate in a Thrift Savings Plan similar to the plans afforded other non-uniformed Federal employees.  Mr. President, the bill which I stand in support of today should be considered as a beginning. Congress has an explicit constitutional duty to see that the Armed Forces are equipped and maintained. Their unique task is daunting and at times life threatening. The Congress and this administration should not treat military service as just another job. This bill represents the Senate's view that the personnel of America's Armed Forces are worth a significant investment. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  To every member of our Armed Forces, whether afloat, ashore or airborne, wherever they are in the world, I say thank you and well done!
