Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, and with all due respect, and I have a great deal of respect for the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos), I would have to respectfully decline.  Earlier we had spoken, and the gentleman had indicated he wanted to do a colloquy on identical language. The problem is the word ``undermine.'' If a group opposes a certain type of prevention such as condom use that could be construed in the eyes of someone who is making a grant or letting a grant, that organization should not get funded. The proposed Lantos language nullifies any conscience clause so I must reject it.  Our hope with our amendment is that we empower the maximum army of volunteers and professional people to care and assist people who are at risk of HIV/AIDS as well as people who have already contracted this horrific disease. We should not limit our response to this crisis; we need to have a more flexible response. Be reminded, we are talking about grant money. So it is still up to the grantor--the United States Government--to decide whether or not the grant request that we are in receipt of meets the criteria in terms of what the project is all about, whether it be dealing with actual treatment of AIDS patients or hospice care or some prevention strategy or mother to child transmission initiatives.  So with all due respect, I would have to decline.
