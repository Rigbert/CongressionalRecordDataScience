Mr. Chairman, let me respond to my friend, the gentleman from California, by saying first of all, I do distinguish the bill as it is currently written with a volunteer verification system from the mandatory verification system that we had at the phase of the subcommittee. It was for that reason we felt we could distinguish the two and take out the testers.  I want to say that the amendment that is going to be offered in the next day or two by the gentleman from California [Mr. Gallegly], to make the verification system mandatory does include the testers provisions, so that is more of a parallel. We had it mandatory in subcommittee, the testers are still in the amendment, making the verification system.
