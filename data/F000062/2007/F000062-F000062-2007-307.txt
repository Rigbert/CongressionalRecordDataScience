 President, I am pleased to introduce this bill today along with Senator Boxer as cosponsor to direct the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of expanding the Santa Monica National Recreation Area to include the Rim of the Valley Corridor.  The Rim of the Valley Corridor is an example of a highly threatened habitat area, the Mediterranean chaparral ecosystem. Connecting to the adjacent Los Padres and San Bernardino National Forests, the Corridor encircles the San Fernando Valley, La Crescenta, Simi, Conejo, and Santa Clarita Valleys, consisting of parts of the Santa Monica Mountains, Santa Susanna Mountains, San Gabriel Mountains, Verdugo Mountains, and San Rafael Hills.  There is a great need for expanded parkland in southern California. While the Los Angeles metropolitan region has the second-largest urban concentration in the United States, the area has one of the lowest ratios of park-and-recreation-lands per thousand-population of any urban area in the country.  Since the creation of the Santa Monica Recreation Area in 1978, Federal, State, and local authorities have worked successfully together to create and maintain the highly successful Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, hemmed in on all sides by development.  With the passage of this legislation, Congress will hold true to its original commitment to preserve the scenic, natural, and historic setting of the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area.  With the inclusion of the Rim of the Valley Corridor in the Santa Monica Mountains Recreation Area, greater ecological health and diversity will be promoted, particularly for larger animals like mountain lions, bobcats, and the golden eagle. By creating a single contiguous Rim of the Valley Trail, people will enjoy greater access to existing trails in the Recreational Area.  Within a National Recreation Area, the National Park Service is prohibited from exercising the powers of eminent domain, and private property may be purchased from voluntary sellers only.  The bill includes a provision directing the Department of the Interior to analyze any effects that a proposed expansion of the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area will have on private land within or bordering the area. Any such effects will be thoroughly considered as the study moves forward.  After the study called for in this bill is complete, the Secretary of the Interior and Congress will be in a key position to determine whether all or portions of the Rim of the Valley Corridor warrant inclusion in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.  This bill enjoys strong support from local and State officials and I hope that it will have as much strong bipartisan support this Congress, as it did last Congress. Congressman Adam Schiff plans to introduce companion legislation for this bill in the House and I applaud his commitment to this issue.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation and I ask unanimous consent that the text of this proposed legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1053       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Rim of the Valley Corridor      Study Act''.     SEC. 2. RESOURCE STUDY OF RIM OF THE VALLEY CORRIDOR,                    CALIFORNIA.       (a) Study Required.--The Secretary of the Interior shall      conduct a resource study of     the lands, waters, and interests of the area known as the Rim      of the Valley Corridor in the State of California to evaluate      a range of alternatives for protecting resources of the      corridor, including the alternative of establishing all or a      portion of the corridor as a unit of the Santa Monica      Mountains National Recreation Area. The Rim of the Valley      Corridor generally includes the mountains encircling the San      Fernando, La Crescenta, Santa Clarita, Simi, and Conejo      Valleys in California.       (b) Study Topics.--In conducting the study, the Secretary      shall seek to achieve the following objectives:       (1) Protecting wildlife populations in the Santa Monica      Mountains National Recreation Area by preserving habitat      linkages and wildlife movement corridors between large blocks      of habitat in adjoining regional open space.       (2) Establishing connections along the State-designated Rim      of the Valley Trail System, with the aim of creating a single      contiguous Rim of the Valley Trail and encompassing major      feeder trails connecting adjoining communities and regional      transit to the trail system.       (3) Preserving recreational opportunities and facilitating      access to open space for a variety of recreational users.       (4) Protecting rare, threatened, or endangered plant and      animal species, and rare or unusual plant communities and      habitats.       (5) Protecting historically significant landscapes,      districts, sites, and structures.       (6) Respecting the needs of communities within, or in the      vicinity of, the Rim of the Valley Corridor.       (c) Private Property.--As part of the study, the Secretary      shall analyze the potential impact that establishment of all      or a portion of the Rim of the Valley Corridor as a unit of      the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area is likely      to have on land within or bordering the area that is      privately owned at the time the study is conducted. The      report required by subsection (g) shall discuss the concerns      of private landowners within the existing boundaries of the      Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.       (d) Cost Effectiveness.--As part of evaluating each      alternative considered under the study, the Secretary shall      estimate the impact of implementing the alternative on      staffing and other potential costs to Federal, State, and      local agencies and other organizations.       (e) Consultation.--The Secretary shall conduct the study in      consultation with appropriate Federal, State, county, and      local government entities.       (f) Study Criteria.--In addition to the special      considerations specified in this section, the Secretary shall      conduct the study using the criteria prescribed for the study      of areas for potential inclusion in the National Park System      in section 8(c) of Public Law 91-383 (16 U.S.C. 1a-5(c)).       (g) Transmission of Study.--Within three years after funds      are first made available for the study, the Secretary shall      transmit a report containing the results of the study to the      Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and      to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of      Representatives.                                 ______                                       By
