President, I thank my colleague, Senator Harkin, for this opportunity to speak on the drought funding and legislative needs for the Klamath Basin in southern Oregon.  I understand that the bill currently being considered, the Emergency Agriculture Assistance Act of 2001, is primarily a bill to provide money for farmers suffering market loss this year. A market loss, as I understand it, happens when a farmer receives less money for his crop than he spent to produce it. But, due to drought, my constituents were unable to plant their crops.
