Speaker, I am going to support this resolution because it is what I call a one-third measure. Not a half measure, it does not go that far, but a one-third measure.  My friend, the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Gilchrest] who preceded me, is a gentleman for whom I have a great deal of respect and even more than that, affection, but I would remind the gentleman that when he talks about the President of the United States being an obstructionist, I would remind him in 1980, the entire debt of this Nation was $945 billion. It grew by $3.5 trillion over the next 12 years under President Reagan and President Bush. Were they not obstructionists? Did they not care about this deficit? They could have stopped it, as the gentleman claims the President is stopping this process.  Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is, we work together on policies to try to move this Government forward. The gentleman from Texas [Mr. DeLay], the whip, and so many of the Republicans have been talking about the President not meeting his obligation under the law. This is the law. It says nothing, nothing in section 203 about the President putting a balanced budget on the table. Nothing, my friends.  Read it. Stop misleading the American public and intimating that the President has not told the truth or has not met his commitments. In fact, this President has spent more time negotiating with the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House than any President in history. Apparently, Senator Dole thought it was negotiation in good faith, because he unanimously led a unanimous consent for a continuing resolution to put Government workers back to work and to put Government back to service for the American public.  My friends, we will pass this resolution, this bill. In my opinion, it is flawed at best; but it is necessary, and I will support it. But let us tell the truth.
