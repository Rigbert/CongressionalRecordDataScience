President, Aroostook County in far northern Maine has long been a thriving center of farming and logging. In the early years of the 20th century, it seemed that the only barrier to growth and prosperity was a shortage of modern health care facilities and trained medical professionals.  Two local citizens took it upon themselves to remove this barrier. By horse and wagon, Frank White, an attorney, and Charles E. Hussey, a farmer, traveled through the countryside calling on their neighbors and collected $2,500 to establish a center for health care. In the spring of 1912, Presque Isle General Hospital opened with 20 beds, an operating theater with the latest equipment, four physicians, and a training school for nurses.  Much has changed during the past 100 years. What began in one three-story converted house as Presque Isle General is known today as the Aroostook Medical Center, TAMC, with facilities in Presque Isle, Mars Hill, and Fort Fairfield, an ambulance service, and outreach services, such as a dialysis center and primary care clinics, throughout the northern part of the largest county east of the Mississippi. It has a medical staff of more than 60 trained professionals and a workforce of more than 1,000, making it the region's largest employer.  What has not changed is the spirit of service that is the foundation of this remarkable organization. As one who was born and raised in Aroostook County, I am proud of what has been accomplished there and grateful for the contributions and dedication over the generations that have made this invaluable community resource possible.  The commitment that established the region's first public hospital in 1912 was not a one-time event. Less than a decade later, the growing population created the need for a larger hospital. Another, even more successful fund drive led to the opening in 1921 of a facility with more than twice the beds and vastly expanded services. In 1960, a capital campaign of unprecedented size for this area established the A.R. Gould Memorial Hospital that continues to grow and serve Aroostook residents.  The namesake of today's hospital is of special significance to my Senate colleagues. Arthur Robinson Gould was a Presque Isle entrepreneur who built a lumber mill, powerplants, and an electric railroad. In 1926, he was elected to the U.S. Senate to fill the term of Senator Bert M. Fernald, who died in office. Senator Gould is best remembered for the courageous stand he took against the Ku Klux Klan at a time when that hateful group was gaining prominence in American politics. Despite the esteem in which he was held, Senator Gould chose not to run for reelection in 1930, saying, ``I want to get back to my railroad and the pine forests of Maine.''  That simple statement describes the affection the people of Aroostook County have for their home and helps to explain how they could join together to create, sustain, and grow a modern health care organization. By proclamation of the Governor of Maine and the city of Presque Isle, June 9, 2012, is the official day of celebration for this great centennial. I am honored to commemorate the occasion by congratulating the men and women of the Aroostook Medical Center and the people of Aroostook County for 100 years of accomplishment, and I wish them the best in the years to come.                          ____________________
