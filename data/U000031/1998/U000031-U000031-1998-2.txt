Speaker, it has been a great delight for me to serve as Speaker pro tempore during part of this great tribute to a wonderful man who loves this House, Jerry Solomon.  I have had the opportunity to know the gentleman from New York (Mr. Solomon) for a long time from my days when I served for Ronald Reagan and now as a Member of this House. We all love this House. No greater love comes from a man with terrific respect, Jerry Solomon.  It is a great tribute to you that, as you finish this year, we have a balanced budget; and now we can, in fact, use that surplus to reduce the debt. That is the next battle.  I can remember the days and the issues where we met together on so many different times moving the Solomon budget. Yes, it was bipartisan. We got one Democrat, we got 19 Republicans, and we fell far short of getting the battle won. But somehow, some way, today we prevailed.  It is because of your great efforts in so many different ways that we do love this House and we love the men and women who serve it. Thanks to people like you, a man with courage, with heart, thoughtfulness and compassion, a great man that we look forward to seeing again. Thank you, Jerry.
