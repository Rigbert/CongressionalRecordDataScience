 President, thank you.  I come to the floor today to urge my colleagues to vote no on the nomination that we will vote on shortly.  On the campaign trail, President Trump promised to put workers first. Instead, President Trump's administration has rolled back worker protections and prioritized corporate interests at the expense of workers.  It is critical, now more than ever, that the NLRB remain independent and committed to advocating for workers and their right to organize, but I am deeply concerned that President Trump's nominee, Mr. Kaplan, does not have a record of supporting the rights of workers and unions.  At his nomination hearing, Mr. Kaplan confused basic labor issues and decisions, further proving he lacks the knowledge and experience to serve on this important board. NLRB members should be committed to standing up for workers, and it is clear Mr. Kaplan does not make the cut.  I urge my colleagues to join me in doing what President Trump has failed to do, and that is to put workers first. Vote against this nomination.  Thank you.  I yield the floor.                             Cloture Motion
