 The gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) wanted to say something, but I wanted to say you were right on the process. I was incorrect on the process. It was a separate vote on a separate package, and you are right that I and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) and others voted against it. It was not on these provisions as you know because a change was made, not in a partisan sense, according to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin).  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) to explain his perception and recollection of the process.
