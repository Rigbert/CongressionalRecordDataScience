Speaker, I rise today to recognize Terry R. Carlstrom who for four decades has managed the stewardship of some of our Nation's most precious natural and cultural resources. Mr. Carlstrom is retiring after 41 years in Federal service during which he served with the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the National Park Service.  Mr. Carlstrom's stewardship extended over the past 22 years to the protection and enhancement of 14 units of the National Park System and the numerous memorials in our National Capital Region. First, as Associate Regional Director for Professional Services, and then for the past 8 years as Regional Director of the National Capital Region, he has extended his watchful eye and guiding hand to the protection of our most symbolic National Icons: the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, the Jefferson Memorial; Presidential Memorials to FDR and Lyndon Baines Johnson, the White House; and memorials commemorating the American heroes at home and abroad in the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and in World War II. His leadership in the complete reconstruction of the 5 major scenic parkways, which provide the gateways to our Nation's Capital, ensured their scenic protection while providing for user safety. He also was instrumental in the creation of the Streetscape Standards for the Monumental Core by an interagency task force.  I join the men and women of the National Park Service and the National Capital Region in recognizing Mr. Carlstrom's sincere interest in the welfare and safety of every employee, a dedication which is evidenced by his support and leadership in a safety program that reduced the lost time accident rate by 100 percent during the last 5 years. He established the National Capital Region's Communications Command Center in Hagerstown, Maryland, which has assured continuous and complete communications for our park rangers in remote locations throughout our far ranging parks.  Mr. Carlstrom has provided oversight of 14 parks in the National Capital Region: the National Mall and Memorial Parks; Anacostia River Parks; Rock Creek Park; the White House and President's Park; C Canal National Historical Park; George Washington Memorial Parkway; Civil War Battlefield Parks at Antietam, Monocacy, Harper's Ferry, and Manassas; the Wolf Trap Farm National Park for the Performing Arts; Prince William Forest Park and Catoctin Mountain Park; and the Potomac Heritage National Scenic Trail. During his tenure he guided the establishment of Mary McLeod Bethune Council House and Carter G. Woodson National Historic Sites, the President Lincoln and Soldier's Home National Monument, and the boundary expansions of Monocacy Battlefield and Harper's Ferry National Historical Park. Further, he was a leader in establishing numerous partnerships, including the preservation of the Washington Monument; refurbishment and joint management with Montgomery County of Glen Echo Park; the Accokeek Foundation and National Colonial Farm; and the Alice Fergusen Foundation's Hard Bargain Farm. Recognizing the importance of these important relationships with agencies and individuals beyond the National Park Service, he established an Assistant Regional Director for Partnerships.  Mr. Carlstrom leaves a lasting legacy to Americans from coast to coast. As a young forester in the 1960s, he established sensitive timber management programs for the Bridger National Forest in Wyoming and for the Chippewa people on the White Earth Reservation in Minnesota, which today provide for timber demands, enhanced recreational opportunities and excellent wildlife habitat. Through his efforts wetlands in North Dakota have been protected for waterfowl propagation, a portion of the St. Croix National Scenic River in Minnesota and Wisconsin has been preserved for future generations, and resource protections were enriched as a result of his master planning for five Arizona national parks--Tumacacori National Historical Park, Fort Bowie National Historic Site, Coronado National Memorial, Saguaro National Park and Organ Pipe National Monument.  As Chief of Planning of the National Park Service's Denver Service Center Western Team, he led several planning initiatives to protect Redwood National Park, to expand protection of the watershed and to preserve the remaining ancient Redwood groves. Remnants of the ancient Anazazi culture, which can still be found in Grand Canyon National Park and Lake Meade National Recreation Area, remain protected today because of wilderness plans initiated under his leadership. Those wilderness plans, which were prepared at the direction of Congress, recognized that the areas should be under the protection of the National Park Service and not exposed to multi-use land management.  In 1980 the Alaska National Interest Lands and Conservation Act brought 55 million acres under the auspices of the National Park Service. The Act was carefully crafted to provide for the continued subsistence use and protection of the living culture of the Native peoples and enable the appreciation of these unique lands by future generations of their fellow Americans. Mr. Carlstrom headed the multi-agency task force which prepared the environmental documents and analyzed thousands of public comments that permitted President Jimmy Carter to create National Monuments via Presidential Proclamation as an interim measure pending the ultimate placement by Congress of these millions of acres into National Parks and Preserves.  Mr. Carlstrom's four decades of devotion stand as examples to all of us who preserve the treasures of which our Nation is proud, our vast resources, our varied cultures, our storied history. I am proud to recognize him today for his years of service and thank him for his hard work, care for his fellow human beings, and his many, many accomplishments.                          ____________________
