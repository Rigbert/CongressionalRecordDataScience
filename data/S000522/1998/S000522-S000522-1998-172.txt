Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend for yielding me time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady). While the gentleman from Texas may be one of the most junior members of our Committee on International Relations, he is one of the most significant, and a key participant in our committee's deliberations on this bill and many other policy initiatives. The gentleman has offered many helpful suggestions along the way, and has demonstrated over and over again his commitment to the struggle against religious persecution, and I deeply, deeply, respect him.  The amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) today makes further positive contribution tothe bill, and enhances the bill, as he pointed out, in a variety of ways.  I commend the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady) for his work on behalf of this legislation and his very constructive amendment, and I do urge my colleagues to support it.
