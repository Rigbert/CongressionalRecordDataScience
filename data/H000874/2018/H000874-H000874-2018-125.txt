Speaker, although it was not on this list, I wonder if we might expect a budget resolution to be offered at some point in time in the future.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.  Even though I gave him a bonus colloquy beyond the week in front of us, that does not mean if I don't mention something, that that item would not come forward. So as the Budget Committee works, I will keep the gentleman apprised of where they are and when the timing is for us to bring it to the floor.
