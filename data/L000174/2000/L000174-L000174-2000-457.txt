President, on April 20, 1999, 14 young students and a teacher lost their lives at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO. That was one of a series of deadly incidents of school violence over the last 2 years. The day that happened, the Senate Judiciary Committee was not engaged in working on crime proposals or public safety issues. That day, like today, we were devoting our attention to the symbolism of this proposed amendment to the Constitution, which would weaken the first amendment for the first time in history, so that we might make criminal the burning of the American flag.  Scores of our Nation's children have been killed and wounded over the last 2 years. They haven't been killed or wounded by burning flags. They have been killed and wounded by firearm violence. Our loss has been from school violence that has shaken communities across this country.  Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House have not found time to have the juvenile crime bill conference meet and resolve the differences. So even though we have passed a juvenile crime bill, one that has modest gun control in it, the gun lobby said we can't meet on that. We cannot have meetings on it. We cannot resolve those differences. Instead, we step forward and say to the American people: We will protect your children, we will protect your schools, we will make sure we have a constitutional amendment banning the burning of flags.  Like all Americans, all parents, I abhor the burning of flags. But like American parents, especially those with children in school, I know the danger to those children of gun violence and other criminal activity in this country is far more of a danger than the burning of a flag.  The Republican majority has not moved the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that is needed to provide Federal assistance to victims of Hurricane Floyd, or to help those who need fuel assistance, or to fund our men and women engaged in international peacekeeping efforts in Kosovo. Nor has the Republican majority moved responsibly to help fill the 77 judicial vacancies plaguing the Federal courts around the Nation. Nor has the majority yet moved a budget resolution to meet the April 1 and April 15deadlines of the Budget Act. I recall that 2 years ago no final budget resolution passed the Congress, and I hope that experience of congressional inattention will not be repeated. We need to raise the minimum wage, pass a Patients' Bill of Rights, approve prescription drug benefits, and authorize the FDA to help stem the public health hazard of tobacco products. There is a lot to be done, and very little is being done.  I came to the Senate again last week to urge action on the juvenile crime conference. This Congress has kept the country waiting too long for action on juvenile crime legislation and sensible gun safety laws. We are fast approaching a first-year anniversary of the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, without any response from Congress except for a bill that passed the Senate 3-to-1, a bill that we all praised and took credit for, a bill that, unfortunately, didn't go anywhere. It sat in a closed conference, behind a door that says: Parents of America cannot be admitted.  If we did all our work, if we did something about gun violence, if we did something about our children who are dying in the streets of America, if we did something about school safety and something about juvenile justice, if we passed our budget on time, as the law requires, if we did something on medical privacy, if we did those things, fine, set aside a couple of weeks for symbolic actions. But let's do our work first. Let's do the things that should be done first.  Next month, Americans have to have their tax returns in, by April 15, because it is the law. It is also the law that says we are supposed to get our budget done. But we won't. The Congress of the United States has shown 2 years ago that we have not followed the law.  For some time I have been urging the Senate to rededicate itself to the work of helping parents, teachers, police and others to curb school violence. On May 11 last year, the Republican majority in the Senate allowed us to turn our attention to the important problems of school violence and juvenile crime. Over the ensuing two weeks the Senate worked its way through scores of amendments. The Hatch-Leahy juvenile justice legislation that passed the Senate last May 20, received a strong bipartisan majority of 73 votes. Under the plan put forward by the Republican leader, this juvenile justice legislation had become the vehicle for the anti-violence amendments adopted by the Senate last May.  I urged a prompt conference. When things bogged down, I took the unusual step of coming to the Senate to offer a unanimous consent request to move to conference on the legislation, which eventually provided the blueprint for finally agreeing to conference on July 28.  Unfortunately, the conference was convened for a single afternoon of speeches. Democrats from the House and Senate tried to proceed, to offer motions about how to proceed, and to begin substantive discussion, but we were ruled out of order by the Republican majority.  Since that time I have returned to the Senate a number of times to speak to these important issues and to urge the Republican to reconvene the juvenile crime conference. I have joined with fellow Democrats to request both in writing and on the floor that the majority let us finish our work on the conference and send a good bill to the President. On October 20, 1999, all the House and Senate Democratic conferees sent a letter to Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde calling for an open meeting of the juvenile crime conference. On March 3, 2000, after yet another shocking school shooting involving 6-year-old classmates in Michigan, Representative Conyers and I wrote again to Senator Hatch and Congressman Hyde requesting an immediate meeting of the conference. The response has been resounding silence.  I worry that after a major debate on the floor, one in which we have both Republicans and Democrats bring up amendments and pass some and vote down others, we then let the subject of juvenile justice languish. We have seen press releases, but the families of America have yet to see a bill.  Three weeks ago, I was honored to be invited to a White House summit by the President of the United States. He had three other Members of Congress--the distinguished chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Henry Hyde; the distinguished chairman of our Judiciary Committee, Senator Hatch; and the distinguished ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Conyers. We met in the Oval Office in a rather extraordinary meeting. I have been to many over 25 years, and I do not remember one where the President stayed so engaged for such a long period of time in such a frank and open exchange.  The President concurs with the reconvening of the conference and action by the Congress to send him a comprehensive bill before the 1-year anniversary of the Columbine tragedy. But all of his entreaties have been rebuffed as well. We have been in recess more than we have been in session since that time. Take a couple of days and wrap this up, and send it to the President.  Democrats have been ready for months to reconvene the juvenile crime conference and put together an effective juvenile justice conference report that would include reasonable gun safety provisions. It bothers me that this Senate, under its majority leadership, cannot find the time nor the will to pass balanced, comprehensive juvenile justice legislation.  With respect to juvenile crime, I hope the majority will heed the call of our Nation's law enforcement officers to act now to pass a strong and effective juvenile justice conference report. Ten national law enforcement organizations representing thousands of law enforcement officers have endorsed the Senate-passed gun safety amendment. They support loophole-free firearm laws.  These are the ones who do:  International Association of Chiefs of Police;  International Brotherhood of Police Officers;  Police Executive Research Forum;  Police Foundation;  Major Cities Chiefs;  Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association;  National Sheriffs Association;  National Association of School Resource Officers;  National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives; and  Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association.  Should we not at least listen to the law enforcement people who are asked every day to put their lives on the line to protect all of us, and should we not at least listen to them when they say, Pass this modest bill? But no. We see the gun lobbies run all kinds of ads basically telling the Congress, Don't do it; we will not allow you to do it. The Congress meekly says, Yes, sir; yes, sir; we will let the gun lobby run our schedule--not those of us who are elected to do it.  I was in law enforcement. I spent 8 years in law enforcement. I know law enforcement officers in this country need help in keeping guns out of the hands of people who should not have them.  I am not talking about people who use guns for hunting or for sport, as my neighbors and I do in Vermont, but about criminals and unsupervised children. The thousands of law enforcement officers represented by these organizations are demanding the Congress act now to pass a strong and effective juvenile justice conference. As leader of the Democrats on this side, I am willing to meet on a moment's notice to do that.  Every parent, teacher and student in this country is concerned about school violence over the last two years and worried about when the next shooting may occur. They pray it does not happen at their school or involve their children.  We all recognize that there is no single cause and no single legislative solution that will cure the epidemic of youth violence in our schools or in our streets. But we have an opportunity before us to do our part. We should seize this opportunity to act on balanced, effective juvenile crime legislation, and measures to keep guns out of the hands of children and away from criminals. It is well past the time for Congress to act.  Instead, the Senate will be called upon to devote several more days this week to debating this proposal to amend the Constitution to restrict the First Amendment's fundamental protection of political expression for thefirst time in our nation's history in order to criminalize flag burning as a form of political protest. We can debate that. But can't we take at least as much time to debate things that will actually involve the safety of our children?  I am prepared to debate the merits of the proposed constitutional amendment to restrict political speech. I contributed to an extensive set of minority views in the Committee's report that lay out the flaws in the proponents' arguments and the case for protecting the Constitution and our Bill of Rights. We have debated this before and must do so, again.  I treat proposals to amend the Constitution with utmost seriousness. Our role in the process is a solemn responsibility. But when we have concluded this debate, as we will in the next few days, I hope that the juvenile crime bill conference committee will complete its work. I hope that we will move the emergency supplemental appropriations needed to help our citizens hurt by Hurricane Floyd and by high fuel prices. I hope that we will vote to increase the minimum wage without further delay; I hope that we will enact a real patients' bill of rights, and that we will approve a meaningful prescription drug benefit, and that we will pass the statutory authority now needed by the FDA to regulate tobacco products. I hope that we will vote on the scores of judicial nominations sent to us by the President to fill the 77 vacancies plaguing the federal courts and our system of justice; and I hope that we will make progress on the many other matters that have been sidetracked by the majority.  My friends on the Republican side of the Senate control the schedule. They set the priorities. But I hope they realize that these are priorities of the American people and will allow us to vote on them.  Mr. President, on the proposed constitutional amendment we are debating, I note that the minority views in the committee report extend over 30 pages, yet we are asked to limit the debate on the proposal to 2 hours. Nobody wants to filibuster a proposal. But if we are going to amend the Constitution, especially if we are going to amend the first amendment, and especially if we are going to amend the Bill of Rights for the first time in over 200 years, I think the American people deserve more than a couple of hours of chitchat and quorum calls to discuss what we are going to do.  I look forward to hearing from Senator Feingold, the ranking member of the Constitution Subcommittee. I look forward to hearing from Senator Bob Kerrey, the only Congressional Medal of Honor recipient among us; or Senator Robb, of Virginia, who is a decorated veteran and distinguished Senator; and, of course, the constitutional sage of the Senate, the senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Robert C. Byrd.  The Senate was intended to be a place for thoughtful debate, for the offering of amendments and for votes on amendments. We should not short-change this debate. Let us do justice to the task of considering this constitutional amendment before we are called upon to vote, again.  This afternoon we will first vote on the Flag Protection Act amendment offered by Senators McConnell, Bennett, Dorgan and Conrad with the support of Senators Dodd, Torricelli, Bingaman, Lieberman and Byrd. Having reviewed that proposal, I intend to support it as well. It is a statutory alternative to the proposed constitutional amendment.  Now, let us remember one thing. No matter how Senators vote on the proposed amendment, either for or against it, there is one thing that unites every single Member of this body. We all agree that flag burning is a despicable and reprehensible act. It is usually done to show great disrespect to our country and our institutions and all it stands for. It has to be especially offensive to those who put their lives on the line for this country, whether in the Armed Forces, law enforcement, or elsewhere.  But the ultimate question before us is not whether we agree that flag burning is a despicable and reprehensible act. We all agree that it is. The issue is whether we should amend the Constitution of the United States, with all the risks that entails, and narrow the precious freedoms ensured by the First Amendment for the first time in our history, so that the Federal Government can prosecute the tiny handful of Americans who show contempt for the flag. Such a monumental step is unwarranted and unwise.  Proponents of the constitutional amendment note the views of distinguished American veterans and war heroes who have expressed their love of the flag and support for the amendment. Those who fought and sacrificed for our country deserve our respect and admiration. I remember very much the letters that came back from my uncle in World War II, and other friends and neighbors in subsequent wars.  They know the costs as well as the joys of freedom and democracy. Their sacrifices are lessons for us all in what it means to love and honor our flag and the country and the principles for which our flag stands. On this question of amending our Constitution, some would like to portray the views of veterans as being monolithic, when in fact many outstanding veterans oppose the amendment.  Above all, these veterans believe that they fought for the freedoms and principles that make this country great, not just the symbols of those freedoms. To weaken the nation's freedoms in order to protect a particular symbol would trivialize and minimize their service.  Last year, we were honored to have former Senator John Glenn, my dear friend, who served this nation with special distinction in war and in peace and in the far reaches of space, come back to the Senate to testify before the Judiciary Committee. This is a veteran of both World War II and the Korean conflict.  He told us:       It would be a hollow victory indeed if we preserved the      symbol of our freedoms by chipping away at those fundamental      freedoms themselves. Let the flag fully represent all the      freedoms spelled out in the Bill of Rights, not a partial,      watered-down version that has altered its protections.       The flag is the nation's most powerful and emotional      symbol. It is our most sacred symbol. And it is our most      revered symbol. But it is a symbol. It symbolizes the      freedoms that we have in this country, but it is not the      freedoms themselves. . . .       Those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, who died      following that banner, did not give up their lives for a red,      white and blue piece of cloth. They died because they went      into harm's way, representing this country and because of      their allegiance to the values, the rights and principles      represented by that flag and to the Republic for which it      stands.  These are powerful words from our former colleague, John Glenn, a man we all agree is a true American hero.  Last spring I wrote to General Colin L. Powell, our Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Persian Gulf War, about this proposed constitutional amendment. I thank him for having answered the call and for adding his powerful voice to this debate. He wrote me the following:       We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or      desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when      they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of      their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of      cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which      tolerates such desecration.       If they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else,      that's a prosecutable crime. If it is a flag they own, I      really don't want to amend the Constitution to prosecute      someone for foolishly desecrating their own property. We      should condemn them and pity them instead.       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and      citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful      sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel      the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the      Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment      exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression      applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but      also that which we find outrageous.       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer      a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long      after they have slunk away.  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent to have the full text of General Powell's letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              Gen. Colin L. Powell, USA (Ret),                                     Alexandria, VA, May 18, 1999.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Thank you for your recent letter asking      my views on the proposed flag protection amendment.       I love our flag, our Constitution and our country with a      love that has no bounds. I defended all three for 35 years as      a soldier and was willing to give my life in their defense.       Americans revere their flag as a symbol of the Nation.      Indeed, it is because of that reverence that the amendment is      under consideration. Few countries in the world would think      of amending their Constitution for the purpose of protecting      such a symbol.       We are rightfully outraged when anyone attacks or      desecrates our flag. Few Americans do such things and when      they do they are subject to the rightful condemnation of      their fellow citizens. They may be destroying a piece of      cloth, but they do no damage to our system of freedom which      tolerates such desecration.       If they are destroying a flag that belongs to someone else,      that's a prosecutable crime. If it is a flag they own, I      really don't want to amend the Constitution to prosecute      someone for foolishly desecrating their own property. We      should condemn them and pity them instead.       I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and      citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful      sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel      the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the      Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment      exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression      applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but      also that which we find outrageous.       I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer      a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long      after they have slunk away.       Finally, I shudder to think of the legal morass we will      create trying to implement the body of law that will emerge      from such an amendment.       If I were a Member of Congress, I would not vote for the      proposed amendment and would fully understand and respect the      views of those who would. For or against, we all love our      flag with equal devotion.           Sincerely,                                                  Colin L. Powell.
