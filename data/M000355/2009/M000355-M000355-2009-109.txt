 President, first, I wish to extend a welcome to the President, who is coming to the Capitol today to meet with Democrats on the subject of the health care bill.  So far, they have voted to cut Medicare three times--cuts they previously described as immoral and irresponsible; cuts that made it impossible for the President to keep his pledge that people who like their plans can keep them; cuts that will reduce the quality of home health care; cuts that will reduce benefits for nearly 11 million American seniors on Medicare Advantage; cuts that raid Medicare instead of fixing it; and cuts the American people vehemently oppose.  Democrats are in a tough situation on this bill.
