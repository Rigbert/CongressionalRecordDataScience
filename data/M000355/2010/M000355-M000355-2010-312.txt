 REID. Yes.  Mr. McCONNELL. Even though allowing that, as the majority leader suggested, is certainly optional, it has been the custom of both sides, when we have been in these vote-arama situations in the past, to allow the time oneach side, and I appreciate the willingness of the majority leader to do that.
