Speaker, I rise simply to say that the objectives of this motion to recommit I think are worthwhile and good, but I want to make the record clear. The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and I have had a colloquy on section 3 of the National Voter Registration Act. It is the committee's view that nothing in this bill changes or diminishes in any way any provision, including provisional voting, of the National Voter Registration Act. In fact, I made it a condition to my participation in the bipartisan bill that that be the case.  In addition to that understanding with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and all of us on the committee and the staff, we have contacted the Attorney General's Office and I would include at this point in time in the Record a letter that was received by the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and myself on December 10, 2001 from the Assistant Attorney General.                                            Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                Washington, DC, December 10, 2001.     Hon. Steny Hoyer,     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on House Administration,          House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Hoyer: This letter responds to your letter      of November 29, 2001 regarding the effect of H.R. 3295. the      ``Help America Vote Act,'' upon the National Voter      Registration Act of 1993 (``NVRA'').       Although several provisions in the bill affect the list      maintenance provisions in section 8 of the NVRA, it is      evident that the bill is not designed to modify the NVRA and,      in fact, it does not alter or undermine the NVRA's      requirements. Section 903 of the bill itself specifically      provides that nothing in H.R. 3295 ``shall supercede,      restrict or limit the application of . . . NVRA,'' that      nothing in the bill ``authorizes or requires any conduct      which is prohibited by the NVRA,'' and that nothing in the      bill ``may be construed to affect the application of the . .      . NVRA . . . to any State'' (except as specifically provided      in the bill). These provisions would guide the Department's      enforcement efforts if the bill becomes law.       Various parts of the bill reference the NVRA and appear      designed to clarify and strengthen enforcement of the NVRA's      list maintenance provisions. Section 502(2) would require all      50 States and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam,      American Samoa, and the United States Virgin Islands to adopt      a system of list maintenance ensuring that voter registration      lists are accurate and updated regularly, and that removes      registrants who are ineligible to vote. Under this system,      ``consistent with the [NVRA],'' registrants who have not      voted in 2 or more consecutive Federal general elections and      who have not responded to a notice would be required to be      removed from the list of eligible voters, except that no      registrant could be removed solely by reason of failure to      vote. This system also would have to have safeguards to      ensure that eligible voters were not removed in error.      Section 501(a)-(b) would require all States to      enact legislation to adopt such a list maintenance system,      but properly would leave States discretion as to the      specific methods of implementing such a system.       Secton 902(a) entitled ``Clarification of ability of      election officials to remove registrants . . . on grounds of      change of residence,'' would amend the NVRA's existing      requirement (at 42 U.S.C. 1973gg-6(b)(2)) that any general      program not result in removal of voters' names due to their      ``failure to vote.'' However, the amendment in section 902(a)      merely would clarify that nothing in section 19733gg-6(b)(2)      was intended to prohibit a State from using the procedures      already in sections 1973gg-6(c)-(d) to remove the names of      voters who have not voted or have not appeared to vote in two      or more consecutive Federal general elections and who have      not notified the registrar, or responded to a notice sent by      the registrar, that they intend to remain registered in the      jurisdiction. As an amendment to the NVRA, this provision      would apply only in the 45 jurisdictions covered by the NVRA      (44 States and the District of Columbia).       In view of the bill's several affirmations that removal of      names from voter rolls should be carried out in a manner      consistent with the NVRA and in view of the general      affirmations in section 903 that the bill will not restrict      or limit the NVRA, the bill's list maintenance provisions can      and should be read consistently with the NVRA's existing list      maintenance procedures, which basically are: section 1973gg-     6(c) suggests the Postal Service National Change of Address      program as one example of a means of identifying voters who      have become ineligible because they have moved outside the      jurisdiction. Section 1973gg-6(d) them provides a      confirmation process that States must follow before removing      voters identified as potentially ineligible due to having      moved. As above, voters may be removed if: (1) they do not      respond to the registrar's notice and do not vote or appear      to vote in two Federal general elections; or (2) they confirm      in writing that they have moved outside the jurisdiction.       Many States, following guidance from the Federal Election      Commission, legislatively adopted or legislatively revised      list maintenance provisions after passage of the NVRA. See,      e.g., Ak. Stat. 15.07.130; Fl. Stat. 98.065, 98.075, 98.093;      Ga. Stat. 21-2-231 to 21-2-235; Va. Stat. 24.2-427 to 24.2-     428.2. To the extent that the 45 jurisdictions covered by the      NVRA have adopted list maintenance programs consistent with      42 U.S.C.. 1973gg-6, we conclude that the new clarifying      provisions of section 902(a) of the bill would not require      those States to amend their programs. Likewise, State      legislation consistent with the NVRA probably would meet the      new, less specific, minimum standards for list maintenance      required in section 502(2) of H.R. 3295. If this      interpretation differs with that of the drafters of the bill,      some clarification may be warranted.       Thank you for the opportunity to present our views. Please      do not hesitate to call upon us if we may be of additional      assistance. The Office of Management and Budget has advised      us that from the perspective of the Administration's program,      there is no objection to submission of this letter.           Sincerely,                                                 Daniel J. Bryant,                                       Assistant Attorney General.       Identical letter sent to the Honorable Bob Ney, Chairman.
