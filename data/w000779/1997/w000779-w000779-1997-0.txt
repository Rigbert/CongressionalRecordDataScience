President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, Senators Kennedy and Specter, in introducing a bill that will make it clear that this country will no more tolerate violence directed at gays, women, or people with disabilities. This legislation will end the bizarre double standard which says that hate crimes motivated by one sort of prejudice are a Federal crime, while those motivated by other biases are not. It will assure that every American who becomes a victim of a hate crime has equal standing under Federal law, because hatred and violence are always wrong.  This bipartisan bill is based on a common conviction that this country still has work to do in rooting out hatred, prejudice and the violence they generate. Hate crimes--the threat or use of force to injure, intimidate or interfere with another person solely because of the person's race, color, religion or national origin--cannot be tolerated in our society. That point has already been enshrined in law and passage of the Hate Crimes Statistics Reporting Act in 1990, followed by the Hate Crimes Penalty Enhancement Act in 1993 and the 1996 resolution condemning church burnings.  Our bill simply seeks to offer the same protection to victims of gay bashing, woman beating and crimes against people with disabilities that has already been offered to victims of bias crimes based on racial and ethnic discrimination.  Today, the perpetrator who hurls a brick at someone because he is Asian-American can be prosecuted under Federal law. The one who attacks gay men to ``teach them a lesson'' cannot. The perpetrator who burns a black church or defaces a synagogue can be prosecuted under Federal law. The one who targets people in wheelchairs or blind people cannot. This legislation would erase that double standard from the books. Hate crimes are all the same, and they are never acceptable.  I urge my colleagues to join us in moving forward with this important legislation when we return here next year.                                 ______                                       By
