President, first I express my appreciation to the very able managers of this legislation, Senator Campbell and Senator Kohl, for their willingness to accept the amendment which has been proposed by myself, Senator Shelby and Senator Grassley.  Let me just briefly explain the amendment and its purpose.  This amendment would prohibit the inspector general of the Department of Treasury from spending any money on consulting contracts, and it would make a corresponding reduction in the inspector general's budget by cutting it by $1 million.  Let me first make clear that this amendment is not intended to affect in any way any audit, inspection, investigation or law enforcement function of the Inspector General's Office.
