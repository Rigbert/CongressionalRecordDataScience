Speaker, I rise today in tribute to a man whose life embodied the living Gospel, the Reverend Frank Musgrave. Reverend Musgrave, of Toledo, Ohio, passed from this life on Tuesday, September 10, 2002. A personal friend, Reverend Musgrave was a true servant and legendary figure of ministry and service whose love extended to our community as well as his church.  A Baltimore native, Frank Musgrave served four years in the Army Air Corps, then went on to pursue his degree in early childhood education. He met his wife Jane while both were students at Johns Hopkins University. Reverend Musgrave attended the Episcopal Theological School in Cambridge, Massachusetts and was ordained in 1952. His first assignment was St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Toledo, where he remained until his 1991 retirement. Even after retiring, he continued ministry on a part-time basis in churches in Fostoria and Monroeville, Ohio and later at St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Toledo. He served the Episcopal diocese as well, as youth chaplain and examining chaplain for new clergy.  Fervently ecumenical, Reverend Musgrave served on the Toledo Ministerial Association and the Toledo Area Council of Churches as president and past president of the organizations. An ``outstanding ecumenist who was ahead of his time'' according to one associate, Reverend Musgrave would say, ``. . . if the good Lord came down and put us all in a bag, shook it up, and rolled us out, we wouldn't know who we were anyway.'' He was very much a leader in the early years of the ecumenical movement, and remained a visionary for ecumenism. He is credited with starting Toledo's ecumenical Feed Your Neighbor Program, a comprehensive network of area churches providing groceries for those of our own community who do not have enough to eat.  A real labor minister, Reverend Musgrave was long a member of the Toledo Labor Management Citizen's Committee, and served as the organization's chair from 1975 to 1993. His voice of reason, coupled with tenaciousness and passion marked his tenure, as Reverend Musgrave guided the Committee into the cooperative entity which has become its hallmark.  Reverend Musgrave lived out Christ's teachings by zealously pursuing social justice and never backing down on his principles. His heart was with those among us most vulnerable, and he never lost sight that true Christian ministry served all people. Our community has been privileged to call him a true and enduring friend.  As he joins our Creator, he leaves to this earth his wife Jane and their children Amy and Jane, his brother and grandchildren. May they find comfort in the memory of this gifted and wonderful priest, family man and friend, committed activist and Christian. May he guide them and us from above on our journey forward.                          ____________________
