 President, I would like to take a moment to recognize a very special advocate and former Governor of my home State of Washington who is celebrating his 100th birthday on Thursday.  Albert D. Rosellini served two terms as Governor of Washington State, first being elected in 1956. Before he was elected Governor, he served as the deputy prosecutor of King County and 18 consecutive years in the State senate.  Throughout his career, Governor Rosellini has been a dedicated public servant and an inspiration to generations of public servants. I know that Governor Rosellini's knowledge, drive and passion for service has made my home state a better place to live and work. It is an honor to have had the opportunity to earn the support and advice of such an extraordinary figure in my State's history.  In the State senate, Albert was a champion for labor, small business and equality, introducing an unfair practice bill to ensure small businesses receive decent prices, a fair employment practices bill, and an equal wage bill for women.  He strived to improve the quality of education in Washington State by supporting measures to improve retirement programs and raise salaries for teachers. He also promoted improvements to schools for the mentally disabled, deaf and blind. As a sponsor of the Youth Protection Act, Albert promoted progressive correctional programs for delinquents and revitalized penal institutions and juvenile institutions that are still in use today.  In 1951, he introduced a bill that created a teaching hospital on the campus of the University of Washington, continuing his goal to improve education and medical facilities across the State. That hospital is the basis of the acclaimed medical center we have there today.  As Governor, Albert worked to diversify Washington State's industry by creating the Department of Commerce and Economic Development which brought international trade to Washington. This department helped launch the high tech industry in this area and developed Overlake Park in Bellevue where Microsoft and other high tech companies are currently established.  The leadership abilities displayed by Governor Rosellini were quickly noticed by his colleagues and he was elected chairman of the National Governors Association during his second term as Governor.  Since leaving office, Governor Rosellini has continued his commitment to better Washington State. In 1979 he helped our State's athletes attend and compete on the world's stageas the chairman of the United States Olympic Committee for Washington State. Additionally, as a result of the great improvements made to Washington's transportation system while Governor, he was made a member of the Washington State Transportation Committee for 11 years, acting as chairman for the last 2.  I greatly respect the Governor for his unmatched dedication to public service and the State of Washington and thank him for making such a critical difference in the history of my State.                          ____________________
