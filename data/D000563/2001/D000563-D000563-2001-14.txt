President, today I would like to discuss the financial burden faced by many of the men and women who serve in the military Reserves or National Guard and who are forced to take unpaid leave from their jobs when called to active duty. While these individuals receive pay for the time they are on active duty, it is often significantly less than what they receive in their normal jobs. It is unfair to ask the men and women who have volunteered to serve their country, often in dangerous situation, to also face a financial strain on their families.  A number of employers have wisely acted to remedy this hardship by establishing a financial compensation plan for their employees in the Reserves or National Guard. In response to the recent terrorist attacks of September 11, the Netherlands-based ABN AMRO Bank N.V., one of the world's largest banks, has set up a special pay differential program to provide their employees in the Reserves and National Guard compensation equaling the income they would normally have to forfeit when called to active duty. LaSalle Bank, a subsidiary of ABN AMRO in Chicago, has already seen this program help 12 reservists in its ranks. The spokesperson for LaSalle described the program as something the company wanted to do ``to be supportive of the country's efforts''.  Let us take similar action in Washington and set an example for employers throughout the country. Today, I am introducing with my colleague from Maryland Senator Barbara Mikulski, the Reservist Pay Security Act of 2001, legislation that will help alleviate the financial problems faced by many Federal employees who serve in the Reserves and must take time off from their jobs when called to active duty. This bill would allow these employees to maintain their normal salary when called to active service by requiring Federal agencies to make up the difference between their military pay and what they would have earned on their Federal job.  As the symbol of American values and ideals, the Federal Government should give these special employees of our government more than just words of support. We should not encourage Americans to protect their country and then punish those who enlist in the armed forces by taking away a large segment of the salary. We must provide our reservist employees with financial support so that they can leave their civilian lives to serve in the military without worrying about the financial well-being of their families.                                 ______                                       By
