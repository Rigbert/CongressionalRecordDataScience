 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.  I am asking that these statements be printed in the Congressional Record, as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.            Regarding The Media in Public Life, May 7, 2001       APRIL LEICHTNAM: ``There are two ways to slide through      life; to believe everything or doubt everything. Both ways      save us from     thinking.'' Alfred Korzybski. The media plays an important      role in the lives of all human beings. There are numerous      different forms of media. Some of these forms are printouts      such as newspapers, books, fliers, billboards, clothing,      signs and magazines. Along with print media, there is      nonprint media, such as television, radio, movies, cassette      tapes, CDs, videotapes, Internet and other electronic modes      of communication. When the media constructs the message they      would like to convey, they have two things in mind. They have      a purpose, and they design them to evoke a certain response      from their audience.       LAURA DICK: The main purpose of the media is to inform      people of the things around them, to persuade them into doing      and buying things, to entertain them by showing them false      images, and to sell products by not always telling what is      true. Also, when constructing ads, the advertisers look to      make the ad appealing to those who are seeing it. They use      many different types of techniques. Some of these techniques      include humor, comparisons, economics, social prestige,      emotional appeal, appeal to fears and insecurities,      statistics and studies, exotic appeals, a sense of belonging,      a sense of mastery, a desire to be noticed, consumer      compliments, the use of parental figures, and also ``weasel''      words. many of these techniques are designed to target a      certain audience. Also, a lot of these claims on TV make ads      meaningless. for example, an ad will say, ``virtually      spotless,'' instead of just ``spotless,'' which does not mean      the dishes will be totally spotless, but it makes one think      they will be. Some other common advertising techniques      include bandwagon, attraction, happy families, something-for-     nothing, testimonials, ``all natural,'' nostalgia, and      patriotism. We ask have a statistic that shows the influence      on media on the lives of many people today. For example:       APRIL LEICHTNAM: During one year, a child will see      approximately 3,000 drinking episodes on television. The      average American child will view approximately 75,000 beer      ads by the age of 18. Alcohol advertising accounts for 3 to 5      percent of total revenue on TV, and 12 percent on radio.      Prime time and soap operas expose teenagers to sexual scenes      every nine minutes. Fewer than 6 percent of males and 2      percent of females on TV are obese, yet 25 to 45 percent of      the American population is overweight, and two major health      problems among teens are anorexia and bulimia. The average      American watches 1,000 hours of television every year. In      1991, three out of four households owned a VCR. The average      American sees about 32,000 commercials every year. In 1998, a      60-second commercial cost $2,600,000 during the Super Bowl.      The average American household owns two to three televisions.      The average child views 10,000 murders, raps and aggravated      assaults in one year. 20 to 28 hours per week are spent      viewing television. This is the only activity we spend more      time doing besides sleeping. Four out of five Americans      believe violence on TV causes real violence. Beer commercials      air while drinking portrayal occurs five times per hour.      Average high school students spend two to three hours a day      watching TV on school days, and eight hours a day on      weekends. 90 million households own at least one TV set. 63      percent have two or more sets. By the first grade, the      average child has seen 5,000 hours of TV. There are more      people in the world who have televisions than indoor      plumbing. In promoting things that are not reality, the media      promotes such complex problems as drug addiction, crime, teen      pregnancy, promiscuous sex, materialism, violence, racism,      eating disorders, tobacco and alcohol consumption by teens      and younger children, sexual and physical abuse, profanity,      voter apathy, and pornography. Therefore, we conclude that      media literacy classes should be offered in every high school      in the state of Vermont.                                  ____                                                   Regarding Public Schools, May 7, 2001       PATTY RALSTON: We have a video.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: You have a video?       PATTY RALSTON: Yes.       (Videotape played.)       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Thank you very much for that excellent      video. Who wants to begin verbal presentation now? You don't      think you are going to get away with just the video, do you?      Just because you are TV stars does not exempt you from      discussing it. Your name again?       SELENIA COGHLAN: Selenia Coghlan. Like I said on the video,      I just feel that like--I'm not in public school right now,      but I go to the Learning Edge. I'm getting my adult diploma.      But when I was in the middle school or public schools, I feel      that, if you are on a different level than the other kids,      like if you can't read as well or you can't do math as well,      they treat you a lot differently. And, basically, I feel it      is the teachers' fault, because they're there to educate you      and they should be the ones to teach you, and when you get      your diploma, it shouldn't be just because you got passed      along. You should know something.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Let me back you up here. I don't know      that everybody knows. Why don't you guys say a few words      about the Lund Home? How is the Lund Home different from      other schools?       SELENIA COGHLAN: The Lund Home is for young parenting and      pregnant teens. And is it a small class, where all females      that are pregnant or parenting can get their diploma or GED.      And they take math, history, everything that public schools      take, and they also take parenting skills classes and like      things that you need to know about parenting, or whatever. If      you don't want to parent, what you could do, or if you want      to parent, what you could to.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Thank you. Next?       PATTY SALVAS: I never went to public schools in Vermont,      but I do know that a lot of the public schools aren't very      friendly to teen moms, and for like the people on welfare,      they don't give them enough initiative. So they need to be      more sympathetic towards them.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Okay.       PATTY RALSTON: People shouldn't really, like just cause we      had kids young and everything too, doesn't mean like--you      know what I mean? Because I will make it, and whether anybody      says I won't, I will.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: How many students are there at Lund?       PATTY RALSTON: We go to the Learning Edge. It is a      different program, but there is like seven, eight--ten right      now. Ten right now.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: And do you think the Learning Edge      does things for young parenting moms that a public school      often does not do?       PATTY RALSTON: Yes. They're helpful. And they're always      there if you need like support or anything. They are there.      You know they're there.       SELENIA COGHLAN: The other students that were talking      before us, they said something, the other side--what is it      called?       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: Alternative.       SELENIA COGHLAN: Alternative schools. I think those are      really great for kids. Some people do have problems maybe,      with family, and that is why the are there, but some kids      learn slower than other kids. Like me, I have to have      somebody explain what I need, you know, like how to do it. Or      if I just have a teacher in front of me saying, this, and      there you go, I won't know anything, and then I won't do it.       CONGRESSMAN SANDERS: So you think different types of kids      respond to different--       SELENIA COGHLAN: Everybody is different. I feel like      everybody is different and everybody learns differently.      There are kids that can learn things a lot quicker, and lots      of people that can't. And I feel it is good to have      alternatives for pregnant and parenting teens, and just for      other kids that need the extra help, even if they are not      pregnant or parenting.                               ____________________
