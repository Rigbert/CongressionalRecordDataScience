 President, today I pay tribute to Bobby Hayes, who has dedicated over 24 years of his life to public service. In October of this year, when Bobby steps down as mayor of the city of Pelham, AL, he will leave behind a legacy of leadership and service to his community.  For 24 years, Bobby has served as the mayor of Pelham. Over those years, Bobby has overseen many changes to the city. As a retired field commander of the tactical operations unit of the Birmingham Police Department, it was critical to Bobby that he provide local law enforcement with the tools needed to do their jobs effectively. Bobby successfully expanded the Pelham Police Department, adding a traffic unit, tactical operation unit, school resource officers and installing computers in all patrol cars.  It was also under his direction that Pelham erected four new fire stations and a new public safety building to house the police department and the municipal court. During his tenure, Mayor Hayes also was instrumental in the building of the Pelham Civic Complex and Pelham Senior Center. Bobby also ensured that the Pelham sewer system and new sewer plant were completed and increased the city's water supply and storage facilities.  A strong supporter of education and academics, Bobby oversaw the expansion and renovation of the Pelham Public Library. Since then, it has become one of only four public libraries in the State the Alabama Library Association recognized for excellence in library service. In 2005, the library became the recipient of prestigious Blue Ribbon Library status.  While many people think that the service Bobby contributes each day as mayor of Pelham is enough, he thinks otherwise. An avid leader, Bobby has been involved in many State committees and one national committee. In 2004, he was elected vice-president of the Alabama League of Municipalities and in 2005 he rose to serve as president. Bobby also represents the mayors of the 6th Congressional District to the State of Alabama Housing Finance Authority.  Additionally, Bobby has held memberships with organizations such as the Alabama League Committee on State and Federal Legislation, National League of Cities Public Safety and Crime Prevention Policy Committee, the Greater Shelby County Chamber of Commerce, and the Alabama City/County Management Association.  Bobby is married to Judith Lance Hayes. Together, they have three children and nine grandchildren.  As Bobby embarks on another phase in his life, he will be remembered for his dedication and many contributions to the city of Pelham's ongoing prosperity and advancement. I wish him much luck in his future endeavors, and I ask this entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the life and career of my good friend Bobby Hayes.                          ____________________
