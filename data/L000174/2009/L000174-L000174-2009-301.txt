I am pleased the Senate will take this action at the start of National Police Week and I thank all Senators for their strong support. I thank Senator Sessions, as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, for joining me in the introduction of this resolution.  This week we will reflect on the extraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by the men and women of our police forces. We do not thank them enough. And as thousands of law enforcement officers arrive in Washington this week to pay tribute to those whose lives were lost in the line of duty, I hope they all know that the Senate stands with them and honors their service and their sacrifice. We welcome these men and women and their families and friends to the Nation's Capital.  This week, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing to get the perspective from the field as to how funds provided through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act have been assisting with law enforcement efforts at the State and local level. I look forward to hearing from the Department of Justice and law enforcement officials on Congress and the administration's efforts to assist law enforcement across the country. Along with our respect, America's law enforcement officers deserve Congress's strong support.  Once again, I am proud that the Senate will unanimously approve this resolution and formally recognize National Police Week and National Peace Officers Memorial Day.
