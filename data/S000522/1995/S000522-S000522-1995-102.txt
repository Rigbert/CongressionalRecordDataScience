Mr. Chairman, just let me remind Members that Dr. Sadik and UNFPA has spent over $150 million. They have people and personnel on the ground. As part of this terrible program they have said, and I quote, ``China has every reason to feel proud of and pleased with its remarkable achievements made in its family planning policy and control of its population growth over the past 10 years. Now the country could offer its experiences and special experts to help other countries.''  Just what we need, a world of one child per couple where forced abortion and forced sterilization is the rule rather than the exception.  Mr. Chairman, let me also point out that the amendment contains a provision that would essentially reinstate what was known as the Mexico City policy, and that, too, was rescinded by President Clinton in 1993. This policy, and the amendment, would prevent foreign aid from going to nongovernmental organizations unless the organizations certify that it does not and will not during the term for which funds are made available perform abortions as a method of family planning or undermine the laws of other countries with respect to abortion. It clarifies that this does not apply to the treatment of injuries or illnesses caused by legal or illegal abortions or to assistance provided directly to governments. Moreover, the amendment contains a limited exception for attempting to establish universally recognized standards such as opposing forced abortion.  Mr. Chairman, this policy worked for almost a decade, it worked well for the American taxpayer, for unborn children, and for responsible family planning organizations. Most recipients of U.S. aid during the two previous administrations accepted the policy and said, ``We will, indeed drive that wall between abortion and family planning and just do family planning and not take the lives of innocent, unborn children by way of abortion.''                              {time}  1600  Mr. Chairman, I hope Members will accept this amendment. They did so just about a month ago. I hope when Mrs. Meyers offers the amendment on behalf of the abortion rights people, that that will be defeated by this body. I suspect we will get to that momentarily.
