President, Chris Bohjalian is one of the treasures of Vermont, as well as being a gifted writer. We Vermonters are fortunate to be able to read his weekly column. They almost always deal with some aspect of life in the State he and I share.  Marcelle and I were especially touched by his column on Christmas Day about Pastor David Wood, of the United Church of Lincoln, VT.  So many of us go to church on Christmas Day, shake hands with those officiating at the service and thank them for what they have done, and then go home to be with our families. What Chris has done is talk about the Herculean tasks of Pastor David Wood. It reminds us that those who give us spiritual guidance and consolation do far more than what we see on holidays and holy days. I would ask unanimous consent that Chris Bohjalian's column about the extraordinary David Wood be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                    [From the Burlington Free Press]        Idyll Banter: Burning the Christmas Candle at Both Ends                          (By Chris Bohjalian)       Look, I know Santa just pulled an all-nighter, flew through      serious turbulence over Iceland, and had to put up with--yet      again--Prancer's ``attitude'' that no one has yet to write a      song about him. (You live on nothing but lichen between      Thanksgiving and Christmas, and watch what happens to your      temper.) But my great friend and the pastor of the United      Church of Lincoln, David Wood, just performed four church      services in 16 hours.       Yup. Four in 16. This is what happens when Christmas falls      on a Sunday.       ``From a spiritual point of view, I love it when Christmas      comes on a Sunday. From a practical point of view, it's      terrifying,'' David told me.       Specifically, last night there were three services at the      church here in Lincoln. There was a 7 p.m. pageant for      families--and this year the pageant was mighty impressive,      with St. Nicholas himself sharing the story of the Nativity.      Then there was an 8:30 p.m. service that was more      traditional, just as joyous, but at least marginally less      raucous. Finally, at 11:30 p.m., there was the quiet,      contemplative, communal service that ended shortly after      midnight--on Christmas Day. And while the church's youth      pastor, Todd Goodyear, did the heaviest lifting at that very      first service, David was still plenty involved.       In any case, after three services in five hours last night,      David finally collapsed into bed about quarter to 1 on      Christmas morning . . . and was back in the sanctuary today,      preaching, 10 hours later.       That workload might not daunt Santa, but it would most      mortals.       It has always seemed to me that the majority of priests and      ministers and rabbis and imams work incredibly hard.      Certainly David does. To wit: I will never forget when my      wife was in labor with our daughter a little over 18 years      ago. When Grace arrived--so did David. The labor was 22      hours, but still he was there within 40 minutes of Grace's      arrival. Two months ago, my wife had six hours of kidney      surgery. I had told David about it the day before. Sure      enough, there he was the next day at the hospital. And it's      not like my wife gets preferential treatment. (Given the      number of Humane Society shelter cats she has tried to foist      on David's family, he should be giving her a very wide      berth.) He is always comforting someone or some family in      hospitals in two counties. And then there are the funerals.      And the christenings. And the baptisms. And the marriages.      And the meetings. And the counseling. And the Yankees. (We      all have our flaws.) David has been the pastor here in      Lincoln since 1979, so this is not the first time that      Christmas has fallen on a Sunday on his watch. He knows what      to expect: ``Everything speeds up. Nothing slows down.''      Consequently, he had his sermons done weeks ahead of time. He      had a plan in place to get the props from the pageant removed     from the sanctuary in time for the 8:30 service. And, once      again, he made sure that all six church fire extinguishers      were distributed discretely to volunteer firefighters before      that first Christmas Eve service, since it would end with the      congregation--including the children--raising and lowering      lit candles while we all sang ``Silent Night.''       But despite the borderline bedlam that can mark this time      of the year for us all, he tries not to lose sight of the      blessings that come with that chaos. ``What is most special      for me every Sunday, but even more as we approach Christmas      and Easter, is the realization that I get to speak the good      news to people. Christian faith isn't about rules and      regulations, it is about our relationship with a God who      loves us enough to choose to be with us.''       Indeed. So, while I remain impressed as heck with what      Santa Claus and his reindeer just pulled off, I am mighty      grateful as well for the work of David Wood and his peers.       Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah. Peace.                          ____________________
