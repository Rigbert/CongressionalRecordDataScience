I'm appreciative of the gentleman's observation.  I understand as well, I want to acknowledge that his district was hard hit, not only by the earthquake, but by Irene and, I presume, by the rains as well that have compounded that issue.  In any event, I appreciate his willingness to ensure that we do, in fact, get a supplemental that will meet the needs, the immediate needs of those people throughout certainly the Atlantic coast, but in other parts of the country as well. I appreciate and will look forward to working with him on that objective, as I will look forward to working with him on realizing the early passage of a jobs bill which will, in fact, get Americans back to work and get our economy growing, as is essential.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
