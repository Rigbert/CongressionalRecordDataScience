Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, next year the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairswill spend over $40 billion combined on health care for current or former military personnel and their families. Despite this enormous sum, despite the fact that this year under the leadership of the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle), the discretionary spending, the health care spending will increase just for VA alone by $2.8 billion, there is still not enough to meet the growing demand.  The bipartisan amendment that I offer today on behalf of myself, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Stump), the gentleman from New York (Mr. McHugh), the gentleman from Kansas (Mr. Moran), and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), is designed to provide additional resources to both health care systems by providing sharing agreements between the Department of Defense and the VA.  Mr. Chairman, while statutory authority to allow resource sharing has existed for more than 20 years, as a matter of fact, the legislation was enacted during my first term 21 years ago, the latest figures tell us that the level of sharing between the VA and the DOD remains extremely low, almost a joke, accounting for less than 1 percent of their combined health care budgets.  The Federal Government can and must do more to increase resource sharing whenever and wherever feasible. Our amendment accomplishes that by providing additional incentives and putting additional pressure on both the Department of Defense and the VA to move forward with common-sense, practical steps to increase the level of resource sharing between these two massive health care systems.  Under our amendment, the VA and DOD would establish at least 5 health care resource sharing projects at locations where both have significant medical facilities. These projects would, to the extent feasible, adopt a new management system to look at ways to eliminate differences between the budget, health care provider assignment, and medical inpatient information systems.                              {time}  0015  The amendment would also establish a permanent joint committee in the Departments of Defense and VA to provide stronger strategic direction and oversight of sharing initiatives and would authorize $30 million over each of the next 3 years to reward sharing innovations.  Mr. Chairman, let me be very clear. This amendment will not in any way compromise the quality or variety of care available to military veterans, military personnel or their families, or the veterans as well. It will expand health care services, because any savings that are achieved will be reinvested locally so that those benefits will accrue at the local level.  Mr. Chairman, I do have a much longer statement, but let me just finally say that this is backed by the Paralyzed Veterans of America, the VFW, American Legion, and the DAV.  Mr. Chairman, I hope the Members will support the amendment, and I herewith submit for the Record letters of support for this amendment from the organizations I referred to earlier:                                          The American Legion,                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 2002.     Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, House of          Representatives, Cannon House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Smith: On behalf of the 2.8 million members      of The American Legion, I would like to express our full      support for the Department of Defense (DoD)--Department of      Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Resources Sharing and      Performance Improvement Act of 2002. The initiatives outlined      in this bill would improve health care access for veterans      and DoD beneficiaries by authorizing the sharing of health      resources between DoD medical treatment facilities and VA      health care facilities.       The American Legion recognizes the benefits from current      sharing agreements between DoD and VA health care facilities      and the potential gains from additional efforts. Clearly,      there are multiple venues for sharing agreements that will      augment services, build on the respective strengths of the      participants and improve overall health care for all DoD and      VA beneficiaries.       The American Legion has long supported the goal of      improving the quality and access of health care through the      sharing and coordination of VA-DoD health care resources.      This bill is a solid first step toward achieving that goal.       Once again, The American Legion fully supports the DoD-VA      Health Resources Sharing and Performance Improvement Act of      2002. The American Legion appreciates your continued      leadership in addressing the issues that are important to      veterans, members of the Armed Forces, and their families.           Sincerely,                                               Steve A. Robertson,     Director, National Legislative Commission.                                  ____                                Paralyzed Veterans of America,                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2002.     Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     Chairman, House Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Cannon House          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the members of Paralyzed      Veterans of America (PVA) I want to express our support for      your amendment to H.R. 4546, the Bob Stump National Defense      Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003. The amendment calls      for increased direction and incentives to improve sharing of      health care resources and services between the Department of      Veterans Affairs (VA) and Department of Defense (DoD) health      care systems.       PVA strongly believes the two departments have much to      share in the provision of health care services that can be of      mutual benefit to both patient populations. Unfortunately,      existing statutory sharing authority has failed to provide      the appropriate atmosphere, direction, and incentives to      encourage VA and DoD to maximize their cooperation potential.      This amendment seeks to correct that shortcoming.       Both departments have distinct patient population and      missions. Recognizing that fact, we applaud language in the      amendment that stipulates within the gamut of sharing      opportunities, both large and small, such activities will not      affect the ability of the VA to protect one of its primary      missions--the maintenance of its capacity to provide such      specialized services as spinal cord injury care for severely      disabled veterans. We believe there are many areas where      sharing health care resources can improve care and reduce      costs in both systems.       Thank you for your continuing care and concern for our      nation's veterans.           Sincerely,                                                Richard B. Fuller,     National Legislative Director.                                  ____                                    Disabled American Veterans                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2002.     Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     Chairman, House Veterans Affairs Committee, Cannon House          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Smith: The Disabled American Veterans (DAV)      appreciates the introduction of your amendment to H.R. 4546,      the national Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003.       The Department of Defense (DoD)-Department of Veterans      Affairs (VA) Health Resources Sharing and Performance      Improvement Act of 2002 would, in part, require sharing and      coordination of VA/DoD health care resources and authorize      initiatives to improve access to health care services      provided to beneficiaries of both systems. It would also      authorize a demonstration project to identify the feasibility      and benefits or disadvantages of coordinated management of      health care resources of both departments.       We agree that scarce Federal health resources should be      used effectively and efficiently in order to enhance access      to high quality health care services for active      servicemembers, veterans, retirees, and family members of      active or retired servicemembers as provided by law.      Certainly we have a compelling moral duty to honor our      pledges to them, and a responsibility to see that resources      are used wisely to achieve this goal. This amendment seeks to      ensure that both departments take full advantage of the      opportunities authorized by law to provide improved health      care for all beneficiaries. We are pleased that language in      the amendment maintains the integrity of the special      disabilities programs in accordance with section 1706(b) of      title 38, United States Code.       We agree that DoD and VA should commit their respective      departments to exploring new ways for significantly improving      health resources sharing and to building organizational      cultures supportive of health resources sharing. This      provisions gives strong incentives for increased      collaboration between the respective departments and is an      initial step forward to achieving this goal.       We sincerely thank you for your introduction of this      amendment and continued support to improve health care      services for our Nation's veterans.           Sincerely,                                               Joseph A. Violante,     National Legislative Director                                  ____                                          Veterans of Foreign Wars                                         of the United States,                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2002.     Hon. Christopher H. Smith,     Chairman, House Veterans' Affairs Committee, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Smith: On behalf of the 2.7 million members      of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States (VFW)      and our Ladies Auxiliary, I am pleased to offer our strong      support for the amendment you are to offer to H.R. 4546, the      FY 2003 National Defense Authorization Act. This bold and      far-reaching legislative initiative will promote health      resource sharing between the Department of Veterans Affairs      (VA) and the Department of Defense (DOD). We strongly believe      that improved VA-DOD health resource sharing will greatly      benefit our veterans, our     active duty military and our military retirees.       Despite the repeated attempts of Congress to increase      sharing arrangements, very little has actually taken place.      The 1999 Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and      Veterans Transition Assistance found that VA and DOD shared      only $62 million out of a $32 billion healthcare budget.      These two agencies have had the authority to enact sharing      agreements for over twenty years, yet they have done little.      The VFW believes that the provisions of this amendment will      serve as a strong incentive for VA and DOD to at last pursue      these mutually advantageous agreements.       It is our view that increased health resource sharing will      be doubly beneficial. It has the potential to provide an      expanded wealth of services to all beneficiaries, all while      reducing costs. The Transition Commission noted, for example,      that were VA and DOD to better coordinate the purchase of      medical products, including pharmaceuticals and supplies,      they would realize a savings of almost $2 billion over a      five-year period. Further, a May 2000 General Accounting      Office report claimed that VA and DOD could realize a gain of      up to $300 million per year with improved joint      pharmaceutical contracts.       The VFW insists that all cost-savings resulting from      improved resource sharing agreements be reinvested back into      the Departments' health care systems without any funding      offsets. The resulting supplemental revenue will help bring      the Departments' respective health care budgets closer to      what is actually needed to provide the timely, first-rate      health care our active duty servicemembers and veterans so      richly deserve. Additionally, the resultant additional      dollars will serve as an effective incentive for the      Departments to pursue other additional avenues of health care      sharing.       Notwithstanding this legislation's manifest benefits, we do      have some concerns that we would articulate here. First, we      believe that the individuals who head the Health Executive      Committee which this legislation creates should have equal      authority and the highest possible access to their respective      Secretaries. This will help preserve the integrity of their      decision-making and mitigate potential institutional      interference. We note that under your amendment the senior      DOD head will be the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel      and Readiness whereas VA's Deputy Secretary represents that      department. We recommend that the DOD head be the Deputy      Secretary of Defense.       A second concern is since the findings of this Committee      are essentially binding upon the two departments, that they      not unduly supplant established and effective planning      procedures nor serve as a means to circumvent the will of the      Congress and the longstanding oversight capacity of the      veterans service community. Great care must be exercised to      ensure that the considerable authority invested in this      Executive Committee is not misapplied.       Despite this, the VFW strongly supports this bold approach      to expanding and, indeed, enforcing the implementation of VA-     DOD health care resource sharing agreements. Most      importantly, it specifically addresses a key VFW goal that      veterans and the active duty military receive the best      possible health care in the best possible way. We thank you      for introducing this vital measure, and we look forward to      working with you to ensure its success.           Sincerely,                                                Robert E. Wallace,                                               Executive Director.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
