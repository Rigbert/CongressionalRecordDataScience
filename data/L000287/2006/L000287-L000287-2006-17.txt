Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the U.S.-Oman Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act. This agreement contains the same flawed ``enforce your own labor laws'' provision that we have seen in recent trade agreements. These labor standards simply do not work when we are dealing with countries that lack strong labor laws and practices.  Mr. Speaker, before we move forward on this issue, I feel a moral obligation to pose the following questions to my colleagues and to the American people:  When negotiating trade agreements, why does this Administration always seem to lose its tenacity and its resolve when it comes to protecting the labor rights of some of the world's most vulnerable workers?  What message does America send to the international community, when we will fight to protect pharmaceuticals patents and other intellectual property within our trade agreements, but we will not do the same for human beings?  Mr. Speaker, before the Members of the People's House cast their votes on this agreement today, I ask that they take a long, hard look at our priorities and our values when it comes to trade policy. I am convinced that this Administration can do a much better job of negotiating trade agreements that will advance the interests of U.S. business and agriculture, while protecting the rights of workers.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this flawed trade agreement.
