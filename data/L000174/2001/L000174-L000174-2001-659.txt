President, the Senator from Delaware was going to speak, but if I might, just before he does, and on this issue, the desegregation efforts in Missouri in 1992, when Jay Nixon first ran for attorney general in Missouri, he did recognize the need to settle the St. Louis and Kansas City desegregation issues. He said the State, the cities, and parents needed resolution and certainty after years of nonstop litigation. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial summed up the differences under Jay Nixon. It said:       Their differences in how the State should respond to the      Federal court orders of desegregation for St. Louis and      Kansas City schools is instructive. The Republican wants to      keep fighting although the State lost the case long ago. The      Democrat wants to have a settlement.  Mr. Nixon then followed through in this agreement. He was the first Missouri official to sign a resolution on behalf of the State, and he was a supporter of the law that provided the State funding to settle the St. Louis case. In both the settlement agreement and the law to implement it, then Governor, Governor Carnahan, provided the leadership that Governor Ashcroft did not provide.  Senator Ashcroft ran for Governor in 1984 as a strong opponent of the settlement, the settlement finally had in Missouri. He was 8 years as attorney general and 8 years as Governor. In those years he denied liability, opposed a fair settlement, and litigated the questions over and over again.  I will put in the Record in a moment a letter from Arthur Benson who, since 1979, has been lead counsel for the schoolchildren in the Kansas City desegregation litigation.  What he said in it is:       While the case proved difficult to settle with the State,      it did eventually settle because Jay Nixon and other Missouri      officials wanted to settle rather than litigate, and because      he wanted to refocus the time and efforts of state officials      on improving education.  To this Senator's mind, this is a marked difference from what Senator Ashcroft had done. In any event, Senators have to make up their own minds.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Arthur Benson & Associates,                                Kansas City, MO, January 30, 2001.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Since 1979 I have been the lead counsel      for the plaintiff schoolchildren in the Kansas City school      desegregation litigation, now styled as Jenkins et al., v.      Kansas City Missouri School District, case number Case No.      77-0420-CV-W-1, United States District Court for the Western      District of Missouri.       After January 1993 there was a marked change in the manner      in which the then defendants of the State of Missouri were      represented in this litigation. After January 1993 Attorney      General Jay Nixon continued     to defend the legal positions of the State of Missouri      defendants vigorously and well. At the same time, however, he      never denied the State's responsibility for eliminating the      vestiges of its prior de jure segregation. He also expressed      interest in settlement, supported legislative initiatives in      the Missouri legislature that would provide necessary      underpinning for any settlement, and proposed alternatives to      the courts in response to remedial proposals of the      plaintiffs, all of which were changes from the litigation      tactics of the state defendants in this case before 1993.       While the case proved difficult to settle with the State,      it did eventually settle because Jay Nixon and other Missouri      officials wanted to settle rather than litigate, and because      he wanted to refocus the time and efforts of state officials      on improving education.           Yours very truly,                                                    Arthur Benson.
