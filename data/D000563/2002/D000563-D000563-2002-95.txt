It suggested to me, I say to the Senator from Nevada, coming back to this bill, when we go to the merits of this debate, let's be very honest about what this concerns.

There are those who argue--and you have heard it from the Senator from Texas--once they come into this new Department, we can't afford to run the risk that someone who belongs to a labor union can really rise to the challenge of defending America.  Pardon me, Madam President. Do I recall correctly those profiles in courage of September 11, 2001, of which so many of us are so proud?

Did anyone question their patriotism, their loyalty to our country, their devotion to so many people?  Oh, and yet today we hear speech after speech: We just can't run the risk of letting people who are members of labor unions in this situation, public employees----
