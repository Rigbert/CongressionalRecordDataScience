 President, yesterday I did not have an opportunity to participate in a very important series of speeches on the subject of the national drug strategy that were spoken by several of my colleagues, particularly on this side of the aisle. I am sorry I was not able to do that. That was under the leadership of Senator Coverdell, and I compliment Senator Coverdell for his leadership in that area. So, it is at this point, albeit 1 day later, that I would like to comment on our Nation's drug strategy.  Mr. President, when I returned to Washington after the Easter recess, I returned with a lot on my mind. During the last week of Easter recess I held a series of meetings across Iowa to brainstorm with parents, educators, law enforcement officers, country attorneys, probation officers, juvenile court officials, social service and youth specialists, and high school students. I wanted to hear their views on juvenile delinquency, violence, and drug use. I held these meetings to follow up on a town meeting I held in February. I did this, in part, as preparation for the reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Act. We need to take a hard look at what works and where the act needs to be updated in order to meet today's requirements.  The meetings highlighted the deep concern of the public over the growing problem of violence and drug use among the Nation's young people. One of the causes of difficulties is the ease of availability of illegal drugs to today's young people. Not only do illegal drugs destroy families and ruin the lives of individuals; they exact a heavy cost on society as a whole. Whether it is in rising health care costs, losses at work, or greater risks on our highways and streets, drugs exact a heavy toll. Conservative estimates put the costs at over $67 billion a year. That does not include the costs of the drugs themselves. Nor is it a measure of human misery, which cannot be reduced to dollars and cents. When linked to rising crime and violence among our young people, the problems become even more disturbing.  Juvenile crime is not new but it is rising nationwide. What is worse, experts say kids commit more violent crimes today and show less remorse. In the last decade, murders committed by teens increased by 150 percent. Just recently, three children, one 6-year-old and two twins, aged 8, invaded the house of a neighbor to steal a tricycle. The 6-year-old, the ring leader, used the occasion to savagely attack an infant in its crib. The infant, beat and kicked by the 6-year-old, is not expected to live, and if he does live, he is likely to have brain damage. The crime was premeditated and vicious. Unfortunately, this tale of children killing children is becoming increasingly common. As is drug use among teenagers and even elementary school kids.  What is unfortunate about this rise in drug use is that it comes after years of declines. It comes after we had made considerable progress. After years in which ``Just Say No'' helped lift a generation of kids past the most vulnerable years--ages 12 to 20. Not only is use returning, but kids see less danger in using drugs than just a few years ago. Somewhere we put a foot wrong, and now we face the prospect of a new generation of addicts.  We cannot let this happen. Recently, I cochaired a congressional task force to lay the groundwork for fighting back. Last week I held a hearing on the domestic consequences of drug trafficking and use. Last month the Task Force on National Drug Policy, convened by Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich, released ``Setting the Course: A National Drug Strategy''. In that report, we set out many of the prevention, treatment, law enforcement, and interdiction initiatives that we need to undertake to respond to the growing challenge of returning drug use. Senator Hatch, Congressman Zeliff and I, along with others, have been working to put the drug issue back on the national agenda after years of neglect and virtual silence from the administration.  Yesterday, the administration, belatedly, issued its own strategy on how to fight back. While I welcome General McCaffrey, the new drug czar, to the fray, I am concerned that the strategy released by the administration is long on platitudes and shy on substance. While I do not doubt the General's sincerity, I am not all that confident in the administration's commitment to supporting him. Indeed, the General's first task is imply to recover much of the ground lost in the last 3 years. His effort is aimed at damage control. The strategy, unfortunately, is a prisoner to that effort. And it shows. It outlines fine sentiments, but it is skimpy on any measurable standards. It is hard to fault such language as the strategy contains. But it says little other than it is against drugs. It offers little in concrete measures to determine whether intent will be backed up by deeds. And it fights shy of providing any criteria to measure success.  I know that General McCaffrey intends to do all in his power to fight this problem, but when it comes to serious effort, my response is, ``Show me, don't tell me.'' It is important that we get action not more words.  This administration has been more than invisible on the drug issue in the past 3 years. It has tried to bury the drug issue. The first official act on drugs of this administration was to gut the drug czar's office. To cut its staff by 80 percent. It was this administration's first Surgeon General that called for the legalization of drugs. It was this administration that replaced ``Just Say No'' with ``Just Say Nothing.'' It was this administration that replaced a strategy that was working with one that has presided over one of the largest increases in use in the last 30 years. Furthermore, in the past 3 years under this administration's approach, the movement to legalize drugs has gained momentum.  It is deja vu all over again. Music, movies, and the media have begun to glamorize drug use. To normalize it in print and song. Meanwhile the response from the administration to rising teenage drug use or the effort to legalize dangerous drugs has been like pulling teeth to monitor, difficult to explain, and hard to spot with the naked eye.  It is only after growing criticism from Congress and from the public that the administration has begun, at long last, to at least talk about the drug issue. The President has had more to say about the drug issue in the past 2 months than in the past 3 years. It is about time. It is only after efforts by Congress to force a more serious strategy on the administration, and to insist upon accountability in programs, that the administration has begun to speak about meaningful efforts.  The administration is now talking about the need for a bipartisan effort. I, for one, welcome such an effort. But let us not mistake criticism of failed policies as partisanship. It is, after all, criticisms of the past few years of effort that have led to the present, election-year reversals. It is breaking the silence on poor performance and neglect that have led to renewed attention to drug policy. To the appointment of a new drug czar. To a rediscovered interest by the President in drug policy.  Better late than never. But, while I welcome the present born-again policy, I remain concerned about the intent behind it. There is more showmanship and political maneuvering in the present effort than depth of commitment. I know that General McCaffrey is not running for reelection. I believe that General McCaffrey is serious when he says he wants a bipartisan approach. I am less certain about the motives of others in the administration. I remain concerned that many of the Key advisers on policy are hostile to serious enforcement and interdiction efforts. I am concerned about the commitment of some of the advisers to the White House to keeping drugs illegal.  Nevertheless, I welcome the strategy and I hope that the administration will support the drug czar, unlike his predecessor. I hope that we will see more action. I hope that the action that we see focuses less on backdrops and photo ops, and more on results.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
