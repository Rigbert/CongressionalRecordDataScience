  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, twice the voters of Oregon have gone to the ballot box to enact and uphold our Death With Dignity law. The Ninth Circuit Court, the Supreme Court, and most recently the Attorney General have upheld the right of the citizens of Oregon to enact a Death With Dignity law.  But now a group of our colleagues, working hand-in-glove with the same national special interest groups that opposed our ballot measure, have proposed Federal legislation to preempt our Death With Dignity law. Many of these same Members of Congress wax eloquent day after day on the floor of the House for States' rights. Yes, States' rights if it restricts a woman's right to choice. They are for States' rights if it shreds the social safety net. But if the people of Oregon want a Death With Dignity law, well, they are not for States' rights anymore. The Federal Government should preempt them.  This is not only an attack on our States' rights, it is an attempt to overturn the will of a majority of Oregonians with an unprecedented Federal intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship. It is no longer a doctor-patient relationship when we are dying, it is a doctor-patient and Drug Enforcement Administration official relationship. This will have an incredibly chilling effect on the end of life painfully provided by doctors. We must reject this proposal.                          ____________________
