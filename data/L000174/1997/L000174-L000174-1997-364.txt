It has been my experience in the past that Republicans and Democrats have worked closely together with both Republican and Democratic Presidents to keep the judiciary out of politics, knowing that all Americans would go to court not asking whether a judge is Republican or Democrat, but asking whether this is a place they will get justice. If we politicize it, they may not be able to answer that question the way they have in the past.
