Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Hungarian Caucus, I rise today with great pleasure and enthusiasm to congratulate St. Elizabeth of Hungary Catholic Church in Cleveland on their 125th anniversary. St. Elizabeth is North America's oldest Hungarian Church.  The history of this notable congregation begins in 1892, where a small wood-framed church on the corner of Buckeye Road and East 90th Street in Cleveland held mass for the faithful.  On June 4, 1893, the cornerstone of the first St. Elizabeth's Catholic Church was laid, providing seating for up to 800 Hungarian immigrants at a single mass. Ten years later, the church was too small to accommodate the thousands of Roman Catholic Hungarian immigrants who settled in this area. In 1907, the Pastor of the church began to petition the Bishop of Cleveland for permission to raisemoney to build a new church which could accommodate more parishioners. Construction of the new church begun in 1918 and was completed in 1922.  In addition to the completion of the church structure that still stands today, the community built a parish hall that became a community center for the neighborhood's Hungarians, a true social and religious meeting center of ``Little Hungary'' on Buckeye Road.  St. Elizabeth's was designed by Cleveland architect Emile Uhlrich and is an example of Italian-influenced Baroque Revival architecture. It was partly modelled after the church of Sant' Agnese in Agone in Rome.  St. Elizabeth's Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its place in Cleveland's history and because of its historically significant architecture.  The congregation of St. Elizabeth's weathered many changes throughout the decades, but remained true to its mission and to its dedication to Hungarian heritage.  St. Elizabeth's Church is a magnificent example of all that a spiritual home should be for the past 125 years. Our hope is that St. Elizabeth of Hungary Catholic Church's congregation continues to grow and prosper through the years.  Gratulalok.                          ____________________
