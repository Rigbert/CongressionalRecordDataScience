Mr. Speaker, 30 years ago, with Harry Truman watching, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into a law a program to guarantee health insurance for every person over 65.  Thirty years ago, Medicare was born.  Thirty years ago, half our senior citizens did not have health insurance. Today, because of Medicare, 99 percent of our elderly have health insurance.  The Republicans are threatening the Medicare program. And they are doing it to pay for tax breaks promised in their so-called Contract With America.  But make no mistake about it, that is not the Contract With America. I have here in my pocket the true contract with America--the Medicare Act signed by President Johnson. This is our contract with our parents, with our children, with our grandchildren. This is our contract with America.  Medicare is a sacred trust with our seniors and our families. It cannot and must not be violated.                          ____________________
