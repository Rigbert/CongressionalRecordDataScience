 President, few who ever served in this body have been as universally mourned as those of us from both sides of the aisle who knew him will mourn our former colleague, Ed Muskie, who died here in Washington early this morning.  The reports already circulating on the news wire services and the obituaries that will appear in tomorrow's newspapers, all will make much, and rightly so, out of his long and distinguished service as a public man.  Few men or women in our history have contributed so much to the Nation as Ed Muskie did as a U.S. Senator for 21 years and as Secretary of State; few have contributed as much to their native State as Ed Muskie did as a member of the Maine House of Representatives and as Governor of the State he loved so much; and few have contributed as much to one of the major political parties as Ed Muskie did to the Democratic Party, which he served as a Vice Presidential candidate in 1968 and as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.  It is fitting that, upon his death just 2 days before his 82d birthday, Americans should be reminded of his long and faithful public service and leadership--but those of us who knew and served with Ed Muskie will remember him more familiarly as a man of principle, as a powerful personality, and, most of all, as our good friend.  One thing that I learned very quickly, serving with him on the Budget Committee and the Foreign Relations Committee, was that while he exhibited the gravitas--the character and substance--that might be expected of a man whose full given name was Edmund Sixtus Muskie, he was a very human, very good-humored man--most of the time--who was most comfortable simply as Ed Muskie, and who if he was your friend was your friend for life.  It is true that his good humor would sometimes momentarily desert him--he had a temper that verged on the volcanic, and he was capable of weeping public tears over an insult to the wife whom he loved--but those moments occurred, for the most part, because Ed Muskie never believed that a career in politics obliged his head to divorce his heart; despite a powerful intellect that won him a law degree, a Phi Beta Kappa key and a long, successful career both in law and in politics, he never believed that political feelings must somehow be set aside.  He was passionate about his politics--he believed the work we do here is important to improving the lives of Americans--and he believed that what he felt was as important to achieving that end as what he thought.  But though Ed Muskie sometimes wore his heart unashamedly on his sleeve, he was also very much a Yankee, very much a man of Maine, who put great stock in getting things done, and getting them done at the right price.  By that I am not referring so much to his chairmanship of the Budget Committee--although he certainly exerted a strong hand at that helm, often to the dismay of bureaucrats throughout the land and not infrequently to Senate colleagues who failed to make a strong enough case for their favorite program--no, for him, getting things done at the right price meant achieving that meld of idealism and realism which we often say a democratic system of Government requires but which few of us ever achieve with the grace and consistency of an Ed Muskie.  The people of Maine understood that as well as we did here in the Senate, and he understood and loved them, as well.  I remember him saying one time, ``in Maine, we tend not to speak unless we think we can improve upon the silence.''  Out of his wisdom, out of his passion, out of his drive to get things done, Ed Muskie often spoke up for Maine and for America--and we need only feel the silence of his passing gather about us now to know how much he improved upon it during a long and accomplished life.  In the words of William Shakespeare, ``he was a man, take him for all in all, [we] shall not look upon his like again.''                          ____________________
