 President, we all know the U.S. health care system is in serious need of reform. Costs are too high, they are rising, and if we do nothing, they will continue to consume a larger and larger share of Federal dollars and of the budgets of millions of middle-class American families, of young workers trying to get their start in life, and, of course, of seniors.  For months, the administration and its allies in Congress promised a solution to these problems, a solution they said would lower costs and help the economy.
