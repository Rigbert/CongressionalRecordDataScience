 President, I am pleased to introduce legislation today to grant United States citizenship to Vijai Rajan. Ms. Rajan is a twenty-four year old permanent resident from India whose naturalization application was denied because of physical disabilities that make it impossible for her to take the oath of allegiance.  Ms. Rajan has lived in the United States since she was four months old. Her sister, Inbhu, was born in Cincinnati and is an American citizen by right of her birth in the United States. Her father Sunder Rajan became a naturalized citizen in 1980. But Ms. Rajan's mother Shakunthala, was not naturalized until 1994, just after Vijai's 18th birthday. If both parents had become citizens before Rajan turned 18, she would have automatically qualified for citizenship.  Unfortunately, due to this peculiar circumstance, the law now requires that Ms. Rajan undergo the rigors of the regular naturalization process, including taking the oath of allegiance, before she can become a United States citizen.  An anomaly in the law has resulted in Ms. Rajan being left out of her family's American dream, for no other reason than because her physical disabilities prevent her from taking the oath of allegiance. Ms. Rajan suffers from cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, seizures, and Crohn's disease.  American citizenship is the most visible sign of one's attachment to the United States. The naturalization process, including the oath of allegiance, should be credible, and it must be accorded the formality and ceremony appropriate to its importance. I would not support any steps that would detract from the meaningfulness, solemnity, and dignity of this time-honored tradition.  In 1952, when Congress codified the requirements for becoming an American citizen, it required that the oath contain five elements: (1) support for the Constitution; (2) renunciation of prior allegiance; (3) defense of the Constitution against all enemies; (4) true faith and allegiance; and (5) a commitment to bear arms or perform noncombatant service when required.  I believe these principles should remain intact. But I also believe that we should carry out these ideals with compassion and sufficient flexibility that persons who are so severely disabled, like Ms. Rajan, are not automatically disqualified from becoming U.S. citizens.  I believe the case of Vijai Rajan is compelling and warrants Congress' immediate consideration. Moreover, I am aware that there are other cases in which a physical disability has prevented an otherwise qualified person from becoming an American citizen. I intend to work to enact legislation that will give the Attorney General the discretion to act on such compelling cases without having to resort to a private act of Congress.  In the meantime, I urge my colleagues to support this private legislation on behalf of Vijai Rajan.                                 ______                                       By
