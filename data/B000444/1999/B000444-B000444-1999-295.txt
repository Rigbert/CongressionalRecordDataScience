 Presidents make commitments all the time. Commitments and obligations do not a treaty make and do not require a supermajority vote under the Constitution by the Senate to ratify those commitments. I, at least for the time being, object and hope that after we finish this debate, before we vote, my colleague and I can have a few minutes in the well to see whether he will consider amending it to add the word ``legal'' on line 7 of his amendment. So I object.
