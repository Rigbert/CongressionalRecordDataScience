Chairman, 17 riders in this appropriation bill are a bitter vetch of environmental poison concocted by special interest groups and served up by the majority party. The Republican proposals will weaken environmental protection. They will endanger public health and safety. They will reward irresponsible polluting businesses and penalize the responsible businesses which have cleaned up their smokestacks and the water they discharge into our lakes and streams.  We in America have made real progress in cleaning up pollution, but if we let this Republican proposal pass, we will return to the polluted air and water we used to have.  Who wants these Republican environmental loopholes? Big business, foreign-owned cement kilns which release toxic pollution into the atmosphere, oil and gas refineries which will be allowed to spew air polluted with benzenes and dioxins into the air that we breathe.  America has come so far in cleaning up the environment. We cannot sell out to the special interests with these 17 riders today.
