I cannot believe it, after all the efforts that we have made and all the agreements.  I am glad there is a Ross Perot, and I hope that that particular party runs candidates across this country because this bill is a sham. It does not close a loophole that the American people have known, they have known this has existed for years. This is a sham.  This entire debate, cynically orchestrated by Newt Gingrich, is a sham--why? Because just a few days ago, the Republican Campaign Committee leader in the Senate [the other body] called him Mr. Money Bags from Kentucky, killed campaign reform for this year. Even if this chamber passed the finest reform in the country, nothing is going to happen. It takes both chambers to tango.  This House bill is particularly cynical because the suspension procedure under which we are considering it is a gag rule. No amendments are allowed; it allows only 20 minutes debate on each side in this serious debate. What a travesty! And then to gain passage, it requires \2/3\ of the Members to achieve passage, not a majority.  These bills have no spending limits; in fact, these bills allow wealthy individuals to triple the amount of money they can contribute. Yet, they cut off the legs of ordinary working men and women by demeaning their participation in our political life by requiring them to get written permission. What an insult.  I urge the American people to call their Members of the House to urge them to sign on the discharge petition on the Shays-Meehan bill to get a real reform debate on the Floor of this House.  And I wish to enter into the Record the editorial in the New York Times today that strikes the heart of the deceitful process underway here tonight--``The Plot to Bury Reform.''                        The Plot to Bury Reform       Newt Gingrich has selected today as the moment to line up      his firing squad and kill campaign finance reform in Congress      this year. Yet the House Speaker may be surprised.      Republicans and Democrats who favor reform are so outraged      over Mr. Gingrich's broken promises and heavy-handed tactics      that they could seize the moment and force him to back down.      Whether the reformers succeed depends on their ability to      hold together and find ways to get genuine reform to the      floor, where a majority of members appear ready to vote for      it.       Just how desperate Mr. Gingrich is to thwart reform is      clear from the parliamentary tactics he is preparing to use.      Last week, the Speaker broke his promise to debate the issue      of a campaign cleanup and pulled all relevant legislation      from the House agenda. In doing so, he virtually acknowledged      that he and his wrecking crew lacked enough support from      fellow Republicans to prevent passage of genuine reform. Then      the Republican leadership abruptly announced it would bring      four watered down reform bills up today, but under rules      preventing amendments or substitutions and requiring a two-     thirds vote for approval of anything. Clearly, the Speaker's      goal is to insure that nothing gets passed, and hope someone      else can be blamed.       Republicans are ready to defy the Speaker by joining with      most Democrats to vote for legislation sponsored by      Representatives Christopher Shays of Connecticut and Marty      Meehan of Massachusetts. The Shays-Meehan bill would ban the      unregulated and unlimited donations to political parties that      are known as ``soft money'' and were at the heart of the      recent scandals. It would also establish exacting disclosure      requirements and apply fund-raising limits to independent      groups running attack ads on television.       The bills that Mr. Gingrich is sponsoring are either      anemic, irrelevant or tied to an anti-union provision      repugnant to most Democrats. With a two-thirds approval      requirement, they cannot pass. Of course Mr. Gingrich does      not care if his own fraudulent legislations wins or loses.      All he seeks is the chance to say the House considered      campaign finance reform and was unable to pass a bill. It is      a cynical maneuver that will come back to haunt Mr. Gingrich      and any House member who supports it.
