Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, this country has a crisis in manufacturing. Particularly, small- and medium-sized manufacturing jobs are going overseas by the droves, particularly to China, and there are a whole lot of reasons for that; but one of the reasons is a judicial system that is out of control.  My colleagues can talk about business, but it is business that creates the jobs that hire our constituents who pay the taxes to make the government run; and by having court reform, which is what this bill does, it is not tort reform because nobody's rights to a jury trial or to get into a court are constricted by one iota. It is where this is done and how class actions get certified and protections for consumers such as the coupon settlements and the deficiency judgments that are entered against class members.  This is going to help keep America's economy vibrant. Pass the bill.
