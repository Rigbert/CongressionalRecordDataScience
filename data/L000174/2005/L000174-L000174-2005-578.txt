President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for his courtesy. I apologize to the Senator from Colorado. I was distracted when he was giving the order to put us out. I should have realized, after 31 years here, when we are on autopilot. And, of course, the Senator was following precisely the agreement as usually somebody does in wrapup that has been worked out between the Democratic leader and the Republican leader and was totally within his rights. I apologize for interrupting.
