 Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Dicks) for yielding me this time, and I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member for their work on this important piece of legislation.  Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to call attention to an amendment that I will be offering along with the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Lewis) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Stupak) later on in this bill.  That amendment deals with the issue of payment in lieu of taxes. As my colleagues know, Mr. Chairman, there are some 1,800 counties throughout the United States that have land in them that is owned by the Federal Government. Over the years, the Federal Government has not kept faith with these communities and has not paid a fair payment in lieu of taxes.  In the Congress, especially in recent years, we have been hearing a lot of discussion about what is called devolution, more respect, more authority for local counties and local towns. It seems to me that if we are sincere about respecting our States and our towns that we should be fair with them in terms of providing them the payment in lieu of taxes that they need.  So I would hope that, when this amendment comes up, which affects some 1,800 communities in America, it affects some 49 States, and it is an amendment similar to one that won here on the floor of the House last year, that we will once again support it.  It is unfair, it seems to me, to take advantage of communities all over this country, force them to inadequately fund their infrastructure, education, the services they provide their people because the Federal Government is not properly paying the in lieu of tax payments that it should.  I urge support of this amendment when it appears later.
