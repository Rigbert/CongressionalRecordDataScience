 President, the story of what happened in Libby, MT, is heartbreaking.  Years ago, when I first heard what happened there, I began a campaign to ban asbestos and to protect its victims. In June of 2002, I testified at a hearing about Libby before the Senate Subcommittee on Superfund, Toxics, Risk, and Waste Management. The people of Libby, MT, have been waiting for this day for a very long time.  This indictment tells companies that they are responsible for their decisions and that human lives are more important than profits. The indictment sends a message that if you are putting workers and consumers at risk, if you try to hide the dangers, you will be prosecuted because at the end of the day, this is not about profits, it is about people.  It is about people such as Gayla Benefield, whom I met last summer. Gayla's father worked at W.R. Grace's vermiculite mine and mill in Libby, MT, from 1954 to 1973. Her father died of asbestosis in 1974. Gayla's mother never worked in that mine, but she was exposed to asbestos fibers on her husband's work clothes. Gayla's mother died of asbestosis in 1996. Gayla herself was exposed to asbestos fibers. Why? Because she hugged her dad when he came home from work. And then, in December of 2001, Gayla and her husband David both were diagnosed with lung abnormalities.  In all, about 37 people in Gayla's family have signs of asbestos disease, and only three ever worked in that mine.  Now, as my colleagues know, for the past 4 years, I have been speaking about the dangers of asbestos and the need to ban it in this country. I have stood up for victims and their families. I have introduced legislation to protect workers, educate the public, and improve research and treatment.  Last year, when Congress considered an inadequate trust fund bill, I stood up for the asbestos victims and voted against it. We still have a lot of work to do to take care of the current victims and to prevent future deaths. That is one of the reasons I am so personally concerned about the class action bill that is now before the Senate.  The bill allows companies to move class action lawsuits from State jurisdiction to Federal jurisdiction. That could delay justice for years. In many cases, victims have already been waiting a long time for their day in court. If their cases are moved to Federal court, they will essentially have to start all over at the bottom of the pile. That is because Federal courts already have a massive backlog of cases. It is one of the reasons the Federal bench opposes this bill.  If class action lawsuits are dumped on to our Federal courts, they will fall to the bottom of the list of priorities. Even if they work their way up to the top of the docket after many years, they will not be resolved quickly because they are such complicated cases.  The bill that is before the Senate now could add years to the amount of time it takes to resolve a case. Unfortunately, asbestos victims do not have time on their side. Once a person is diagnosed with mesothelioma, they usually have only about 6 to 18 months to live. So if companies know, they can just play legal games, they can just wait it out, just move the case and hold things up until the victim dies. If that happens, there is no justice.  For someone with the death sentence of an asbestos disease, justice delayed is justice denied. That is why Congress should reject this class action bill.  There are other ways this bill could deny justice. Companies could just wait until a victim's medical bills or lost wages are so high that the victim is forced into an unfair settlement. Once again, that is because this bill tips the scales of justice against average Americans.  I have focused on asbestos victims, but this class action bill would affect many more types of victims. Anyone with a class action lawsuit could find themselves pushed into Federal court at the bottom of the list. Congress should not delay and deny justice for victims.  As for asbestos victims, we still have a lot of work to do. Each year in this country 10,000 Americans die from asbestos disease--10,000 Americans. The first thing we need to do is ban the production and importation of asbestos in the United States. Do you know that each year in this country we put asbestos into 3,000 consumer products, products that you buy at the store regularly? Hair dryers, floor tile, and automobile brakes--we put asbestos in them in this country today. If we know this is deadly, we should stop putting it in consumer products in America.  Again, later this year, I am going to reintroduce my Ban Asbestos in America Act. The first year I introduced it, we only had four cosponsors. Last session, we had 14. We also made progress, including my ban in the asbestos liability legislation that was considered by the Judiciary Committee. My ban is also included in Senator Specter's most recent version of that bill.  But we also need to help victims by investing in mesothelioma researchand treatment. And we need to boost awareness of how consumers--that is all of us--and workers can protect themselves.  Today, up to 35 million homes, businesses, and schools have the deadly Zonolite insulation in their attics. People need to know about the danger so they can protect themselves, so they do not go up in their attic and do their work unknowingly exposing themselves to asbestos.  Many employees are still in danger--from construction workers to auto mechanics. And let's not forget that many asbestos victims were exposed to asbestos when they served our country in the military. About 32 percent of asbestos victims happen to be Navy veterans. Many of them worked in the Bremerton Shipyard in my home State of Washington.  The dangers of asbestos are not just limited to Libby, MT, or to military communities; they are everywhere. This Congress needs to address them the right way. Congress should make sure asbestos victims can get the justice they deserve. That is why I will vote against this class action bill. And that is why I am going to continue to fight to ban asbestos and to help the victims in this country.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1          [From the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, Feb. 8, 2005]              W.R. Grace Indicted in Libby Asbestos Deaths        Mine company and seven executives face criminal charges                         (By Andrew Schneider)       Missoula, Mont.--W.R. Grace & Co. and seven of its current      or former executives have been indicted on federal charges      that they knowingly put their workers and the public in      danger through exposure to vermiculite ore contaminated with      asbestos from the company's mine in from Libby, Mont.       Hundreds of miners, their family members and townsfolk have      died and at least 1,200 have been sickened from exposure to      the asbestos-containing ore. The health effects also threaten      workers, their families and residents everywhere the ore was      shipped, including Seattle, and people living in millions of      homes nationwide where it was used as insulation.       Yesterday, on the steps of the county courthouse here, U.S.      Attorney Bill Mercer announced the 10-count indictment,      alleging conspiracy, knowing endangerment, obstruction of      justice and wire fraud.       ``A human and environmental tragedy has occurred,'' he      said. ``This prosecution seeks to hold Grace and its      executives responsible.''       ``This is one of the most significant criminal indictments      for environmental crime in our history,'' said Lori Hanson,      special agent in charge of the Environmental Protection      Agency's environmental crime section in Denver.       In a statement released for Grace by a public-relations      firm, the company ``categorically denies any criminal      wrongdoing.''       Grace criticized the government for releasing the      indictment before providing a copy to the company. ``We are      surprised by the government's methods and disappointed by its      determination to bring these allegations. .  .  . We look      forward to setting the record straight.''       Federal environmental officials began examining the hazards      in Libby after Nov. 19, 1999, when the Seattle Post-     Intelligencer began publishing a series of stories about what      the government has called ``the nation's biggest      environmental disaster.'' Within three days of the P-I's      first report, an EPA emergency team arrived in the tiny      northwestern Montana town.       Present at the announcement yesterday were Libby victims      Lester and Norita Skramstad and Gayla Benefield.       Lester Skramstad has asbestosis, as does his wife, Norita,      and two of their children. He spoke softly but forcefully,      struggling for breath to launch his words into the wind on a      blustery winter afternoon. ``I've waited a long time for      this,'' he said. ``It's a great day to be alive.''       If found guilty, the individual defendants face from five      to 15 years in prison on each count, which for some of the      executives could be as much as 70 years.       Grace could be fined up to twice the profits from its      alleged criminal acts or twice the losses suffered by      victims. According to the indictments, Grace made more than      $140 million in after-tax profits from the Libby mine, which      would mean a fine of up to $280 million. Alternatively, the      court could fine the company twice what it computes the loss      to be from more than a thousand Libby victims. In addition,      the court could order restitution for the victims.       ``This criminal indictment is intended to send a clear      message: We will pursue corporations and senior managers who      knowingly disregard environmental laws and jeopardize the      health and welfare of workers and the public,'' said Thomas      Skinner, EPA's acting assistant administrator for      enforcement, yesterday.       The executives charged are Alan Stringer, formerly general      manager of the Libby mine and Grace's representative during      the government's Superfund cleanup; Henry Eschenbach,      formerly director of health, safety and toxicology in Grace's      industrial chemical group; Jack Wolter, formerly Grace vice      president and general manager of its construction products      division; Bill McCaig, also formerly general manager of the      mine; Robert Bettacchi, formerly president of the      construction products division and senior vice president of      Grace; O. Mario Favorito, former Grace general counsel; and      Robert Walsh, formerly a Grace senior vice president.       The 49-page indictment accuses Grace of knowingly releasing      asbestos into the air, placing miners, their families and      townspeople at risk, and of defrauding the government by      obstructing the efforts of various agencies including the      EPA, increasing profits and avoiding liability for damages by      doing so.                          P-I's Investigation       Tens of thousands of pages of internal Grace documents and      court papers were the basis of scores of stories in the P-1      on Libby and the deadly ore that Grace shipped throughout the      world. Those documents show years of extensive communication      among Grace's top health, marketing and legal managers and      mine officials in Libby about concealing the danger of      asbestos in the ore and consumer products that were made from      it.       They discussed methods to keep federal investigators from      studying the health of the miners, the potential harm to      Grace sales if asbestos warnings were posted on its products,      and the effort to mask the hazard of working with the      contaminated ore.       ``The prosecution cannot eliminate the death and disease in      Libby,'' said John Heberling, a lawyer with McGarvey,      Heberling, Sullivan and McGarvey. ``But there is comfort in      the hope that criminal convictions will say to corporate      America . . . managers will be held criminally accountable if      they lie and deny and watch workers die.''       For years, the Kalispell, Mont., firm has been fighting for      damages from Grace on behalf of the families of the dead and      the dying from Libby.                         Mine's huge production       Opened in 1913, the mine is six miles from Libby. Grace      bought it in 1963 and closed it in 1990. In its heyday, the      mine produced 80 percent of the world's vermiculite. The      company still operates smaller vermiculite mines in South      Carolina.       Vermiculite, a mineral similar to mica, expands when heated      into featherweight pieces that have been used commercially      for decades in attic and wall insulation, wallboard,      fireproofing, and plant nursery and forestry products. It was      also used in scores of consumer products, such as lawn and      garden supplies and cat litter.       Exposure to the tremolite asbestos fibers, which      contaminate the vermiculite ore, has caused hundreds of cases      of asbestosis, lung cancer and mesothelioma in Libby and an      untold number at hundreds of other sites across North America      where the ore was processed.       Criminal investigators and lawyers from the EPA, the      Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Attorney's offices in      Montana often put in 12- to 15-hour days while preparing the      case.       Investigators and lawyers from the Justice Department and      the EPA's headquarters also assisted. The haste was required      because prosecutors were up against a five-year statute of      limitation, based on the arrival of the first federal team in      Libby after the P-1 stories. They gained a three-month      extension of that limitation.                            A troubled past       The EPA said that over the years it had filed several      complaints against Grace over the company's environmental      practices. The only previous criminal charge against the      Columbia, Md.-based corporation was in the mid-'80s. Grace      was indicted on two counts of lying to the agency about the      quantity of hazardous material used in its packaging plant in      Woburn, Mass. In 1988, the company pleaded guilty to one      count and was fined $10,000, the maximum at that time. The      charges were brought after Grace and another company were      sued after being accused of illegally dumping toxic      chemicals, contaminating two wells and, some believe,      resulting in the deaths of five children from leukemia. Grace      paid the families $8 million to settle the suits. The book      and movie ``A Civil Action'' were based on the Woburn case.       Grace, which produces construction materials, building      materials and packaging, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy      protection in 2001 because of the ``sharply increasing number      of asbestos claims,'' Paul Norris, Grace's chairman and CEO,      said at the time.       May 2002, the Justice Department intervened in Grace's      bankruptcy, the first time it had entered such a case,      alleging that before Grace filed for Chapter 11, it concealed      money in new companies it bought. Justice Department lawyers      said Grace's action was a ``fraudulent transfer'' of money to      protect itself from civil suits.       In November of that year, just before the trial was to      begin, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the      companies returned almost $1 billion to the bankruptcy judges      holding Grace's assets. Grace is far from out of business.      Norris said the company has annual sales of about $2 billion,      more than 6,000     employees and operations in nearly 40 countries.       Mercer refused comment on whether there would be more      indictments from other locations where Grace had operations.      Hanson said she had been discussing the investigation with      her counterparts in EPA regions throughout the country.       Libby victim Benefield said yesterday that as she watched      the announcement of the indictments, her thoughts were with      her parents, Perley and Margaret Vatland, both of whom died      of asbestosis. She wore on her coat a costume-jewelry pin her      mother, who sold Avon products, bought from Avon for herself.       ``Somewhere today they're smiling,'' she said, fingering      the pin. ``I just know it.''                                 online       Read Uncivil Action, the P-O's award-winning coverage of      the deadly legacy of asbestos mining, beginning with a      November 1999 story about hundreds dead or dying in Libby,      Mont.
