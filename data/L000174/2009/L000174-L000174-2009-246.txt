President, today I am pleased to join with Senator Bond in introducing the National Guard Empowerment and State-National Defense Integration Act of 2009. This is a clearly needed piece of legislation that will enable the Nation to tap more of the tremendous experience and expertise that exists within the National Guard.  This legislation--known as Empowerment II--ensures that the Department of Defense takes advantage of the Guard's unique strengths and focuses on the critical mission of domestic operations and military support to civilian authorities. This bill is about focusing attention on the military's response to emergencies at home and fleshing out the structure of that response. Doing that will ensure our National Guard, Reserves and active forces can bring their specialized capabilities to bear, all while safely under the control of democratically elected officials and civilian authorities.  The bill will specifically make the Chief of the National Guard a full member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, while creating a new three-star deputy to the Bureau Chief to reflect the Bureau Chief's increased responsibilities. Additionally, the 2009 Empowerment Act provides the National Guard Bureau with limited budget authority to be able to acquire specially designed equipment for domestic operations, and it requires the Department of Defense to establish procedures to formalize arrangements to allow National Guard forces to have tactical control over active forces that operate in a domestic setting.  Today Senator Bond and I seek to build on some of the major improvements to the Guard that we, together, made in the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Authorization Bill. That landmark bill enacted large portions of the first version of the Guard Empowerment Bill which elevated the Chief of the National Guard from three-star general to full General. The goal of all the changes enacted was to begin to ensure that the Guard has a seat at the table in major budget and policy decisions.  We need to pick up where we left off early last year and sharpen the focus on the National Guard's role as a homeland defense and defense support to civilian authorities force. In fact, we are trying, in the realm of domestic operations and military support to civilian authorities, to do exactly what Secretary of Defense Robert Gates is trying to do in the realm of irregular warfare. The Secretary is working to ensure that at least a good portion of the Department of Defense's equipment has utility in counterinsurgency situations. The Secretary has recently testified that he foresees about 10 percent of procured equipment to be dedicated solely for counterinsurgencies. I strongly support the Secretary's initiative.  There also is a need to carve out a small wedge of the defense budget to develop technologies and systems that will help the National Guard, serving in a Title 32 capacity under the control of the Governors. Much of all Guard equipment is considered and should be ``dual use,'' but a sliver should be specially designed and used solely for domestic situations.  The Guard Empowerment bill we are introducing today will also reduce the confusion that sometimes exists when there is a domestic emergency about how National Guard forces, serving under a Governor during an emergency, will interact with active duty forces that serve under the President's command. United States Northern Command in Colorado has unfortunately only exacerbated those concerns through attempts to override Governors and take command-and-control of National Guard assets in a State even though they are in their so-called Title 32 status.  There is nothing in this bill that the National Guard is not already undertaking. The President and the Secretary of Defense look to the Guard Bureau Chief on matters related to defense at home. The Guard works to purchase homeland defense-oriented equipment through the so-called Guard and Reserve Equipment Account, and the Governors already wield active duty personnel during so-called National Security Events. The chain of command arrangements made during last year's political conventions in Minnesota and Colorado are a good example.  The President recognizes that this legislation makes sense. In his ``Blueprint for Change,'' his new Administration's national security plan, President Obama endorsed the idea of making the Guard Bureau Chief a full member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, a move that Vice President Biden also has endorsed. In developing the bill, we worked closely with The National Guard Association of the United States, the Adjutants General Association of the United States and the Enlisted National Guard Association of the United States--organizations that we expect to formally endorse the bill after its introduction.  Everyone recognizes that if there is an emergency like Katrina and our civilian resources at all levels get overwhelmed, the military is going to have to come in to assist. The American people expect no less than a swift, coordinated and effective response. And it is the National Guard that knows how to do this mission right. Providing support to civilian authorities at the State level is what the Guard has done since its inception more than two centuries ago, and it is a mission that the National Guard continues to take seriously.  This legislation solidifies and codifies sensible approaches to improving the Guard's ability to support civil authorities in an emergency. Enactment of this legislation is the very least we owe our proud citizen soldiers and airmen for their efforts.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1361       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
