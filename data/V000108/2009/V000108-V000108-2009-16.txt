Speaker, I appreciate the recognition, and because the energy and water portion of the omnibus package was mentioned, I would point out to my colleagues that we know how to say ``no,'' to say ``no'' for the right reason: for policy, as well as to save the taxpayers of this country money.  The previous administration asked for $205 million to expand the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. That would essentially, at a time of high gas prices, put the Federal Government in competition with the consumer. That was a bad idea. The subcommittee and full committee said ``no,'' and we have saved the taxpayers $205 million in this bill.  The previous administration asked for moneys for the so-called Global Nuclear Energy Partnership Act. That was zeroed out in this bill. There were not huge, vast sums of money involved, but there were taxpayers' dollars that were saved and particularly in the out years because we did not go down that road.  The previous administration wanted to proceed as far as the examination of a reliable replacement warhead absent a new nuclear strategy post-Cold War. It was not a good idea. We eliminated that money, and we saved the taxpayers of this Nation a great sum of money.
