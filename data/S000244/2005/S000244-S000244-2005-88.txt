Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. Let me say the significant point the gentleman from Kansas has made is that last year the Congress prohibited the Department of Homeland Security from using appropriated funds to change the oath. Because it is an appropriation bill, the Congress would have to renew that prohibition year after year after year. This will save us some work in the future by making the change permanent law. I support the amendment.  In 2003, the Department of Homeland Security proposed changes to the oath which every naturalized citizen must take which would have significantly weakened the oath and demeaned its historical significance. Due to strong public opposition, those changes were never implemented. However, since the oath is not set forth in federal statute, but only in regulation, the agency can modify its language at any time in the future in a similarly inappropriate way.  The Oath is the fundamental statement of allegiance to the United States and our Constitution, and this allegiance is what unites Americans of all backgrounds and provides for our commonality.  We are not a nation based upon race, creed, or religion--we are a nation based upon our loyalty and allegiance to our country and her principles. As the gateway into U.S. citizenship, the Oath should be protected by Congress.  The Oath of Allegiance has historic roots in the language of the founders. We should protect this historical statement of national unity and support the Ryun amendment. We have already set the precedent in an appropriations bill of requiring that no appropriated funds could be used to amend the Oath of Renunciation and Allegiance as it currently is memorialized in federal regulations.  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.
