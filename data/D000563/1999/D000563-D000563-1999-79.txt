As a member of the Appropriations Committee, he has had the responsibility of putting together a budget. We are supposed to make choices. Some programs are worth investing in and some are not. Instead of making the choice, the Republican leadership says let's take a cut across-the-board on all of these projects and programs.  I am not going to stand here and say there is waste, fraud, and abuse when it comes to medical research. We fund at the current time fewer than half of the requests. People come to NIH and say: We have an idea for a cure for diabetes, or something to do with asthma, arthritis. These people are vetted, the professionals look at them, the money is given.  This approach is not only going to cut a percentage off the money for medical research, it is going to delay 40 percent of the funds until the closing days of the year. So all the researchers are put on hold, and all the people out in America, worried about these medical conditions for themselves and their families, frankly, are going to be faced with that same delay.
