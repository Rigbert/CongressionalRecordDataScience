 I realize, and I don't think other people here do--I realize my friend is not ``against rail.'' He has said to me, I don't know how many times over the years: Why can't we work something out, Joe, that funds the places needed, the dense populations, the Northeast corridor? But the rest of this apparatus is bleeding us to death. And you have inefficiencies even in the corridor. Why don't we work that out?  What I am saying to my friend, and I say it sincerely, he is right in this respect. We should either decide what we mean by Amtrak, that it is the Northeast corridor and West Coast system and that's it, or we should decide it is a national system and we are going to pay the price. We should decide what it is. He is right about that debate. Let's have that debate. Whatever it comes out, in terms of reorganization, let's then make sure it can function.  I wasn't being smart with my friend. I am sincere when I say I know he is not ``against rail.'' He is against what he believes to be--and in many cases is right--total inefficiency and outrageous subsidies. That's the only way we have been able to keep the Northeast corridor going, because we had to get everyone from Texas to West Virginia and Minnesota to vote for it.
