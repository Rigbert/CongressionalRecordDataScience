Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend the conferees for including economic development funding for the Pribilof Islands. The economies of these Island communities have been struggling in the face of the ban on the fur seal harvest and the collapse of the crab and other fisheries in the area. The funding in this appropriations bill is a key step in helping the Aleut population of the Islands to develop a diversified, sustainable economy.  For over 100 years, the Federal Government controlled the Natives' fur seal harvest on the Islands, as well as their social and municipal services. In the 1980s the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Congress embarked on a plan for transition of the Islands to independence and economic self-sufficiency. One of the most important aspects of the plan was that the Federal Government would transfer control of the fur seal harvests to the Natives and permit the Natives to keep the income from the harvests. Unfortunately, one year after the plan was developed, the Government banned fur seal harvesting on environmental grounds and removed a critical source of regular income from the community.  Four years ago, the Congress enacted the Pribilof Island Transition Act, which I authored. I worked closely with my Alaska colleagues in the other body in crafting that legislation and shepherding it through the legislative process. The Act was aimed at compensating for the loss of the fur seal industry and for the delays in implementation of two other key objectives of the transition plan: construction of usable harbors and transfer of lands from NOAA to Island entities. The Transition Act authorized $28 million for economic development over a period of five years. This is the first year that funds have been appropriated for this purpose, and it comes at a crucial time.  It is my hope that additional funding for Pribilof Island economic development will be forthcoming in the years ahead.                          ____________________
