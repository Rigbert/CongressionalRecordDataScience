President, I will be very brief. I thank my colleagues, particularly Chairman Craig, Senator Gordon Smith, who was so extraordinarily helpful, Senator Bingaman, Senator Baucus, Senator Boxer, and many of our colleagues who put in a great many hours on this legislation.  Frankly, 18 months ago, they said it could not be done. This legislation 18 months ago was an ideological magnet for those who wanted to debate natural resources policy. Senator Craig and I said this legislation, which funds basic services in rural America for schools, roads, and other essential services, was beyond that kind of discussion. It was too important to try to settle all of the divisive issues about natural resources on this legislation.  I am very pleased this bipartisan legislation has been passed because this legislation sends a strong message that it is not right for Federal policies to turn rural communities into economic sacrifice zones. I believe this reinvents the relationship between local communities and the Federal lands that are so important to them. It will ensure that we can provide for the economic livelihood of folks in rural communities, but also it ensures that in the future we are going to focus on watershed restoration and conservation easements and a wide variety of measures that are going to protect ecosystems.  I thank my colleague who is on the floor, Chairman Craig. As I said, 18 months ago no one would have thought that we could be here tonight with this extraordinarily important legislation for rural America.  I yield the floor.
