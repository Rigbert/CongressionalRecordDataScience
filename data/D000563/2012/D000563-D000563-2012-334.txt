President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 9:30 a.m. on Thursday, June 28; that following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day; that the majority leader be recognized; that the first hour of debate be equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with the Republicans controlling the first half and the majority controlling the final half.
