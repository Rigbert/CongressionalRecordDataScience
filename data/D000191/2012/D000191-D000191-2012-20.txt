  Mr. DeFAZIO. On January 19, 2011, the Republicans voted to repeal ObamaCare. Thirty other times on the floor since then, they have voted to repeal ObamaCare, or part of ObamaCare. And today, for the 31st time, they will vote to repeal ObamaCare.  How about doing something productive for the American people in terms of lowering health insurance and health care costs instead of your political theater here?  The Supreme Court has ruled. Let's roll up our sleeves and improve what is the law of the land.  I propose that today we should vote on my bipartisan amendment to take away the antitrust immunity of your friends, the insurance industry, so they can't collude to drive up prices, they can't collude to restrict coverage and divide up markets and make it more expensive for all Americans. The Consumers Union says this would mean a 10 to 25 percent drop in everybody's health insurance in this country.  Let's do something real. Stop the political theater. Let's help the American people get affordable health care and health insurance.                          ____________________
