Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to also recite Mr. Hodel, the past Secretary of the Interior.  The last paragraph says, ``This legislation Chairman Young is sponsoring, H.R. 883, will bring welcome relief to property owners threatened by a United Nations bureaucracy that has grown out of control.'' I support H.R. 883 thoroughly.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Peterson).
