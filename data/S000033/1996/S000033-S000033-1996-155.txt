 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by several high school students at Champlain Valley Union High School in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Through our high school years, we have discovered the power      and voice that we as students have in our school; and we have      realized that this power of student voice is an incredibly      valuable and meaningful learning experience.       It's important to recognize that education reform,      especially when it concerns the students that say their      education . . . can be very slow. And we hope that some of      the ideas that we present today will be a springboard for      further action on the part of both students in the audience      as well as for Vermont.       It's our hope that . . . we be more of a voice, both in      schools and on a national level. And, for that reason, our      presentation is both for Congressman Sanders and for the      teachers and the students in the audience.       We believe that student voice is fundamental to provide the      necessary quality of education to our nation's youth. Student      voice empowers our students, instilling confidence and      providing opportunities for participation in the democratic      process. Student voice gives students control over their own      education, getting them interested and excited about it, and      making it more meaningful.       Student voice improves the tone and level of respect among      students, teachers and administration and other members of      the school community, building a stronger community.      Incorporating student voice into the educational experience      is a tool for developing contributing members of a democratic      society.       We attended a national conference last November, where we      came together with students and teachers from across the      country re: policy changes for student voice. And we came up      with a general policy at that conference. This first handout      that we've given Congressman Sanders (and if anyone else we      would like to copy, we'll have them available afterwards) is      kind of our own version of general policy that we created.      It's something you can bring back to your own schools, and      share with other people. The following is the policy:       School government: schools should incorporate a democratic      decision-making process where all students can be recognized;      all people in the school community should have equal      opportunity to be heard; there should be a commitment to      building this process by making it accessible, and by      providing students and staff with the time necessary to plan      and implement the school's plan of action.       For curriculum, students need to have a voice in what and      how they learn; open dialogue should exist between teachers      and students, about teacher and student evaluation.       For school tone and culture: a school should have an      atmosphere that reflects its values of student empowerment;      this includes allowing students to help shape the atmosphere      of the school; the climate of the school should be one of      open communication between all its members; students and      faculty should feel equally comfortable in discussing      concerns and suggestions. The first step towards creating a      school culture that allows for Student Voice lies within each      individual, and . . . we want to stress that each person is      responsible for speaking out, and listening, and encouraging      the voice of others. The school atmosphere should reflect the      democratic ideals of our society. In an ideal world, as well      as a democracy, every person has a voice, and so each      person's voice should be listened to and respected.       And the most important thing is ``how'' and ``what can you      do;'' and that's the second handout that we have available if      you want it. (signal) We're just going to go through reading      this is all. Here are some suggestions:       Create more funding for education; let's think about the      future; if students are empowered today, we will be prepared      tomorrow to contribute to society in an active and productive      way. But this cannot be accomplished on a shoestring budget.      . . . What is more important than education, what is more      important than our future?       Encourage students to teach each other; everyone is good at      something; finding strengths build upon them by creating      opportunities for students to teach their peers. Through this      teaching process, students will gain confidence in leadership      skills. Invite students to serve on national committees and      panels concerning education skills. Create positions for      students to advise the Secretary of Education: a student      representative in Washington.       And the final suggestion today: create charters for student      rights within your local schools, and send these charters to      other schools, and encourage them to create their own      charters. Let's begin a grassroots Student Voice Movement.      (APPLAUSE)       Congressman Sanders: I would strongly encourage all of the      schools here to get copies of these very excellent documents.      The second I'd like to ask you: to what degree are these      principles in existence now at CVU--are they in existence?       Answer. I think we're here because we have gotten these      principles from our school and from our education; and that's      not to say that every student at CVU has gotten the same      things that we have. I think that our school does an      excellent job of providing opportunities for students, but it      doesn't do quite as well in making . . . sure that all      students realize and recognize that opportunity.       Congressman Sanders: Let me ask you the last question: in      the last election nationally, only 38% of the American people      came out to vote. What do you see as the relationship between      student democracy and democracy within our country as a      whole?       Answer. It's building on the future; if we start in      schools. The problem with our democracy today is that as      students grow up in our educational system, they don't learn      that much about it. Then once they get out there into the      real world they haven't had very much practice with it, and      don't know what to do. One of the best ways to remedy that      problem is to start dealing with democracy in the schools.                          ____________________
