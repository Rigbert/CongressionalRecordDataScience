REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, we hear a hue and cry--and you and I have been doing some of the crying--about the businesses moving overseas. One reason they are doing that is, of course, there is cheap labor overseas. But the other is they can't find enough people to do the work here. So they throw their arms up and ask us to help them.  I believe it is so important we understand this legislation, of which the Senator from Illinois has been a constant supporter, and as a cosponsor of the amendment we have filed, this Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act of 2000.  Let's not confuse this. My friend from Utah raised the words: ``Illegal immigration. Aren't we supporting illegal immigration?'' Let the Record be spread with the fact this is not about illegal immigration. This has everything to do with fairness--fairness notfor some mystical people off on the horizon but for human beings who live in Las Vegas, who live in Winnemucca, or Chicago, and other places throughout America. All they want is a chance at the American dream. They are not asking for anything other than a fair hearing and the right to work as they know how.
