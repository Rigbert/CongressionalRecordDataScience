 President, as I stated many times, we are all in this body working to get to a balanced budget. I spent 2 years on the Budget Committee doing that. It was difficult, but we were moving toward it.  I say to my colleagues, $245 billion in tax cuts, if we took that back, would go a long ways in helping kids get education and caring for our senior citizens.
