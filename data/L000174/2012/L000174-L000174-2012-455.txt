On page 12, line 11 of amendment 1483, it says ``definitions--as used in this section:'' and then provides a set of definitions which includes ``material information.'' That provision very clearly applies the definition only to that new Criminal Code section, not to the rest of title 18, to the remainder of the STOCK Act, or to Federal securities law. In fact, this language was drawn from S. 401, the Leahy-Cornyn Public Corruption Prosecutions Improvement Act, and it is the legislative history of that bill and not that of the STOCK Act, that will apply when our amendment is interpreted.
