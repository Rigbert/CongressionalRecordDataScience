 President, I am a supporter of McCain-Feingold, so I am not inclined to be supportive of anything that is going to make the effort that is underway less effective in controlling these kinds of ads. The distinguished Senator from Wisconsin indicated to me while the Senator from Pennsylvania was speaking--and I apologize; I did not catch the intervention of the Senator from Tennessee because I was not on the floor, so I may be being redundant, but it was indicated to me that at least some who support this legislation, McCain-Feingold, fear that if the standard being proposed by the Senator from Pennsylvania, which I support, is adopted, we will have inadvertently put in a two-test hurdle.  I see the distinguished Senator from Maine. Maybe she can be helpful--that it would require, not only that you reach the Snowe-Jeffords standard but that you then have to meet a second standard, thereby making it even more difficult to control the kinds of ads we are trying to get at here.  I wonder if the Senator from Maine or the Senator from Wisconsin--or anyone--could tell me why they think the Snowe-Jeffords standard would, in fact, capture the kinds of ads that the Senator from Pennsylvania has been speaking to, which do not mention the name by name, or they mention by name but do not advocate whether to vote for or against that candidate. Why would such ads be captured by the language of the Snowe-Jeffords amendment? Would anybody wish to respond to that for me?
