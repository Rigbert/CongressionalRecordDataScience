Speaker, well, last week the President finally revealed a few more specifics about the direction he wants to take to deal with the potential, possible, future funding shortfalls in Social Security. He used some unfortunate verbiage. He said Social Security will be bankrupt in 2041. It will not be bankrupt; it will pay 75 percent of promised benefits under very conservative economic assumptions into the indefinite future, or 2053 if we use the estimates of the Republican Congressional Budget Office. So it would not be bankrupt in any sense.  But he did talk about the possibility there could be a shortfall in Social Security starting 40 or 50 years from today. That is progress that he is beginning to talk about that problem. He actually offered a solution, for once. His privatization plan he has admitted would in fact make Social Security's finances worse, has nothing to do with dealing with the future possible potential shortfalls in the Social Security trust fund, the program as we know it today. He said, finally, let us talk about how we might get there.  He cloaked benefit cuts in a veneer in high-falutin rhetoric. He called it progressive indexing of wages. What he is talking about is benefit cuts. Who would pay the benefit cuts? Let us take someone who is 22 years old, graduated from college last year. They are a public schoolteacher. They are going to work the next 40 years as a public schoolteacher and hope to retire in their 60s with a Social Security benefit. If they earn $36,000 average over their lifetime, their benefits would be cut by 16 percent, $3,000 a year. Their proposed benefit would go from $19,800 down to $16,500. These are calculations of the Social Security actuaries of the President's proposed cuts.  Now let us say that young person graduating from college is going to become an entrepreneur, small business person and do pretty well with a truly small business, and they average $58,000 a year throughout their lifetime. What would the President do to them? He would cut their Social Security benefit from $26,000 to $19,800 which would be a 25-percent cut which they could get if Social Security went, under the President's words, bankrupt. That is if Congress did nothing and Social Security had a shortfall starting 40 or 50 years from today. Under the worst-case scenario, that person would get the same. But the President wants to guarantee a cut in that person's benefits. Remember, this does not have anything to do with the President's privatization plan which would further undermine the finances of Social Security and accelerate the date of what the President calls bankruptcy, others call trust fund exhaustion, I call benefit reductions.  The funny thing is that half of the American people pay more in taxes to Social Security than Federal income taxes. They have a lot invested in this program, and they would like to see the benefits when they retire.  Now, it is a little different for rich people. Let us take the President on his modest $400,000 which is a lot less than he earns from his private investments. Let us just take his salary and pretend that is all he has. He stopped paying Social Security taxes on the morning of March 24. That Americanthat earns $36,000 or $58,000 or even $90,000 pays Social Security tax every day of the year, this year, with the expectation they will get a benefit; but not so for people who earn more, $90,000, including Members of Congress. When income hits $90,000, the tax goes away. The President stopped paying on March 24, and he wants to cut the benefits of people who pay that tax every day this year, many of them a bigger tax than they pay to the Federal Government under income taxes, particularly low-income people.  Let us take some other friends of the President. The heads of Viacom, Tom Freston and Les Moonves, they stopped paying the Social Security tax at 4 a.m. on January 2 because they earn $77,000 a day. So at 4 a.m. on January 2, their obligations to Social Security went away. Despite their huge $20 million salary, they will pay one one-thousandth of 1 percent of their salary to Social Security, but working Americans are going to pay 6.2 percent of every paycheck and self-employed will pay 12.4 percent of every paycheck, and the President wants to cut their benefits. But he does not want to cut the tax cuts for Mr. Moonves or Mr. Freston, and he does not want to cut the tax cuts for himself.  There is a better way to solve the Social Security problem, and I will talk about that another day.                          ____________________[Pages H2745-H2746]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                  SOCIAL SECURITY WILL NOT GO BANKRUPT  Mr. DeFAZIO.
