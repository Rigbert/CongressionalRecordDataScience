President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. Today, the Medicare Program is a fee-for-volume system. The underlying bill junks this and turns out the lights on millions of users.  The underlying bill before the Senate says the future will be about rewarding value and good quality care for our Medicare patients. The Cotton amendment embraces the outdated status quo and says there is no need to coordinate care, no need to pay for value, no need to pay for quality for our Medicare patients. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.
