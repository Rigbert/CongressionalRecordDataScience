But I did not see that during the hearings. He deferred to the official policies of this administration throughout the Judiciary Committee proceedings.  When asked about the Bybee memo, he said:       I don't have a disagreement with the conclusions then      reached by the Department.  And he stated a patently false reading of the torture convention that would allow for foreigners captured overseas to be subjected to cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment at the hands of American captors or surrogates. He appeared to accept the notion that the President has the authority to immunize somebody to commit torture under his command.  A letter signed by a number of high-ranking former military officers, including the former head of the Joint Chiefs, GEN John Shalikashvili, said the interrogation policies that Judge Gonzales helped to define ``have fostered greater animosity toward the United States, undermined our intelligence-gathering efforts, and added to the risks facing our troops serving around the world.''  The best evidence we have is that he rejected the advice of Secretary Powell and career military officers when he recommended to the President the Geneva Conventions should not apply to the conflict in Afghanistan. Admiral John D. Hutson, the former Judge Advocate General of the Navy, testified to the Judiciary Committee that the advice given by Judge Gonzales to the President on this point was ``shallow in its legal analysis, short-sighted in its implications, and altogether ill-advised. Frankly, it was just wrong.''  These military men are joined in opposition to this nomination by a large number of organizations, including the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the La Raza Centro Legal, and the Mexican-American Political Association. Three leading human rights organizations, Human Rights Watch, Human Rights First, and Physicians for Human Rights, none of which have ever opposed a nomination before, did so for the very first time. They acknowledge that the struggle to stamp out torture around the world ``has been made harder by the legal positions adopted by the Bush Administration, including Mr. Gonzales's refusal to state that a President could not lawfully order torture.'' The Congressional Hispanic Caucus and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund both issued statements stating that they cannot support this nomination. I ask unanimous consent to include in the Record a list of organizations opposing or not supporting the nomination.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    Organizations Opposed to the Confirmation of Alberto R.
