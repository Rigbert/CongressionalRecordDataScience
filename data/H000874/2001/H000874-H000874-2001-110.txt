Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, first of all, let me respond to what I perceive to be the unfortunate assertion of the gentleman from California with reference to corruption. He uses that word awfully lightly. No such things were ever frankly as I recall asserted even. They may have asserted that there was an overuse, but the word corruption I cannot recall being used. I think it was unfortunate that the gentleman from California used it. There is no such proof of any of that allegation.  The gentleman from Illinois talked about demeaning the House. I did not really get into it, but let me tell you, for the last 6 years we have heard rhetoric like that. The chances of this provision being included in this bill if it were Vice President Gore, the Vice President of the United States, are zero.  I do not say that because I speculate or that is my opinion. It is because I served on this committee for the last 6 years.                              {time}  1430  I saw the attention to detail and the objections that were raised repeatedly by this committee's majority on expenditures and fine-tooth-comb analysis of those expenditures. This is not about corruption. This is about policy.  Now, I am not going to get deeply into this debate, but I do want to respond as forcefully as I know how to the assertion that somehow these amendments are different than amendments that have been offered in the past by the majority when the other party, my party, was in control of the White House and the Vice Presidency. Very frankly, we can debate these on policy grounds; I think that is appropriate.  There is no assertion here that the Vice President has done something wrong because they suggest that consumables be donated to the Navy for use at the Vice President's residency. What is asserted by the gentleman from New York is that this, again, takes out of our purview, first of all, the oversight on the expenditures, and, secondly, opens up the Vice President's residency to substantial private sector donations. Not to the Vice President's residency, but to the Navy, and puts the Secretary of the Navy inthe position of accepting these donations. That is the issue before us, as to whether or not that is appropriate.
