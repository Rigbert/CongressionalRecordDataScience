President, also, before he leaves the floor, I intend to talk about the ethical quagmire at the Minerals Management Service. I commend Senator Nelson, who really, just as he said, always does try to be bipartisan. We work together as part of a large health care group. Senator Nelson was one of the first to spot these flagrant examples of abuse at the Minerals Management Service. I know he is going to be part of our effort to finally drain the swamp at the Minerals Management Service next week. I thank my friend from Florida for his efforts in that regard.                          ____________________
