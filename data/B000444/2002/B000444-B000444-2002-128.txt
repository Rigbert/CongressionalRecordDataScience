 President, I support Senator Kerry's amendment to strengthen the protections for State and local government to achieve their environmental and other important priorities. The Kerry Amendment adds to the objectives that our negotiators will seek to achieve in future trade discussions. While we cannot mandate specific outcomes in those negotiations, we here in Congress will be able to look at future trade agreements to make sure that they include additional safeguards for the kinds of regulations that some international investors have challenged under NAFTA's Chapter 11.  We all agree that to make trade work, to bring the benefits of expanding markets to American workers and consumers, we must give investors the confidence that the countries they move into will not discriminate against them. They need to know that they will not have plants and equipment expropriated, or rendered worthless through some government regulation or other action.  But such protections can go too far, as many observers of actions taken under NAFTA investor-state provisions have concluded. The Kerry Amendment makes sure that our negotiators will be careful to balance the need for investor protections with the need for state and local governments to protect their citizens as they see fit. That is the kind of balance that will help to restore popular support for the many real benefits of expanded trade, and will help to secure Congressional support for future trade agreements.
