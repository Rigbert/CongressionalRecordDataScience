 We will have further discussion postcloture. I think we have a good product. This conference report is basically the Senate-passed bankruptcy bill with certain minimal changes made to accommodate the House of Representatives. The means test retains the essential flexibility that we passed in the Senate. The new consumer protections sponsored by Senator Reed of Rhode Island relating to reaffirmation is in our conference report before the Senate. The credit card disclosure sponsored by Senator Torricelli is also in this final conference report. We also maintain Senator Leahy's special protections for victims of domestic violence and Senator Feingold's special protections for expenses associated with caring for nondependent family members.  I think it is pretty clear that on the consumer bankruptcy side, we maintain the Senate's position. Anybody who says otherwise has not read the conference report.  It is also important to realize how much of an improvement this legislation is for child support claims. The organizations that specialize in tracking down deadbeat fathers think this bill will be a tremendous help in collecting child support.  I have a letter I am going to ask to have printed in the Record from Mr. Philip Strauss of the Family Support Bureau of the San Francisco district attorney's office. Mr. Strauss notes that professional organizations of people who actually collect child support       . . . have endorsed the child support provisions of the      Bankruptcy Reform Act as crucially needed modifications of      the Bankruptcy Code, which will significantly improve the      collection of support during bankruptcy.  There you have it. According to people in the front lines, the bankruptcy bill is good for collecting child support. So I say to my colleagues, if you have concerns about child support, look at this letter.  I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          District Attorney Family                                               Support Bureau,                            San Francisco, CA, September 14, 1999.     Re S. 625 [Bankruptcy Reform Act].       Dear Senators: I am writing this letter in response to the      July 14, 1999 letter prepared     by the National Women's Law Center. That letter asserts in      conclusory terms that the Bankruptcy Reform Act would put      women and children support creditors at greater risk than      they are under current bankruptcy law. The letter ends with      the endorsement of numerous women's organizations.       I have been engaged in the profession of collecting child      support for the past 27 years in the Office of the District      Attorney of San Francisco, Family Support Bureau. I have      practiced and taught bankruptcy law for the past ten years. I      participated in the drafting of the child support provisions      in the House version of bankruptcy reform and testified on      those provisions before the House Subcommittee on Commercial      and Administrative Law this year.       I believe it is important to point out that none of the      organizations opposing this legislation which are listed in      the July 14th letter actually engages in the collection of      support. On the other hand, the largest professional      organizations which perform this function have endorsed the      child support provisions of the Bankruptcy Reform Act as      crucially needed modifications of the Bankruptcy Code which      will significantly improve the collection of support during      bankruptcy. These organizations include:       1. The National Child Support Enforcement Association.       2. The National District Attorneys Association.       3. The National Association of Attorneys General.       4. The Western Interstate Child Support Enforcement      Council.       The thrust of the criticism made by the National Women's      Law Center is that by not discharging certain debts owed to      credit and finance companies, the institutions would be in      competition with women and children for scarce resources of      the debtor and that the bill fails ``to insure that support      payments will come first.'' They say that the ``bill does not      ensure that, in this intensified competition for the debtor's      limited resources, parents and children owed support will      prevail over the sophisticated collection departments of      these powerful interests.''       With all due respect, nothing could be further from the      truth. While the argument is superficially plausible, it      ignores the reality of the mechanisms actually available      for collection of domestic support obligations in contrast      with those available for non-support debts.       Absent the filing of the bankruptcy case, no professional      support collector considers the existence of a debt to a      financial institution as posing a significant obstacle to the      collection of the support debt. The reason is simple: the      tools available to collect support debts outside of the      bankruptcy process are vastly superior to those available to      financial institutions and, in the majority of cases, take      priority over the collection of non-support debts.       More than half of all child support is collected by      earnings withholding. Under federal law such procedures have      priority over any other garnishments of the debtor's salary      or wages and can take as much as 65% of such salary or wages.      By contrast the Consumer Credit Act prevents non-support      creditors from enforcing their debts by garnishing more that      twenty-five percent of the debtor's salary.       In addition, there are many other techniques that are only      made available to support creditors and not to those      ``sophisticated collection departments of . . . [those]      powerful interests:'' These include:       1. Interception of state and federal tax refunds to pay      child support arrears.       2. Garnishment or interception of Workers' Compensation or      Unemployment Insurance Benefits.       3. Free or low cost collection services provided by the      government.       4. Use of interstate processes to collect support      arrearage, including interstate earnings withholding orders      and interstate real estate support liens.       5. License revocation for support delinquents.       6. Criminal prosecution and contempt procedures for failing      to pay support debts.       7. Federal prosecution for nonpayment of support and      federal collection of support debts.       8. Denial of passports to support debtors.       9. Automatic treatment of support debts as judgments which      are collectible under state judgment laws, including      garnishment, execution, and real and personal property liens.       10. Collection of support debts from exempt assets.       11. The right of support creditors or their representatives      to appear in any bankruptcy court without the payment of      filing fees or the requirements of formal admission.       While the above list is not exhaustive, it is illustrative      of the numerous advantages given to support creditors over      other creditors. And while all of these advantages may not      ultimately guarantee that support will be collected, they      profoundly undermine the assumption of the National Women's      Law Center that the mere existence of financial institution      debt will somehow put support creditors at a disadvantage. To      put it otherwise, support may sometimes be difficult to      collect, but collection of support debt does not become more      difficult simply because financial institutions also seek to      collect their debts.       The National Women's Law Center analysis includes without      specification that the support ``provisions fail to insure      that support payments will come first, ahead of the increased      claims of the commercial creditors.'' Professional support      collectors, on the other hand, have no trouble in      understanding how this bill will enhance the collection of      support ahead of the increased claims of commercial      creditors. To them, such creditors are irrelevant outside the      bankruptcy process. And in light of the treatment of domestic      support obligations as priority claims under current law and      the enhanced priority treatment of such claims in the      proposed legislation, this objection seems particularly      unfounded.       Where support creditors are indeed at a disadvantage under      current law is during the bankruptcy of a support debtor.      Under existing bankruptcy law support creditors frequently      have to hire attorneys to enforce support obligations during      bankruptcy or attempt the treacherous task of maneuvering      through the complexities of bankruptcy process themselves.      Attorneys working in the federal child support program--     indeed, even experienced family law attorneys--may find      bankruptcy courts and procedures so unfamiliar that they are      ineffective in ensuring that the debtor pays all support when      due. Ideally, procedures for the enforcement of support      during bankruptcy should be self-executing and uninterrupted      by the bankruptcy process. The pending bankruptcy reform      legislation goes far in this direction. To suggest that women      and children support creditors are not vastly aided by this      bill is to ignore the specifics of the legislation.       In the first place support claims are given the highest      priority. Commercial debts do not have any statutory      priority. Thus when there is competition between commercial      and support creditors, support creditors will be paid first.      And, unlike commercial creditors, support creditors must be      paid in full when the debtor files a case under chapter 12 or      13. Unlike payments to commercial creditors, the trustee      cannot recover as preferential transfers support payments      made during the ninety days preceding the filing of the      bankruptcy petition, and liens securing support may not be      avoided as they may be with commercial judgment liens. Unlike      commercial creditors, support creditors may collect their      debts through interception of income tax refunds, license      revocations, and adverse credit reporting, all--under this      bill--without the need to seek relief from the automatic      bankruptcy stay.       In addition, support creditors will benefit--again, unlike      commercial creditors--from chapter 12 and 13 plans which must      provide for full payment of on-going support and unassigned      support arrears. Further benefits to support creditors which      are not available to commercial creditors is the security in      knowing that chapter 12 and 13 debtors will not be able to      discharge other debts unless all postpetion support and      prepetition unassigned arrears have been paid in full.       Finally, and most importantly, support creditors will      receive--even during bankruptcy--current support and      unassigned arrearage payments through the federally mandated      earnings withholding procedures without the usual      interruption caused by the filing of a bankruptcy case. Like      many other provisions of the bill, this provision is self-     executing, the bankruptcy proceeding will not affect this      collection process. Frankly, and contrary to the assertions      of the National Women's Law Center, it is difficult to      conceive how this bill could better insure that ``support      payments will come first, ahead of the increased claims of      the commercial creditors.''       The National Women's Law Center states that some      improvements were made in the Senate Judiciary Committee.      This organization may wish to think twice about that      conclusion. What the Senate amendments did was to distinguish      in some cases between support arrears that are assigned (to      the government) and those that are unassigned (owned directly      to the parent). The NWLC might have a point if assigned      arrears were strictly government property and provided no      benefit to women and children creditors. However, upon a      closer look, arrears assigned to the government may greatly      inure to the benefit of such creditors.       In the first place the entire federal child support program      was created to recover support which should have been paid by      absent parents, but was not. Such recovered funds became and      remain a source of funding to pay public assistance benefits,      especially by the states which contribute about one half of      the costs of such benefits.       More directly significant, however, is the fact that under      the welfare legislation of 1996 (the Personal Responsibility      and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act) support arrearage      assigned to the government and not collected during the      period aid is paid reverts to the custodial parent when aid      ceases. This scenario will become increasingly common in the      very near future as the five year lifetime right to public      assistance ends for individual custodial parents. In such      cases this parent will face the double whammy of being      disqualified from receiving the caretaker share of public      assistance and--because of the Senate amendments--not      receiving arrears or intercepted tax refunds because they      were assigned at the time the debtor filed for bankruptcy      protection.       In addition, prior to the Senate Judiciary Committee      amendments a debtor could not obtain confirmation of a plan      if he were not current in making all postpetition support      payments. The advantage of this scheme was that it was self-     executing. Under the Senate amendments a debtor may obtain      confirmation even when he is not paying his on-going support      obligation. He is only required to     provide for such payments in his plan. In such cases it will      then be the burden of the support creditor to bring a      bankruptcy proceeding to dismiss the case if the debtor stops      paying. While this procedure is a welcome addition to the      arsenal of remedies available to support creditors, it should      not have supplanted the self-executing remedy which required      the debtor to certify he was current in postpetition support      payments before the court could confirm the plan.       While the Senate version of bankruptcy reform should      certainly be amended to restore the advantages of the earlier      draft, it does, even in its present form, provide crucial      improvements in the protections and advantages afforded      spousal and child support creditors over other creditors      during the bankruptcy process. These improvements will ease      the plight of all support creditors--men, women, and      children--whose well-being and prosperity may be wholly or      partially dependent on the full and timely payment of      support. Congress has created the federal child support      program within title IV-D of the Social Security Act. It is      the opinion of those whose job it is to carry out this      program that the Bankruptcy Reform Act provides the long      overdue assistance needed for success in collecting money      during bankruptcy for child and spousal support creditors.       Most of the concerns raised by the groups opposing the bill      do not, in fact, center on the language of the domestic      support provisions themselves. Instead they are based on      vague generalized statements that the bill hurts debtors, or      the women and children living with debtors, or the ex-wives      and children who depend on the debtor for support. It is      difficult to respond point by point to such claims when they      provide no specifics, but they appear to fall into two      categories.       The first suggests that the reform legislation will result      in leaving debtors with greater debt after bankruptcy which      will ``compete'' with the claims of former spouses and      children. As discussed above there is little likelihood that      such competition would adversely affect the collection of      support debts. In any event the bill does little to change      the number or types of nondischargeable debt held by      commercial lenders. it will slightly expand the presumption      of nondischargeability for luxury goods charged during the      immediate pre-bankruptcy period and will make debt incurred      to pay a nondischargeable debt also nondischargeable. It is      doubtful that either provision will, in reality, have much      effect on the vast majority of ``poor but honest'' debtors      who do not use bankruptcy as a financial planning mechanism      or run up debts immediately before filing for bankruptcy in      anticipation of discharging those obligations.       The second contention is presumably directed at a number of      provisions in the bill that are designed to eliminate      perceived abuses by debtors in the current system. The      primary brunt of this attack is borne by the so-called      ``means testing'' or ``needs based bankruptcy'' provisions      which would amend the current language of Section 707(b).      Most of the opposition appears to stem from the notion      that means testing would be a wholly novel proposition.      Such a conclusion is plainly incorrect. Virtually every      court that has ever considered the issue holds that      Section 707(b) already includes a means test or, more      accurately, a hundred or a thousand means tests, one for      each judge who considers the issue. The current Code      language sets no standards or guidelines for applying this      test, thus leaving the outcome of a motion subject to the      unstructured discretion of each bankruptcy judge. The      proposed bankruptcy reform legislation attempts to      prescribe one test that all courts must apply.       The precise terms of that standard have been under constant      revision since the bankruptcy reform bills were introduced      last year, and undoubtedly they will continue to be fine-     tuned to ensure that they strike a balance between preventing      abuse and becoming unduly expensive and burdensome. But mere      opposition to any change in the present law, and vague claims      that any and all attempts to address such existing abuses as      serial filings are oppressive and will harm women and      children, does nothing to advance the dialogue. And worse,      the critics appear content to sacrifice the palpable      advantages which this legislation would provide to support      creditors during the bankruptcy process for defeat of this      legislation based on vague and unarticulated fears that women      will be unfairly disadvantaged as bankruptcy debtors. In more      ways than one the critics would favor throwing out the baby      with the bath water. No one who has a genuine interest in the      collection of support should permit such inexplicit and      speculative fears to supplant the specific and considerable      advantages which this reform legislation provides to those in      need of support.           Yours very truly,                                                Philip L. Strauss,                                      Assistant District Attorney.
