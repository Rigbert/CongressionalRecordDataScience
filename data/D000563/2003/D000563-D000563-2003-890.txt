HATCH. Let me finish my remarks and, of course, I will. But to come here with crocodile tears and tell us that he just did not do enough and he did not answer the questions when he did, in fact, do so, and to misrepresent, as some have done--I am not saying the distinguished Senator from Illinois because I have not heard all of his remarks; people will have to judge that for themselves. But to come here and make those kinds of accusations when this man had one of the longest hearings, answered many more questions than almost any Clinton circuit court of appeals nominee had to answer when I was chairman, and to act like he does not deserve to have an up-or-down vote on the Senate floor, which we gave to every Clinton nominee, I think is a little bit beyond the pale, and I think that is what has been happening around here.  Personally, I resent it, on behalf of the United States of America and on behalf of this Hispanic nominee who has all of these qualifications which I believe even the Senator from Illinois has acknowledged.
