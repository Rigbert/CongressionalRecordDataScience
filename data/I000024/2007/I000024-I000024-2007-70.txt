President, I think we need to be real clear what we are talking about. What we are talking about is telling the enemy what we are going to do. If there is one thing they have said, our military has said we cannot do, is to leave precipitously and let them know when we are going to do it. But that is what we are talking about.  You know, when General Petraeus came a couple of weeks ago, I knew exactly what he was going to say because I was over there--I have been over there actually 15 times in the AOR of Iraq, not always in Iraq, sometimes Afghanistan, Djibouti and all of that.  But I have watched very carefully, from time to time when I have been there, what progress has been made. I was in shock the last two trips we took.
