That is why I took it jocularly and moved on.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield again, I do not want to prejudge the chairman of the Committee on Rules or the Committee on Rules on what they would do, but I think, I think this budget enforcement process bill is a very important piece of legislation. It defines who we are and where we want to take this country, and I am saying, ``we'' the House and both parties, and I think a free and open debate should be warranted.
