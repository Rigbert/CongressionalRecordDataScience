President, I truly appreciate the response of the Senator from Texas. The reason I ask that is we are losing a $17.5 million health and dental clinic and a $5.7 million child development center, which will make an enormous difference in the quality of life in regards to the soldiers coming back.  There is another project I want to mention, and the Senator has brought it up. We need a $27 million battle command training center. What is that all about? That is 4,000 people going through that center which is going to be improved, who are going immediately to Iraq to serve under General Petraeus to see if that mission can work, and they are following the doctrine General Petraeus laid down at Fort Leavenworth, KS, which is the intellectual center of the Army. This center is necessary for training command, control, and communications functions that are critical to the training of the brigade and division staff. If you don't want to have them go to Iraq, rest assured they need the training to basically have them prepared for any kind of national security threat in the future.  Another Kansas project in jeopardy of losing funding that is of deep concern to me and should be of deep concern to the Army is the joint regional correctional facility at Fort Leavenworth. This is a little different. I don't know if the Senator has something like this, but I would ask the Senator a question. We need to build a joint regional correctional facility to house prisoners from around the Nation who are moved to Kansas. Currently, the Army is stretched to its limit. It needs these new beds for prisoners, and as the general told me, there is no place to put them.  The Acting Commanding General at Fort Leavenworth, BG Mark O'Neill, told me yesterday, add to the equation that the facility is underfunded at $68 million--they need $95 million at a bare minimum. What do we do with the prisoners? That is $27 million more than was even budgeted.  So the House is saying they will receive zip, nada, zero. Now, that is a correctional facility. I know it doesn't compare to the readiness problem, but with more prisoners and no place to put them, what are we going to do? That is a real problem.  I want to give you some good news, and I am going to ask the Senator if she has a similar situation in Texas. Kansas leaders share my concern. Last night, our Governor Sebelius's Military Council passed a unanimous resolution supporting our efforts to bring this amendment before the Senate.  I ask unanimous consent the letter of support be printed in the Record at this point.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      Governor's Military Council,                                                State Capitol,                                     Topeka, KS, February 7, 2007.     Hon. Pat Roberts,     U.S. Senator,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Roberts: Today, the Governor's Military      Council (GMC) passed unanimously a resolution in support of      your amendment to H.J. Res. 20 which would fully restore      funding for implementation of the 2005 Base Realignment and      Closure (BRAC) round to the level requested by the      Administration.       Full funding of the BRAC budget request is critical to      military readiness, quality of life, as well as Department of      Defense's transformation efforts. Furthermore, failure to      fully fund the budget for BRAC will delay implementation of      base closure and realignment actions, postponing indefinitely      the realization of budget savings resulting from the BRAC      round and the completion of BRAC movements for all affected      military installations.       The GMC was originally constituted through an Executive      Order signed by Governor Kathleen Sebelius as the Governor's      Strategic Military Planning Commission (The Commission) in      January of 2004 to represent the State of Kansas during the      2005 BRAC process.       In January of 2006, the Commission stood down and the GMC      was created by another Executive Order to support the      military in the State of Kansas. The GMC's membership      consists of 25 individuals from the communities in which the      state's four major installations are located, state      legislators, the Adjutant General and representatives of the      Kansas Congressional Delegation.       We thank you for your leadership on the issue of critical      importance to our nation's military and the military      installations in the State of Kansas.           Sincerely,                                                    John E. Moore,                               Chair, Governor's Military Council.
