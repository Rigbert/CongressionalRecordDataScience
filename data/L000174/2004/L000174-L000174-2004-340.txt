President, it saddens me to rise today to speak about the situation in Burma. Burma is a beautiful country with a rich history. Regrettably, this great nation, with so much potential, is being destroyed by the despotic junta, the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC.  Natural resources are pillaged, ethnic minorities are brutally repressed, and most notably, Nobel Laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi, is under house arrest--denying her the right to help lead her nation.  For more than a decade, the brutal and autocratic regime, the SPDC has played an outrageous ``game'' with Aung San Suu Kyi. It goes something like this: pretend to allow Aung San Suu Kyi freedom to move around the country; when her movements become too threatening, put her under house arrest; keep her there until international pressure becomes too intense; eventually let her out, starting it all over again. In other words, isolate Aung San Suu Kyi and stall for time, while looting the country of its resources.  Once again, we find ourselves in this situation. About a year ago, the SPDC launched a vicious, pre-meditated attack against Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of the NLDF. The SPDC then placed Aung San Suu Kyi under house arrest, using the absurd justification that it is for her own safety. Virtually nothing has changed since that time. Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest and the outrageous activities of the SPDC continue unabated.  It is for this reason that I join Senators McConnell and Feinstein today in introducing the joint resolution to extend the sanctions provided for in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act. The senior Senators from Kentucky and California have already discussed the situation in Burma and made the case why this legislation is so important. I want to associate myself with their remarks and will be brief here today.  The message that we are sending to the ruling junta in Burma is clear: its behavior is outrageous. Aung San Suu Kyi is the rightful leader of the democratic opposition in Burma. She and other opposition leaders must be immediately released.  But, as important as U.S. leadership is on this issue, we all know it is not enough. Burma's neighbors--India, Thailand, and China--must also act. For too long, the silence of these key nations has been deafening. To obtain real change in Burma, these and other nations in the region must change course, speak out and disavow the failed policies of engagement.  I know that the sponsors of the legislation recognize this. I have heard Senator McConnell speak frequently of the need for a ``full court press'' by the international community on this issue. While I am not so naive as to believe that this legislation will instantly cause a change of heart among the SPDC, I am hopeful that constant pressure U.S. pressure and others will, one day, lead to a breakthrough.  Everyone in the Senate would like to see the SPDC tossed on the ash heap of history, but there is widespread recognition that this regime is well entrenched and will not go away overnight. The immediate goal should be to get Aung San Suu Kyi out of house arrest and give her and the NLDF an equal seat at the table. Considering that the NLDF was democratically elected to lead Burma, this is a modest goal indeed.  Aung San Suu Kyi and her supporters have been denied for too long. It is time for a change in Burma. I hope that this is the beginning of the end for the SPDC and the start of a new era in Burma, allowing that country and its people to achieve the democracy and progress they deserve.                          ____________________
