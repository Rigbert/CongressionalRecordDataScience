Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for rising and for yielding as well. I had not heard of Joe's passing.  When I came to the Congress of the United States in 1981, my office was two doors from Joe Skeen's. As we all do, we had the opportunity to walk down the fifth floor corridor of the Longworth building to vote and we talk and get to know one another. And Suzanne, his chief of staff, and I became good friends, and Joe became an extraordinarily good friend. Joe chaired a subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations.  Mr. Speaker, Joe Skeen was one of those Members who added greatly to the comity of this body. He had deep convictions, but he also had a deep respect for those with whom he served. Joe Skeen will be missed by New Mexico, by his family, but he will also be missed by this House and by the American people. At a time when the relations between the parties is not what really it ought to be in this House, and perhaps in this country, Joe Skeen was one of those who demonstrated that differences on policy did not need to be accompanied by enmity between the Members of this House. He will be sorely missed. And I thank the gentlewoman for giving me this opportunity to say how loved Joe Skeen was by all who knew him.
