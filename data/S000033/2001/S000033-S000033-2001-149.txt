 Speaker, today I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this summer. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.  I am asking that these statements be printed in the Congressional Record, as I believe that the views of these young persons will benefit my colleagues.                           Regarding Napster                          (By Hydie Buchanan)       I am here today to talk about whether it is right to shut      down Napster over the record companies' feeling it infringes      on the copyrights of artists.       This case first started in April 1999 when the recording      industry brought a lawsuit against Napster, saying that      Napster violated copyrighted material. Since then, just      recently, district courts ruled that Napster has to put      blocks on copyrighted material, which Napster has complied      with.       However, although it is against Napster's file-sharing      rules to change file names to get around the copyrighted      blocks, people change a song, they add letters or numbers to      the file name, and therefore it can pass the block. And      although Napster says that they will warn people and then      kick them off the Napster community, there is over 500,000      users, so it is kind of hard to keep track of them all.       It's not that many artists are intimated by Napster. Many      artists actually support Napster. It is the recording      industry that thinks they are losing profits, when, in all      reality, profits were up in 1999 because of Napster.       I have a few quotes to share about artists who support      Napster. Dave Matthews Band, in July 2000, said: ``There are      a lot of bigger problems in the world than whether Napster      succeeds or fails. I don't think there is a malice coming out      of Napster. We allowed people to tape our concerts from the      beginning, and the record company questioned us about      allowing that.       My thinking was that it only makes people want to buy more,      and increases the devotion of people who are really going to      listen to us.'' Which, in this case, shows that he supports      Napster because it promotes the music, not takes away      profits, but actually increases them.       Another quote: ``We're not afraid of the Internet. We think      it is a very cool way to reach our fans. If a band sells 12      million albums, what are we supposed to say? `Oh, maybe we      could have sold 13 million if we had just been Internet      Nazis.'       At a certain point you have to say, Let the people have the      music.''       Dexter Holland, from Offspring: ``Many of the bands that      support Napster are maybe not the manufactured bands created      as boy bands, the popular music of today.'' A lot of people      think that Napster doesn't infringe on copyrights. And it      really doesn't. Napster does not copy the MP3s. The people      that are on Napster, they're the ones that create the MP3s,      either from the program that they downloaded off the Internet      or burning the--ripping the CD onto their hard drive. So,      really, it's not Napster. They just created a community where      people can swap everything, and that is not necessarily so      wrong.       A lot of people that use Napster use it as a way to find      out more about an artist. Like, say they hear one song on the      radio and they want to hear more about the band before they      go out and buy the CD. So that's actually helping the      profits, So, really, the recording industry, they shouldn't      stop people from doing that, because it is promoting the      music.       Also, Napster is not the only company of its sort. There      are many other file-sharing companies out there, such as      Scour or Livewire, that also have the same sort of system      with filesharing. It is also the same thing as, say, burning      a CD for your friend, or recording a tape of songs off the      radio. It is all the same thing. And, sure, they said     that recording CDs and tapes is illegal, but never really did      anything about it.       In order to shut Napster down, I think you would have to      stop selling the recordable CDs and recordable tapes, because      it is all the same thing. And you would also have to go out      onto the Internet and search for every site like Napster in      order to shut them all down, because shutting one down out of      thousands isn't really fair.                                  ____                                                Regarding Abenaki and Native American Issues                          (By Fellicia Gagne)       I am here today to talk about the lack of academic success      among minorities, specifically Abenakis. Basically what I'm      going to be talking about is from last year's Vermont      Framework of Standards, which all schools are supposed to      take, show that 19 percent of tenth grade Native Americans      met the reading and knowledge interpretation. This means that      81 percent can't read a one- to two-paragraph passage and      understand and interpret what they have read.       In mathematical skills, the test shows that American      Indians fall 52 percent below standards. Only 14 percent meet      the standards, which is really low. The difficulty is with      fractions, multiplying, et cetera. What that means is they      have difficulty with basics, rather than what normal students      would be able to do.       Continuing, I would like to talk about why this is      happening. Abenakis are a majority of my school, and like      over 50 percent fall below standards. And I don't see why      that should be happening. If Abenakis aren't meeting      standards now, then how do they expect to go to college, get      a degree, and have a good life? That means that my people,      Abenakis, would be lower in poverty, wouldn't be able to      support their families, and it is just going to keep      happening over and over and over again.       This has been happening for years and years, and I feel      that it should have been changed long ago. What are the      reasons that this is happening? Racism, maybe. It has been in      society and schools for years, and probably never will leave.      Also, Eugenic Survey. This could also prove what had happened      during the 1920s through the '40s.       A professor at UVM thought that he would improve Vermont.      He thought that he could cleanse or change genetically      inferior people. Because we were different, we had to go      through a phase where you had to feel uncomfortable, you      couldn't be proud of who you are or what you have been as an      individual, and you lost a lot of your dignity, your pride.       And, in 1931, Vermont had a sterilization law, and it      remained until 1973. The effects of the survey were loss of      pride, dignity, and loss of heritage. Many students today      that are Abenaki either don't know it or they don't know      about their heritage, because it has been lost, because of      the Eugenics Survey. If someone can't be proud of who they      are or who they come from, then how do they expect to show      proudness in everything that they do?       Another reason why Abenakis lack the academics is because      of courses in teaching at my school, students feel separated      and intimidated at school. People are put in certain classes      and special groups where they feel that they're not      intermingled enough. They don't have the right people to be      around them, where they will feel that they fit in with all      these topics.       I would like to talk about how we can make things better.      There will be core-plus classes next year, which means that      our school is trying core-plus classes. Whether you are an      honor student or an applied student, you are going to be in      the same class. That could start issues with honor students      being bored or people being rushed into things.       Mr. Barnett, a teacher at my school, he tries to teach      reading and writing in all of his classes. He tries to help      students improving the skills that they need in everyday      life. And he is one of the many at my school that are trying      to change. But I think you need the whole school to help make      a difference, or it's not going to--it's not going to have an      effect.       Another way that you could make things better is through      volunteer work. My family and I help out at a learning      center. It is the Abenaki Learning Center in Swanton. Four      days a week, we help kids with homework, and we try and help      them understand the basics of what they need for when they      get into high school. We open kids to Native American arts      and crafts, and we do cooking with them.       And I feel that, if you are Abenaki or if you are not, you      should know a little about the background of the Abenakis,      and try and pass it on to more people. Because, as the years      go by, more and more people are forgetting, and they're      losing everything.       I feel that these things will help the Abenakis, and even      other races of our school. Like I said, you need everybody to      work together, not just a few here and there.       I want to thank you for inviting me here to speak on a      topic that concerns me greatly. And I think that one day the      Abenakis will earn their pride back.                               ____________________
