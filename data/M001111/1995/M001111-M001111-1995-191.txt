 He has hit exactly why I am so saddened and concerned by this budget proposal that obviously has the numbers and will pass this Congress this week.  He has pointed out to us who is going to be hurt in this budget, and it certainly is middle class, average Americans. And they are going to see it everywhere. It is for people like me before I came to this body, who are responsible for raising their kids and taking care of their parents and earning middle-income salaries, who are going to feel the effects. Their kids will not be able to go to college; they will not be able to afford it. Programs in their schools will be gone. Goals 2000, the one hope we have given to kids that we were going to try to improve their education, parents will see that removed for their children.  The young families who are worried about their aging parents on Medicare not only have to worry about the costs to their parents going up by $3,200, as my colleague has pointed out, but those families that are trying to rush to work and care for their kids and worry about their education are going to receive increased calls from their parents saying: Can you help me out? I cannot get to the doctor today. I just cannot afford it. That burden and that stress is going to come out in every walk of our families' lives.  And who will bear the real brunt of that stress as we go through this will be the children. So much we hear about children on this floor and why they need a balanced budget. Well, the stress that is put on our kids, the loss to them is really going to be felt, and I think it is a sad day.  I think my colleague from Connecticut would agree with me.
