 President, I, too, will not object to accepting this amendment. Let me just add, I concur with the manager of the amendment, Senator Mack, who I think has done an outstanding job working with the different departments. The Sergeant at Arms did come back with a 14.5-percent cut. They are definitely going to be looking at how they can do that in the coming months when we will see the effect of that. It is, I think, difficult for us to micromanage them from this point, but I am willing to accept this amendment.  Let me at this point say, in doing so, I also want to send my compliments to our current elevator operators, whom I think many of us do not take the time to say ``thank you'' to so often. They are always kind and courteous and efficient. I appreciate the fact that they find me in the crowds. I know that is not a problem that some of the other Members have.  But they are always here, they are always smiling, they are on time. I think oftentimes when we have amendments like that, it is seen as a slam on some people who are doing a very efficient job, and, I think, one that we do not say ``thank you'' for, often enough.  So let me take this opportunity to thank them for the job that they do for all of us.  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there be no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.  The amendment (No. 1805) was agreed to.
