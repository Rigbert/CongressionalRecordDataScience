President, in Vermont, you have to wait until May to see signs of life, signs of spring. But this May has been unseasonably cold, and got a little colder earlier this week when Vermont lost Jack Barry--one of the true, enduring treasures of the most special State in the Union.  Jack Barry left us on Sunday, May 4, at the age of 70, after a long struggle with cancer. He was in his third year as a senator, he was my first press secretary when I came to Washington as a 34-year-old Senator. But most of all he was an extraordinary and beloved broadcaster on radio and television whose ubiquitous presence on the Vermont airwaves has made thousands of Vermonters feel as though Jack Barry has been a member of the family.  In fact, he really was a member of thousands of Vermont families, and more welcome in their homes than just about anybody else.  Jack achieved legendary status among Vermont broadcasters. As an interviewer, he had an unparalleled ability to get to the essence of a person and an issue.  Jack's life in radio and television makes any review of his achievements read like a broadcasting directory. As you might expect, Jack had an on-air personality and voice to die for, and he was the same off the air, as fresh and genuine as the Green Mountains that he loved.  He hosted call-in shows where civility and common sense were the standard, he moderated and produced several public affairs programs where he was the most prepared person there. And he was a popular master of ceremonies for a wide range of nonprofit and public interest causes. He was Vermont's Sportscaster of the Year in 1972 and the Vermont Association of Broadcasters gave him the Distinguished Broadcasting Award in 1981 and, to make sure that everyone knew, they installed him into their Hall of Fame in 1995. He was the Rutland Herald's Vermonter of the Year in 1991. He lent his considerable talents to many community organizations including St. Michael's College--his alma mater, and mine--the Vermont Special Olympics, United Way, and the Vermont Cancer Society. He was past chairman of the Vermont Heart Association and was serving on the national board of the American Heart Association. For the last 3 years he served in the Vermont Senate, where, as Senate President pro tempore Peter Shumlin puts it, Jack ``was like a kid in a candy shop.''  He loved people. He truly loved people--all people--just as he truly loved politics. And he did not shrink from controversy to act on his convictions. He embraced controversy, if need be, because he never gave up his convictions, as when he forcefully argued against the popular rush to criminalize the rare instances of flag burning. And our State agreed with him.  I want to put into the Record at the end of my remarks a selection of the many news accounts, columns, and editorials this week that recite so many more of his achievements. But first I want to recount some of the personal recollections about Jack from his friends and colleagues that have come my way since Sunday.  George Goldring, who works at WVMT, recalls the days when he and Jack broadcasted University of Vermont football--Jack, for WVMT, and George, for WJOY.  He fondly remembers one night after a game in Pennsylvania, when they were sitting around a hotel room with a couple of other Vermont broadcasters. Nobody went to bed. The night dissolved into morning as Jack regaled them with story after story and joke after joke, keeping everyone in stitches all night long.  Mr. President, having been one of those fortunate enough to have sat in on one of these evenings--you do not want the night to end. It is the best of Irish storytelling.  George says that Jack was a professional's professional in front of a microphone. He was never at a loss for words.  John Goodrow of my staff and Jack both worked at WJOY in Burlington in different eras. Last November, the station threw a party to mark its 50th anniversary, and through the evening all the former on-air personalities were introduced. But when Jack Barry was introduced, the applause was the loudest and the longest, the most fervent, the most heartfelt.  John's father, Goody Goodrow, recalls getting to know Jack while Goody was a student at St. Michael's College after serving in the Navy in the Second World War. He was one of the many St. Mike's students who would phone in music requests to Jack's radio show. Goody himself was a musician who once played piano in Artie Shaw's military band, and he made a living in the Burlington area as a musician--in fact, as a young student, I danced some of those times he played--including stints, after those years at St. Mike's, playing the piano on Jack's radio shows on WJOY.  Joel Najman engineered Jack's show at WJOY for years, and he now works at WDEV. He tells about Jack's natural curiosity about the world. He was a sponge for information and ideas. Joel said he had time to read just one newspaper before Jack's morning show, but before airtime, Jack already had read four or five newspapers, and from personal experience I know he committed them virtually to memory.  Ken Horseman was an executive producer at Vermont ETV--public television in Vermont--and also produced Jack's radio show for a time. And Ken's fondest memories of Jack center on the old Vermont ETV auction which Ken produced and Jack hosted. Jack would hold forth through 10 hours of live television, and he would do this for 10 straight days. He would prime the pump for the station's coffers, and people all over the State and in nearby Canada and everywhere else would tune in to see Jack Barry.  Jerry Lewis has nothing on Jack Barry as a telethon maestro. More than 3,000 Vermonters volunteered during the auction over those 10 days. To them and to the viewing audience, Jack was the auction's symbol. I was fortunate enough to have had a chance to be on some of those auctions as a volunteer, as was, I think, the whole Vermont congressional delegation at one time or another, because Jack would just grab everybody. You could be the person who runs the gas station; you could be the Governor of the State. Jack Barry would say: ``Now here is the time you are going to auction,'' and you would.  He thrived on the unpredictability of live television. He was steady in the midst of chaos, as Ken remembers.  Mike Donoghue of the Burlington Free Press grew up in Vermont listening to Jack on the radio. Like all of us, he remembers his signature line at the end of every radio spot: ``Don't forget to tell 'em Barry brought ya.'' Of course, that is exactly what people did.  Jack brought us the warmth of his smile. He nourished our sense of community and purpose in Vermont. And he brought us the gift of his friendship.  Last September, Marcelle and I attended Jack's surprise 70th birthday party at his son-in-law's camp in Jonesville, VT.  Mr. President, if there is any way that I would remember Jack, it was at this party. It was vintage. He was surrounded by the family he adored and who adored him even more. Politicians and political junkies were everywhere, from both parties, and, of course, Jack was at center stage holding forth and carrying the day. I took photograph after photograph, although in one way I did not need to because the memories are as clear as the photographs are. Everybody came in, and it would be like they were the one person there with Jack. He would hug them and they would hug him. And the children were around. It was chaotic and it was fun. It was very, very, very Irish. It is that sunny day in Jonesville that sticks most in my mind when I think of Jack.  But I also think of Monday of this week when Marcelle and I went to Jack's home and visited with his wife, Bunny, a dear friend, the woman he loved so much, and with other family members, and the stories about Jack's humor and generosity and humanity rose easily and quickly to the surface as they always have when talking about Jack. One minute Marcelle and I were crying; the next minute we were laughing with everybody else there. Kathy, Maureen, and Bridget were there, Bunny's daughter Brigid and others, Tim and Wright, and we talked with Bridget and Kathy and Maureen about the time when Jack Barry was first down here as press secretary, and Marcelle was taking the kids on a ride in the car coming back from somewhere and two cars stopped in front of us--and I mean this is 20 years ago, Mr. President. Some of the people were getting out of the two cars in front of Marcelle, and they were getting into a fight and Marcelle was telling the children, ``Get down! Get down!'' And they were saying, ``We want to see! We want to see!'' And it was typical of what any one of Jack's kids would want: ``But I want to see what's going on!''  I think of all the times I would call him for advice, in good times and in some very sad times. Jack was always there. We might not have talked to each other for weeks and we would pick up the conversation as though it ended minutes before. I remember calling him and asking him for a joke because I was going to be speaking somewhere, and to start off he would say, ``Well, there were these two Irish guys,'' and we would both be laughing, and I hadn't even heard the joke. We would start laughing right away because we knew how funny it would be.  I recall a Christmas when Marcelle was on duty at the hospital and I was calling friends, and I called up Jack, after he had taken up his new duties in the Vermont Statehouse, and I said, ``Hi, Senator.'' He said, ``Hi, Senator.'' And we were going on calling each other Senator for a couple minutes until we were both laughing so hard we sort of lost it.  We go back a long time, Mr. President. His father and mother and my father and mother were friends. Jack and I knew each other forever it seems. I think of the days when he was down here, when we first moved down a few days before the swearing-in. It was New Year's Eve. We had rented a townhouse. And the moving van came that day. We were unloading boxes, and Jack shows up, and a couple other Vermonters were here with me, and we decided we would have a New Year's Eve party. We invited the two moving van people. We sat around on crates and boxes and opened them up trying to find a plate, a glass or silverware, ordering in pizza and soda and beer and what not. Jack put us all at ease. He started telling stories. Midnight came and midnight went, and that party went on and on.  How much I wish it could still go on today. I think of people that Jack helped during his years here in Washington, people who were cursed with the affliction that some have of drinking, and Jack would work with AA. He would be the person they would call when they really needed help and he would go. And after that time I heard from so many Members of Congress and others who would come to me and tell me, ``Jack Barry really saved my life.''  I remember him interviewing Cabinet Members down here for Vermont ETV and them telling me afterward that he was the most prepared interviewer they ever had.  So I have lost a dear, dear friend. Marcelle and I have spent a lot of time talking this week about how much he meant to us. We also know that Vermont has lost one of its real treasures. So Marcelle and I join all Vermonters in extending wishes of comfort and appreciation to Bunny and to all the family. I will put, as I said, items in the Record, but one especially from Bridget Barry Caswell--his daughter who we know and love and are so proud of, a great journalist in her own right and one who learned so much from her father--the eulogy she gave this week in his memory at St. Michael's College.  I will say this to the family, as my Great-Aunt Kate, who came here from Ireland, would say of a good Irish person when they would leave this vale of tears: ``He went straight up.'' Jack Barry went straight up, and I cannot help but think of the Irish jokes that are going through the heavens tonight.  Mr. President, in yielding the floor, I ask unanimous consent that these other items be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                              For You, Dad                       (By Bridget Barry Caswell)       To borrow one of my father's favorite words . . . he would      be just tickled to see all of you here today, to celebrate      his life and his final passage into peace. He'd probably look      around and say, ``Fantastic! I didn't know I had so many      friends.'' But he certainly did . . . and then some.       My Dad was truly one of a kind, as you know. He was      enthusiastic, he was warm . . . he was a true humanitarian      and he was the most optimistic person I know.       I am so proud to be a part of my Dad. We are all so proud      to say we are of him . . . we are a product of Jack Barry.       He was a passionate man. He was passionate about public      service and his career . . . a news junkie to the bone. And      he was passionate about learning and his family.       My father's life was dedicated to public service . . . he      was absolutely loyal to everything he cared about and fought      for. We will probably never know all of the people he      influenced or aided in one way or another . . . either      through his thousands of programs on issues affecting      everyday Vermonters . . . or the endless speaking engagements      he said yes to year after year. He couldn't say no and he was      able to use his public persona in so many good ways. And he      didn't do it for his own gratification . . . that didn't      matter to him . . . for he said yes whether it was a request      for a 500-person gala or a request to play auctioneer at an      elementary school fundraiser. I can remember as a child, my      father was always out . . . lending his name to one cause or      another. I don't think I realized at the time all of the good      he was doing. I'd like to share with you one example of my      father's dedication and loyalty to an organization. Shortly      after I was born--30 something years ago--I was diagnosed      with a serious heart defect. It was eventually repaired      through surgery, but that event in my father's life marked      the beginning of a lifetime of service to the Vermont Heart      Association . . . my family dove into volunteer work      immediately and my father's never ended. He served on the      board as member and eventually chairman. He spoke at endless      Heart Association events, and at the time of his death was      serving on the national board of the American Heart      Association. He considered that a great honor . . . and his      work finally came full circle when he became the beneficiary      of Heart Association research.       My Dad was also passionate about learning . . . he was a      life-long learner, always on a quest to improve his mind. And      it showed. He was a voracious reader. He read seven      newspapers every day . . . and devoured every news magazine      possible. On top of that, he always, and I mean always, had a      novel or two going. He would go on vacation to Florida for      two weeks and finish off a half-dozen books . . . and I mean      books like this. He loved to share them too . . . a few of      you probably still have a few of his out there!! I know I do!      But it didn't stop there. Whenever my nieces and nephew, who      live out of state, would come to visit, they always had their      own special time with my father, their grandfather. He would      take them out . . . not to a movie or a fun park. He took      them to the Oasis for breakfast and then they went      shopping . . . for books. Every time they visited, that      was their ``tradition'' with my Dad. He instilled in them      a love of reading and to this day, it is an area in school      where they all excel. He was very proud of that.       And finally, as I said earlier, my father was passionate      about his family. You probably got a little tired of hearing      about us all the time . . . he talked about us incessantly on      the air. His listeners knew of every milestone in our lives.      But that made us feel special. And he made us feel special in      the little things he did . . . a personal note on our ``big''      birthdays . . . the Sweet 16th, the 21st, the quarter-of-a-     century, and the 30th. And as some of you may have read, at      our family dinners--which meant anywhere from 10 to 22 people      at the table --my father led us with a toast before each      meal, and to him that meant a time to note our      accomplishments, large and small. He didn't forget anyone . .      . and he welcomed each and every one of us to share in the      meal, usually gourmet and always cooked and served to      perfection.       My father loved to cook . . . as my aunt said the other      day, if you needed a good recipe, you called Jack. If you      needed a good joke, you called Jack. And if you needed a good      book, you called Jack.       But he wasn't alone in his love for a good book, a good      joke or a good recipe. My Dad and Bunny were a team . . .      true soulmates and best friends . . . and they wore their      love on their sleeves. My Dad was passionate about Bunny . .      . on the air he often referred to her as ``that beautiful      thing I'm married to.'' And at home . . . it usually went      something like this, ``Hey Bare. You can carve the meat now''      and he'd say, ``Anything you say, Baby.'' Even to the end,      they exchanged love names. Bunny will probably never forgive      me for telling you this, but even during the last difficult      days of my father's life, when he continued to fight so      valiantly, she would walk into his hospital room--after     catching maybe an hour or two of sleep--and she'd say      ``Jackie-Poo, I'm here.'' She made all of us smile during      those dark days last week and my sisters and I will be      forever grateful for the love and care she gave to my Dad      during his illness.       Boy we loved him . . . he was truly an exceptional human      being. In just a moment we'd like to invite you to sing with      us one of my father's favorite songs, ``When Irish Eyes Are      Smiling.'' My Dad always had a smile in his eyes . . . and we      all know that he was certainly a proud Irishman.       In closing, I'd like to share with you a poem that was sent      to my father in February by his old buddy, John Zampieri. The      two of them were battling their own health problems and they      often exchanged notes sending words of encouragement. Just      two weeks ago, I sent out for my Dad his last note to      ``Zamp,'' as he called him. It was a photo on election night      . . . and they looked fabulous. Anyway, just yesterday, we      found this poem that John sent to my father a few months ago.      It was the first we'd seen of it . . . and we found it most      appropriate in light of my Dad's incredible optimism, his      courage and his pledge to never give up his fight. It's      called ``Don't Quit.''                               Don't Quit     When things go wrong, as they sometimes will     And the road you're trudging seems all uphill     When the funds are low and the debts are high     And you want to smile but you have to sigh     When care is pressing you down a bit--     Rest if you must but don't you quit     Life is queer with its twists and turns,     As every one of us sometimes learns     And many a fellow has turned about     When he might have won if he'd stuck it out     And he learned too late when the night came down     How close he was to the golden crown     Success is failure turned inside out,     The silver tint of the clouds of doubt     And you never can tell how close you are     You may be near when it seems so far     So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit     It's when things seem worst that you mustn't quit       That's All Folks . . . ``Don't forget to remind 'em that      Barry brought you.''                                                                    ____                            Barry Brought Me                           (By Peter Freyne) [From the Column ``Inside Track'' Seven Days, Burlington, VT, May 7,                                  1997]       They're burying Jack Barry today. It'll be a good turnout.      Jack always loved a crowd. Just given him a microphone and      turn him loose, and the kid from Waterbury Center, Vermont,      would crank up those marvelous Irish pipes with the lilt and      the blarney and the gift of the gab.       As far as the airwaves go, this was Jack Barry's town. He      loved it and he lived it--oh did he live it! From the days of      ``It's Your Nickel'' to ``Open Mike'' to ``The Jack Barry      Show,'' to ``Vermont Report'' and ``Vermont This Week'' on      Vermont ETV, Jack was the man who could turn your average      story into a marvelous tale. Before talk radio became king in      the 1980s, he was already sitting in the throne. ``Be sure      and tell'em Barry brought you,'' was his trademark refrain.       Jack wasn't one of those wishy-washy types who'd try to      please everyone. He had values and principles and opinions,      and he laid it on the line. He also had a fiery passion for      politics. For decades on the local airwaves he defended a      women's right to choose, and boldly called for an end to the      war in Vietnam, the war in Vietnam, the war that he      personally checked out in a 1968 visit. Once he saw firsthand      what a ``bright shining lie'' that war was, Jack wasn't      afraid to change his position.       Jack was the best sort of friend a guy could have, the kind      who was there for you not just when you were on top of the      world, but when the world had beaten you down. I know. When I      hit bottom, Jack Barry was there for me.       He loved the ponies--oh, did he love the ponies--and he      loved Saratoga in August. And, coincidentally, there was a      horse in the Kentucky Derby the day before he passed away, by      the name of Jack Flash. But most of all he loved his Bunny,      the Murphy girl he married and laughed with through the best      years of his life.       Well, Jack Barry's crossed the finish line now--in a flash.      No need to wait for the stewards to develop the photo. It      wasn't even close. Jack Barry won . . . going away.                                                                    ____                 [From the Rutland Herald, May 6, 1997]                   Jack Barry, A Man Of The Airwaves                         (By Christopher Graff)       Montpelier--Jack Barry was radio's biggest cheerleader.       Sure, he loved public television. And he was passionate      about politics. But radio was his true love.       ``Radio was everything,'' Barry once said, reminiscing      about the glory days before the dawn of television. ``Radio      was drama. Radio was sports. Radio was a window on the      world.''       ``Radio, pre-television, was everything,'' he said. ``And      it was a central part of everyone's lives.''       And Jack Barry, for many decades, was a central part of      Vermonters' lives.       Barry died Sunday at the age of 70. He was in his third      year as a state senator, a position that allowed him a seat      at center stage of the political world he loved. But it was      as a radio and television host that Barry became a household      name.                           *   *   *   *   *       ``I just always had this radio bug,'' he later said.       In 1948 he went to WJOY in Burlington, then owned by The      Burlington Free Press, where he helped air the 11 p.m. news      live from the Free Press newsroom and then stayed to play      poker with the editors while the paper ran off the presses.       In 1954 he and his pal Vin D'Acuti provided competition for      WJOY by launching WDOT. They did it all themselves, working      18-hour days. Barry raced around to fires and car accidents      and plane crashes in a Ford station wagon. He could--and      did--broadcast live anywhere, anytime.       He entered the world of talk shows, the forum in which he      would excel, becoming the daily visitor into the homes of      Vermonters.                           *   *   *   *   *       Barry later entered television. There was a time he did a      morning show on WVMT radio in Colchester 6 a.m. to 9 a.m.,      then a television show on WVNY-TV from 10 to 11 and then back      to WVMT for his ``Open Mike'' show from noon to 2 p.m.       In the evenings he was off to do play-by-play sports      broadcasts--baseball, basketball, football, hockey or boxing.       He started volunteering at Vermont ETV in 1970 and went on      the payroll in 1973. He took a brief time out for his first      round in politics, serving two years as press secretary for      Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.       He was back in 1976, juggling his morning radio shows and      his evening television appearances right up to his retirement      from Vermont ETV in 1991. The radio continued for a bit until      elective politics beckoned and he became a state senator.       Last year his life's passions came together briefly when      the Senate considered a proposal to cut ETV's state funding      from $762,500 to $1.       Barry, although ill, traveled to the State House to make an      impassioned plea for ETV. He talked about his experiences,      his interviews, the reaction from viewers. ``There are      moments at ETV that transcend anything I can recall,'' he      told his colleagues, who restored half of the money.       One of his greatest pleasures in a wide world of      broadcasting was when he found himself on the other side of      the microphone.       Vermont ETV, on Barry's final day on the job, set up a      surprise interview of Barry by his daughter, Bridget Barry      Caswell, herself a television reporter.       ``I am very proud you have come into this field,'' Barry      told his daughter on the air. ``It's a honorable profession      and a very good one. Without the Fourth Estate, we'd all be      in big trouble.       ``I hope your career is long and pleasant and you get to      achieve the things that give you as much satisfaction as my      career has given to me.''                                                                    ____           [From the Burlington (VT) Free Press, May 6, 1997]                              A Man Of Joy       Jack Barry found what many Vermonters spend a lifetime      seeking; a family he treasured, public service work he loved,      and an optimism that sustained him to the end.       Barry, who died Sunday of liver cancer at 70, will be      missed.       Sen. Jack Barry, D-Chittenden, was a decent man. For      decades, his loyalty was to his many listeners on      Burlington's radio stations and Vermont ETV. In the end, it      was the residents of Chittenden County who came first.       As a radio and television interviewer, Barry quizzed      politicians, journalists and entertainers alike. He was      polite, yet thorough. Barry's balance and fairness kept loyal      listeners tuning in.       He brought the same balance to his state Senate job,      refusing to be sucked into partisan Statehouse games.                           *   *   *   *   *       And Barry's interviewing skills will also be missed. In      committee meetings, he quickly drove to the heart of issues,      politely steering witnesses in the right direction.                           *   *   *   *   *       Through it all, he smiled, Barry smiled during broadcast      work, floor speeches and committee discussions. In fact, he      hid the severity of his illness behind a grin of pure joy      during his Senate tenure.       ``He just loved it,'' said fellow Sen. Richard Mazza, one      of Barry's closest friends. Mazza's right.       Goodbye, friend.                                                                    ____                 [From the Vermont Times, May 7, 1997]                               Editorial       This week, Vermont lost one of its richest gems and      tireless spirits. For most of us, State Senator Jack Barry's      beaming smile and clear, deep voice were as recognizable as      the profile of Mount Mansfield.       Jack Barry's stature in Vermont, especially in his home      turf of Chittenden County, was like that of Walter Cronkite.      As a Democrat, he steadfastly believed in speaking up for the      people. He did this by keeping people focused on the heart of      the matter at hand, and not drifting into political      bickering.                           *   *   *   *   *       For decades, Vermonters have had someone in their corner      when a public official or some other potentate had something      to say     to us Vermonters. For there behind the microphone, or on      camera, was Jack Barry--asking the questions to which we all      wanted answers.       Jack Barry's style as a journalist and a professional      broadcaster was one which we should all strive to live up to:      He was polite and pesky, thoughtful and thorough. That's      probably why he was loved and respected by so many people.       To the man with the silver voice and the silver hair, thank      you. Thank you Jack Barry.                          ____________________
