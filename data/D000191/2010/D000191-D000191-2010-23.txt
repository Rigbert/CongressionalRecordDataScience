 So the Chinese have passed a law saying that no one in China can buy a U.S.-made windmill or photovoltaic. If we get these green jobs and green industry going that the President wants, the Chinese aren't going to buy them. But guess what? The so-called stimulus bill that passed this Congress, part of those funds, our taxpayer dollars, money we borrowed in part from China to finance that bill, were used to buy windmills made in China. They can get their windmills in here like that.  There's a company proposing to assemble photovoltaics in my hometown of Eugene, Oregon. But I also have people in Oregon trying to keep their companies going with made in America photovoltaics. But they are having trouble competing with the subsidized cheap junk from China because their photovoltaics are not very good. Again, we can't send our ours there, but they can send theirs here without any constraints.  I remember back to Lee Iacocca, back when we used to sort of laugh at the Japanese cars. And when he had minivans and the Japanese started producing minivans, he said, You know, I produce a minivan for $16,000. I send it to Japan, it sits on the dock for 6 months while a series of inspectors come down and look at it. And then finally when it gets to the showroom, it costs $30,000 and it's been there 6 months. He said the Japanese take their minivan, it costs $17,000 to make it--they were less efficient then--he said they put it on a ship, it gets to Portland, they roll it off, it's in the showroom the next day. Do we ever reciprocate?  We say, okay, if you are going to keep our cars on your docks for 6 months, how about we're going to keep your cars on our docks for 6 months? And that's what the trade commission will point to. It will point to the unfair trade barriers, these whole series of different phytosanitary, or actually safety inspections, or currency manipulation, all of the things that China and other countries are doing to steal our jobs and kill off our industries. This commission can point to those things, they can emphasize them, and they can propose ways that we can deal with it more meaningfully in trade agreements in the future.  I recommend to my colleagues, help end the trade deficit. Vote for this legislation.                              {time}  1220
