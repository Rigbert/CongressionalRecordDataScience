President, today I am introducing legislation, the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act, to reduce the burdensome reporting requirements imposed on educational institutions by the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credits. I am very pleased to be joined by my principal cosponsor, the distinguished Senator from Ohio, Senator DeWine, who has been a real leader in education issues. I am also pleased to have the Presiding Officer, Senator Gordon Smith, as one of my cosponsors as well as Senators Bond, Enzi, Faircloth, Hatch, Helms, Hutchison, and Roberts.  Mr. President, when Congress created the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning Tax Credit, it, unfortunately, at the same time also created a very burdensome and costly reporting requirement for our universities, our colleges, and our proprietary schools. Beginning with the tax year 1998, the regulations will require schools to report to the IRS information on their students--including name, address, Social Security number, information about attendance status, program level, a campus contact, and the amount of qualified tuition and student aid.  Mr. President, this is a perfect example of the law of unintended consequences. We have inadvertently imposed a costly burden on our institutions of higher education. In the words of the president of the University of Maine at Farmington:  At a time when we are working to increase access and to contain college costs, new government reporting requirements are working against us. We will need to add personnel, not in support of our educational functions, but to comply with the new IRS regulations. This is not sensible and it is definitely not in the interests of the people we are here to serve.  Mr. President, she said it very well. This is not sensible and it is not in the interests of the people that we are here to serve.  Yet another example from my State comes from the University of Maine at Presque Isle, a small campus with fewer than 1,000 students. The President there has told me that he may well need to hire an additional person to oversee the data collection and reporting requirements of this new law. Indeed, Mr. President, analysis of these reporting requirements indicate that they will cost America's postsecondary educational institutions as much as $125 million, and that is just to set up the system. In addition, tens of millions of dollars will have to be spent each year on an ongoing basis to comply with these onerous new regulations.  Mr. President, this simply does not make sense. The Collins-DeWine bill will repeal the provision of the Internal Revenue Code that requires a school to report this information for its students. Instead, Mr. President, we will treat these educational tax credits just the way we would treat any kind of tax credit. Taxpayers will be required to report the necessary information on their tax returns and to maintain records of their expenses that will support any tax credits that they claim.  Mr. President, the rationale for the Hope and Lifetime Learning education credits is to make postsecondary education both more affordable and thus more accessible to lower income individuals. But in this case, Mr. President, what Congress is giving with one hand it is taking away at least in part with its regulatory hand. The cost of conforming to these regulatory requirements will inevitably result in increases in tuition, chipping away at the very benefit of these tax credits.  Mr. President, the American Council on Education strongly supports this bill. It will help avoid a wasteful expenditure of the resources, the scarce resources, of America's colleges and universities.  I ask unanimous consent a letter from the president of the American Council on Education endorsing our bill on behalf of seven national education associations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                    American Council on Education,                                      Office of the President,                                    Washington, DC, March 5, 1998.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The creation last year of the Hope      Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credits through the      Taxpayer Relief Act was met with great enthusiasm by the      higher education community. These education tax incentives      will clearly benefit students and their families.      Unfortunately, the creation of these tax credits has an      extraordinarily negative by-product: an unprecedented barrage      of new regulatory and record-keeping requirements for      colleges and universities.       The cost of complying with the education tax provisions in      the Taxpayer Relief Act will be enormous. More than 15      million degree-seeking students currently are enrolled in      America's colleges and universities; we believe, based on      preliminary estimates, that the cost of reporting will be      approximately $6 to $8 per student. Note that this estimate      does not include the cost of collecting and reporting the      data on the roughly 15 million students who take continuing      (i.e. non-degree) courses every year. When examined on an      institution by institution basis, the cost is alarming. The      University of California at Los Angeles estimates it will      cost $427,000 to comply with the requirements of the new law;      Colorado State University estimates the cost will be      approximately $250,000. Unavoidably, the cost of complying      with these externally imposed requirements will be passed on      to students.       Given the costs and burdens that will be associated with      implementing these important provisions, we are grateful for      your efforts to minimize the burden to be placed on schools      by introducing the ``Higher Education Reporting Relief Act.''       The higher education community is involved in efforts to      minimize or eliminate the reporting burden while preserving      important accountability for the use of federal funds. We      have established a task force comprised of nine associations      to analyze and document the full extent of the burden that      these regulations pose. Led by the National Association of      College and University Business Officers, this task force      will estimate the costs associated with compliance; make      recommendations to alleviate the regulatory burden; and      assess the possible use of third-party service providers to      manage reporting for individual colleges and universities.      This group is expected to complete its work in mid-May; we      hope that it will be an excellent source of technical      assistance to you and others.       We greatly appreciate your leadership on this issue and      expect that many of our campuses will contact you directly to      express their thanks. We look forward to working with you to      relieve higher education institutions from the reporting      requirements associated with the new education tax      incentives. Thank you for your attention to his issue and for      your consistent commitment to students and families, and to      American higher education.           Sincerely                                             Stanley O. Ikenberry,                                                        Presdient.       On behalf of: American Association of Community Colleges;      American Council on Education; Association of American      Universities; Association of Governing Boards of Universities      and Colleges; National Association of College and University      Business Officers; National Association of State Universities      and Land-Grant Colleges; National Association of Student      Financial Aid Administrators; The College Fund/UNCF.  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, I am delighted to join Senator Collins today in the introduction of the Higher Education Reporting Relief Act. This bill, as my colleague has explained, would repeal section 605 of the Internal Revenue Code, thereby eliminating responsibility of schools to file returns to the IRS on behalf of their students.  Now, the National Commission on the Cost of Higher Education has recommended that the most direct way to minimize the regulatory burden on colleges and universities would be to repeal the sections of law that impose reporting requirements.  What is the problem? Here is the problem: Current law relating to the Hope Scholarship and the Lifetime Learning tax credit requires all colleges and universities to comply with very burdensome and costly regulations. Beginning with tax year 1998, schools will be expected to provide the IRS with information regarding its students, including the following: name, address, Social Security number of the students, whether the student was in attendance at least half-time during the academic period, whether the student was enrolled exclusively in a program leading to a graduate-level educational credential, the person to contact at the institution in case there are questions, the amount of qualified tuition and gift aid a student receives--on and on.  The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 that we are amending today contained a provision requiring colleges, universities, and trade schools to begin issuing annual reports to students and to the Internal Revenue Service detailing the students' tuition payments in case they apply for the new education tax credit. Preliminary analysis shows the reporting requirements will cost 6,000 colleges in America more than $125 million to implement and tens of millions of dollars annually to maintain.  The bill that Senator Collins and I are introducing will free colleges, universities, and trade schools from complying with these very burdensome and costly requirements. Under our bill, taxpayers will now simply claim the new education tax credits on their income tax returns as they do with other tax credits and deductions.  Now, Mr. President, in my home State of Ohio, I have heard from many colleges. They have told me that the reporting requirement will place a significant financial and human resource burden on colleges and universities that will ultimately lead to an increase in the cost of higher education.  Ohio institutions such as Cleveland State, Bowling Green State University, Shawnee State University, and North Central Technical College have all written me and told me these requirements place schools in a very difficult position, putting them between students and parents and the IRS, because the schools are required under the current law to collect information that, frankly, they would not otherwise have to collect. While these schools are very supportive of the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credit, the burden placed on universities will increase the cost of higher education, which, of course, reduces the benefit of the tax credit to the students.  The bill that my colleague from Maine and I are introducing is commonsense legislation that will eliminate an unfunded mandate placed upon colleges and universities. In realistic terms, if the new reporting requirement is not lifted off the backs of colleges and universities, those schools will be forced to raise tuition costs to cover this unfunded mandate. In effect, students and families will not benefit from passage of the Hope Scholarship because the money received from the tax credit will be used to pay this higher tuition.  I support the Hope Scholarship, and I am excited that students will be given a financial boost in their plans to attain a higher education. However, the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credit will not be as beneficial if it means that colleges and universities will raise their tuition to cover the costs of this unfunded mandate. Trying to pay for an unfunded mandate shifts a school's focus away from its primary goal, which, of course, is giving the students the best possible education.  Now, similar legislation to our bill has already been introduced in the House of Representatives. The House bill is supported by a bipartisan coalition of Members of the House. In addition, Mr. President, the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, representing 425 of the largest colleges and universities in the country, and also the American Association of Community Colleges, representing 1,200 community colleges, have both endorsed this initiative.  Mr. President, I conclude today by asking my colleagues to take a closer look at how this legislation will benefit students and families in this country. I invite any of my colleagues to join us today to cosponsor this bill. Passage of the Hope Scholarship and Lifetime Learning tax credit was a good beginning, but we must now assure that universities and colleges will not raise tuition costs simply to cover the costs of this unfunded mandate.  Our bill, then, is simple. It is simple, fair legislation that will greatly benefit any person who wants to obtain a higher education in this country.
