It is also interesting to put it in the context of where we have come over the last few days.  The amendment on the floor just a few days ago when the shortfall was noted on a bipartisan basis from Senator Murray was an amendment less than the one adopted. It was $1.4 billion. The Senator, the chairman of the committee, as well as others, came together on a bipartisan basis and said, That is not enough. That is not enough, $1.4 billion will not meet the shortfall. By our best estimate, they said 24 hours ago or whenever we debated it, we need more, we need $1.5 billion. And we acceded to your knowledge of the agency and your knowledge of its need and came together on a bipartisan basis--I believe the vote was 96 to nothing--and said that is exactly what we will do, $1.5 billion.  Then while we barely finished this work, the House came back and said no, the figure is $975 million or whatever number they came up with, dramatically less than what we had approved.  It strikes me as interesting that we are going to back off of our best estimate and say let's err on the side of less money for the Veterans' Administration. Why wouldn't the Senate be holding fast to its position? Why wouldn't the Senate be holding fast to its position and say we believe $1.5 billion is the right number still, as we believed 24 hours ago when we voted on it? Why do we want to back off at this point and say it must be that much less?  It strikes me, unless there has been a dramatic infusion of new information and knowledge, that we are acceding to the House of Representatives because they have decided to go home.
