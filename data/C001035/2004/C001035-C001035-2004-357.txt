President, if I could complete my sequencing here. After Senator Roberts, Senator Levin had asked to be recognized on the Specter amendment. They were both here last night, so I want to respect their requests as well.  I wonder if we could arrange for Senator Harkin to speak after the first series of votes today, for 10 minutes.
