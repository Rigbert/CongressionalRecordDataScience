 I appreciate her contribution to this debate, not only at this time but in previous rounds. She is right on the mark, it seems to me, in concluding that this bill falls well short of anything the Congress ought to foist on to the American people, and particularly the restrictions on all the individuals across the country that want to participate in the political process.  I would just say to my friend from Texas--I did not get a chance yesterday to tell her this--even the National Education Association, almost never aligned with people like the Senator from Texas and myself, wrote me a letter yesterday saying how awful this bill was, and said they hoped it would be defeated. They also pointed out that the average contribution to the NEA PAC was $6, and asked the question, why in the world participation of that sort would be a bad thing for American democracy and something the Congress ought to eliminate?
