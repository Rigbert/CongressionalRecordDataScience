President, today I am introducing the Keep Americans Working Act, legislation to strengthen and expand work share programs to keep Americans working and provide employers with an alternative to layoffs.  This legislation allows employers to reduce the hours of their workers for some period of time and for the workers to receive proportionate unemployment benefits for those reduced hours to lessen the impact on them and their families.  While 17 States, including Rhode Island, are using their resources to provide work share, these programs remain largely underutilized. Indeed, work share is simply not available in \2/3\ of States.  In Rhode Island, the number of employees participating in the program has more than tripled this past year to 8,000 workers, in comparison to the year prior. It has also been highly successful. For instance, I recently visited Hope Global in Cumberland, Rhode Island, which has participated in Rhode Island's WorkShare program. At this company, I listened to an employee who worked there with her husband, and they benefitted from this program. She said, point blank: Without it, we would have lost our health care and we would have lost our home.  Other states with work share programs have also experienced an extraordinary increase in participation.  But given Rhode Island's 12.4 percent unemployment rate--the second highest in the country--we can stem even more job loss with this legislation. Specifically, the Keep Americans Working Act provides states with temporary federal financing for 100 percent of work share benefits paid to workers for up to 26 weeks. Employers have to certify that maintenance of health and retirement benefits is not affected by participation in the program. This financing program is available for 2 years.  It also includes important limitations to ensure that taxpayer dollars are provided only when appropriate safeguards are in place. To hold employers accountable, states can assess penalties on employers that break the rules, including those who do not act in good faith to retain participating employees. In addition, to aid States in this effort, the Department of Labor would establish an oversight and monitoring process for state agencies to ensure that participating employers comply with the terms of the written plan approved by the state agency.  Given that State labor agencies are already doing more with less, this legislation also provides for administrative funding, and for those States that are trying to get work share programs off the ground, it provides start-up grants.  It is a win-win for all.  First, work share helps speed economic recovery. Economist Mark Zandi estimates that temporary financing of work share offers a very high ``bang for the buck'' of $1.69. That is, every $1 devoted to finance State work share programs results in $1.69 in real GDP.  Secondly, work share allows businesses to retain skilled workers, temporarily cut costs, and maintain employee morale.  Thirdly, it keeps people working with their health insurance and retirement benefits. This means parents can continue to pay their mortgages and their bills and provide for their families.  This legislation will help stem the tide of joblessness, providing workers, businesses, and communities with the resources to stay afloat while we work our way through these tough economic times.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1646       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Keep Americans Working      Act''.     SEC. 2. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to keep Americans working by      strengthening and expanding short-time compensation programs      that provide employers with an alternative to layoffs.     SEC. 3.
