I, too, appreciate Senators Mikulski and Bond supporting this. I think the point Senator Kerry is making with this amendment--I hope in the days ahead it yields to a broader debate--is that at a time of record economic prosperity, we are having extraordinary crises in terms of access to affordable housing. All across this country we have waiting lists, sometimes for years, for the kind of people that Senator Kerry is trying to assist with this amendment. I think this is a start. Senator Mikulski and Senator Bond have been very gracious to accept this amendment. I commend them for it. But I hope in the days ahead that we can build on the Kerry amendment and really drive these waiting lists down. If anything, the hot economy we are seeing is driving up rents and, in effect, contributing to the problems we are having with these waiting lists.  I didn't want to take a lot of time of the Senate, and I am very pleased Senator Kerry is leading this effort. I hope this is seen as the beginning of a bipartisan effort to drive down these waiting lists that are years and years in some communities for disabled folks, seniors, and those with HIV.  I thank the Senator from Massachusetts for yielding time. I am glad this amendment has been accepted on both sides of the aisle.
