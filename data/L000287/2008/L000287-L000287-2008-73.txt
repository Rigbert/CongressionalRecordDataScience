Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. McDermott for yielding and for bringing this necessary piece of legislation to us today.  It is basic, it is common sense, it is the right thing to do. People are calling out. They're crying out for help.  They ask, where is the Federal Government? Where is Congress? Which side is the government on? What are you doing to help the unemployed, people who lost their jobs? It's not their fault. What are you doing to help those in need, those who need a helping hand? What are you doing and doing now?  Mr. Speaker, some of us may not remember this, or maybe we never had to do it, but just a few short years ago, many people in this country washed their clothes at night and hung them up to a heater or to the fireplace so they could dry and wear them to work the next morning. I wonder if we're headed back to that reality. People need help and they need it now.
