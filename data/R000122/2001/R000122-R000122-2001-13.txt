We are approaching a situation where the States are under extreme fiscal distress. Without the foundation of this Federal funding, I am very pessimistic that States will come forward.  If it is not important for us, the Federal Government charged with protection of our country, then how is it important to a State legislature to appropriate funds this coming year, in the next few months? That is another reason I believe we have to act now. We have to act promptly.  In addition, we have to be able to support the efforts of the State governments to begin to take these plans andoperationalize them--to go and actually test these plans. Frankly, we will not know the gaps until they go out and test it. This money could enable that.
