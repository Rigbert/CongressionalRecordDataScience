President, I don't know if we have people coming to speak. If no one does, I will soon yield back the time so we can vote. I urge, as Senator McConnell has and as the leaders have, those who have amendments on which they seek votes to come to the floor and offer their amendments. I know that the intent of Senator McConnell and myself is if there are no other amendments waiting to be disposed of or pending, we plan to go to third reading. Going to the third reading could be in a matter of the next couple of hours at that pace.  Some Senators have said they had a number of amendments. At such point that there are no amendments pending, it is our intention to go to third reading.  I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be charged to my side.
