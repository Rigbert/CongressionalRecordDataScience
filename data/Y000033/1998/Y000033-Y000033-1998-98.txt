Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3903 authorizes a conditional land exchange between the State of Alaska and the United States.  The purpose of the exchange is to enable the construction and operation of a small, 800 kilowatt hydroelectric project for the community of Gustavus, which is located in Southeast Alaska on the edge of Glacier Bay National Park. If feasible, the project would also provide low-cost, clean power to the National Park Service.  The committee held a hearing on H.R. 3903 on June 10, 1998. By a voice vote, the bill was ordered reported, with an amendment, on July 22.  This legislation completes several years of negotiation with the Gustavus Electric Company, the State of Alaska, the National Park Service, and local environmental groups. I would like to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Bliley) and the work of the Committee on Commerce in expediting House consideration of H.R. 3903.  The need from the bill arises from Gustavus's reliance on diesel generation for its power, which presents air emission considerations, high energy costs, and risks of fuel spills during shipment. To avoid the drawbacks of using diesel fuel, Gustavus Electric Company studied alternative power sources. Hydroelectricity generating at a nearby area called Falls Creek was identified as the city's best option. I believe it also make sense for the National Park Service, too, because the agency relies on a separate set of diesel generations there.  The problem with constructing a hydro-facility is that Falls Creek, the proposed site, is currently located inside the boundary of designated wilderness of Glacier Bay National Park, where such a project is not allowed. To solve this problem, H.R. 3903 authorizes a land exchange that will put the site in State ownership, redraw the park and wilderness boundary, and enable the United States to acquire lands of equal value in Alaska.  When this land exchange was originally proposed, there was concern expressed by the administration and some Alaskans over the potential environmental impact of a hydro project in Glacier Bay National Park. I have never understood why anyone would object to hydropower when the alternative is to continue burning diesel fuel at a national park. Regardless, these concerns have been put to rest.  In the interest of moving forward, I agreed to make the land exchange conditional on a determination by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that a hydro facility will have no adverse impact on the Park. In other words, there will be no land exchange, and therefore, no project, if FERC finds there will be any harm.  The bill under consideration today has a minor amendment to the reported bill. The amendment strikes section 4(d) of the reported bill. This action is technical in nature only.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I include for the Record correspondence relative to this bill.                                         House of Representatives,                                        Committee on Commerce,                                Washington, DC, September 8, 1998.     Hon. Don Young,     Chairman, House Committee on Resources, Washington, DC.       Dear Don: On July 22, 1998 the Committee on Resources      ordered reported H.R. 3903, the Glacier Bay National Park      Boundary Adjustment Act of 1998. H.R. 3903, as ordered      reported by the Committee on Resources, details the role of      the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (``FERC'') and      Gustavus Electric Company in a land exchange between the      United States and the State of Alaska. As you know, the      Committee on Commerce was granted an additional referral upon      its introduction pursuant to the Committee's jurisdiction      over the generation and marketing of power under Rule X of      the Rules of the House of Representatives.       Because of the importance of this matter, I recognize your      desire to bring this legislation before the House in an      expeditous manner. I also understand that you have agreed     to address this Committee's concern over section 4(d) of the      bill as ordered reported in a manager's amendment to be      offered on the Floor. Therefore, with that understanding, I      will waive consideration of the bill by the Commerce      Committee. By agreeing to waive its consideration of the      bill, the Commerce Committee does not waive its jurisdiction      over H.R. 3903. In addition, the Commerce Committee reserves      its authority to seek conferees on any provisions of the bill      that are within the Commerce Committee's jurisdiction during      any House-Senate conference that may be convened on this      legislation. I would seek your commitment to support any      request by the Commerce Committee for conferees on H.R. 3903      or related legislation.       I would appreciate your including this letter as a part of      the Committee's report on H.R. 3903 and as part of the record      during consideration of this bill by the House.           Sincerely,                                                       Tom Bliley,     Chairman.                                  ____                                         House of Representatives,                                       Committee on Resources,                                Washington, DC, September 9, 1998.     Hon. Tom Bliley,     Chairman, Committee on Commerce,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R.      3903, the Glacier Bay National Park Boundary Adjustment Act      of 1998, a land exchange bill I introduced to help Gustavus,      Alaska, construct a small hydroelectric project to provide      clean, lower-cost power for the community and for the      operation of Glacier Bay National Park.       I appreciate you waiving your additional referral of this      bill to allow it to be considered before the House of      Representatives adjourns for the year. As your letter states,      I plan to offer a manager's amendment which addresses the      concerns you raised regarding subsection 4(d) of the bill as      reported by striking that subsection. In addition, I will      include your letter in the report on the bill and in the      Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 3903 on the      Floor. Finally, I will support your request to be represented      on any conference on H.R. 3903 in the unlikely event that one      becomes necessary.       Thank you again for your cooperation and that of Hugh      Halpern of your staff. I look forward to seeing H.R. 3903      enacted into law soon.           Sincerely,                                                        Don Young,                                                         Chairman.                              {time}  1530  Crafting this bill has taken some time, but the final project advances a sensible local solution to a serious local problem and should be enacted into law without further delay.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  (
