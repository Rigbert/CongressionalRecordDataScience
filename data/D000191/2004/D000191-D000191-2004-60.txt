  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, the world and Iraq are better off without that murderous despot Saddam Hussein in power. But the unanimous report of the Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee refutes the Bush administration's principal premise of the war that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. They concluded he did not, that he presented a danger. They said the sanctions were working and his military was degraded and rapidly disintegrating. No links to 9/11; yet the President said seven times in 32 minutes the American people were safer because of the war in Iraq.  He can say it, but it does not make it so. Osama bin Laden is still out there plotting and planning. We are on heightened alert. They say he is going to attack anytime soon, but he has given a bye for the last 2 years by the Bush administration because of their obsession with Iraq instead of those who attacked us on 9/11.  We are not safer because of the war in Iraq. We are in fact more at risk because Saddam Hussein was not the real threat. It was Osama bin Laden, who has had the chance to regroup, strengthen his forces, and plan new attacks because the Bush administration has not been adequately pursuing it.                          ____________________
