 President, I have come to the floor to speak as a member of the Judiciary Committee, but I will back up the Senator from Arkansas on one very key point that I hope can happen in this Congress. I urge, as she has done, that a bill to reauthorize the Older Americans Act come to the floor of the Senate because it has been so long since that law has been reauthorized on a permanent basis. I understand it has been reauthorized on a year-to-year basis, but not on a permanent basis as it ought to be, or at least for a multiyear basis. So I urge that action to be taken at this particular time.                          ____________________
