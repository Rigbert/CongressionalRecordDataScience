 They are looking for some flexibility in the 26 degree mark--2 or 3 degrees either way. They are not asking there not be a demarcation. They are not saying that the rule should say zero and below is frozen, above that is fresh. They are not asking for that.  So I am not standing here making the argument that there is no rationale related to having a third category here. I am suggesting that it is not workable as the standard proposed by the Department now which, to use the term freeze, is being frozen by the committee until there can be some more rational way to look at this.  So I wish to make it clear, we are not asking and I am not of the view that there not be a distinction made among the categories of how a chicken or a piece of poultry is packaged and sold.
