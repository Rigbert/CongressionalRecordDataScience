It is with the deepest admiration that I pay tribute to the men and women throughout Northwest Indiana and the entire country who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. Each year, the Highland, Indiana Fraternal Order of Police, Donald R. Sheppard Lodge Number 122, and the Highland Police Department honor these individuals for their courage and their commitment to protecting their communities at all costs. Annually, two fallen officers of the Highland Police Department, Officer Donald R. Sheppard, killed in the line of duty in November 1971, and Officer Robert J. Markley, killed in the line of duty in March 1978, are remembered for their service to the Highland community and for their sacrifice.  This year, the Highland Fraternal Order of Police and the Highland Police Department will recognize these fallen heroes, as well as all of the law enforcement officers across the United States, who have given their lives for the protection of our great country. These fine men and women will be honored at a memorial service during Law Enforcement Memorial Week, on Saturday, May 12, 2007, at the Highland Town Hall/Police Department.  As a nation, we owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the men and women of the law enforcement community. Currently, there are over 870,000 law enforcement officers in the United States. Each day, these selfless individuals start their shifts with one goal in mind: to serve and to protect the citizens of their communities. The one constant they face is the uncertainty of what each day will bring, knowing all too well that in any situation, there is the potential for danger. Still, these everyday heroes honor the commitment they have made to the people they serve.  Law enforcement officers throughout the nation have always exemplified dedication and loyalty, not only to those they serve, but to each other as well. Throughout the United States, many law enforcement organizations will hold memorials to honor their fallen brothers and sisters. In Indiana alone, more than 345 officers have been killed in the line of duty, while the total number of fallen officers in the United States is over 17,900.  These real life heroes are remembered for their courage and bravery as they gave their lives to protect their communities and our way of life. These men and women exemplify the valor and strength of our country and its citizens.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending and acknowledging the men and women of the law enforcement community, both in Northwest Indiana and throughout the United States. I also ask that you join me in honoring the memory of all fallen law enforcement officers throughout the United States, especially Officer Donald R. Sheppard and Officer Robert J. Markley, for making the ultimate sacrifice for their communities. These selfless individuals are worthy of the highest honor and respect.                          ____________________
