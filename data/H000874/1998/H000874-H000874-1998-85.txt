 My question, and rather than yell at one another, rather than accuse one another of awful things, I want to find out what we are talking about. It is my premise that the gentleman does not believe there is any procedure, at any time, that is less than objectionable. Am I correct in that premise?  Mr. DeLAY. I think the gentleman's question is grammatically in error.
