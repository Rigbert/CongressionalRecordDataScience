Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information. Let me say that I am pleased, and I know our side is and I am sure the gentleman's side is as well and I know the Governors and county officials throughout the country are pleased, to see that the transportation bill is on the floor. This was a bill, as the majority leader knows, that expired, I think, September 30, 2003, and we have done extensions since that time.  It is scheduled for 2 days on the calendar, as I understand, and we just heard the announcement of the Committee on Rules chairman that there may be limitations to amendments in the bill. In light of the fact that I know there are still some substantial questions, this bill was reported out on voice vote unanimously but with one of the most contentious issues, as I understand it, left unresolved in terms of donor/donee States.  Can the majority leader amplify, perhaps, on what the Committee on Rules chairman said in terms of whether we will have general debate on one day and amendments on the next, or does he think he will start considering amendments on the first day of consideration.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, will the gentleman yield?
