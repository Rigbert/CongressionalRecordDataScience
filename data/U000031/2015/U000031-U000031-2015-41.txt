Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment. Section 1101 makes important improvements to FERC's process for reviewing interstate natural gas pipelines.  As we all know, the demand for natural gas is growing, which requires new and modernized pipeline infrastructure. It has got to happen.  Unfortunately, the permitting process is becoming increasingly complex and challenging. Rate hikes hit the families and businesses that can least afford it the hardest, the most vulnerable. So we have worked very diligently to find some agreement on this provision. We have held hearings, received technical assistance from FERC, and accepted many of their recommendations.  Section 1101 would authorize concurrent permitting reviews, require more transparency through the process, and allow for the use of new survey technology for citing pipelines.  Just yesterday, Mr. Chairman, in a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, FERC Chairman Bay acknowledged the need for new pipeline capacity and signaled his support for the enhanced transparency provisions and the regulatory dashboard that is required by section 1101.  So this amendment, if passed, would strike a commonsense approach to introduce greater public transparency and accountability for Federal and State permitting agencies, and therefore I would ask for a ``no'' vote on the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
