Boehner, Mr. Cantor, Mr. McCarthy--only 78, and the rest, including the present Director of OMB, voted to keep the government shut down.  So I am not surprised that we are here, but it is sad that we are here acting so irresponsibly. If we have one duty as we come here, it is to have our government function effectively for our people. We are failing tonight.  This is a pretense. This bill is going nowhere. The Senate won't accept it. Perhaps the Senate will send it back, amended--perhaps. But we are, we think, adults. Let's act responsibly. Defeat this bill.
