 President, I thank the chairman and ranking member for taking the time to discuss an issue that is very important to me and to the well-being of our military personnel.  As both of you well know, the military today relies on vaccines as an element of force protection. In order to keep our military healthy and to protect against biological threats, we require personnel to be vaccinated.
