President, it is very clear from Hurricane Rita and Hurricane Katrina that America is now learning how to be prepared for disasters. Many more positive things happened as a result of the threat of Hurricane Rita than happened just a few weeks before in Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. We now know that it is not a question of pointing the finger of blame, but those of us in leadership in Washington need to get to the bottom of this--not so we can decide who was wrong in days gone by but, frankly, to make sure this doesn't happen again.  The American people do not want to know who wins the game of ``gotcha'' here; they want to know if America is ready for the next disaster. We were clearly not prepared for Hurricane Katrina. The scenes we all saw night and day on television of helpless victims in New Orleans and other communities remind us over and over again that the Federal Emergency Management Agency was not prepared for this challenge. We came to that realization when Mr. Brown was asked to leave FEMA. I believe that was the right decision.  But I was stunned to learn that he is still on the payroll. It is hard to imagine that this man who was at FEMA with such a thin resume and such limited experiences dealing with disasters was asked to leave and be replaced and then continues on as a consultant to FEMA. He is going to be scrutinized today by a panel in the House of Representatives that may ask him some questions about what he did. The first thing they should ask him is by what standard is he still on the Federal payroll. Why is this man still being paid by the Federal Government? The administration clearly cannot investigate itself when it comes to Hurricane Katrina, and this decision to keep Mr. Brown on the payroll reflects on what he did in the past but, more importantly, what he might do in the future. He doesn't have the skill set needed for the disasters that could come as soon as tomorrow. Why is he still there? I don't believe this is the right way to approach a natural disaster or a terrorist disaster. We need to put people in place who understand how to deal with it.  I believe the President was right in removing Mr. Brown and putting in his place Commander Allen from the Coast Guard. I have met with him in New Orleans. He is a man who apparently takes control of the situation and does it very well, and I believe we should give him a chance to lead--to make certain that we handle that past disaster but also that we are prepared for the next one.  But this is a recurring problem. It isn't just a question of Michael Brown being replaced by Commander Allen. It is a question of whether there are people in other key spots in this Government who do not have the qualifications to lead.  Make no mistake about it: Every President brings in people of their own political persuasion and friendship. This happened from time immemorial. It is understandable that sometimes these people do an excellent job. I can recall when President Clinton suggested that Jamie Lee Witt from Arkansas, his emergency management director, was coming up to run FEMA in Washington. I want to tell you that when I heard that, I thought: Here we go again, an old political friend is going to come up here and run this important agency. This could be awful. I am happy to report I was wrong. Jamie Lee Witt did an extraordinary job. I never heard a word of criticism about the job he did for 8 years in Washington. He had skills, extraordinary skills, and brought them to the job. But we need at this moment in time to ask critical questions as to whether there are men and women in this administration such as Michael Brown who are not prepared to deal with the next challenge to the United States.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from Time magazine of this week entitled ``How Many More Mike Browns Are Out There?''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From TIME Magazine, Sep. 25, 2005]                How Many More Mike Browns Are Out There?           (By Mark Thompson, Karen Tumulty, and Mike Allen)       In presidential politics, the victor always gets the      spoils, and chief among them is the vast warren of offices      that make up the federal bureaucracy. Historically, the U.S.      public has never paid much attention to the people the      President chooses to sit behind those thousands of desks. A      benign cronyism is more or less presumed, with old friends      and big donors getting comfortable positions and impressive      titles, and with few real consequences for the nation.       But then came Michael Brown. When President Bush's former      point man on disasters was discovered to have more expertise      about the rules of Arabian horse competition than about the      management of a catastrophe, it was a reminder that the      competence of government officials who are not household      names can have a life or death impact. The Brown debacle has      raised pointed questions about whether political connections,      not qualifications, have helped an unusually high number of      Bush appointees land vitally important jobs in the Federal      Government.       The Bush Administration didn't invent cronyism; John F.      Kennedy turned the Justice Department over to his brother,      while Bill Clinton gave his most ambitious domestic policy      initiative to his wife. Jimmy Carter made his old friend Bert      Lance his budget director, only to see him hauled in front of      the Senate to answer questions on his past banking practices      in Georgia, and George H.W. Bush deposited so many friends at      the Commerce Department that the agency was known internally      as ``Bush Gardens.'' The difference is that this Bush      Administration had a plan from day one for remakmg the      bureaucracy, and has done so with greater success.       As far back as the Florida recount, soon-to-be Vice      President Dick Cheney was poring over organizational charts      of the government with an eye toward stocking it with people      sympathetic to the incoming Administration. Clay Johnson III,      Bush's former Yale roommate and the Administration's chief      architect of personnel, recalls preparing for the inner      circle's first trip from Austin, Texas, to Washington: ``We      were standing there getting ready to get on a plane,      looking at each other like: Can you believe what we're      getting ready to do?''       The Office of Personnel Management's Plum Book, published      at the start of each presidential Administration, shows that      there are more than 3,000 positions a President can fill      without consideration for civil service rules. And Bush has      gone further than most Presidents to put political stalwarts      in some of the most important government jobs you've never      heard of, and to give them genuine power over the      bureaucracy. ``These folks are really good at using the      instruments of government to promote the President's      political agenda,'' says Paul Light, a professor of public      service at New York University and a well-known expert on the      machinery of government. ``And I think that takes you well      into the gray zone where few Presidents have dared to go in      the past. It's the coordination and centralization that's      important here.''       The White House makes no apologies for organizing      government in a way that makes it easier to carry out Bush's      agenda. Johnson says the centralization is ``very      intentional, and it starts with the people you pick . . .      They're there to implement the President's priorities.''      Johnson asserts that appointees are chosen on merit, with      political credentials used only as a tie breaker between      qualified people. ``Everybody knows somebody,'' he says.      ``Were they appointed because they knew somebody? No. What we      focused on is: Does the government work, and can it be caused      to work better and more responsibly? . . . We want the      programs to work.'' But across the government, some      experienced civil servants say they are being shut out of the      decision making at their agencies. ``It depresses people,      right down to the level of a clerk-typist,'' says Leo Bosner,      head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA's)      largest union. ``The senior to mid-level managers have really      been pushed into a corner career-wise.''       Some of the appointments are raising serious concerns in      the agencies themselves and on Capitol Hill about the      competence and independence of agencies that the country      relies on to keep us safe, healthy and secure. Internal e-     mail messages obtained by TIME show that scientists' drug-     safety decisions at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)      are being second-guessed by a 33-year-old doctor turned stock      picker. At the Office of Management and Budget, an ex-     lobbyist with minimal purchasing experience oversaw $300      billion in spending, until his arrest last week. At the      Department of Homeland Security, an agency the Administration      initially resisted, a well-connected White House aide with      minimal experience is poised to take over what many consider      the single most crucial post in ensuring that terrorists do      not enter the country again. And who is acting as watchdog at      every federal agency? A corps of inspectors general who may      be increasingly chosen more for their political credentials      than their investigative ones.       Nowhere in the federal bureaucracy is it more important to      insulate government experts from the influences of politics      and special interests than at the Food and Drug      Administration, the agency charged with assuring the safety      of everything from new vaccines and dietary supplements to      animal feed and hair dye. That is why many within the      department, as well as in the broader scientific      community, were startled when, in July, Scott Gottlieb was      named deputy commissioner for medical and scientific      affairs, one of three deputies in the agency's second-     ranked post at FDA.       His official FDA biography notes that Gottlieb, 33, who got      his medical degree at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, did a      previous stint providing policy advice at the agency, as well      as at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and was      a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative      think tank. What the bio omits is that his most recent job      was as editor of a popular Wall Street newsletter, the      Forbes/Gottlieb Medical Technology Investor, in which he      offered such tips as ``Three Biotech Stocks to Buy Now.'' In      declaring Gottlieb a ``noted authority'' who had written more      than 300 policy and medical articles, the biography neglects      the fact that many of those articles criticized the FDA for      being too slow to approve new drugs and too quick to issue      warning letters when it suspects ones already on the market      might be unsafe. FDA Commissioner Lester Crawford, who      resigned suddenly and without explanation last Friday, wrote      in response to e-mailed questions that Gottlieb is ``talented      and smart, and I am delighted to have been able to recruit      him back to the agency to help me fulfill our public-health      goals.'' But others, including Jimmy Carter-era FDA      Commissioner Donald Kennedy, a former Stanford University      president and now executive editor-in-chief     of the journal Science, say Gottlieb breaks the mold of      appointees at that level who are generally career FDA      scientists or experts well known in their field. ``The      appointment comes out of nowhere. I've never seen anything      like that,'' says Kennedy.       Gottlieb's financial ties to the drug industry were at one      time quite extensive. Upon taking his new job, he recused      himself for up to a year from any deliberations involving      nine companies that are regulated by the FDA and ``where a      reasonable person would question my impartiality in the      matter.'' Among them are Eli Lilly, Roche and Proctor &      Gamble, according to his Aug. 5 ``Disqualification Statement      Regarding Former Clients,'' a copy of which was obtained by      TIME. Gottlieb, though, insists that his role at the agency      is limited to shaping broad policies, such as improving      communication between the FDA, doctors and patients, and      developing a strategy for dealing with pandemics of such      diseases as flu, West Nile virus and SARS.       Would he ever be involved in determining whether an      individual drug should be on the market? ``Of course not,''      Gottlieb told TIME. ``Not only wouldn't I be involved in that      . . . But I would not be in a situation where I would be      adjudicating the scientific or medical expertise of the [FDA]      on a review matter. That's not my role. It's not my      expertise. We defer to the career staff to make scientific      and medical decisions.''       Behind the scenes, however, Gottlieb has shown an interest      in precisely those kinds of deliberations. One instance took      place on Sept. 15, when the FDA decided to stop the trial of      a drug for multiple sclerosis during which three people      had developed an unusual disorder in which their bodies      eliminated their blood platelets and one died of      intracerebral bleeding as a result. In an e-mail obtained      by TIME, Gottlieb speculated that the complication might      have been the result of the disease and not the drug.      ``Just seems like an overreaction to place a clinical      hold'' on the trial, he wrote. An FDA scientist rejected      his analysis and replied that the complication ``seems      very clearly a drug-related event.'' Two days prior, when      word broke that the FDA had sent a ``non-approvable''      letter to Pfizer Inc., formally rejecting its Oporia drug      for osteoporosis, senior officials at the FDA's Center for      Drug Evaluation and Research received copies of an e-mail      from Gottlieb expressing his surprise that what he thought      would be a routine approval had been turned down. Gottlieb      asked for an explanation.       Gottlieb defends his e-mails, which were circulated widely      at the FDA. ``Part of my job is to ask questions both so I      understand how the agency works, and how it reaches its      decisions,'' he told TIME. However, a scientist at the agency      said they ``really confirmed people's worst fears that he was      only going to be happy if we were acting in a way that would      make the pharmaceutical industry happy.''       The Oporia decision gave Pfizer plenty of reason to be      unhappy: the drug had been expected to produce $1 billion a      year in sales for the company. Pfizer's stock fell 1.4% the      day the rejection was announced. The FDA has not revealed why      it rejected the drug, and Pfizer has said it is ``considering      various courses of action'' that might resuscitate its      application for approval.       Health experts note that Gottlieb's appointment comes at a      time of increased tension between the agency and drug      companies, which are concerned that new drugs will have a      more difficult time making it onto the market in the wake of      the type of safety problems that persuaded Merck to pull its      best-selling painkiller Vioxx from the market last year. The      agency's independence has also come under question, most      recently with its decision last month to prevent the      emergency contraceptive known as Plan B from being sold over      the counter, after an FDA advisory panel recommended it could      be. That Gottlieb sits at the second tier of the agency,      critics say, sends anything but a reassuring signal.       David Safavian didn't have much hands-on experience in      government contracting when the Bush Administration tapped      him in 2003 to be its chief procurement officer. A law-school      internship helping the Pentagon buy helicopters was about the      extent of it. Yet as administrator of the Office of Federal      Procurement Policy, Safavian, 38, was placed in charge of the      $300 billion the government spends each year on everything      from paper clips to nuclear submarines, as well as the $62      billion already earmarked for Hurricane Katrina recovery      efforts. It was his job to ensure that the government got the      most for its money and that competition for federal      contracts--among companies as well as between government      workers and private contractors--was fair. It was his job      until he resigned on Sept. 16 and was subsequently arrested      and charged with lying and obstructing a criminal      investigation into Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff's      dealings with the Federal Government.       Safavian spent the bulk of his pregovernment career as a      lobbyist, and his nomination to a top oversight position      stunned the tightly knit federal procurement community. A      dozen procurement experts interviewed by TIME said he was the      most unqualified person to hold the job since its creation in      1974. Most of those who held the post before Safavian were      well-versed in the arcane world of federal contracts.      ``Safavian is a good example of a person who had great party      credentials but no substantive credentials,'' says Danielle      Brian, executive director of the Project on Government      Oversight, a nonprofit Washington watchdog group. ``It's one      of the most powerful positions in terms of impacting what the      government does, and the kind of job--like FEMA director--     that needs to be filled by a professional.'' Nevertheless,      Safavian's April 2004 confirmation hearing before the Senate      Governmental Affairs Committee (attended by only five of the      panel's 17 members) lasted just 67 minutes, and not a single      question was asked about his qualifications.       The committee did hold up Safavian's confirmation for a      year, in part because of concerns about work his lobbying      firm, Janus-Merritt Strategies, had done that he was required      to divulge to the panel but failed to. The firm's filings      showed that it represented two men suspected of links to      terrorism (Safavian said one of the men was ``erroneously      listed,'' and the other's omission was an ``inadvertent      error'') as well as two suspect African regimes. Ultimately,      the committee and the full Senate unanimously approved      Safavian for the post.       His political clout, federal procurement experts say      privately, came from his late-1990s lobbying partnership with      Grover Norquist, now head of Americans for Tax Reform and a      close ally of the Bush Administration. Norquist is an antitax      advocate who once famously declared that his goal was to      shrink the Federal Government so he could ``drag it into the      bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.'' As the U.S.      procurement czar, Safavian was pushing in that direction by      seeking to shift government work to private contractors,      contending it was cheaper. Federal procurement insiders say      his relationship with Norquist gave Safavian the edge in      snaring the procurement post. But Norquist has ``no memory''      of urging the Administration to put Safavian in the post,      says an associate speaking on Norquist's behalf. A White      House official said Norquist ``didn't influence the      decision.'' Clay Johnson, who was designated by the White      House to answer all of TIME's questions about administration      staffing issues and who oversaw the procurement post, says      Safavian was ``by far the most qualified person'' for the      job. Perhaps it also didn't hurt that Safavian's wife      Jennifer works as a lawyer for the House Government Reform      Committee, which oversees federal contracting.       In addition, Safavian had worked at a law firm in the mid-     '90s with Jack Abramoff, one of the capital's highest-paid      lobbyists, a top G.O.P. fund raiser and a close friend of      House majority leader Tom DeLay. Abramoff was indicted last      month on unrelated fraud and conspiracy charges. In 2002,      Abramoff invited Safavian on a weeklong golf outing to      Scotland's famed St. Andrews course (as Abramoff had done      with DeLay in 2000). Seven months after the trip, an      anonymous call to a government hotline said lobbyists had      picked up the tab for the jaunt. That wasn't true;      Safavian paid $3,100 for the trip. But the government      alleges that he lied when he repeatedly told investigators      that Abramoff had no business dealings with the General      Services Administration, where Safavian worked at the      time. Prosecutors alleged last week, however, that      Safavian worked closely with Abramoff--identified only as      ``Lobbyist A'' in the criminal complaint against      Safavian--to give Abramoff an inside track in his efforts      to acquire control of two pieces of federal property in      the Washington area. Safavian, who is free without bail,      declined to be interviewed for this story. His attorney,      Barbara Van Gelder, said the government is trying to      pressure her client to help in its probe of Abramoff.      ``This is a creative use of the criminal code to secure      his cooperation,'' she said.       Three days after the Sept. 12 resignation of FEMA's Michael      Brown, Julie Myers, the Bush Administration's nominee to head      Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) came before the      Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.      The session did not go well. ``I think we ought to have a      meeting with [Homeland Security Secretary] Mike Chertoff,''      Ohio Republican George Voinovich told Myers. ``I'd really      like to have him spend some time with us, telling us      personally why he thinks you're qualified for the job.      Because based on the resume, I don't think you are.''       Immigration and Customs Enforcement is one of 22 agencies      operating under the umbrella of the Department of Homeland      Security, but its function goes to the heart of why the      department was created: to prevent terrorists from slipping      into the U.S. If that weren't enough, the head once must also      contend with money launderers, drug smugglers, illegal-arms      merchants and the vast responsibility that comes with      managing 20,000 government employees and a $4 billion budget.      Expectations were high that whoever was appointed to fill the      job would be, in the words of Michael Greenberger, head of      the University of Maryland's Center for Health and Homeland      Security, ``a very high-powered, well-recognized intelligence      manager. ``       Instead the Administration nominated Myers, 36, currently a      special assistant handling personnel issues for Bush. She has      experience in law enforcement management, including jobs in      the White House and the Commerce, Justice and Treasury      departments, but she barely meets the five-year minimum      required by law. Her most significant responsibility has been      as Assistant Secretary for Export Enforcement at the Commerce      Department, where, she told Senators, she supervised 170      employees and a $25 million budget.       Myers may appear short on qualifications, but she has      plenty of connections. She     worked briefly for Chertoff as his chief of staff at the      Justice Department's criminal division, and two days after      her hearing, she married Chertoff's current chief of staff,      John Wood. Her uncle is Air Force General Richard Myers,      the outgoing Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Julie      Myers was on her honeymoon last week and was unavailable      to comment on the questions about her qualifications      raised by the Senate. A representative referred TIME to      people who had worked with her, one of whom was Stuart      Levey, the Treasury Department's Under Secretary for      Terrorism and Financial Crime. ``She was great, and she      impressed everyone around her in all these jobs,'' he      said. ``She's very efficient, and she's assertive and      strong and smart, and I think she's wonderful.''       To critics, Myers' appointment is a symptom of deeper ills      in the Homeland Security Department, a huge new bureaucracy      that the Bush Administration resisted creating. Among those      problems, they say, is a tendency on the part of the      Administration's political appointees to discard in-house      expertise, particularly when it could lead to additional      government regulation of industry. For instance, when      Congress passed the intelligence reform bill last year, it      gave the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) a      deadline of April 1, 2005, to come up with plans to assess      the threat to various forms of shipping and transportation--     including rail, mass transit, highways and pipelines--and      make specific proposals for strengthening security. Two      former high-ranking Homeland Security officials tell TIME      that the plans were nearly complete and had been put into      thick binders in early April for final review when Deputy      Secretary Michael Jackson abruptly reassigned that      responsibility to the agency's policy shop. Jackson was      worried that presenting Congress with such detailed proposals      would only invite it to return later and demand to know why      Homeland Security had not carried them out. ``If we put this      out there, this is what we're going to be held to,'' says one      of the two officials, characterizing Jackson's stance. Nearly      six months after Congress's deadline, in the wake of the      summer's subway bombings in London, TSA spokeswoman Amy Von      Walter says the agency is in the process of declassifying the      document and expects to post a short summary on its website      soon.       In the meantime, Myers' nomination could be in trouble.      Voinovich says his concerns were satisfied after a 35-minute      call with Chertoff, in which the Homeland Security Secretary      argued forcefully on Myers' behalf. But other senators are      raising questions, and Democrats have seized on Myers'      appointment as an example of the Bush Administration's      preference for political allies over experience.       The Post-Watergate law creating the position of inspector      general (IG) states that the federal watchdogs must be hired      ``without regard to political affiliation,'' on the basis of      their ability in such disciplines as accounting, auditing and      investigating. It may not sound like the most exciting job,      but the 57 inspectors general in the Federal Government can      be the last line of defense against fraud and abuse. Because      their primary duty is to ask nosy questions, their      independence is crucial.       But critics say some of the Bush IGs have been too cozy      with the Administration. ``The IGs have become more political      over the years, and it seems to have accelerated,'' said A.      Ernest Fitzgerald, who has been battling the Defense      Department since his 1969 discovery of $2 billion in cost      overruns on a cargo plane, and who, at 79, still works as      a civilian Air Force manager. A study by Representative      Henry Waxman of California, the top Democrat on the House      Government Reform Committee, found that more than 60% of      the IGs nominated by the Bush Administration had political      experience and less than 20% had auditing experience--     almost the obverse of those measures during the Clinton      Administration. About half the current IGs are holdovers      from Clinton.       Johnson says political connections may be a thumb on the      scale between two candidates with equal credentials, but      rarely are they the overriding factor in a personnel      decision. Speaking of all such appointments, not just the      IGs, he said, ``I am aware of one or two situations where      politics carried the day and the person was not in the job a      year later.''       Still, several of the President's IGs fit comfortably into      the friends-and family category. Until recently, the most      famous Bush inspector general was Janet Rehnquist, a daughter      of the late Chief Justice. Rehnquist had been a lawyer for      the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and      worked in the counsel's office during George H.W. Bush's      presidency before becoming an IG at the Department of Health      and Human Services. In that sense, she was qualified for the      job. But a scathing report by the Government Accountability      Office asserted that she had ``created the perception that      she lacked appropriate independence in certain situations''      and had ``compromised her ability to serve as an effective      leader.'' Rehnquist also faced questions about travel that      included sightseeing and free time, her decision to delay an      audit of the Florida pension system at the request of the      President's brother, Governor Jeb Bush of Florida, and the      unauthorized gun she kept in her office. She resigned in June      2003 ahead of the report.       Three weeks ago, however, Joseph Schmitz supplanted      Rehnquist as the most notorious Bush IG. Schmitz, who worked      as an aide to former Reagan Administration Attorney General      Ed Meese and whose father John was a Republican Congressman      from Orange County, Calif., quit his post at the Pentagon      following complaints from Senate Finance Committee chairman      Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa. In particular, Grassley      questioned Schmitz's acceptance of a trip to South Korea,      paid for in part by a former lobbying client, according to      Senate staff members and public lobbying records, and      Schmitz's use of eight tickets to a Washington Nationals      baseball game. But those issues aren't the ones that led to      questions about his independence from the White House. Those      concerns came to light after Schmitz chose to show the White      House his department's final report on a multiyear      investigation into the Air Force's plan to lease air-     refueling tankers from Boeing for much more than it would      have cost to buy them. After two weeks of talks with the      Administration, Schmitz agreed to black out the names of      senior White House officials who appeared to have played a      role in pushing and approving what turned out to be a      controversial procurement arrangement. Schmitz ultimately      sent the report to Capitol Hill, but Senators are irked that      they have not yet received an original, unredacted copy.       Congressional aides said they are still scratching their      heads about how Schmitz got his job. He now works for the      parent company of Blackwater USA, a military contractor that,      in his old job, he might have been responsible for      investigating.
