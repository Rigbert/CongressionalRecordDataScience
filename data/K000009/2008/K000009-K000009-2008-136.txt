This month, Sylvania celebrates the 150th anniversary of its founding.  Founded in 1833 by General David White and Judge William Wilson at the junction of Ten Mile and Ottawa Creeks near the present day border of Ohio and Michigan, the area was originally the campgrounds of Erie, Chippewa and Wyandot tribes. First settlers' names continue through generations, including Lathrop, Pease, Printup, Rice, Green and Cosgrove. They established the first Sylvania school and church early on: both the Stone Academy and First Presbyterian Church were established in 1834.  In 1876, the town was formally incorporated. Truly a sylvan glade with more than one thousand trees, Sylvania took its name from theLatin ``sylvan'' meaning ``the woods.'' It remains a city of trees today, including 27 varieties of maple, with the maple leaf as the city's symbol.  In the decades which followed through the nineteenth, twentieth, and now the twenty-first century, Sylvania has prospered. It is a caring community with fine schools and first rate services for young and old and families. Sylvania remains a bucolic community reminiscent of its wooded early history, yet offers a bustling suburban economy of thriving businesses. Its Main Street retains charm from its past, but Sylvania at 150 years is a city moving forward. I am pleased to offer the congratulations of our entire region during this sesquicentennial celebration.                          ____________________
