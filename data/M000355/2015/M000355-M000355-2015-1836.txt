 President, today I had the honor of addressing the legendary World War II-era 1st Special Service Force, a joint American-Canadian special forces military unit called the Devil's Brigade, on the occasion of the surviving members of that elite unit receiving the Congressional Gold Medal. I ask for unanimous consent that my remarks be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Sometimes, truth can be more impressive than fiction.       When it comes to the heroes we honor today, that's      certainly the case.       Members of the elite ``Devil's Brigade'' excelled in rock-     climbing and amphibious assault.       They advanced on skis and through the air. They survived by      stealth, and trained in demolitions.       Some of their more daring mission plans would've made James      Bond blush.       And through it all, they helped save a continent in chaos.      They helped defeat some of the greatest menaces our world has      known.       But this isn't just some Hollywood script. It's a true      story about a fearless group of young Canadians and      Americans--including many Kentuckians--who were willing to      put their lives on the line in the truest sense of the term.       Some probably did it to protect neighbors and families.      Others to defend cherished democratic ideals. Many likely      fought for all these reasons.       And they volunteered for this danger. Here's how the      force's recruiting slogan read:     Vigorous training.     Hazardous duty.     For those who measure up, get into the war quick.       Typical Madison Avenue spin, this was not.       But it was honest.       The fighting could be fierce. Conditions could be awful.      The missions, seemingly impossible.       Yet, dark masses of boot polish and young courage--fighting      knives gripped tightly in hand, elements purged consciously      from thought--advanced against the Wehrmacht and held strong      against forces of fascism.       The Devil's Brigade, heeding Churchill's call for      ``specially trained troops of the hunter class'' who might      unleash ``a reign of terror'' against the Nazis, became a      feared adversary.       But these ``Devils'' only rented space in the shadows. They      moved within darkness in order to defeat it.       And today, here they are. Champions of freedom. Heroes in      two nations. Saviors to many others.       To you, we offer our most profound gratitude for      distinguished service.       To the families gathered today, know that your loved one      made a difference. Know that the veteran you've loved made a      contribution to history that we as a people will not soon      forget.       As the son of a World War II veteran, I'm particularly      determined to ensure we don't.       That's why we will soon dedicate the highest civilian honor      Congress can bestow.       It may only be a piece of metal, but it carries the      gratitude of a nation.       May you always remember it.                          ____________________
