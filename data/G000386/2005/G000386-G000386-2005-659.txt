 President, today I want to pay tribute to the life of Jesse Nichols, Sr., who passed away on February 22, 2005. Jesse R. Nichols, Sr., faithfully served the U.S. Senate for over 30 years. He was the first African American Clerk employed by the U.S. Senate.  Jesse Nichols was born on June 14, 1909, in Clarksdale, MS. He began his service when the late Pat Harrison of Mississippi was the distinguished Chairman of the Finance Committee--the committee I am now privileged to chair.  Jesse was appointed as a messenger for the Finance Committee in 1936, and was elevated about 6 months later to assistant clerk of the Committee. At that time, the staff of the Finance Committee numbered only three.  In 1967, on the occasion of his thirtieth anniversary on the Senate staff, several members of the Finance Committee, led by Delaware Republican John J. Williams, rose in the Senate chamber to pay tribute to Jesse Nichols who had ``earned the respect of those former giants of the Senate, each of whom was proud to call him a friend.''  Senator Williams added that:       It is refreshing to meet a man who throughout the years has      served the Senate and his country with but one thought in      mind, and that is, to do his job to the best of his ability,      always remembering that as a Government employee he is a      servant of the people.  Senate Republican Leader Everett Dirksen added his endorsement, noting that:       Thirty years of faithful and devoted service certainly      deserves to be taken account of in the proceedings of this      body.  An oral history interview conducted by the Senate Historical Office from March 26 to April 12, 1994, is available on the Senate Web site. The history documents Jesse's employment by the Committee on Finance from the 75th Congress through the 91st Congress.  He worked under the guidance of Democratic and Republican Chairmen, including Walter F. George of Georgia, I Senator Eugene Millikin of Colorado, Harry Flood Byrd of Virginia and Russell B. Long of Louisiana.  Jesse Nichols' service was faithful, exemplary and noteworthy. He served not only the Finance Committee with class and grace, but also the Senate as a whole during that critical period in American history. I join my colleagues in recognizing Mr. Nichols' life and am grateful to his service to our country.                              S. Res. 168       Whereas Jesse R. Nichols, Sr., faithfully served the United      States Senate and the Committee on Finance as the Government      Documents Clerk and Librarian from nineteen hundred thirty-     seven through nineteen hundred seventy-one;       Whereas Jesse R. Nichols, Sr., was born on June 14, 1909,      in Clarksdale, Mississippi, and was the first African      American Clerk employed by the United States Senate;       Whereas he carried out his duties in exemplary fashion,      bringing credit to the Committee and to Congress;       Whereas Jesse Nichols worked effectively under the guidance      of Democratic and Republican Chairmen, including Pat Harrison     of Mississippi, Walter F. George of Georgia, Harry Flood Byrd      of Virginia and Russell B. Long of Louisiana from the 75th      Congress through the 91st Congress; and       Whereas the Committee on Finance will long remember the      commitment, service and leadership of Jesse R. Nichols, Sr.,      as documented in an oral history posted on the Senate      Historian's website: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the United States Senate expresses its deep      gratitude and sincere respect for Jesse R. Nichols for his      unfailing service and his dedication to the United States      Senate. The Senate hereby expresses condolences to the family      due to the death of Jesse R. Nichols, Sr., on February 18,      2005.                          ____________________
