 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of the week, and any votes called on those measures will be rolled until 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday, the House will convene at 10 a.m. We plan to consider H.R. 1561, the Patent & Trademark Fee Modernization Act. In addition, we plan to consider H.R. 3752, the Commercial Space Launch Amendments Act. And, finally, I would like to remind all Members that we do not plan to have any votes next Friday, March 5.  I thank the gentleman for yielding and will be happy to answer any questions he may have.
