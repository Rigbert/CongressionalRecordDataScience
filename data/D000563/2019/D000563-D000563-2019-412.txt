 But the nominee, Daniel Bress, is a Washington, DC, lawyer who has only lived in California for 1 year since high school.  Mr. Bress checks many of the usual boxes that we see for Republican judicial nominees: He is very young--only 40 years old--he has a track record of representing big corporate interests, and he is a longtime member of the Federalist Society.  But what is new and different about this nominee is that, by any reasonable standard, he is not a member of the legal community of the State in which he would sit if confirmed.  Mr. Bress is listed by the California bar as an out-of-State attorney. He belongs to no legal societies or organizations in California. He has only workedon a handful of matters in California courts.  He doesn't own property in California or even have a California driver's license. Mr. Bress's nomination is opposed by California's two Senators, neither of whom have provided a blue slip. He was reported out of the Judiciary Committee with opposition from all committee Democrats.  To my Republicans colleagues, I say this: The vote on the Bress nomination will set a precedent that could come back to haunt your State.  Any Senator who votes to confirm Mr. Bress is giving their blessing to a process that could cause an out-of-state attorney to be seated in a circuit court judgeship in your own State, over the objection of your State's Senators.  There are thousands of well-qualified attorneys living and practicing in California whom the Trump administration could have selected for this California-based Ninth Circuit seat. They bypassed all of them in favor of a Washington, DC, attorney with minimal California ties.  There have been many breakdowns in the Senate's process for confirming judicial nominees under this Republican majority. If the Senate votes to confirm Mr. Bress, it would represent yet another new precedent that diminishes the Senate's advice and consent process. I urge my colleagues to vote no.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cassidy). The Senator from Florida.                           Order of Procedure
