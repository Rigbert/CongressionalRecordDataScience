Res. 231       Whereas news of the end of slavery did not reach frontier      areas of the United States, and in particular the      Southwestern States, for more than 2 years after President      Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, and      months after the conclusion of the Civil War;       Whereas, on June 19, 1865, Union soldiers led by Major      General Gordon Granger arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news      that the Civil War had ended and that the enslaved were free;       Whereas African Americans who had been slaves in the      Southwest celebrated June 19, commonly known as ``Juneteenth      Independence Day'', as the anniversary of their emancipation;       Whereas African Americans from the Southwest continue the      tradition of celebrating Juneteenth Independence Day as      inspiration and encouragement for future generations;       Whereas, for more than 140 years, Juneteenth Independence      Day celebrations have been held to honor African American      freedom while encouraging self-development and respect for      all cultures;       Whereas, although Juneteenth Independence Day is beginning      to be recognized as a national, and even global, event, the      history behind the celebration should not be forgotten; and       Whereas the faith and strength of character demonstrated by      former slaves remains an example for all people of the United      States, regardless of background, religion, or race: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That--       (1) the Senate--       (A) recognizes the historical significance of Juneteenth      Independence Day to the Nation;       (B) supports the continued celebration of Juneteenth      Independence Day to provide an opportunity for the people of      the United States to learn more about the past and to      understand better the experiences that have shaped the      Nation; and       (C) encourages the people of the United States to observe      Juneteenth Independence Day with appropriate ceremonies,      activities, and programs; and       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that--       (A) history should be regarded as a means for understanding      the past and solving the challenges of the future; and       (B) the celebration of the end of slavery is an important      and enriching part of the history and heritage of the United      States.
