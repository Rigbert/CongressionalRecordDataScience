Chairman, if my colleague would yield for a moment, I certainly appreciate the gentleman striking and yielding the time.  Again, I understand and appreciate the gentleman's concern and his passion about this. Obviously, I cannot make any representations, other than I would want to stay in touch with both gentlemen and see what can be done and to work closely with you.  But I appreciate again the circumstances you find yourself in and would be happy to try to work with you.
