  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1990       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Emergency Contraception      Education Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) each year, 3,000,000 pregnancies, or one half of all      pregnancies, in the United States are unintended, and half of      all of these unintended pregnancies end in abortion;       (2) the Food and Drug Administration has declared emergency      contraception to be safe and effective in preventing      unintended pregnancy, reducing the risk by as much as 89      percent;       (3) the most commonly used forms of emergency contraception      are regimens of ordinary birth control pills taken within 72      hours of unprotected intercourse or contraceptive failure;       (4) emergency contraception, also known as post-coital      contraception, is a responsible means of preventing pregnancy      that works like other hormonal contraception to delay      ovulation, prevent fertilization or prevent implantation;       (5) emergency contraception does not cause abortion and      will not affect an established pregnancy;       (6) it is estimated that the use of emergency contraception      could cut the number of unintended pregnancies in half,      thereby reducing the need for abortion;       (7) emergency contraceptive use is the United States      remains low, and 9 in 10 women of reproductive age remain      unaware of the method;       (8) although the American College of Obstetricians and      Gynecologists recommends that doctors routinely offer women      of reproductive age a prescription for emergency      contraceptive pills during their annual visit, only 1 in 5      ob/gyns routinely discuss emergency contraception with their      patients, suggesting the need for greater provider and      patient education;       (9) in light of their safety and efficacy, both the      American Medical Association and the American College of      Obstetricians and Gynecologists have endorsed more widespread      availability of emergency contraceptive pills, and have      recommended that dedicated emergency contraceptive products      be available without a prescription;       (10) Healthy People 2010, published by the Office of the      Surgeon General, establishes a 10-year national public health      goal of increasing the proportion of health care providers      who provide emergency contraception to their patients; and       (11) public awareness campaigns targeting women and health      care providers will help remove many of the barriers to      emergency contraception and will help bring this important      means of pregnancy prevention to American women.
