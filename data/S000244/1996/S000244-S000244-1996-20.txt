Speaker, I would just like to point out that in the hometown of the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey], hometown of Wausau, there was a 7-hour publichearing on October 17, 1995, where 82 individuals either appeared or registered before the committee at the hearing.  What the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey] apparently wants to do is to ignore the input that those 82 individuals gave in his hometown to elected legislators, and have bureaucrats in the Department of Health and Human Services end up deciding what waivers to approve, what waivers to modify, and what waivers to reject, and thus write the final welfare reform plan. I have much greater faith in the folks who appeared at the hearing in Wausaw than the folks across the street in the HHS building.
