 President, I rise in opposition to the Hope Offered through Principled and Ethical Stem Cell Research Act, S. 30.  My objection to this bill is simple. This legislation will do nothing to overturn President Bush's failed policy that is restricting access to viable stem cell lines.  The United States Senate must be very careful when incorporating scientific concepts, and scientific definitions, into legislation. This bill relies on the notion of so-called ``naturally dead'' embryos to provide viable stem cells. It defines these embryos as:       having naturally and irreversibly lost the capacity for      integrated cellular division, growth, and differentiation      that is characteristic of an organism, even if some cells of      the former organism may be alive in a disorganized state.  We do not know what the implications of this definition may ultimately be. And the fact is, neither do many scientists. As the leadership of The American Society for Cell Biology wrote yesterday,       Naturally dead is a scientifically meaningless idea. To our      knowledge, there is no scientifically credible way to      determine this.  They continue:       It is critically important that the Senate proceed with      caution as it continues its work in the area of scientific      policy. Legislation based on inaccurate science could have a      detrimental impact on the course of the American biomedical      research enterprise.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.
