m. Following morning business, the Senate will begin the consideration of the energy bill. Under the previous agreement, no amendments will be in order to the bill until Thursday, but Members are encouraged to come to the floor to debate the bill.  In addition to the energy bill, the Senate may begin consideration of any of the following items tomorrow: State Department reauthorization bill, the air cargo security bill, the FAA reauthorization bill, the NATO expansion treaty, as well as any nominations that can be cleared. Therefore, Members should anticipate rollcall votes during tomorrow's session. I encourage Members to plan for a busy week with votes possible each day.  I am going to put in a quorum call in the hopes that we can work out the agreement under which we were going to go to the NATO expansion bill before we leave tonight.
