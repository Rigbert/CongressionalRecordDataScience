 D'AMATO. We share the Senator's concern. In response, let me say that it is not our intent that the regulators implement the deposit shifting provision in a way that would raise constitutional free speech issues. The Supreme Court has made it clear that the first amendment protections do indeed extend to lawful and accurate business communications and we expect the regulators to abide by these decisions.                          ____________________
