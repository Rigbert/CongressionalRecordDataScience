 Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt) for yielding me the time. I apologize for being late. I will be very brief.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3180, the New Hampshire-Vermont Interstate School Compact Consent. This bill will permit the residents of the Dresden School District, which includes Norwich, Vermont, and Hanover, New Hampshire, to implement a change in the procedure used to approve bond initiatives.  The Dresden School District, with the approval of the legislatures of Vermont and New Hampshire, wants to be able to implement all-day secret balloting when appropriate instead of the town meeting system, which is the only approved method currently. Given that the communities involved and the respective States have approved this initiative, we in the Congress should grant our approval.  I thank the chairman and ranking member for moving this bill, and I urge its adoption.
