President, before we go to third reading, I wish to thank Senator Gregg for his tireless efforts on this bill and the Members of the Appropriations Committee which passed this bill originally 28 to 1. I will say more about Senator Gregg's staff and my staff tomorrow so as not to hold up third reading.
