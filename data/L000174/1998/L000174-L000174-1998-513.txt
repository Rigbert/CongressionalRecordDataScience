President, if the distinguished Senator from Utah will stay on the floor for a moment on this, I know there are a number of Senators, especially the two distinguished Senators from Pennsylvania, and others who wish to speak. I advise Senators that I am only going to hold the floor for a moment.  I would like to underscore something that the distinguished Senator from Utah said, which is that if this matter does not come to a vote in the next couple of days and stays on the calendar during that time, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee has the authority to hold further hearings, if he wishes to, even though the matter is here pending on the calendar. It is something that can be done without the direction one way or the other from the Senate as a body.  I would also note that the distinguished chairman and I have a long practice of discussing first privately issues of this nature that may come up so that we can then report back to the individual Members on our side of the aisle where we are going. I know that the distinguished Senator from Utah would do that. I mention this only to say that I do not want in any way to limit anyone's right to speak, but I will reserve any comments that I might make until after the time I have discussed this matter privately withthe Senator from Utah. I will certainly listen to the things that are said by other Senators on the floor. I want to note an agreement with what the Senator from Utah has said, which is, of course, that the committee has the right to hold further hearings while this matter is pending before the Senate. It is not often done. But certainly it could be.  Mr. President, I am about to suggest the absence of a quorum, and I will assure Senators that I will have no objection to having it called off in about 1 minute. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
