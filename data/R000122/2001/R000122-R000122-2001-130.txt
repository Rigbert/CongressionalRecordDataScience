President, I rise today to introduce the Professional Development Reform Act to strengthen and improve professional development opportunities for teachers and administrators.  I have long worked to improve the quality of teaching in America's classrooms for the simple reason that well-trained and well-prepared teachers and principals are central to improving the academic performance and achievement of students. In the 105th Congress, I introduced the TEACH Act to reform the way our prospective teachers are trained, and I was pleased that this legislation was included in the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1998.  As Congress turns to the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, ESEA, the focus shifts to increasing support for both new and veteran classroom teachers, as well as school principals.  Research shows that professional development programs, however, too often consist of fragmented, one-shot workshops, at which teachers passively listen to experts, and lack significant opportunity for teacher interaction. The Department of Education recently evaluated the Eisenhower Professional Development program and found that the vast majority of professional development opportunities are not of sufficient duration or intensity to generate significant improvements in teaching. Other studies support that finding and show that such professional development fails to improve or even impact teaching practice.  We do not expect students to learn their ``ABCs'' after one day of lessons, and we should not expect a one-day professional development workshop to yield the desired results. Indeed, the Department of Education found that teaching would improve if teachers experienced consistent, high-quality professional development.  Moreover, a recent survey of teachers found that professional development is too short-term and lacks intensity. In fact, recent studies indicated that the majority of teachers participated inprofessional development activities from one to eight hours, or for no more than one day a year.  As a consequence, only about 1 in 5 teachers felt very well prepared for addressing the needs of students with limited English proficiency, those from culturally diverse backgrounds, and those with disabilities, or integrating educational technology into the curriculum.  There is also widespread agreement that a good principal is the keystone of a good school. However, there is great concern that the supply of quality principals may not meet the increasing demand for quality school leadership. Unfortunately, the depth and quality of support and development programs for both new and veteran principals varies widely, which creates another gap in our education system.  I am introducing legislation today which would reform professional development for teachers and principals.  There is broad consensus among experts about the elements that truly constitute an effective professional development program. Research shows that effective professional development approaches are sustained, intensive activities that focus on deepening teachers knowledge of content; allow teachers to work collaboratively; provide opportunities for teachers to practice and reflect upon their teaching; are aligned with standards and embedded in the daily work of the school; and involve parents and other community members.  Such high-quality professional development improves student achievement. Indeed, a 1998 study in California found that the more teachers were engaged in ongoing, curriculum-centered professional development, the higher their students scored on mathematics achievement on the state's assessment. Further, Community School District 2 in New York City has seen its investment in sustained, intensive professional development pay off with significant increases in student achievement. Professional development in District 2 is delivered in schools and classrooms and focused on system-wide instructional improvement, with intensive activities such as observation of exemplary teachers and classrooms both inside and outside the district, supervised practice, peer networks, and offsite training opportunities. I have visited District 2 and have seen this outstanding professional development first hand.  My legislation builds on these successful models and the research on effective professional development to create a new formula program for high-quality professional development that is sustained, collaborative, content-centered, embedded in the daily work of the school, and aligned with standards and school reform efforts.  To achieve this enhanced professional development, my legislation funds the following activities: mentoring; peer observation and coaching; curriculum-based content training; dedicated time for collaborative lesson planning; opportunities for teachers to visit other classrooms to model effective teaching practice; training on integrating technology into the curriculum, addressing the specific needs of diverse students, and involving parents; professional development networks to provide a forum for interaction and exchange of information among teachers and administrators; as well as release time and compensation for mentors and substitute teachers to make these activities possible.  The Professional Development Reform Act also requires partnerships between elementary and secondary schools and institutions of higher education for providing training opportunities, including advanced content area courses and training to address teacher shortages. In fact, Department of Education data show that the Eisenhower Professional Development program activities are most effective when they are sponsored by institutions of higher education.  My legislation will also provide funding for leadership training to encourage highly qualified individuals to become principals, and to develop and enhance leadership, management, parental involvement, and mentoring skills for principals and superintendents. Indeed, ensuring that our principals have the training and support to serve as instructional leaders is critical. Further, my legislation will provide funding for programs to encourage highly qualified and effective teachers to become mentoring teachers.  We know that our schools with the highest percentage of poverty have the greatest need for professional development improvement and resources, and that is why my bill targets funding to these schools.  Importantly, the Professional Development Reform Act offers resources but it demands results. The bill's strong accountability provisions require that school districts and schools which receive funding actually improve student performance and increase participation in sustained professional development in three years in order to secure additional funding.  In sum, my legislation seeks to ensure that new teachers and principals have the support they need to be successful educators, that all teachers have access to high quality professional development regardless of the content areas they teach, and that professional development does not isolate teachers, but rather brings teachers together as part of a coordinated and comprehensive strategy aligned with standards.  The time for action is now because schools must hire an estimated 2.2 million new teachers over the next decade due to increasing enrollments, the retirement of approximately half of our current teaching force, and high attrition rates. Ensuring that teachers and principals have the training, assistance, and support to increase student achievement and sustain them throughout their careers is a great challenge. But we must meet and overcome this challenge if we are to reform education and prepare our children for the 21st Century. The Professional Development Reform Act, by increasing our professional development investment and focusing it on the kind of activities and opportunities for teachers and administrators that research shows is effective, is critical to this effort.  I urge my colleagues to join me in this essential endeavor by cosponsoring this legislation and working for its inclusion in the reauthorization of the ESEA.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 373       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
