 President, I rise today to discuss the latest developments in Cambodia and my thoughts on how the United States should respond to these developments.  Over the past decade the United States has contributed hundreds of millions of dollars towards peace in Cambodia. What benefit has been achieved as a result of this assistance? Is Cambodia better off now than it was 10 years ago? I would argue that recent political developments have undercut most gains this assistance may have provided--and worse, our own policies have contributed to the most recent deterioration considerably.  On July 26 of this year, the Cambodian people turned out in overwhelming numbers to vote in parliamentary elections. The ruling government pointed to this impressive turnout and claimed it was representative of a free and fair process. In fact, the election was termed by one American observer as the ``Miracle on the Mekong.'' With all due respect, I question how any informed observer could make that evaluation. For one to believe this appraisal, one must completely ignore the events dating from the 1997 coup.  In truth, the events which lead up to the July 26 balloting made the prospects for free and fair elections impossible. The opposition parties infrastructure had been completely dismantled following the July 1997 coup d'etat, orchestrated by Hun Sen and his Cambodian Peoples Party (CPP). As many as 100 opposition party members were reported killed, and those who remained in Cambodia were forced to campaign in fear if they dared speak out at all. The CPP controlled access to media and thereby prevented opposition candidates from effectively getting their message out. The National Election Commission (NEC), which had oversight of the election process, was stacked almost entirely with CPP party loyalists. Each of these factors on their own would be troubling, but when looked at collectively they are an outrageous example of a government which acts with impunity and has no regard for democratic principles.  Despite this reality, the Clinton Administration joined many in the international community, including the so-called ``Friends of Cambodia,'' in pushing the parties to participate in the July 26 elections. I thought then, and I continue to believe now, that this was a mistake. To use an old phrase--with ``Friends'' like these, who needs enemies? How could we ask these brave men and women to risk their lives and take part in a process which was doomed to failure? To make matters worse, the U.S. Government now seems bent on ignoring the reality of the flawed election. Rather, it is pushing opposition leaders to participate in a parliament at the mercy of a brutal dictator who has no regard for the ruleof law. So, in the end, the United States has invested hundreds of million of dollars and the Cambodian people have little to show for our efforts.  Mr. President, since July 26th, the environment has actually deteriorated rather than improved. Opposition leaders filed hundreds of protests with the National Election Commission, only to see each of these complaints dismissed without consideration. Legitimate claims of fraud have been ignored as the CPP seeks to cement its claim to so-called ``legitimate'' authority. Let's examine a few of these problems:  Prior to the July ballot, the NEC secretly and without debate changed the formula by which parliament seats would be assigned. Only after the votes were tabulated was this new formula announced. To no one's surprise, the result was an additional five seats for Hun Sen's party, thereby preventing CPP from being in the minority. Had the original formula been in place, the parties of Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy could have combined their seats to form a majority of parliament.  Only July 27, as ballots were being processed, the NEC ordered the counting stopped. According to a senior member of the NEC, this halt in the proceedings occurred because the opposition parties had taken the lead. Not surprisingly, when counting was renewed, CPP regained control and went on to be credited with 41 percent of the total vote.  Finally, the violence continues. Immediately following the election, largely peaceful demonstrations broke out in downtown Phnom Phen. CPP armed thugs and soldiers broke up the demonstrations and dismantled the symbolic ``democracy square'' located near the National Assembly. Opposition leaders were subject to a travel ban and intimidation tactics. Finally, and most alarmingly, several Buddhist monks were murdered and reportedly tortured.  Mr. President, the question must be asked, how should the United States proceed in the face of these developments? I believe there are several concrete steps we can and must take to send the signal that we will not tolerate Hun Sen's brutal disregard for his own nation and people.  Number one, we must continue to withhold direct assistance to the Cambodian Government. This year's foreign operations appropriations bill will do just this. Only when each of the election disputes have been dealt with could aid be released.  Number two, we must not appoint an Ambassador to succeed Ambassador Quinn. Many in the opposition have already spoken out against the current nominee and I share their concerns. However, regardless of the nominee, we should send a strong signal to Hun Sen that we will not recognize his illegitimate government. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to insert a letter from Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, leaders of the two most active opposition parties. In this letter, they detail not only the election disputes, but their opposition to the current nominee to be ambassador to Cambodia.  Number three, the United States should identify Hun Sen for what he is, a criminal. Congressman Rohrabacher has introduced a resolution in the House which calls on the United States to assist in the collection of information that would lead to trying Hun Sen before an international tribunal for violation of human rights. I think Congressman Rohrabacher should be commended for his leadership, and I am hopeful similar legislation will pass in the Senate this year.  Finally, we should oppose the current Cambodian government being allowed a seat at the United Nations.  These steps are essential to staking out America's position as a defender of democracy and rule of law in Cambodia. Strong actions by the U.S. Government can give hope to the heroic members of the opposition as they continue to strive for democracy in the face of repression.  Before I yield the floor, I will ask unanimous consent that remarks from opposition leader Sam Rainsy be printed in the Record. Mr. Rainsy was invited and prepared to appear before the subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee earlier this week, but at the last minute was not allowed to testify due to objections raised by some on the committee. Mr. President, this is a shame.  Sam Rainsy, along with Prince Ranariddh and Son Soubert represent the leaders of those who are working to establish democracy and respect for human rights and rule of law. Had this not been the final hectic week of our Congressional session I would have welcomed the opportunity to host Sam Rainsy before the Foreign Operations Committee. Absent that opportunity, I believe it is important that the Senate have the ability to review Mr. Rainsy's statement, and accordingly I renew my request that his remarks be printed in the Record.  The remarks follow:       Dear Senator Helms: This letter is an appeal to you and      your Committee to take immediate action in condemning the      recent bloodshed in Cambodia caused by soldiers and police      loyal to Hun Sen. Over the past few days, many protestors      have been injured and Buddhist monks killed as these forces      have tried to silence the Cambodian people. We ask you what      kind of government murders Buddhist monks?       We do not recognize the results of the July election. The      Cambodian People's Party's (CPP) domination of the      Constitutional Council and the National Election Committee      have created a grossly uneven playing field. Our appeals and      complaints of vote fraud and counting irregularities have      been dismissed out of hand and in violation of law. Make no      mistake, Cambodia is a country ruled by a single man intent      on destroying any and all political opposition. Since last      year's coup d'etat, scores of our supporters have been      murdered, beaten, and intimidated by Hun Sen's loyalists.       It is imperative that the United States continue to take a      principled stand in Cambodia. To this end, we ask that the      U.S. Congress continue to suspend official assistance to the      current government--formed by a coup--until the current      crisis is resolved. More than anything, if Hun Sen were to      succeed in securing international legitimacy and the      resumption of aid, it would be nothing less than a reward for      his lawless and repressive ways. We ask that the U.S.      Congress and Administration condemn the use of violence in      the strongest of terms. Too many people have died in the      hands of reckless Cambodian leaders, like Hun Sen and Pol      Pot. Finally we urge you not to replace Ambassador Kenneth      Quinn after his term expires in Phnom Penh, and certainly not      with Kent Wiederman who we believe may be less than      supportive of the cause of democracy in Cambodia. The      position should be left vacant as a message to Hun Sen that      there are no rewards for corruption, manipulation of      elections, and violence. We know a precedent exist for such      action in neighboring Burma.       We thank you for your consideration of our views, and we      remain committed to bringing about peaceful, democratic      change in Cambodia.           Yours Sincerely,     Prince Norodom Ranariddh,       President, FUNCINPEC.     Sam Rainsy,       President, The Sam Rainsy Party.                                  ____     Remarks by Sam Rainsy, President, Sam Rainsy Party, Cambodia--  Subcommittee on East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Senate Committee on                    Foreign Relations, October 2, 1998       Mr. Chairman, it is a distinct and unique pleasure for me      to appear before you today. I am honored to inform this      Subcommittee of the political situation in Cambodia following      the July parliamentary elections and to highlight the      important role the United States can play in bringing      democracy, the rule of law, and lasting peace to my country.       The last few months, weeks, and days have been among the      most difficult of my life, and it has been equally trying for      all Cambodians who support democracy. I know this      Subcommittee is familiar with the brutal crackdown of pro-     democracy demonstrators in Phnom Penh by forces of the      Cambodian People's Party (CPP). Buddhist monks and students      have been found tortured and murdered, and many continue to      be missing. I know you are familiar with the illegal and      unconstitutional travel ban that prevented me and all      opposition members from leaving Cambodia one week ago--a ban      that was personally instituted by Hun Sen. And I know that      you are aware of the CPP-biased election machinery that      denied opposition parties due process in the counting of      ballots and resolution of election complaints.       There is no one more disappointed and saddened by the total      failure of the July elections than myself. However, the      opposition in Cambodia warned from the very beginning that      democracy cannot be built on an undemocratic foundation that      lacks the rule of law. Throughout the electoral process--even      before we returned to Phnom Penh from exile in Bangkok--we      pointed out to the international community many serious flaws      in the political environment and in election preparations.      For example, our party structures and property had been      totally destroyed or looted during Hun Sen's July 1997 coup      d'etat, and our membership was traumatized. I could not agree      more with the characterization of the pre-election period as      ``fundamentally flawed.''       Mr. Chairman, we were reluctant participants in this      election and at one point even withdrew from the process. But      under heavy pressure, we accepted the assurances of the      international community that the elections would be      assessed fairly. We were wrong in accepting these      assurances, and today Cambodia is on the brink of      affirming the rule of man, not instituting the rule of      law. I know this to be true, as I spent ten days under the      protection of the United Nations in Phnom Penh because of      Hun Sen's pointed threats.       The United Nations and many other sponsors and observers of      the election did not effectively challenge the conditions      that made a fair election impossible. Throughout the      campaign, our activists were harassed, threatened, and killed      with complete impunity. While the United Nations has done a      commendable job in documenting the abuses of the Cambodian      government, not one human rights violator has been      prosecuted. And the killings and torture continue.       Other shortfalls in the elections included limited and      unequal access to state controlled media, an election      framework that was biased and that lacked transparency, a      recounting process that failed to conduct recounts, a      reluctance to reconcile all ballots, and an illegal change in      the method for seat allocation that gave the ruling party a      majority of seats with only 41 per cent of the official vote.       The burden of proof that this election was legitimate no      longer lies with the opposition--as some asserted immediately      after the polls closed--it is now the responsibility of Hun      Sen and the CPP.       The Cambodian people are confused, frustrated and angry.      They don't understand why many in the international community      are supporting the announced election results and pressuring      the opposition to join a coalition. Why isn't the Cambodian      government pressured into obeying Cambodian laws and its      Constitution?       If the opposition is forced into a coalition without being      able to resolve underlying problems, Cambodia will continue      to be under the complete control of Hun Sen. History has      shown that he will do whatever it takes to stay in power.      Over the past five years, under Hun Sen's leadership,      Cambodia has had unrestrained corruption, human rights      violations, and environmental destruction. He kept his      political opposition in check while building up his own      political and military machine, in part, by making deals with      some of the worst Khmer Rouge leaders and incorporating them      into the government. Anyone who thought Hun Sen was the      solution to Cambodia's problems or that he offered      ``stability'' should know better by now.       I understand all of Cambodia's problem cannot be solved at      once, and the opposition has demonstrated its willingness to      compromise. However, there are some issues where compromise      is impossible, such as the resolution of election related      disputes before a coalition government is formed and the      development of an independent judiciary that enforces and      protects the rights of all citizens, not only members of the      CPP.       Without proper and full resolution of election complaints,      the elections will have no credibility among the Cambodian      people. For better or for worse, the Cambodian people look to      the United States as the standard-bearer of democracy and the      conscience of the world. It was the United States that took      Hun Sen's coup seriously last year and the U.S. Congress that      acted so swiftly to restrict official foreign assistance to      Cambodia. The reaction of Congress was one of the few times      that Hun Sen has received a message from the international      community other than one of accommodation.       Hun Sen expect that the world will legitimize his rule      through these elections and cloak his dictatorial behavior in      the mantle democracy. Cambodian democrats are asking the      United States to be the standard-bearer again while there is      still a chance to get Cambodia back on the road to democracy.      We call upon the United States to: make it clear that it will      refuse to recognize any Cambodian government that is formed      prior to the resolution of election-related complaints filed      by opposition parties, or any government formed under duress;      strongly condemn the Cambodian government for its human      rights abuses and ongoing intimidation of opposition      activists; continue to withhold official aid, as it is      currently doing, and to oppose IMF and other multilateral      lending. Let me make clear that humanitarian and demining      assistance should continue; vote to keep Cambodia's UN seat      vacant and to oppose other international recognition; leave      the U.S. ambassador's post vacant after the departure of      Ambassador Kenneth Quinn until a credible government is      formed and to ensure that next U.S. ambassador is someone      with strong credentials as a supporter of democrats;      intensify efforts to deter the Cambodian government's role      in illegal logging, drug-trafficking, money-laundering and      acts of terrorism such as the grenade attack on march 30,      1997 that killed at least 16 people; and, make public the      Federal Bureau of Investigation's report into the March      1997 grenade attack.       Mr. Chairman, as a target of assassination in 1997 and      again just a few weeks ago outside of the Ministry of      Interior, I know how dangerous Cambodian politics can be. The      United States has an opportunity to make an historic      contribution to Cambodia's future by demonstrating its      leadership and supporting democracy and human rights. Today,      I look to you for hope and assistance.       Thank you for the opportunity to testify.  (At the request of Mr. Daschle, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)                          ____________________
