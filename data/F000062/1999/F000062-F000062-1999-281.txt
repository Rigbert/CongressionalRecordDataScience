 President, today I am introducing a bill to provide funds to build new schools. It is the Excellence in Education Act of 1999.  The purpose of this bill is to (1) reduce the size of schools and (2) reduce the size of classes. The bill would create a 50-50 matching grant program to build new schools to meet the following size requirements:  School size requirement:  for kindergarten through 5th grade, not more than 500 students;  for grades 6 through 8, not more than 750 students; and  for grades 9 through 12, not more than 1,500 students.  Class size requirement:  for kindergarten through grade 6, not more than 20 students per teacher;  for grades 7 through 12, not more than 28 students per teacher.  The bill authorizes $5 billion each year for the next five years for the U.S. Department of Education to award grants to local school districts. School districts would have to match federal funds with an equal amount. In addition to making the above reductions, school districts would be required to terminate social promotion, provide remedial education and require that students be subject to state achievement standards in the core academic curriculum.  Why do we need this bill?  First, many of our schools are just too big, especially in urban areas. The ``shopping mall'' high school is all too common. ``It's not unusual to find high schools of 2,000, 3,000, or even 4,000 students and junior high schools of 1,500 or more, especially in urban school systems,'' writes Thomas Toch in the Washington Post. In these monstrous schools, the principal is just a disembodied voice over the public address system.  Equally serious is the fact that our classes are too big. Even though we have begun to reduce class sizes in my state, California still has some of the largest class sizes in the U.S. The National Center for Education Statistics says California's classrooms have the highest pupil-teacher ratios in the nation.  This bill will provide a new funding source for school districts or states to match to build new schools and reduce both school size and class size. There is no good estimate of how many schools would be needed to reduce schools and classes to the levels specified in the amendment, but we all know that there are many large schools and large classes in public education today.  The U.S. Department of Education estimates that we need to build 6,000 new schools just to meet enrollment growth projections. This estimate does not take into account the need to cut class and school sizes. The needs are no doubt huge.  My state that has some of the largest schools in the country. Our students are crammed into every available space, even in cafeterias and libraries. Today, 20 percent of our students are in portable classrooms. There were 63,000 relocatable classrooms in use in 1998. Here are some examples:  High Schools:  Roosevelt High School (Los Angeles), 4,902;  Huntington Park High School, 4,275;  Roosevelt High School, Fresno, 3,692;  Berkeley High School, Berkeley, 3,025; and  Mt. Carmel High School, San Diego, 3,279.  Intermediate Schools:  Clark Intermediate School, Clovis, 2,744 students;  Gianni Middle School, San Francisco, 1,336; and  O'Farrell Middle School, San Diego, 1,441.  Elementary Schools:  Rosa Parks Elementary School, San Diego, 1,423;  Winchell Elementary School Fresno, 1,392;  Zamorano Elementary School, San Diego, 1,424; and  Kerman/Floyd Elementary School, Fresno, 1,000.  California also has some of the largest classes sizes in the nation. In 1996-1997, California had the second highest teacher-pupil ratio in the nation, at 22.8 students per teacher. Fortunately since 1996, the state has significantly cut class sizes in grades K-3, but 15 percent or 300,000 of our K-3 students have not benefitted from this reform. And students above grade 3 have not been touched.  Here are some examples of classes in my state:  Fourth grade, statewide, 29 students; sixth grade, statewide, 29.5 students.  National City Middle School San Diego, English and math, 34 to 36 students.  Berryessa School District in San Jose--fourth grade, 32 students; eighth grade, 31 students.  Long Beach and El Cajon School Districts, tenth grade English, 35 students.  Santa Rosa School District--fourth grade, 32 students.  San Diego City Schools, tenth grade biology, 38 students.  Hoover Elementary and Knox Elementary in E. San Diego Elementary, grades 5 and 6, 31 to 33 students.  Hoover High School 10th grade Algebra, 39 students.  To add to the problem, California will have a school enrollment rate between 1997 and 2007 of 15.7 percent, triple the national rate of 4.1 percent. We will have the largest enrollment increase of all states during the next ten years. By 2007, our enrollment will have increased by 35.3 percent. To put it another way, California needs to build seven new classrooms a day at 25 students per class just to keep up with the surge in student enrollment. The California Department of Education says that we need to add about 327 schools over the next three years, just to keep pace with the projected growth.  The cost of building a high school in California is almost twice the national cost. The U.S. average is $15 million; in California, it is $27 million. In California, our costs are higher than other states in part because our schools must be built to withstand earthquakes, floods, El Nino and a myriad of other natural disasters. California's state earthquake building standards add 3 to 4 percent to construction costs. Here's what it costs to build a schools in California: an elementary school (K-6), $5.2 million; a middle school (7-8), $12.0 million; a high school (9-12), $27.0 million.  Studies show that student achievement improves when school and class sizes are reduced.  The American Education Research Association says that the ideal high school size is between 600 and 900 students. Study after study shows that small schools have more learning, fewer discipline problems, lower dropout rates, higher levels of student participating, higher graduation rates (The School Administrator, October 1997). The nation's school administrators are calling for more personalized schools.  California's education reforms relied on a Tennessee study called Project STAR, in which 6,500 kindergartners were put in 330 classes of different sizes. The students stayed in small classes for four years and then returned to larger ones in the fourth grade. The test scores and behavior of students in the small classes were better than those of children in the larger classes. A similar 1997 study by Rand found that smaller classes benefit students from low-income families the most.  Take the example of Sandy Sutton, a teacher in Los Angeles's Hancock Park Elementary School. She used to have 32 students in her second grade class. In the fall of 1997, she had 20. She says she can spend more time on individualized reading instruction with each student. She can now more readily draw out shy children and more easily identify slow readers early in the school year.  The November 25, 1997, Sacramento Bee reported that when teachers in the San Juan Unified School Districts started spending more time with students, test scores rose and discipline problems and suspensions dropped. A San Juan teacher, Ralphene Lee, said, ``This is the most wonderful thing that has happened in education in my lifetime.''  A San Diego initiative to bring down class sizes found that smaller classes mean better classroom management; more individual instruction; more contact with parents; more time for team teaching; more diverse instructional methods; and a higher morale.  Teachers say that students in smaller classes pay better attention, ask more questions and have fewer discipline problems. Smaller schools and smaller classes make a difference, it is clear.  My state needs a total of $34 billion to build schools from 1998 to 2008. Of this, $26 billion is needed to modernize and repair existing schools and $8 billion is needed to build schools to meet enrollment growth. In November 1998, California voters approved state bonds providing $6.5 billion for school construction.  California needs to build 7 new classrooms a day at 25 students per class between now and 2001 just to keep up with the growth in student population. By 2007, California will need 22,000 new classrooms. California needs to add about 327 schools over the next three years just to keep pace with the projected growth.  Other bills in the Congress that I am supporting provide tax incentives for holders of school bonds to modernize old schools and we have many old schools. One third of the nation's 110,000 schools were built before World War II and only about one of 10 schools was built since 1980. More than one-third of the nation's existing schools are currently over 50 or more years old and need to be repaired or replaced. The General Accounting Office has said that nationally we need over $112 billion for construction and repairs to bring schools up to date.  Big schools and big classes place a heavy burden on teachers and students. They can be a stressful learning environment.  The American public supports increased federal funding for school construction. The Rebuild American Coalition last month announced that 82 percent of Americans favor federal spending for school construction, up from 74 percent in a 1998 National Education Association poll.  Every parent knows the importance of a small class where the teacher can give individualized attention to a student. Every parent knows the importance of the sense of a school community that can come with a small school.  I hope my colleagues will join me today in passing this important education reform.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and a summary be printed in the Record.
