  I appreciate what the Senator from Wisconsin is trying to do. We have joined together on a bill dealing with one aspect of this problem and that happens to be a bill which deals with arbitration in the automobile industry. As the lead Member of the Senate on alternative dispute resolution issues, I certainly do not want alternative dispute resolution to be used in unfair ways. So following up on the request of the Senator from Wisconsin that if we could make some sort of arrangement for his not offering his amendment at this time--and he has withdrawn it--I have scheduled a hearing in my judiciary subcommittee on our bill. I hope to air some of these other problems the Senator has raised.  I do have a great deal of sympathy for what the Senator from Wisconsin is attempting, but I think more groundwork needs to be done so we all have a better understanding of these issues before moving ahead at this time.  The bottom line, I say to the Senator from Wisconsin--and I hope he will answer yes or no--is that I wish to make sure he is working with us between now and our hearing so every commitment I have made in regard to his offering or not offering his arbitration amendment to this bill at this time is to his satisfaction.
