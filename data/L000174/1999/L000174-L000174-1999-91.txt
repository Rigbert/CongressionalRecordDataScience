 Mr. President, I compliment the distinguished Senator from Alabama for his comments and others who have spoken on this. He and I belong to that great fraternity which I have always considered the best fraternity--former prosecutors. I have sometimes said the best job I ever had was as a prosecutor, although I must admit, when I told the U.S. attorney of our State, Charles Tetzlaff, who is a superb U.S. attorney, I often wanted to trade with him, he said: ``Yeah, sure you do.'' In my view, it is one of the best positions one can have in government, also one that requires the most concern for the public.  I wear both hats of a Senator and also as a former prosecutor in opposing this amendment. I am not opposing the motivation of Senators who want to stop what has become a scourge of drug use in our country. When I think of the young people in this country whose lives are damaged by drugs, when I think of families who are damaged, when I think of the people who are victims of crime from those seeking money to buy drugs, I fully appreciate what a scourge it is.  Right on Capitol Hill, one of the most beautiful parts of our Nation, we have seen people suffer burglaries, muggings, thefts, and assaults by people trying to get money for drugs. It is a problem our country, probably more than any other country, has to face because we are the wealthiest nation on Earth and we, as a nation, fuel the drug trade because of all the money we put into it.  It is ironic, in a way, that we send in troops and helicopters and chemicals to countries to stem the drug production and trade from their country, when the answer, of course, is within our borders. If we worked harder stopping the demand for drugs in the United States, that drug traffic would dry up. If you could turn off the drug production in a country in Central America and could somehow hermetically seal that country, as long as there are tens of billions, even hundreds of billions, of dollars willingly spent by U.S. citizens for drugs, drug production will just take place somewhere else. It is the ultimate example of supply and demand. The supply is always going to be there. We do far too little to stop the demand.  We are not going to stop the demand by this amendment because it takes the wrong approach to combating illegal drug use in this country. The amendment would dramatically increase mandatory minimum penalties for cocaine trafficking. It would throw the principle of federalism out the window by telling local schools and school districts how they must deal with illegal drug use by students. Frankly, how my State of Vermont may want to deal with this may be far different than the State of Montana, the State of Alabama, or any other State. I have to think we know our people the best within our States and they are capable of making those decisions.  The amendment attempts to solve the unfair discrepancy between sentences for powder and crack cocaine. There is an unfair discrepancy, and I do not think people are that far off when they say that discrepancy may have racist overtones. We should all agree the discrepancy is unfair. In solving that discrepancy between powder and crack cocaine, this amendment is going about it in precisely the wrong way by increasing the use of mandatory minimums for those who manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess with intent to distribute powder cocaine.  Under the current law--and this is how we get into the improper and unfair discrepancy--the quantity threshold to trigger mandatory minimum penalties for crack offenders is 100 times more severe than for powder cocaine offenders. Let me put this in a different way.  If you have an offender charged with a 5-gram-crack-cocaine offense, they would be subject to the same 5-year minimum sentence that would apply to somebody who was caught with 500 grams of powder cocaine. These harsher crack sentences have resulted in a disparate impact on the African American community. African Americans constitute 12 percent of the American population but account for 40 percent of our prison population. Anybody looking at those numbers know something has gone astray. Eighty-eight percent of those convicted of crack offenses are black and, of course, crack offenses always carry the higher penalties. In 1993, the number of African American men under the control of the criminal justice system was greater than the number of African American men enrolled in college. Something has gone dramatically astray in our country.  While it is true that Federal courts have held the disparate impact caused by the crack and powder cocaine mandatory sentencing thresholds does not violate constitutional protections, the fact existing laws fall within the judicially determined boundaries of constitutional acceptability does not absolve Congress of its ongoing responsibility to implement the most just and effective ways to combat drugs in America.  Just because an act of Congress may be constitutionally acceptable does not mean it makes sense. On national highways we could probably constitutionally set a $500 fine for somebody driving 5 miles an hour over the speed limit. It would probably be upheld constitutionally, but do we have any constituents who would say it made sense? Of course not.  I have repeatedly stated my objections to the shortsighted use of mandatory minimums in the battle against illegal drugs because of the way they are applied. My objections are all the more grave when an attempt is made to increase the use of mandatory minimums through provisions placed in the middle of--what?--an amendment to a bankruptcy bill offered as the adjournment bells are almost ringing at the end of the session.  We can debate whether mandatory minimums are an appropriate tool in our critically important national fight against illegal drugs. I believe they have not made that much difference. Others would believe otherwise. In my view, simply imposing or increasing mandatory minimums undercuts and even subverts the more considered process Congress set up with the Sentencing Commission.  The Federal sentencing guidelines already provide a comprehensive mechanism to mete out fair sentences. They allow judges the discretion they need to give appropriate weight to individual circumstances. In other words, sentencing guidelines allow judges to do their jobs.  The Sentencing Commission goes through an extensive and thoughtful process to set sentence levels. For example, pursuant to our 1996 anti-methamphetamine law, the Sentencing Commission increased meth penalties after very careful analysis of sentencing data, especially recent sentencing data. They studied the offenses. They had information from the Drug Enforcement Agency on trafficking levels, dosage unit size, price, and drug quantity. They took all those matters into consideration. Simply increasing arbitrarily, in the middle of a bankruptcy bill, mandatory minimums goes too far in taking sentencing discretion away from judges.  Would it not make far more sense if we set this amendment aside, and at the Judiciary Committee, which certainly has jurisdiction over this issue, have real hearings and have people discuss whether it is a good idea or bad idea? Bring in drug enforcement people, bring in local authorities, bring in everybody else involved, and have a real hearing. If we simply do it because it sounds good at the moment, I think we make a mistake.  That is why I have repeatedly expressed my concerns about creating new mandatory minimum penalties, including as recently as in August, when the methamphetamine bill that has contributed many of this bill's provisions was considered by the Judiciary Committee.  The meth bill, which was reported by the Judiciary Committee, is contained in this amendment to the bankruptcy bill. It contains a provision directing the Sentencing Commission to amend the guidelines to make penalties for amphetamine offenses comparable to the offense levels for methamphetamine.  Congress recently increased mandatory minimum sentences for methamphetamine. Stiff mandatory minimum penalties were slipped into last year's omnibus appropriations bill. As a result, now methamphetamine penalties are the same as crack penalties. This amendment in the bankruptcy bill would now order the Sentencing Commission to increase penalties for amphetamine crimes by a number of base offense levels so the same penalties apply to both meth and amphetamine offenses.  So what do we get for a result? Even without the question of mandatory minimums, you are going to have dramatic increases in the penalties for amphetamine offenses.  We ought to first pass a resolution saying, we are all against illegal drug use. We live in neighborhoods. We are parents or grandparents. We walk the streets of America. We have seen the dangers of illegal drug use--all Senators, Republican and Democrat. We are all against it. That should be a given. But do we need to stand up here, the 100 of us who are suppose to represent a quarter of a billion Americans, and prove over and over and over again that we are against illegal drug usage by imposing harsher and harsher penalties, without any regard to whether spending more taxpayer money on more prisons and more prison guards is really the most cost-effective way to address this problem?  In many parts of this country we spend far more money building new prisons than we do building new schools. We spend far more money increasing the number of prison guards and on their pensions and their pay, and everything else that goes for them, than we do in hiring new science teachers or math teachers or language teachers. We ought to ask ourselves: Does this picture make that much sense?  I agree with the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, that we have put a misplaced emphasis on long mandatory minimum penalties as the primary tool we use to fight illegal drug trafficking. When I was a prosecutor, I must admit, there were many times I asked for a stiff penalty, when the case called for it. But I also knew enough to know that stiffer penalties by themselves are not the whole answer. There are a whole lot of other things involved. For one thing, a lot of people committing a crime do not get too concerned about the penalty if they think they are not going to get caught.  So the example I have used before is, you have two warehouses side by side. One has all kinds of alarm systems and security personnel. The other has a rusted old padlock, no lights, and nobody around it. They both are filled with, say, television sets. The penalties for breaking in and stealing those TV sets are the same, whether you break into the warehouse that has its security system, the lights, and the guards, or if you break into the one with the rusty old padlock with no guards and no lights. It does not take a criminologist to know which one is going to get broken into. Why would somebody break into one where they might get caught when they can go into the one where they assume they will not get caught? The penalties are the same, so the penalty is not the deterrent.  We have to make drug dealers feel vulnerable and make drug dealing a risky business. We do this by makingsure they are caught and prosecuted, not simply piling on lengthier prison terms with increased mandatory minimum penalties for the few on the fringes who do get caught.  These mandatory minimums also carry with them significant economic and social costs. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the annual cost of housing a Federal inmate ranges from $16,745 per year for minimum security inmates to $23,286 per year for inmates in high-security facilities.  Mr. President, you and I and every taxpayer is paying for that. It is critical that we take steps that will effectively deter crime, but we should not ignore the costs of this one-size-fits-all approach to mandatory minimums.  We also cannot ignore the policy implications of the boom in our prison population. Let me just tell you about this. In 1970--5 years before I came to the Senate--the total population in the Federal prison system was 20,868 prisoners, of whom 16.3 percent were drug offenders.  By 1997, the federal prison population had grown to almost 91,000 sentenced prisoners, approximately 60 percent of whom were sentenced for drug offenses. The cost of supporting this expanded federal criminal justice system is staggering. The portion of federal drug control spending attributable to the criminal justice system grew from $415 million in 1981 to over $8.5 billion in 1999. Imprudently lowering the cocaine sentencing threshold without considering the fiscal consequences would further encumber our already overworked system. We ignore at our peril the findings of RAND's comprehensive 1997 report on mandatory minimum drug sentences: ``Mandatory minimums are not justifiable on the basis of cost-effectiveness at reducing cocaine consumption, cocaine expenditures, or drug-related crime.''  Reducing the disparity between sentences for powder and crack cocaine in the manner proposed in this amendment is simply wrongheaded. Sentencing parity at any cost is not the smartest way to wage our war on drugs. Drastically increasing the mandatory minimum penalties for powder cocaine in this hasty, end-of-session amendment will be costly to taxpayers far into the future, as we will have to build numerous new prisons to house non-violent drug offenders who are subject to lengthy federal prison terms under this amendment. Indeed, when a bill seeking to make identical changes to our powder cocaine laws was introduced in the last Congress, I wrote to the Attorney General requesting a prison impact assessment. I received a letter from the Justice Department on June 1, 1998, estimating that the total cost of this legislation over 30 years would be over $10.6 billion, including construction of nine new medium security federal prisons to house 11,000 more prison beds.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                     Washington, DC, June 1, 1998.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S.          Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: This is in response to the letter you      and two colleagues wrote to the Attorney General requesting a      prison impact assessment for S. 2033, which would alter      federal sentences for crack cocaine and powder cocaine      offenders. I hope the following information is helpful to      you.       S. 2033 would mandate a 5-year mandatory minimum sentence      for 50 grams of powder cocaine, instead of the current 500-     gram threshold. In addition, the proposal would impose a 10-     year mandatory minimum sentence for 500 grams of powder      cocaine, instead of the current 5 kilogram threshold. The 5-      and 10-year mandatory minimum thresholds for crack cocaine      would remain at 5 and 50 grams, respectively.       Table 1 estimates the impact of the proposed change on      prison costs and population for the 30 years following      enactment. Using its 1996 data set, the U.S. Sentencing      Commission produced estimates of the number of individuals      who would be incarcerated under this scenario. These      estimates, which were based on a review of all defendants      sentenced for drug trafficking and related offenses (U.S.S.C.      2D1.1) involving a single drug type, were then used by the      Bureau of Prisons to project prison costs. While our      estimates assume a constant rate of prosecutions for the next      30 years, it is important to understand that changes in      sentencing during that time period could alter prosecution      practices, thus affecting the cost and population estimates      we provide here. Additional cost analysis assumptions are      contained in Enclosure A.       We estimate that, in the fifth year after enactment, S.      2033 would require us to provide over 5,500 additional prison      beds than currently projected in order to handle those      inmates who would be spending more time in prison. The      cumulative additional cost over five years would be almost      $794 million, including construction of seven new medium      security federal prisons. In the thirtieth year after      enactment, we would need approximately 11,000 additional      beds. The total cumulative cost over thirty years would be      over $10.6 billion, including construction of a total of nine      new medium security federal prisons.       Please do not hesitate to contact our office if you have      additional questions concerning this or any other issue. We      have sent similar letters to Senators Biden and Kennedy.           Sincerely,                                                 L. Anthony Sutin,                                Acting Assistant Attorney General.       Enclosures.                 Enclosure A: Cost Analysis Assumptions       For crack cocaine and powder cocaine sentencing scenarios,      the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) is assuming that these inmates      will be housed in medium security facilities. BOP's projected      construction and operating costs presented in this prison      impact assessment are consistent with costs required by      medium security facilities, which are designed for a capacity      of 1,152 prisoners.       If the estimated impact of enacted legislation will result      in fewer than 1,152 additional prisoners, the prisoners will      be added to existing facilities and be charged at marginal      costs. If the estimated impact of enacted legislation will      meet or exceed 1,152 additional prisoners, construction of a      new facility will be necessary. While construction is      underway, space will be found in existing facilities. Once      the prisoners are transferred to the newly built facility,      those prisoners are charged at full per capita cost to meet      the full expense of operating an additional facility.       The increase in costs over time due to inflation is assumed      to be approximately 3.1% per year.
