President, I would like to ask the Senator from Vermont about three specific reports that have come out in the news recently about Halliburton and about their practices with sole-source contracts in Iraq, where they literally are not competing with any other company for these contracts, and they are cost-plus contracts.  I would like to ask the Senator from Vermont if the amendment which he is proposing might apply with a criminal penalty in these cases. It was reported last week that Halliburton and its subsidiaries were literally driving empty trucks back and forth on the highway, billing the Federal Government for each trip, when in fact they were not even transporting any supplies or equipment for our troops.  It was reported this morning that this same Halliburton operation, if they had a flat tire on a truck, they would abandon the $85,000 truck by the side of the road or torch the truck rather than try to get it repaired because each and every truck was just another cost-plus item on a Federal contract.  And then it was further disclosed they were incorrectly billing the Federal Government, charging for 240,000 cases of soda pop--if you can imagine--but they were delivering 240,000 cans of soda pop. So it was a dramatic overstatement of what they were supposed to be providing for the troops.  I ask the Senator from Vermont, when you consider the fact that we have 138,000 of our finest men and women risking their lives literally in Iraq, how can we possibly turn our backs on this type of outrageous profiteering that has been alleged? Why would it not be a crime? And why would this Senate even hesitate from establishing a criminal penalty when we have a situation that is costing the taxpayers over $1 billion a week to sustain our war effort in Iraq?
