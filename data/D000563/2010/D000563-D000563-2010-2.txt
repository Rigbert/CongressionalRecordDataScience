President, I am sorry they are not on the floor at this moment, but I rise to give special recognition to two Senate pages who have stayed here while all the others have gone home for Christmas. These two pages have been working hard today to keep up with the Senate's very busy schedule:  Rachel Bailey, 16 years old, from Glendale, MD. Mom and dad are Susan and Karl. She is working late today as a Senate page. We thank Rachel so much.  Jarrod Nagurka, 16 years old, from Arlington, VA. His mom and dad are Pamela and Stuart.  Even though they aren't on the floor and they are running around here busy, they can look in the Congressional Record and realize that Senators of both political parties appreciate their dedication to this institution during this holiday season.                          ____________________
