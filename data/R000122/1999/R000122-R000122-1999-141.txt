They are completely without risk. All of their patients, all of the people they directly insure, where they directly assume the risk, are exempt from coverage by this legislation.  The Democratic bill covers all of those who are private-insured HMOs throughout the United States. If the logic is these protections are good enough and necessary enough for those in employer-sponsored self-insured plans, why aren't they good enough, important enough, necessary enough, for those who are direct insurers of HMOs?  The answer, frankly, is that the legislation has been designed to protect the insurance companies from any additional risk. It is fine if we put it on employers; it is fine if they have to pay extra or if they have to do these things.  However, the only consistent pattern if you look at the coverage, this is not a patients' protection bill; this is an insurance industry protection bill.  I yield to the Senator for her comments.
