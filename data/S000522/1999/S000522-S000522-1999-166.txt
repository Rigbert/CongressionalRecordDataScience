Mr. Chairman, the language in the amendment says ``Any existing or future plan.'' I think it wise and provided the future to anticipate.  I know of no plan at the moment to carried a plan may spent nor have I surveyed every plan but that does not mean it has not happened. That does not mean that sitting in the boardrooms around the nation men and women who offer specific plans haven't grappled with this and said, we have to provide this no matter what conditions it violates.  We have to provide maximum freedom in regard to a moral conviction for people who manifest opposition and dissent, and to opt out. And again, let me also point out that I did say with regard to the future plan. There could be plans that would love to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefit Plan program but conclude wait a minute, there is a mandate there that violates our moral convictions.  And that is why I would hope and believe this should be a totally noncontroversial amendment, unless its opponents have designs on using the coercive power of the state to force compliance not withstanding moral convictions.
