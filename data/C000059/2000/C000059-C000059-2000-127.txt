Speaker, today I commemorate the 50th Anniversary of the Korean War. This Saturday, June 25th, the Winchester Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 4379 and the 23rd VFW District will celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Korean War to ``Honor America's Heroes.''  On June 30th, 1950, President Truman ordered United States ground forces into South Korea and a naval blockade of the Korean coast. Only a few days earlier, North Korean forces had crossed the 38th parallel invading South Korea and capturing the South Korean capital of Seoul.  One of the war's most dramatic battles, Chosin, saw 17 Medals of Honor and 70 Navy Crosses awarded, more than any single U.S. action. The Marines and other Allied troops saw nearly 2,400 of their own killed and 10,000 wounded or frostbitten. And yet, this is often called the ``forgotten war'' by our veterans, who found themselves returning to an indifferent home front keeping their experiences to themselves.  Well, I say ``NO MORE,'' Mr. Speaker! And ask that my home district of Riverside County, California and the whole nation open their minds and hearts to the stories of our Korean War veterans--that they join in the celebration. The sacrifice that service men and women have selflessly accepted over the centuries deserve at least that much. I offer my most heartfelt appreciation to the veterans of VFW Post 4379 and the 23rd VFW District.                          ____________________
