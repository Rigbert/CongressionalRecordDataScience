 President, the House of Representatives is in the [[Page S3692]] midst of Legal Reform Week and on its way to passing three bills which, if enacted, would dramatically overhaul and improve our civil justice system. So, Mr. President, the first thing I would like to do is commend the House for its determination and its commitment to change the legal system.  With the exception of the general aviation bill last year, no court reform legislation of any sort has ever gotten anywhere in the Congress.  So the House this week is about to do something truly historic. Over in the House and over here I hope we now realize the civil justice system is broken.  Injured parties wait too many years to have their cases heard. While a few win big damage awards, many people suffering personal injuries do not get adequately compensated for those injuries. We know that for every dollar spent in America in these tort cases only 43 cents makes it to the injured party and 57 cents is taken up by the courts and the lawyers; 57 cents out of every dollar for transaction costs. That is not civil justice. More than half the money goes to transaction costs--lawyers, and expert witness fees, as well as administration of the court system.  Not only do victims fare poorly in the current legal system, but scarce economic resources are drained from more productive uses. Municipalities and nonprofit organizations must absorb spiralling insurance costs, threatening the important public services they provide. No small businessman can afford to be without a lawyer because of the liability maze. And, ultimately, the burden falls on the American people--as taxpayers and consumers, paying more for Government services and higher costs at the checkout counter.  In fact, enactment of legal reform would give the American people a much deserved tax break--a break from the litigation tax that is strangling our economy. This tax break, unlike all others, will not even require a budgetary offset. And, even more significantly, it will not impact the Social Security trust fund.  Perhaps if we add some specific language protecting Social Security to these bills, we will pick up a few Democrat votes. And, maybe then the President could support legal reform. Because as we learned from Attorney General Reno this week, the administration is strongly opposed to the legal reform effort. Interestingly, the administration's unhappiness with these initiatives focuses on federalism--State's rights. I am quite amazed by this approach; after all this administration has not met a problem that could not be solved without a new or expanded Federal program. We only need to remind ourselves of the health care debacle. It is only on this issue--legal reform--that they have suddenly found the 10th amendment.  The fact is, the problem is a national one, and Congress has ample power to act, consistent with the commerce clause of the Constitution. Former Judge Robert Bork has eloquently disposed of the federalism issue in a letter he recently wrote to the Speaker. I ask that Judge Bork's letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Washington, DC,                                                February 27, 1995.     Hon. Newt Gingrich,     Office of the Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Speaker: I understand that several provisions      either already in H.R. 956, the Contract With America's legal      reform provision, or proposed to be included in it, have been      criticized as unwarranted intrusions on the authority of the      States.       The provisions include virtually all the reform measures      that have been discussed over the previous several      Congresses, including limits on punitive or non-economic      damages and joint and several liability (whether applied to      product liability suits or broader categories of cases);      defenses relating to compliance with applicable federal      regulations; regulation of contingency fees and other aspects      of attorney conduct; and various statute of limitations      reforms.       There can be little question that these reforms are well      within the scope of Congress' authority under the Commerce      Clause of the Constitution as it has been interpreted for      many years. Beginning in the 1930s, the courts have read this      Clause as a comprehensive grant of authority to Congress to      regulate virtually any type of activity affecting the      national economy. The measures under discussion indisputably      fall within this broad category of regulation.       As you know, I have long believed, like many scholars and      jurists (and many Members of Congress), that these broad      interpretations of the Commerce Clause are questionable, and      arguably out of keeping with the scheme of coordinate      sovereignty intended by the Framers of the Constitution.      Rather than simply resting on the federalism case law,      therefore, I believe those measures are justifiable and      necessary to protect the balance between State and Federal      authority contemplated by the Framers. They could not have      foreseen the spectacular growth, complexity, and unity of      today's economy. It cannot be said with any certainty that      they would not have passed a measure like H.R. 956 in today's      circumstances.       The problems addressed by H.R. 956 are national problems.      That is true not only because interstate commerce is      affected, and not only because products and services are made      more expensive as insurance costs rise, but also because the      plaintiffs' tort bar chooses to sue in jurisdictions where      awards of compensatory and punitive damages are highest. As a      consequence, a state like California or Texas can impose its      views of appropriate product design and the penalties for      falling short on manufacturers and distributors across the      nation. This is a perversion of federalism. Instead of      national standards being set by the national legislature,      national standards are set by the courts and juries of      particular states.       No problem more preoccupied the Constitutional Convention      than the necessity of protecting interstate commerce from      self-interested exploitation by the States. Madison observed      in Federalist No. 42 that no defect in the Articles of      Confederation was clearer than their inability to protect      interstate commerce. And in Federalist No. 11, Hamilton made      clear that one of the key purposes of the new Constitution      was to prevent interstate commerce from being ``fettered,      interrupted and narrowed'' by parochial state regulation.       The civil justice reforms under discussion are all designed      to vindicate this central constitutional purpose. It can no      longer be disputed that abusive litigation is having a      profoundly adverse impact on interstate commerce. Indeed, a      growing body of evidence suggests that the very purpose of      much of this litigation is to discriminate against interstate      commerce on behalf of local interests. Although      discrimination of this type was anticipated by the Framers,      the misuse of litigation to achieve this effect is a      relatively recent development. It is not surprising,      therefore, that Congress has not previously found it      necessary to regulate in this area.       It is thus neither inconsistent nor hypocritical for      Congress simultaneously to protect interstate commerce from      parochial discrimination and to protect States and localities      from unwarranted federal interference. Both steps are      essential to maintain the constitutional balance established      by the Framers. Clearly, over the last fifty years the      overwhelming trend has been towards the unwarranted expansion      of Federal authority at the expense both of the States and of      individual liberties, and Congress can and should reverse      that trend. But this fact should not blind us to the      continuing necessity of protecting interstate commerce from      parochial, discriminatory regulation by states and      localities. Federal intervention for this purpose is not      merely constitutionally permissible, it is important to      vindicate the Framers' constitutional design.           Sincerely,                                                   Robert H. Bork.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, there is only one objection to reforming the legal system. And it is the objection of the trial bar. They may be getting beat in the House, but they have not really begun to fight. We will see them use their muscle in the Senate. They will throw everything they have at us. They will wrap themselves in the tragic stories of real people who have suffered injuries. And they will let Ralph Nader and his network of organizations which they--the trial lawyers--fund argue on their behalf.  Contrary to their assertions, our reforms will not hurt victims. We want to help victims get fairly compensated without long, drawn-out litigation. We want to encourage those responsible for injuries to settle with injured parties early. And, the House bill moves in the right direction.  But as the debate shifts to the Senate, I want to encourage my colleagues to look seriously at the McConnell-Abraham bill, S. 300. Our bill reverses the incentive structure of the legal system. We set up rewards for early settlement. We want to put more money in the hands of victims. Our limitation on attorney contingent fees, as the Washington Post editorial page noted this week, will do just that.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post editorial be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the editorial was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        [[Page S3693]] [From the Washington Post, Mar. 8, 1995]                         Civil Justice Reforms       House Republicans are moving quickly to pass a series of      bills designed to reform the civil justice system. At least      three separate measures are expected to go to the Senate      before the weekend: a bill concerning the payment of      attorneys' fees, another making changes in securities fraud      law and a third setting new rules for the payment of punitive      damages and changes in product liability law.       Not every bill deserves support in its present form. But      there is no denying that the majority party has taken on a      problem that has been festering for some time. In their      favor, it should also be noted that some of the more      defective provisions of the ``Contract With America'' on this      subject have already been improved by compromise and will      probably be further fixed by the Senate.       The ``loser pays'' provisions of the first bill, which was      passed yesterday, would have required unsuccessful litigants      to pay winners' lawyers fees. It was always a bad idea.      Taking any case to court would have been extremely risky,      especially for those of modest means. As originally drafted,      the bill deserved to be defeated. But it has been modified so      that a loser must pay only if he has rejected a settlement      offer and after trial is awarded less than that offer.      Better, but still not perfect. The Senate should consider an      alternative offered by Sens. Mitch McConnell and Spencer      Abraham that would provide an incentive to litigants to      settle (immediate payment and hourly attorneys' fees) and a      penalty (reduced contingency fees in some cases) to attorneys      who don't. Both measures are designed to encourage early      settlement of disputes, but the McConnell-Abraham bill is      less Draconian.       Securities fraud provisions have also been softened to take      into account some of the suggestions offered by the chairman      of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Arthur Levitt. The      problem here--frivolous class-action lawsuits against a      company as soon as its stock drops--is a real one. As      reported by the House Commerce Committee, this bill drew      support from almost half the Democrats. But additional      changes may be warranted to protect stockholders in      meritorious cases.       The most hotly contested bill will be considered last. It      would limit punitive damages in all civil cases to three      times compensatory damages including pain and suffering, or      $250,000, whichever is more. It would also narrow the risk of      manufacturers' and sellers' liability in certain cases      involving defective products. Many of the latter provisions      make sense. Why not limit damages if the user has altered or      misused the product, or if the accident was caused by drug or      alcohol abuse? As for punitive damages, reform is overdue.      Guidelines and limits must be set, whether caps are $250,000      or $1 million or something higher. Juries are at sea and      sometimes come in with awards that are neither reasonable nor      justified.       Yes, the fear of high punitive damages may keep      manufacturers on their toes. But so would the fear of large      fines payable to the public treasury in case of egregious      misconduct. The system of providing unpredictable      multimillion-dollar awards to single plaintiffs in order to      deter corporate misconduct is unfair and inefficient. A shift      to fines would make sense. Barring that change, clear      guidelines on punitive damages are needed.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, our early offer provision, which builds upon a bill introduced by House Minority Leader Gephardt 10 years ago, will pay victims all of their losses, while taking many cases out of the court system altogether.  Our Nation is suffering from, as one editorial cartoonist called it, lawsuitenitus. It is a contagious disease and it is raging at epidemic proportions. The cure is a strong dose of legal reform. The only ones who will not like the medicine are those who thrive on the disease and profit from the spread of lawsuitenitus by earning huge fees.  Mr. President, we will have a number of bills here in the Senate to consider--the McConnell-Abraham Lawsuit Reform Act; the McConnell-Lieberman-Kassebaum Health Care Liability Reform and Quality Assurance Act; the Product Liability Fairness Act will be introduced next week, and there will be other initiatives. I look forward to comprehensive hearings on these bills, in the Judiciary, Commerce, and Labor Committees.  I am genuinely excited about the possibility of something happening on this issue. I remember being here 10 years ago as chairman of the Courts Subcommittee of Judiciary in 1985 and 1986, and we had numerous hearings on the subject of tort reform. But I knew we had no chance. We have had no chance for years. One of the positive results of last year's election, Mr. President, is that civil justice reform is now on the front burner and that genuinely excites this Senator who has had a great interest in this issue for many, many years.  And, most importantly I am hopeful we will enact reforms which give the American people a legal system that is fair, equitable, and accessible for the resolution of their disputes.  Mr. President, I thank you for your time.  I yield the floor.
