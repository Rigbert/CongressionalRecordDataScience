 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I do not quite understand that because the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Skelton) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Hunter) wrote the draft. It was done by late yesterday afternoon. It was sent to the legislative counsel. The entire draft was done, their agreed-to draft, both the Democrat ranking member, Republican chairman putting together a draft, coming together, and having done that, then it was vetted with the leadership. How much time does one need?  After they finish writing the draft, do they sit around and wait? For what? The two gentlemen that were charged with writing the resolution came together, wrote a resolution that they both put their name on and had agreed to; then it was given to the leadership staff and the leaders, and then that is when the leader wanted to eliminate two clauses and insert another clause. We agreed to eliminate the two clauses. We did not agree to insert the third clause, and that is when negotiation and bipartisanship, which, by the way, that only 50 voted against the resolution, broke down.  Evidently 365 Members thought it was a very well-crafted bipartisan effort.
