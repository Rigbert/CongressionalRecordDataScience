Our States are about the population of the District of Columbia. I expect either one of us could pick out a 2- or 3-day period last year or in this past calendar year in the District of Columbia where more murders occurred than our States put together for the year.  Without sounding like a poster child for the gun lobby or something else, I express one frustration, also watching what has happened in this recent tragic killing of a grandmother, when what appears to be, at least if the news accounts are accurate, people arguing over whose car bumped into whose car, and suddenly there is a gang on the street armed like the marines landing in Kosovo, and now with the nationwide spotlight on this crime, the police go into action and suddenly start confiscating guns.  I ask the Senator from North Dakota: Is it not his understanding, as it is mine, that the District of Columbia has virtually the toughest gun laws in the country? The carrying of these weapons or possession of them is a crime. Yet have you seen an awful lot of people go to prison for carrying these weapons, even though they are found with them all the time?
