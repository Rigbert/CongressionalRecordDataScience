 President, Senate colleagues, how does one sum up the extraordinary accomplishments of the longest serving Republican Senator in U.S. history? The majority leader has summarized Senator Stevens' career, but I think there is a way to measure it and to summarize it that is even shorter. I think it is safe to say, without any fear of contradiction, there is no Senator in the history of the United States who has ever done more for his State than Senator Ted Stevens. Alaska would not be what it is today----
