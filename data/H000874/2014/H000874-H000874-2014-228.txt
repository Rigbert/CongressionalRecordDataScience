Speaker, I rise to recognize an anniversary that all the Members of this House surely ought to celebrate. On July 18, 1914--one hundred years ago this Friday--the Congressional Research Service came into being. Ever since, it has provided Members on both sides of the aisle with important analysis, research assistance, and expertise on virtually every topic relating to our work on behalf of the American people.  The Congressional Research Service, known as the Legislative Research Service for its first fifty-six years, was the brainchild of Senator Robert LaFollette Sr. and Rep. John Nelson, both from Wisconsin. In the Progressive Era, reformers like Sen. LaFollette and Rep. Nelson sought to make governmentmore responsive by providing Members of Congress with greater access to the latest in scientific research and analytical tools. For a century, that is what the Congressional Research Service has done--and the men and women who work there have proven beyond a doubt the merit behind Sen. LaFollette and Rep. Nelson's proposal.  After World War II, as Congress's work expanded to meet the needs of a growing nation and economy and America's role as a military superpower, the Congressional Research Service adapted by hiring experts to provide briefings and answer Members' questions. So many Members and their staffs have come to rely on the timely responses from Congressional Research Service personnel on pending bills, legislative history, and issue tracking. Those who work at the Congressional Research Service continue to play an extraordinarily important role in Congress's work.  In my thirty-three years in this House, the Congressional Research Service has provided me with absolutely essential research on the legislative interests I have pursued. My work on the 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, the 2002 Help America Vote Act, the 2008 ADA Amendments Act, federal employee and civil service issues, and a wide range of constituent questions have all been aided immeasurably by Congressional Research Service reports and analysis.  As it begins its second century, the Congressional Research Service is adapting to new technologies to improve the way it keeps Members of Congress informed. Through social media, online research tools, and reports accessible by internet twenty-four hours a day, it continues to carry out its mission in a way its founders never could have imagined--but for which they would surely be proud.  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking the Congressional Research Service's diverse workforce of over 600 researchers, analysts, attorneys, support staff, and information professionals for their tireless work in service to our nation.                          ____________________
