 President, I introduce the Earthquake Insurance Availability Act of 1995.  The purpose of this legislation is to ensure that all 50 States in our Nation are treated equally by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation with respect to special insurance requirements, specifically earthquake insurance.  The legislation I am introducing today specifies that earthquake insurance requirements targeted to a specific state, by the Federal Home Loan Mortage Corporation, may be imposed only after the State insurance commissioner for the affected State certifies in writing that: First, reasonable insurance capacity exists in the State; and, second, compliance would not cause undue hardship for citizens of the State.  Mr. President, nobody in this Chamber is more aware of the threat of earthquakes than I am. I have seen the devastation they can cause, and I know of the terrible hardships, loss of life, and loss of property they leave behind.  Let me begin by saying that I believe everyone should have adequate insurance on their home to protect against hazards--including natural disasters.  The problem is, however, that adequate insurance is not always available. This is especially true, in California, with respect to earthquake insurance.  The truth is no region of our country is immune to natural disasters. In the last decade, different parts of our Nation have been hit by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, cyclones, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and firestorms, and I believe that it is essential that Congress enact natural disaster legislation as quickly as possible.  That is why I am a cosponsor of the Natural Disaster Protection and Insurance Act recently introduced by the distinguished Senator from Alaska, Senator Stevens, and the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Senator Inouye.  In the interim, however, my State of California which has experienced significant earthquakes in recent years--the Loma Prieta earthquake in 1989; and the Northridge earthquake in 1994--has experienced a sharp drop in the availability of earthquake insurance.  Simply stated, since the Northridge earthquake, many major insurers have pulled out of the California market. Many others have increased their premiums to such a point that they are beyond the reach of many homeowners, and even then there are very steep deductibles.  Recently the situation became much worse, for owners of California condominiums, when the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Company--commonly known as Freddie Mac--issued a policy requiring earthquake insurance, only for California condominiums, as a condition of purchase of mortgages.  I believe this policy, which targets only one State, is inappropriate for a federally chartered corporation which was created by Congress in 1970 to ensure a stable flow of mortgage funds for the entire Nation.  This policy which, in a way, redlines my State, is designed to minimize Freddie Mac's loss in the event of a future earthquake in California.  I can understand why the corporation feels the need to protect its shareholders from potentially lower dividends. But Freddie Mac, while a stockholder-owned corporation, enjoys considerable tax benefits by virtue of its Federal charter.  I believe that those benefits are provided by the American taxpaying public--which includes, I might add, many Californians--to assist Freddie Mac in accomplishing its mission of helping more Americans become homeowners.  California still lags the Nation in its recovery, and the economy there is very fragile. In implementing its new policy, Freddie Mac, in effect, is reducing the number of options for California homeowners, and this will have a direct impact on the value of their homes. I believe this sets a dangerous precedent for other parts of the country which are prone to natural disaster.  I am not unsympathetic to Freddie Mac's position, and I have indicated a willingness to sit down with them and work out a solution. But that solution must take into consideration the underlying problem--which is the lack of earthquake insurance availability.  In addition, the solution must take into consideration not only the protection of Freddie Mac's investors. It must also include the protection of the homeowners of my State, for it is they whom I was elected to represent.                          ____________________
