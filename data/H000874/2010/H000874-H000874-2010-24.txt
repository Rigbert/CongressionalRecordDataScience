 I rise in strong support of this legislation. This legislation is years late in passing. The injustices that it addresses are long term in being.  Today the House has an opportunity to bring an end to two historic injustices. We can do so by approving the settlement in the Pigford and Cobell class action lawsuits, helping to make amends to African American farmers and more than 300,000 Native Americans.                              {time}  1410  Few people in this Nation have been treated as poorly by their Nation as have African Americans and Native Americans. This was a continuing injustice that should have been addressed decades ago and, indeed, of course, should not have happened.  The Pigford settlement concerns a decades-old pattern of racial discrimination in Department of Agriculture loans to black farmers. For too long, farmers were denied loans because of their race. Even black farmers who received loans were paid significantly less than their white counterparts. In some cases, I am told that the amount of the loan on paper did not reflect the proceeds that were received. In fact, the proceeds were far below the face amount of the loan.  The Cobell settlement concerns mismanagement of Federal trust funds in which billions of dollars, billions of dollars in fees and royalties on reservation land were unaccounted for.  This bill can ensure that the individual account holders are properly paid. Now, I just said that, but unfortunately there are some who we will never be able to properly pay because they died before this injustice was righted. This will prevent similar mismanagement, hopefully, from reoccurring and resolve other outstanding land and water rights disputes that are deeply concerning to tribal governments.  Above all, passing this bill means living up to our obligation to those who have deserved better from the Federal Government. These settlements have been reached in court, and now it is our job to ensure that the Federal Government lives up to its end of the bargain.  I am glad that this bill funds the Pigford and Cobell settlements without adding to the deficit, and I am also glad this bill can bring to a close an unfortunate blemish on the record of this government in dealing with its people. It closes an unfortunate chapter in our history.  I urge my colleagues, hopefully unanimously, to pass this piece of legislation. We did the wrong thing, but all of us acknowledge it is never too late to do the right thing. So that although this is late, this legislation is the right thing to do. Let us do it now.  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas), the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee.
