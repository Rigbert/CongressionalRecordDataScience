President, shortly we will resume consideration of S. 2845. I am very hopeful that we will be able to clear an amendment that has been pending for some time. I know that the Senator from Ohio wishes to speak in opposition to Senator Byrd's amendment, which is the first amendment that we will vote on later this afternoon at 4:15. Until the Senator from Ohio arrives, which will be very shortly, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
