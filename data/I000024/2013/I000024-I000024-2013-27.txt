I carry this card with me. The very top military person in the country, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dempsey, told our committee: We are putting our military on a path where the force is so degraded and so unready that it would be immoral to use force.  He is the No. 1 Chief. The No. 2 Chief is Admiral Winnefeld, who stated that ``there could be for the first time in my career instances where we may be asked to respond to a crisis and we will have to say that we cannot.''  We can't correct all of that with this bill, but we can keep it from getting worse and get back and do what we have done over the last 52 years and pass the NDAA bill.  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.
