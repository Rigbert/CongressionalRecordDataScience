Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and I rise in support of S. 2719, the Native American Business Development, Trade Promotion, and Tourism Act of 2000. This bill will establish an office of Native American Business Development which will coordinate Federal programs relating to Indian economic development.  Mr. Speaker, this is a companion bill to the previous bill, and I support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
