Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3579, a bill to transfer the property known as Ranch A to the State of Wyoming, was introduced by Congresswoman Barbara Cubin on June 5, 1996.  Ranch A consists of a lodge, a barn, and associated buildings and includes approximately 680 acres. The property is located in Crook County, WY, which is within Sand Creek Canyon and includes the headwaters of Sand Creek.  The Fish and Wildlife Service acquired the Ranch A property in 1963, but has had little, to no, oversight of the property since 1986. The Wyoming Department of Game and Fish currently manages the majority of the Ranch A property and, up until 1995, raised trout and transplanted the trout to waters around the State of Wyoming. Currently, there is limited game bird hunting, and a select area of Sand Creek is open to fishing. In addition, the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology has been using the facilities for educational purposes.  H.R. 3579 is similar to measures the House of Representatives has approved to transfer certain Federal fish hatcheries to non-Federal control, and it contains the standard language requiring that the property revert to the Federal Government, if it is used for something other than the authorized purposes, which in this case include fish and wildlife management and educational endeavors.  I urge my colleagues to support this non-controversial piece of legislation and I compliment our distinguished colleague, Barbara Cubin, for her effective leadership on behalf of her Wyoming constituents.
