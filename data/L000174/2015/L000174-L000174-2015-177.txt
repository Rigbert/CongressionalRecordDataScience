Donald Ritchie has observed, studied, and documented the workings of the U.S. Senate for almost four decades. Only the second person to serve as the Historian of the Senate, Don has been with the Senate Historical Office since shortly after its creation.  Beginning in 1976, Don spearheaded the Senate Oral History Program, for which he interviewed dozens of former senators and their staff. He documented firsthand recollections of those individuals' time with the Senate, major events and debates, and how the institution evolved during their tenure. In the 1990s, the Senate Historical Office began making transcripts of the interviews available at various libraries and archives, including the Manuscript Division of the Library of Congress and the Senate Library. These accounts are fascinating, and remind us of the intricacies--both in public and behind the scenes--of legislating in the U.S. Senate. The Oral History Program was a colossal undertaking, and one congressional scholars will study for many years to come. Don's work on this program was exceptional.  In addition the Senate Oral History Program, Don and the Senate Historical Office maintain and make available historical documents, statistics, and provide historical background and how it may pertain to current events. In addition to his enormous undertaking, for years, Don has provided enlightening--sometimes humorous, always informative--vignettes to Members and staffers of moments in history, from now famous--or infamous--committee proceedings, to turning points in historical Senate debates, to the personal interactions and relationships among Senators that often don't make the history books.  My wife Marcelle tells me that Don is always welcomed at the Senate spouses' luncheon because of his valuable insights.  Don often reminds us of our roots--how our many traditions began--and how the Senate, as a continuing body, has evolved, decade to decade, generation to generation. He reminds us that for all our political disagreements, progress in the Senate requires some measure of consent. The history of the Senate is clearer because of the talents of Don Ritchie. The time has come to thank him for his decades of service and to wish him well as he assumes a new title of Historian Emeritus.                          ____________________
