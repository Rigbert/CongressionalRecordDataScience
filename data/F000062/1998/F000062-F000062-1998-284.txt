 President, I ask unanimous consent that the January 28 letter from the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Pharmaceutical Research and,                                     Manufacturers of America,                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I urge you to consider any      legislative proposals to ban the cloning of an entire human      being with great caution. The research-based pharmaceutical      industry appreciates the widespread ethical and moral      concerns about the possibility of creating a genetic      duplicate of an existing (or previously existing) human      being. We also share the view expressed by the National      Bioethics Advisory Commission that such a procedure is      unsafe.       For equally valid ethical, moral and safety reasons, we are      concerned that some pending proposals would inadvertently      harm patients with unmet needs and their families. The member      companies of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of      America support the President's call for a voluntary      moratorium on any cloning of an entire human being. However,      the best help and heal patients, biomedical researchers need      to be able to continue to clone human genes, cells and      tissues. If not drafted with laser-precision, legislation to      ban ``human cloning'' could--unintentionally, but      heartbreakingly--stop life-saving and health-enhancing      medical research.       The Food and Drug Administration has announced it will      prevent any cloning of an entire human being. The FDA's      assertion of regulatory authority eliminates any need for      well-intended but risky haste. In your consideration of any      legislative proposals, we urge you to protect patients and      their families from unintended impediments to ethical, moral      and safe biomedical research that does not involve any      cloning of an entire human being, but does involve cloning      human genes, cells or tissues.           Sincerely,                                                   Alan F. Holmer,                                                        President.
