The American people were actually heard, and fear was put on the shelf as we stopped hasty action that Wall Street powerhouses had attempted to ram through this Congress. It was a sobering day. It was an exhausting day. Now we have to get to work to create a new moment: to draft legislation on a bipartisan basis that is responsible, that is rigorous and that meets the real needs.  This includes securities and exchange reform legislation to expand credit flows. The SEC and bank regulators must act immediately to suspend the fair value accounting rules; they must clamp down on abuses by short sellers, and they must withdraw the Basel II capital rules. These will go a long way to expanding credit flows at the local level.  We have to stabilize our housing markets on Main Street, and we have to reform the regulatory process and investigate the wrongdoers who brought America and the American people to this juncture.  We have to fund the FBI to go after those who have exhibited malfeasance, accounting fraud, who have used abusive practices, and who have made billions doing it.  I want to thank the American people and this Congress for doing what was right, not what was hasty.                         Regulating Wall Street                         (By William M. Isaac)       The Fed's decision to open the discount window to Wall      Street firms, and to subsidize the takeover of Bear Stearns,      requires that we rethink the regulation of Wall Street. How      we resolve the issues will have profound effect on our      financial markets for years to come.       Before attempting to come up with answers, we need to make      sure we know and understand the questions. I will try to      identify the important ones.       A. Who Gets Access to the Safety Net? Under What      Circumstances? What Price Do They Pay? The federal safety net      (i.e., the ability to borrow from the Fed and to offer      insured deposits) was created to promote stability in the      banking and thrift industries, and the cost is borne by banks      and thrifts. The deposit insurance fund now exceeds $50      billion, and each year the Fed pays to the Treasury billions      of dollars of profits earned in part from interest-free      reserves maintained by banks.       If we expand the safety net, which firms should be      included--investment banks, hedge funds, leveraged buyout      firms, insurance companies, others? How will we draw the      line--size of firm, inter-connections to other firms, harm a      failure would cause to consumers or businesses, the potential      impact of a failure on financial stability?       If non-banks are granted access to the safety net, will      they be required to help pay cost? Would it be fair to banks      and thrifts to have invested billions per year in the safety      net for much of the past century to suddenly allow non-banks      to obtain the benefits of the safety net? What would be the      competitive effects on banks and thrifts?       B. Who Will Regulate Our New Universe of Safety Net Firms?      Treasury argues that we need to revamp the regulation of      financial firms in view of the new world of finance in which      commercial banks, thrifts, investment banks, insurance      companies, and others perform many of the same functions. It      is suggested that we need to consolidate the regulators while      designating a single ``market stability'' regulator.       I would argue that the genius of the American system of      government is the diffusion of government power. We do not      believe in centralized planning, and we rely heavily on      checks and balances.       One of the clearest lessons of the S crisis of the 1980s      is that we must have an independent deposit insurance agency      armed with the full array of examination and enforcement      powers. The former FSLIC, which insured deposits at S, was      a toothless agency operating as a subsidiary of the primary      regulator. The failure to provide that check on the S      industry was an important contributing factor to a taxpayer      loss of some $150 billion. Are we prepared to go down that      path again in our pursuit of a tidy organizational chart?       We currently have at least four agencies heavily focused on      maintaining stability in the financial markets--the Fed, the      SEC, the FDIC, and Treasury. Do we really believe that having      a single agency fretting about market stability will be an      improvement? If so, which agency has been proven to have such      all-knowing vision and wisdom?       The major problem confronting our financial system for the      past year is the collapse in the residential real estate      markets. Did the banking agencies and Treasury not notice      that unregulated mortgage loan brokers were sprouting up      everywhere, that securitizations were providing unprecedented      liquidity to mortgage markets, that     home loan underwriting standards were deteriorating, and that      home prices were skyrocketing? Did the agencies seek      more information or take actions to dampen the frenzy,      were they rebuffed, or did they not appreciate the      potential problems?       Take a look at the public debate while the real estate      bubble was building. You will find the Fed and Treasury      touting the Basel II capital regime as the way to make more      precise calculations of how much capital was really required      in our banks. It was argued that this would allow our large      banks to reduce their capital to international norms, or      about half the U.S. level. Does that sound like folks who      were concerned in the slightest about a bubble in real      estate?       Thankfully, the FDIC, the OTS, and a few Congressional      leaders fought against eliminating the minimum capital      requirement for U.S. banks. As bad as things might be right      now, how much worse they would be if Basel II had breezed      through without a minimum capital standard and our major      banks had leveraged their balance sheets even further during      the past few years?       One final question to ponder as we debate our future: Would      we be better served by a messy, contentious, and some times      frustrating regulatory system that moves cautiously or by a      highly efficient system that runs with alacrity off the      nearest cliff?       Would it be more appropriate to legislate that non-banks      develop and pay for their own safety net? Should we impose      new standards to reduce greatly the odds that non-banks will      ever need to use the safety net again? Might it be      appropriate to enact tough ground rules restricting the      ability of the Fed to lend to non-bank firms in the absence      of a national emergency? Should the Fed be allowed to act      unilaterally?       If non-bank firms are included in the bank-funded safety      net, what sort of regulation will we impose on them? Will it      be equivalent to the regulation of banks, i.e., capital      regulation, liquidity requirements, examinations, reporting      requirements, compliance regulations, limitations on loans to      affiliates and officers and directors, restrictions on      ownership and permissible activities, lending limits, and a      full range of regulatory enforcement powers?       If non-bank firms are included in the bank-funded safety      net and then fail, how will the failures be handled? Will      they be subject to the receivership powers of the FDIC? If      not, who will administer the receivership?       Do we want our central bank providing liquidity and also      handling failures? We used to have a comparable system in the      S industry with disastrous results.       If we go down the path of comparable regulation of      commercial banks and investment banks, will investment banks      be able to continue their high-risk underwriting and      investment activities so vital to capitalism? If not, will      they remain in the U.S. or move their headquarters to London      or Dubai?                                  ____                    How To Save the Financial System                         (By William M. Isaac)       I am astounded and deeply saddened to witness the senseless      destruction in the U.S. financial system, which has been the      envy of the world. We have always gone through periods of      correction, but today's problems are so much worse than they      needed to be.       The Securities and Exchange Commission and bank regulators      must act immediately to suspend the Fair Value Accounting      rules, clamp down on abuses by short sellers, and withdraw      the Basel II capital rules. These three actions will go a      long way toward arresting the carnage in our financial      system.       During the 1980s, our underlying economic problems were far      more serious than the economic problems we're facing this      time around. The prime rate exceeded 21%. The savings bank      industry was more than $100 billion insolvent (if we had      valued it on a market basis), the S industry was in even      worse shape, the economy plunged into a deep recession, and      the agricultural sector was in a depression.       These economic problems led to massive credit problems in      the banking and thrift industries. Some 3,000 banks and      thrifts ultimately failed, and many others were merged out of      existence. Continental Illinois failed, many of the regional      banks tanked, hundreds of farm banks went down, and thousands      of thrifts failed or were taken over.       It could have been much worse. The country's 10-largest      banks were loaded up with Third World debt that was valued in      the markets at cents on the dollar. If we had marked those      loans to market prices, virtually every one of them would      have been insolvent. Indeed, we developed contingency plans      to nationalize them.       At the outset of the current crisis in the credit markets,      we had no serious economic problems. Inflation was under      control, GDP growth was good, unemployment was low, and there      were no major credit problems in the banking system.       The dark cloud on the horizon was about $1.2 trillion of      subprime mortgage-backed securities, about $200 billion to      $300 billion of which was estimated to be held by FDIC-     insured banks and thrifts. The rest were spread among      investors throughout the world.       The likely losses on these assets were estimated by      regulators to be roughly 20%. Losses of this magnitude would      have caused pain for institutions that held these assets, but      would have been quite manageable.       How did we let this serious but manageable situation get so      far out of hand--to the point where several of our most      respected American financial companies are being put out of      business, sometimes involving massive government bailouts?       Lots of folks are assigning blame for the underlying      problems--management greed, inept regulation, rating-agency      incompetency, unregulated mortgage brokers and too      much government emphasis on creating more housing stock.      My interest is not in assigning blame for the problems but      in trying to identify what is causing a situation, that      should have been resolved easily, to develop into a crisis      that is spreading like a cancer throughout the financial      system.       The biggest culprit is a change in our accounting rules      that the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC put      into place over the past 15 years: Fair Value Accounting.      Fair Value Accounting dictates that financial institutions      holding financial instruments available for sale (such as      mortgage-backed securities) must mark those assets to market.      That sounds reasonable. But what do we do when the already      thin market for those assets freezes up and only a handful of      transactions occur at extremely depressed prices?       The answer to date from the SEC, FASB, bank regulators and      the Treasury has been (more or less) ``mark the assets to      market even though there is no meaningful market.'' The      accounting profession, scarred by decades of costly      litigation, just keeps marking down the assets as fast as it      can.       This is contrary to everything we know about bank      regulation. When there are temporary impairments of asset      values due to economic and marketplace events, regulators      must give institutions an opportunity to survive the      temporary impairment. Assets should not be marked to      unrealistic fire-sale prices. Regulators must evaluate the      assets on the basis of their true economic value (a      discounted cash-flow analysis).       If we had followed today's approach during the 1980s, we      would have nationalized all of the major banks in the country      and thousands of additional banks and thrifts would have      failed. I have little doubt that the country would have gone      from a serious recession into a depression.       If we do not halt the insanity of forcing financial firms      to mark assets to a nonexistent market rather than their      realistic economic value, the cancer will keep spreading and      will plunge the world into very difficult economic times for      years to come.       I argued against adopting Fair Value Accounting as it was      being considered two decades ago. I believed we would come to      regret its implementation when we hit the next big financial      crisis, as it would deny regulators the ability to exercise      judgment when circumstances called for restraint. That day      has clearly arrived.       Equally egregious are the actions by the SEC in recent      years lifting the restraints on short sellers of stocks to      allow ``naked selling'' (shorting a stock without actually      possessing it) and to eliminate the requirement that short      sellers could sell only on an uptick in the market.       On top of this, it is my understanding that short sellers      are engaged in abuses such as purchasing credit default swaps      on corporate bonds (essentially bets on whether a borrower      will default), which lowers the price of the bonds, which in      turn causes the price of the company's stock to decline      further. Then the ratings agencies pile on and reduce the      ratings of a company because its reduced stock price will      prevent it from raising new capital. The SEC must act      immediately to eliminate these and other potential abuses by      short sellers.       The Basel II capital rules adopted by the FDIC, Federal      Reserve, Office of Thrift Supervision and the Comptroller of      the Currency last year are too new to have caused big      problems, but they must be eliminated before they do. Basel      II requires the use of very complex mathematical models to      set capital levels in banks. The models use historical data      to project future losses. If banks have a period of low      losses (such as in the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s), the      models require relatively little capital and encourage even      more heated growth. When we go into a period like today where      losses are enormous (on paper, at least), the models require      more capital when none is available, forcing banks to cut      back lending.       As I write this article, I am seeing proposals by some to      create a new Resolution Trust Corp., as we did in the 1990s      to clean up the S problems. The RTC managed and sold assets      from S that had already failed. It was run by the FDIC,      just like the FDIC. We needed to create the RTC in the 1990s      only because we could not comingle the assets from failed      banks with those of failed thrifts, because we had two      separate deposit insurance funds absorbing the respective      losses from bank and thrift failures.       I can't imagine why we would want to create another      government bureaucracy to handle the assets from bank      failures. What we need to do urgently is stop the failures,      and an RTC won't do that.       Again, we must take three immediate steps to prevent a      further rash of financial failures and taxpayer bailouts.      First, the SEC must suspend Fair Value Accounting and require      that assets be marked to their true economic value. Second,      the SEC needs to immediately clamp down on abusive practices      by short sellers. It has taken a first step in reinstituting      the prohibition against ``naked selling.'' Finally, the bank      regulators need to acknowledge that the Basel II capital      rules represent a serious policy mistake and repeal the rules      before they do real damage.       We are almost out of time if we hope to eradicate the      cancer in our financial system.                                  ____       Mr. Isaac, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.      from 1981-1985, is chairman of the Washington financial      services consulting firm The Secura Group, an LECG company.               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 27, 2008]                       A Better Way To Aid Banks                         (By William M. Isaac)       Congressional leaders are badly divided on the Treasury      plan to purchase $700 billion in troubled loans. Their angst      is understandable: It is far from clear that the plan is      necessary or will accomplish its objectives.       It's worth recalling that our country dealt with far more      credit problems in the 1980s in a far harsher economic      environment than it faces today. About 3,000 bank and thrift      failures were handled without producing depositor panics and      massive instability in the financial system.       The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has just handled      Washington Mutual, now the largest bank failure in history,      in an orderly manner, with no cost to the FDIC fund or      taxpayers. This is proof that our time-tested system for      resolving banking problems works.       One argument for the urgency of the Treasury proposal is      that money market funds were under a great deal of pressure      last week as investors lost confidence and began withdrawing      their money. But putting the government's guarantee behind      money market funds--as Treasury did last week--should have      resolved this concern.       Another rationale for acting immediately on the bailout is      that bank depositors are getting panicky--mostly in reaction      to the July failure of IndyMac, in which uninsured depositors      were exposed to loss.       Does this mean that we need to enact an emergency program      to purchase $700 billion worth of real estate loans? If the      problem is depositor confidence, perhaps we need to be      clearer about the fact that the FDIC fund is backed by the      full faith and credit of the government.       If stronger action is needed, the FDIC could announce that      it will handle all bank failures, except those involving      significant fraudulent activities, as assisted mergers that      would protect all depositors and other general creditors.      This is how the FDIC handled Washington Mutual. It would be      easy to announce this as a temporary program if needed to      calm depositors.       An additional benefit of this approach is that community      banks would be put on a par with the largest banks,      reassuring depositors who are unconvinced that the government      will protect uninsured depositors in small banks.       I have doubts that the $700 billion bailout, if enacted,      would work. Would banks really be willing to part with the      loans, and would the government be able to sell them in the      marketplace on terms that the taxpayers would find      acceptable?       To get banks to sell the loans, the government would need      to buy them at a price greater than what the private sector      would pay today. Many investors are open to purchasing the      loans now, but the financial institutions and investors      cannot agree on price. Thus private money is sitting on the      sidelines until there is clear evidence that we are at the      floor in real estate.       Having financial institutions sell the loans to the      government at inflated prices so the government can turn      around and sell the loans to well-heeled investors at lower      prices strikes me as a very good deal for everyone but U.S.      taxpayers. Surely we can do better.       One alternative is a ``net worth certificate'' program      along the lines of what Congress enacted in the 1980s for the      savings and loan industry. It was a big success and could      work in the current climate. The FDIC resolved a $100 billion      insolvency in the savings banks for a total cost of less than      $2 billion.       The net worth certificate program was designed to shore up      the capital of weak banks to give them more time to resolve      their problems. The program involved no subsidy and no cash      outlay.       The FDIC purchased net worth certificates (subordinated      debentures, a commonly used form of capital in banks) in      troubled banks that the agency determined could be viable if      they were given more time. Banks entering the program had to      agree to strict supervision from the FDIC, including      oversight of compensation of top executives and removal of      poor management       The FDIC paid for the net worth certificates by issuing      FDIC senior notes to the banks; there was no cash outlay. The      interest rate on the net worth certificates and the FDIC      notes was identical, so there was no subsidy.       If such a program were enacted today, the capital position      of banks with real estate holdings would be bolstered, giving      those banks the ability to sell and restructure assets and      get on with their rehabilitation. No taxpayer money would be      spent, and the asset sale transactions would remain in the      private sector where they belong.       If we were to (1) implement a program to ease the fears of      depositors and other general creditors of banks; (2) keep      tight restrictions on short sellers of financial stocks; (3)      suspend fair-value accounting (which has contributed mightily      to our problems by marking assets to unrealistic fire-sale      prices); and (4) authorize a net worth certificate program,      we could settle the financial markets without significant      expense to taxpayers.       Say Congress spends $700 billion of taxpayer money on the      loan purchase proposal. What do we do next? If, however, we      implement the program suggested above, we will have $700      billion of dry powder we can put to work in targeted tax      incentives if needed to get the economy moving again.       The banks do not need taxpayers to carry their loans. They      need proper accounting and regulatory policies that will give      them time to work through their problems.                          ____________________
