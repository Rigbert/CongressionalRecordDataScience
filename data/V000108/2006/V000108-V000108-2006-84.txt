Speaker, it is with sincere admiration that I recognize the Asian-American Medical Association, which hosted the 30th Annual Asian-American Charity Ball on Saturday, November 4, 2006, at the Avalon Manor in Hobart, Indiana. Each year, the Asian-American Medical Association pays tribute to prominent, outstanding citizens for their contributions to the community. In recognition of their efforts, individuals are honored at this annual banquet and are awarded the prestigious Crystal Globe Award.  The Asian-American Medical Association has always been a great asset to Northwest Indiana. Its members have selflessly dedicated themselves to providing quality medical service to the residents of Indiana's First Congressional District, and they have always demonstrated exemplary service through their many cultural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors.  At this year's charity ball, the Asian-American Medical Association presented Surjit S. Patheja, M.D., with the Crystal Globe Award. Dr. Patheja was born in Pakistan in 1947 and graduated from Rangoon University Medical College in 1959. He practiced medicine in Burma for several years until immigrating to the United States in June 1964. After practicing medicine in locations such as Connecticut, New York, and Baltimore, Maryland, Dr. Patheja relocated to Northwest Indiana, where he has resided for the past 35 years. Although now retired from his practice, Dr. Patheja, board certified in Radiology and Nuclear Medicine, has been an invaluable member of the medical community since his arrival in Northwest Indiana, even serving as President of the Porter County Medical Society and the Tenth District Medical Society. Aside from the many accolades he has earned in the area of medicine, Dr. Patheja has also been instrumental in establishing scholarships and endowments for young adults. As if these accomplishments were not impressive enough, Dr. Patheja has always remained an active member of the community, donating his time through membership in several clubs and associations, including the Valparaiso Rotary Club, the Sikh Religious Society of Chicago, the Indian Medical Association of Northwest Indiana, and, of course, the Asian-American Medical Society. He is also a member of the American College of Radiology and the Radiological Society of North America.  Although Dr. Patheja has devoted so much of his time to medicine and to the Northwest Indiana community, he has always made a special point of sharing as much time as possible with his loving wife of 61 years, Mindy,and their three children. Aside from spending time with his family, in his spare time, Dr. Patheja has always enjoyed golfing and photography.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the Asian-American Medical Association, as well as this year's Crystal Globe Award recipient, Surjit S. Patheja, M.D., for their outstanding contributions to medicine and to the community. Their unwavering commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the world is truly inspirational. For these reasons, they are to be praised, and I am proud to serve as their Representative in Washington, DC.                          ____________________[Extensions of Remarks][Pages E1996-E1997]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]           TRIBUTE TO THE ASIAN-AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION                                 ______                                                         HON.
