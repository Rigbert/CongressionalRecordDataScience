President, I will be brief, but I want to just respond to several of the arguments made by my distinguished colleague. My colleague said, for example, that this is going to have real ramifications for the economic well-being of her State. The fact is, what the State of California has already done has already had a major economic impact on my State and on the people of the Pacific Northwest. Under very difficult circumstances we sent additional power to California which generated these glowing thank-you notes from my colleagues and various California public officials.  So my colleague from California envisages some economic trouble in her State. We are already seeing it and it is compounded by the fact that we have been more than a good neighbor. What it is all about on the west coast, as my colleague from Nevada knows, is we have an interconnected power system. We have been more than a good neighbor, and we are suffering economic hardship as a result.  My colleague also said that California is owed the opportunity. Those were her words: The State of California is owed the opportunity to work out this matter.  There is no question in my mind that they should have the opportunity to work it out. But they should not get a free ride. They should have to be part of an effort, as Senator Boxer said this evening, to bring the parties together as we have sought to do with our very narrow amendment we offered this evening.  Finally, my colleague says that somehow the amendment put together by Senator Smith and Senator Boxer and I, in her words, has launched an assault on the State of California.  That is pretty incendiary oratory, in terms of this whole debate. But, again, I submit if there has been an assault that has been launched, it was what was done in the State of California. It was not something that came about because the Senators from Oregon, working with the Senator from California, tried to figure out a way to make sure there was a modest measure of protection for our constituents. It is not a proposal that moved Bonneville Power to the head of the line, not a proposal that gives our constituents a free ride, the way Southern California Edison seems to want, but something that ensures that we do get a fair shake.  I am very hopeful my colleagues will see that there has been an effort on the part of the sponsors of this particular amendment. The first vote will be on the Smith amendment tomorrow morning at 10:30 or thereabouts. It is an amendment that was perfected by Senator Boxer so as to ensure that this would not create a greater opportunity for bankruptcy to take place.  It was designed to make sure that the parties had a reason to negotiate. I fear that if this particular proposal goes down, this gives a green light to the private interests that are opposing this tonight, to know they basically got the votes on the floor of the Senate to work their will on any of these major issues.  This is going to be a big vote, it seems to me. It is important for us in the Pacific Northwest. But for anybody who reads the Washington Post--and I put the article in the Record--the people who are opposing this amendment are folks who are sending billions of dollars overseas rather than trying to take care of business here at home.  The lines are drawn with respect to who is with us and who is not. Those who are responsible to taxpayers and have to make Treasury payments in small California municipal utilities are with us. This is about one proposition, and one proposition only, and that is basic fairness for all concerned in dealing with a difficult issue.  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Smith amendment that will come up in the morning.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                     amendment no. 27, as modified
