President, last week TIME Magazine published an extensive piece that took a close look at the hidden costs within our health care system and how the Medicare program, which is widely disparaged these days, is effective in controlling costs.  We as a nation will spend $2.8 trillion this year on health care. That is on average 27 percent more than what is spent per capita in other developed countries.  According to the TIME article, many hospitals routinely overcharge patients and reap profits at the expense of American families. As one former hospital billing officer put it, ``hospitals all know the bills are fiction.''  Too many families are put on the path to financial ruin because of hospital bills.  Another thing the TIME piece highlighted was that Medicare is much more effective at controlling costs than private sector providers, whether non-profit or for-profit.  Because Medicare sets the prices it is willing to pay providers in advance, patients with Medicare coverage are charged substantially less than patients with private health insurance who have received the same services.  In fact, projected Medicare spending over the 2011-2020 period is more than $500 billion lower since late 2010 than CBO projected.  But we can do more. Every day, 10,000 Americans turn 65 and become eligible for Medicare. In 11 years, Medicare's hospital insurance fund will start paying out more in benefits than it takes in.  Meaningful reforms that lead to better health care at lower costs are good for America's seniors--and for our entire health care system. And that should start with changes to Part D.  Today, I am introducing with Senators Whitehouse and Jack Reed the Medicare Prescription Drug Savings and Choice Act.  Our bill would save taxpayer dollars by giving Medicare beneficiaries the choice to participate in a Medicare Part D prescription drug plan run by Medicare, not private insurance companies.  Seniors want the ability to choose a Medicare-administered drug plan, so let's give them this option.  In 2010, Americans spent approximately $260 billion on prescription drugs. That figure is projected to double over the next decade. However, patients in the United States spend 50 percent more than other developed countries for the same drugs.  The average monthly price of cancer drugs has doubled over the past 10 years, from about $5,000 to more than $10,000.  Of the 12 new cancer drugs approved by the FDA last year, 11 were priced above $100,000 a year.  About 77 percent of all cancers are diagnosed in persons 55 years of age and older.  As these people enter the program, Medicare should be allowed to control how much it pays for these prescription drugs.  While the Affordable Care Act does a lot to control costs in the private insurance market, current law handcuffs Medicare beneficiaries from obtaining competitive prices for their prescription drugs.  For all other Medicare programs, beneficiaries can choose whether to receive benefits directly through Medicare or through a private insurance plan.  The overwhelming majority of seniors choose the Medicare-run option for their hospital and physician coverage.  Our bill requires the Secretary of HHS to develop at least one nationwide prescription drug plan.  Why? Because we should take advantage of the Federal Government's purchasing power.  The Veterans Administration uses this type of negotiating authority and has cut drug prices by as much as 50 percent for our Nation's veterans.  Savings from negotiating on behalf of seniors in Medicare could be used to further reduce costs in the program and ensure the program is there for future generations.  America's health care system is burdening families and hindering our ability to invest in the future.  The Affordable Care Act takes important steps to begin bringing down costs in the private market and in Medicare, but there is more we can do. This proposal is a simple and common sense option that should be available for seniors.  Allowing Medicare to manage a prescription drug plan and negotiate prices, taxpayers will save money and seniors will get high quality drug coverage.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 408       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Prescription Drug      Savings and Choice Act of 2013''.     SEC. 2. ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICARE OPERATED PRESCRIPTION DRUG                    PLAN OPTION.       (a) In General.--Subpart 2 of part D of title XVIII of the      Social Security Act is amended by inserting after section      1860D-11 (42 U.S.C. 1395w-111) the following new section:           ``medicare operated prescription drug plan option       ``Sec. 1860D-11A.  (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any      other provision of this part, for each year (beginning with      2014), in addition to any plans offered under section 1860D-     11, the Secretary shall offer one or more Medicare operated      prescription drug plans (as defined in subsection (c)) with a      service area that consists of the entire United States and      shall enter into negotiations in accordance with subsection      (b) with pharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce the purchase      cost of covered part D drugs for eligible part D individuals      who enroll in such a plan.       ``(b) Negotiations.--Notwithstanding section 1860D-11(i),      for purposes of offering a Medicare operated prescription      drug plan under this section, the Secretary shall negotiate      with pharmaceutical manufacturers with respect to the      purchase price of covered part D drugs in a Medicare operated      prescription drug plan and shall encourage the use of more      affordable therapeutic equivalents to the extent such      practices do not override medical necessity as determined by      the prescribing physician. To the extent practicable and      consistent with the previous sentence, the Secretary shall      implement strategies similar to those used by other Federal      purchasers of prescription drugs, and other strategies,      including the use of a formulary and formulary incentives in      subsection (e), to reduce the purchase cost of covered part D      drugs.       ``(c) Medicare Operated Prescription Drug Plan Defined.--     For purposes of this part, the term `Medicare operated      prescription drug plan' means a prescription drug plan that      offers qualified prescription drug coverage and access to      negotiated prices described in section 1860D-2(a)(1)(A). Such      a plan may offer supplemental prescription drug coverage in      the same manner as other qualified prescription drug coverage      offered by other prescription drug plans.       ``(d) Monthly Beneficiary Premium.--       ``(1) Qualified prescription drug coverage.--The monthly      beneficiary premium for qualified prescription drug coverage      and access to negotiated prices described in section 1860D-     2(a)(1)(A) to be charged under a Medicare operated      prescription drug plan shall be uniform nationally. Such      premium for months in 2014 and each succeeding year shall be      based on the average monthly per capita actuarial cost of      offering the Medicare operated prescription drug plan for the      year involved, including administrative expenses.       ``(2) Supplemental prescription drug coverage.--Insofar as      a Medicare operated prescription drug plan offers      supplemental prescription drug coverage, the Secretary may      adjust the amount of the premium charged under paragraph (1).       ``(e) Use of a Formulary and Formulary Incentives.--       ``(1) In general.--With respect to the operation of a      Medicare operated prescription drug plan, the Secretary shall      establish and apply a formulary (and may include formulary      incentives described in paragraph (2)(C)(ii)) in accordance      with this subsection in order to--       ``(A) increase patient safety;       ``(B) increase appropriate use and reduce inappropriate use      of drugs; and       ``(C) reward value.       ``(2) Development of initial formulary.--       ``(A) In general.--In selecting covered part D drugs for      inclusion in a formulary, the Secretary shall consider      clinical benefit and price.       ``(B) Role of ahrq.--The Director of the Agency for      Healthcare Research and Quality shall be responsible for      assessing the clinical benefit of covered part D drugs and      making recommendations to the Secretary regarding which drugs      should be included in the formulary. In conducting such      assessments and making such recommendations, the Director      shall--       ``(i) consider safety concerns including those identified      by the Federal Food and Drug Administration;       ``(ii) use available data and evaluations, with priority      given to randomized controlled trials, to examine clinical      effectiveness, comparative effectiveness, safety, and      enhanced compliance with a drug regimen;       ``(iii) use the same classes of drugs developed by the      United States Pharmacopeia for this part;       ``(iv) consider evaluations made by--       ``(I) the Director under section 1013 of the Medicare      Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of      2003;       ``(II) other Federal entities, such as the Secretary of      Veterans Affairs; and       ``(III) other private and public entities, such as the Drug      Effectiveness Review Project and State plans under title XIX;      and       ``(v) recommend to the Secretary--       ``(I) those drugs in a class that provide a greater      clinical benefit, including fewer safety concerns or less      risk of side-effects, than another drug in the same class      that should be included in the formulary;       ``(II) those drugs in a class that provide less clinical      benefit, including greater safety concerns or a greater risk      of side-effects, than another drug in the same class that      should be excluded from the formulary; and       ``(III) drugs in a class with same or similar clinical      benefit for which it would be appropriate for the Secretary      to competitively bid (or negotiate) for placement on the      formulary.       ``(C) Consideration of ahrq recommendations.--       ``(i) In general.--The Secretary, after taking into      consideration the recommendations under subparagraph (B)(v),      shall establish a formulary, and formulary incentives, to      encourage use of covered part D drugs that--       ``(I) have a lower cost and provide a greater clinical      benefit than other drugs;       ``(II) have a lower cost than other drugs with the same or      similar clinical benefit; and       ``(III) drugs that have the same cost but provide greater      clinical benefit than other drugs.       ``(ii) Formulary incentives.--The formulary incentives      under clause (i) may be in the form of one or more of the      following:       ``(I) Tiered copayments.       ``(II) Reference pricing.       ``(III) Prior authorization.       ``(IV) Step therapy.       ``(V) Medication therapy management.       ``(VI) Generic drug substitution.       ``(iii) Flexibility.--In applying such formulary incentives      the Secretary may decide not to impose any cost-sharing for a      covered part D drug for which--       ``(I) the elimination of cost sharing would be expected to      increase compliance with a drug regimen; and       ``(II) compliance would be expected to produce savings      under part A or B or both.       ``(3) Limitations on formulary.--In any formulary      established under this subsection, the formulary may not be      changed during a year, except--       ``(A) to add a generic version of a covered part D drug      that entered the market;       ``(B) to remove such a drug for which a safety problem is      found; and       ``(C) to add a drug that the Secretary identifies as a drug      which treats a condition for which there has not previously      been a treatment option or for which a clear and significant      benefit has been demonstrated over other covered part D      drugs.       ``(4) Adding drugs to the initial formulary.--       ``(A) Use of advisory committee.--The Secretary shall      establish and appoint an advisory committee (in this      paragraph referred to as the `advisory committee')--       ``(i) to review petitions from drug manufacturers, health      care provider organizations, patient groups, and other      entities for inclusion of a drug in, or other changes to,      such formulary; and       ``(ii) to recommend any changes to the formulary      established under this subsection.       ``(B) Composition.--The advisory committee shall be      composed of 9 members and shall include representatives of      physicians, pharmacists, and consumers and others with      expertise in evaluating prescription drugs.

Reduce Pharmaceutical Prices--Do Not Cut Benefits       Dear President Obama and Senator/Representative: We have      noted with great concern that federal budget discussions have      included the possibility of cuts to Medicare and Medicaid. We      wish to be clear: We strongly oppose such an approach and      believe it to be both unnecessary and a no-growth policy for      an economy that remains stagnant.       Medicare and Medicaid not only provide critical protections      against the economic deprivation caused by illness,      especially for older Americans; they also create jobs and      boost an economy that is slumbering. Cutting these programs      leads this country in the wrong direction.       We cannot continue to unravel these critical programs for      working families, the elderly, and the poor. If the Congress      is unable to move forward without some compromise that      reduces our national commitment to quality Medicare and      Medicaid programs, there is a source for reductions that will      not harm beneficiaries: the cost of prescription drugs.       The U.S. pays more for prescriptions than any nation in the      world. Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries pay more for      medicines than do our veterans and the clients of the      National Indian Health Service. Why do these differences in      cost persist? They do so because other countries, the VA, and      the IHS negotiate the prices for prescriptions, while      Medicare and Medicaid programs do not.       According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research,      savings to the federal government over the next decade would      be as high as $541.3 billion. The saving to the states would      be as high as $72.7 billion, and beneficiaries would save      $112.4 billion. These amounts are far in excess of the demand      for expenditure reductions being suggested by the most      strident deficit reduction advocates.       We are more than 275 national and state organizations, and      we are opposed to cutting health care benefits for the      elderly and the poor. However, saving money by negotiating      drug prices would be beneficial to the entire health care      system, in addition to saving money for the federal      government and the states. We urge you to pursue this policy      as a major part of efforts to reduce health care costs.

Hon. Dick Durbin,     U.S. Senate, Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Janice Schakowsky,     House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin and Representative Schakowsky: On      behalf of the millions of members and supporters of the      National Committee to Preserve Social Security and     Medicare, I am writing to express our support for the      Medicare Prescription Drug Savings and Choice Act. We applaud      this effort because it would improve the Medicare program for      beneficiaries and reduce federal spending on prescriptions      drugs.       We understand that your legislation would create one or      more Medicare-administered drug plans with uniform premiums,      providing seniors with the opportunity to purchase drugs      directly through the Medicare program. In addition, your      legislation would require the federal government to use its      purchasing power to negotiate lower prices on prescription      drugs for beneficiaries who enroll in the Medicare-     administered plan. The Department of Veterans Affairs and      many state governments are able to deliver lower drug prices      because of price negotiation, and we believe that the federal      government should be able to receive the best price available      for Medicare prescription drugs. Finally, we appreciate that      your legislation establishes an advisory committee to assess      a public formulary and streamlines the Medicare Part D      appeals process, which will help all beneficiaries.       Thank you for your continued leadership on Medicare,      particularly for identifying ways to reduce Medicare spending      without shifting costs to beneficiaries. We look forward to      working with you to enact this important legislation.           Sincerely,                                                     Max Richtman,                                                President and CEO.                                 ______                                       By
