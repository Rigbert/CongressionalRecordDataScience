 Stanley E. Todd Sr. I would also like to extend my most heartfelt condolences to his daughter Becky Todd York, his son Stanley E. Todd Jr., his twin sister Hazel Bush, and his grandchildren.  As a World War II veteran, Dr. Todd possessed a great deal of courage and patriotism that deserves to be recognized and commended. He served as a nose gunner on a B-24 bomber, an endeavor that nearly cost him his life. At one point during his time in the service, Dr. Todd's plane was shot down over Austria and he became a German prisoner of war.  Though the trials Dr. Todd endured contributed to the person he became, he did not let his harrowing experiences have an adverse affect on his life. Instead, he learned never to take a single moment for granted, a paradigm that rings true and serves as an example to all of us he leaves behind.  After completing his service in the military and marrying Esta Newman, Dr. Todd enrolled in the University of Louisville School of Dentistry. He practiced dentistry in Richmond, Ky., for 33 years. Also in Richmond, Dr. Todd helped found the Richmond Health and Rehabilitation Center, a facility that has provided care to residents since 1968.  Even after retiring in 1982, Dr. Todd continued to maintain an active lifestyle. He served Richmond as a city commissioner and also as chairman of the Richmond Housing Authority. Additionally, he was a former chairman of the board of the Kentucky Heart Association, and served on the board of the Kentucky River Foothills Development Corporation. An elder of Richmond's First Christian church, Dr. Todd provided missionary dental work in Haiti and helped found a local clothing bank. He was also instrumental in the organization of Richmond Little League baseball, and the founding of Stanton Woodcraft in Richmond.  I am certain that the legacy that Dr. Stanley E. Todd Sr., left behind will continue on. Indeed, he possessed a tremendous personal story that serves as a testament to the strength of his spirit and his faith and God. His faith, valor and strength of character should serve as an inspiration to us all. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the Senate, I offer my deepest condolences to Dr. Todd's friends and loved ones, and express my gratitude for all he contributed to the Commonwealth of Kentucky and to our great Nation.                          ____________________
