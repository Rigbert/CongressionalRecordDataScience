President, 10 days ago was the 25th anniversary of a policy in this country that was articulated in a treaty called the ABM Treaty. It was a treaty that many of us at that time did not think was in the best interests of this country. It was a treaty that came from the Nixon administration, a Republican administration. Of course, Henry Kissinger was the architect of that treaty in 1972.  Essentially what it did was say to any adversaries out there that we will agree to disarm and not to be prepared to defend ourselves if you agree to do the same thing. Some people refer to it as mutual assured destruction, a policy I certainly did not adhere to at the time, did not feel was good policy for this country. However, there was an argument at that time, because we had two superpowers--we had the then Soviet Union and of course the United States--and at that time we had pretty good intelligence on them, they had pretty good intelligence on us, so I suppose we would be overly critical if we said there was just no justification for that program, even though I personally disagreed with it at that time.  Since that time, starting in 1983 in the Reagan administration, we have elevated the debate that there is a great threat out there and that threat is from the many countries that now have weapons of mass destruction. Over 25 nations now have those weapons, either chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons. The critics, those who would take that money and apply it to social programs as opposed to defending our Nation, use such titles as ``star wars,'' and they talk about the billions of dollars that have been invested.  Anyway, we are at a point right now where something very interesting has happened just recently. That is, on this 25th anniversary, we have found that the Clinton administration, just about 10 days ago, agreed to create new parties to the ABM Treaty. That would be Belarus, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, and Russia. This is going to have to come before this body. I think this is an opportunity that we need to be looking for, because all it would take is 34 Senators to reject this multilateralization of the ABM Treaty.  Right now we have a number of systems that we are putting into place to defend the United States of America, both the national missile defense as well as a theater defense. Certainly, with what is going on right now in Russia and Iran, the need for such a system has been elevated in the minds of most Americans.  We have right now, as we speak, 22 Aegis ships that are floating out there in the ocean, already deployed. They have the capability of knocking down missiles when they are coming in. All we have to do is take them to the upper tier, and we will have in place a national missile defense system. Certainly that is something that could take care of our theater missile needs. So several of us feel that we should go ahead and conclude that is the system that we need. However, that does violate, probably violates, the ABM Treaty, as it is in place today. So I believe we should take this opportunity that is there, when it comes before this body for ratification, to reject this and thereby kill the ABM Treaty, which certainly is outdated.  By the way, it is interesting, the very architect of that treaty, Dr. Henry Kissinger, someone whose credentials no one will question, even though they may question some of his previous policy decisions, Dr. Kissinger, who is the architect of the 1972 ABM Treaty, now says it is nuts to make a virtue out of your vulnerability. He is opposed to continuing the ABM Treaty at this time.  So I hope we will take this opportunity to get out from under a treatythat imposes restrictions on our ability to defend ourselves and reject the upgraded system, or the treaty, as it comes before us and take this opportunity to defend America.  We have an opportunity to get out from under the restriction imposed upon us by the ABM Treaty.  We have an opportunity to elevate our Aegis system.  We have an opportunity to defend America.  After all, Mr. President, isn't that what we are supposed to be doing?  I ask unanimous consent that a decision brief from the Center for Security Policy be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:A Day That Will Live in Infamy: 25th Anniversary of the A.B.M. Treaty's                     Ratification Should Be Its Last       (Washington, D.C.): Twenty-five years ago tomorrow, the      United States ratified the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)      Treaty; this Friday will mark the 25th anniversary of that      Treaty's entry into force. With those acts, America became      legally obliged to leave itself permanently vulnerable to      nuclear-armed ballistic missile attack.       It is highly debatable whether such a policy of      deliberately transforming the American people into hostages      against one means of delivering lethal ordnance against them      (in contrast to U.S. policy with respect to land invasion,      sea assault or aerial attack) made sense in 1972. It      certainly does not today, in a world where the Soviet Union      no longer exists and Russia no longer has a monopoly on      threatening ballistic missiles or the weapons of mass      destruction they can carry.                           the reagan legacy       Indeed, as long ago as March 1983, President Reagan dared      to suggest that the United States might be better off      defending its people against nuclear-armed ballistic missile      attack rather than avenging their deaths after one occurs.      And yet, while Mr. Reagan's address spawned a research      program that became known as the Strategic Defense Initiative      (SDI)--into which tens of billions of dollars have been      poured over the past fourteen years, the ABM Treaty remains      the ``supreme law of the land.'' As a consequence, the United      States continues to fail what has been called ``the one-     missile test''. No defenses are in place today to prevent      even a single long-range ballistic missile from delivering      nuclear, chemical or biological warheads anywhere in the      country.       This is all the more extraordinary since Republicans and      like-minded conservatives have generally recognized that such      a posture has become not just dangerous, but also reckless in      the ``post-Cold War'' world. In fact, one of the few      commitments of the `Contract With America' that remains      unfulfilled was arguably among its most important--namely,      its promise to defend the American people against ballistic      missile attack. Successive legislative attempts to correct      this breach-of-contract have all foundered for essentially      two reasons.                      why are we still undefended?       First, most Republicans have shied away from a fight over      the ABM Treaty. Some deluded themselves into believing that      the opportunity afforded by the Treaty to deploy 100 ground-     based anti-missile interceptors in silos at a single site in      Grand Forks, North Dakota would allow the U.S. to get started      on defenses. Even though such a deployment would neither make      strategic sense (it would not cover the entire United States      from even a limited attack) nor be justifiable from a      budgetary point of view (while estimates vary widely, costs      of this minimal system could be well over $10 billion), some      missile defense proponents rationalized their support for it      by claiming that the anti-defense crowd would not object to      this ``treaty-complaint'' deployment and that it would be      better than nothing. To date, however, all these ``camel's-     nose-under-the-tent'' schemes have come to naught.       Such a system would create a basis for addressing new-term      missile threats and complement space-based assets that may be      needed in the future. The only problem is that the ABM Treaty      prohibits such an affordable, formidable sea-borne defensive      system. It must no longer be allowed to do so.                            the bottom line       As it happens, the opening salvos in what may be the      endgame of the ABM Treaty fight were sounded this weekend at      the first International Conservative Congress (dubbed by one      participant ``the Conintern''). One preeminent leader after      another--including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, former      British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, once-and-future      presidential candidate Steve Forbes, former UN Ambassador      Jeane Kirkpatrick, Senator Jon Kyl and nationally syndicated      columnist Charles Krauthammer--denounced the idea of making      it still harder to defend our people against ballistic      missile attack. Several, notably Senator Kyl and Mr. Forbes,      have explicitly endorsed the AEGIS option to begin performing      that task.       In an impassioned appeal for missile defenses as part of a      robust military posture, Lady Thatcher said yesterday:       ``A strong defense, supported by heavy investment in the      latest technology, including ballistic missile defense, is as      essential now, when we don't know who our future enemy may      be, as in the Cold War era. And my friends, we must keep      ahead technologically. We must not constrain the hands of our      researchers. Had we done so in the past, we would never have      had the military superiority that in the end, with the      dropping of the atomic bomb, won the war in the Far East and      saved many, many, lives, even through it destroyed others. We      must always remain technologically ahead. If not, we have no      way in which to be certain that our armed forces will      prevail. And the research and technology of the United States      is sheer genius, and it always has been.''       With such leadership, there now looms a distinct      possibility that the American people can finally be      acquainted with the ominous reality of their vulnerability      and empowered to demand and secure corrective actions. Thanks      to the Clinton ABM amendments and the new technical options      for defending America, we have both the vehicle for getting      out from under an accord that was obsolete even in Ronald      Reagan's day and the means for making good and cost-effective      use of the freedom that will flow from doing so.
