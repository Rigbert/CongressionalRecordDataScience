Ron was a dedicated public servant and he will be deeply missed.  Throughout his life, Ron worked to improve the community around him. In the first phase of his public service, Ron worked as a California Highway Patrol officer. By the time he retired, Ron had risen to the rank of sergeant. After his career in law enforcement, Ron began what would eventually be a twenty-four-year dedication to the city of Temecula. Ron was first appointed to the Temecula Traffic Commission in 1990, the year after the city incorporated.  In 1992, Ron was elected to the Temecula City Council, where he would ultimately serve five consecutive terms, from 1992 to 2014, including five terms as the city's mayor. The impact of Ron's leadership and hard work is on display today throughout Temecula, particularly in its infrastructure, facilities, parks and libraries. In fact, the city honored Ron by naming its busiest library the Ronald H. Roberts Temecula Public Library. Ron was also rightfully proud of his work granting public use of the Duck Pond at the corner of Ynez and Rancho California roads and revitalizing Old Town Temecula. Extraordinary cities like Temecula don't exist by accident--they come to fruition thanks to the vision and activism of tireless advocates like Ron Roberts.  Ron is survived by his wife, Jeanne; son Ron, Jr. (wife Kara); daughter Wendy (husband Sam); and five grandchildren. I extend my heartfelt condolences to the Roberts family, his friends, and everyone fortunate enough to know Ron. Although Ron may be gone, the many contributions he made to his country, community and family will have a lasting impact.                          ____________________
