Mr. Speaker, many in the human rights community were horrified to learn of the shooting of Akin Birdal, President of Turkey's Human Rights Foundation, by unidentified armed gunmen at his offices in Ankara. Mr. Birdal, a widely recognized and respected human rights advocate, appeared before the Helsinki Commission in the early 1990s and most recently met with members of a Commission delegation that visited Turkey in January. Today's attack occurred against the backdrop of an ongoing campaign of harassment against human rights NGOs in Turkey. The Human Rights Foundation, Turkey's largest human rights monitoring group, has had numerous offices closed down by the Turkish authorities. The Foundation's leadership, including Mr. Birdal, has been repeatedly targeted for prosecution.  The attack against Akin Birdal in a very real sense is an assault on Turkey's fledgling civil society. The development of a genuine civil society is essential if Turkey hopes to develop into a true democracy. Mr. Speaker, instead of viewing human rights advocates like Mr. Birdal as adversaries, Turkey's leaders should embrace these courageous individuals as allies and form a partnership with those dedicated to democracy, human rights, and the rule of law. Our prayers go out to Mr. Birdal and his family in the aftermath of this senseless act.                          ____________________
