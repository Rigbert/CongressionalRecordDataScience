 You know what this reminds me of? This reminds me of the Senate. Imagine, both sides of the aisle--Republican and Democrat--on the floor discussing and debating an issue which counts with American families--health insurance.  Is it going to be there when we need it? Will it be affordable? Can we trust our doctors not to be overruled by insurance company bureaucrats?  I like this debate. That is why I ran for the Senate. But in 10 minutes there will be a vote on a Republican motion to table to end this debate, to stop it, to say that there is going to be no further debate, no future amendments--it is over.  I do not think that makes sense. Weren't we sent here to enter into this debate? To face these issues on an up-or-down vote? I am prepared to do that.  I know that some of the votes on these amendments will not be easy, but I think we have an excellent bill in the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, a bill that has been endorsed by every major health organization, children's advocacy groups, and labor-business across the board.  I am prepared to stand and defend this bill, offer amendments that give to families the assurance they are going to get quality health care. But the Republican side does not want this debate. They do not want to vote on these amendments. They called it ``health care-plus.'' It is ``health care-minus.'' Every day they are taking away from American families their power to choose a doctor, their power to have the right specialist, their willingness, I guess, to sit down with their doctor and realize they are getting an honest answer.  It is a shame that in 10 minutes this motion to table is going to come before us. This really resembles the Senate--deliberation on an issue that counts. I hope the motion to table is defeated. Let's have the real debate on this issue.  I yield back my time.
