Speaker, yesterday the commission which Congress created during the enactment of the surface transportation, the SAFETEA-LU bill, reported its results to the Congress in terms of the state of the Nation's infrastructure. The short version is that the state of the Nation's infrastructure is abysmal. We are seeing dramatically increased congestion. We are seeing bridges collapse. We are losing ground. We are not even maintaining the investment made by the Eisenhower generation in the Nation's interstate system let alone other vital national needs. It needs immediate attention.  And, of course, investment in our infrastructure will produce jobs. Large numbers of jobs will be produced should we go ahead with this needed construction, not only construction jobs but suppliers, small businesses, communities will benefit. The economy as a whole will benefit in terms of our economic productivity and competitiveness with just-in-time delivery and other concerns. And the American people will benefit in terms of more time at home, less time in commutes, less fuel wasted in congestion and backups in traffic. These are investments that need to be made.  The commission, a bipartisan commission, by a large majority said we need to be investing between $220 and $335 billion a year from all sources, Federal, State, local, and private, in the Nation's transportation infrastructure.                              {time}  1700  And today we're investing about $87 billion, about a third of the minimum they think is necessary. This is a wake-up call that's long overdue to this Congress, to this administration, and to the country about how we're losing ground. We're headed toward Third World status in terms of our Nation's transportation infrastructure. That is not acceptable.  Unfortunately, the Bush administration, the headquarters of the head in the sand folks, are saying no additional Federal investment is necessary; that all of that $220 billion can come from privatizing the Nation's highways; tolling and pricing people off the roads will help mitigate congestion. Yes, they want to toll existing highways, paid for by taxpayers, they want to put extortionate tolls on where they would charge more at rush hour. Now, if you happen to live on the east side of town and work on the west side and have to travel a congested highway, from George Bush and Mary Peters, Secretary of Transportation, the message is, quit your job, move, or tough luck, suck it up. That's not acceptable for America. We are not going to solve this problem through the fantasies of this administration. You're not going to solve it with the privatization of our existing network.  Now, in certain areas, tolling, congestion pricing and private-public partnerships, done properly, protecting the public interest, can contribute a small amount. The estimates are, generously, maybe 10 percent. But the Bush administration is saying that can do 100 percent because they're saying they will never ever support any increase in any taxes to increase any investment in the national transportation infrastructure. That's a shame. That's an incredible shame. And it is doing an amazing disservice to the future of our economy.  And as we stagger in this recession created by the policies of this administration, one of the best ways that we can begin to build out of it and to make ourselves more productive in the future and prevent future recessions is investment in our infrastructure. You can justify borrowing money to build things that are going to last 30, 50, 100 years and benefit all of the American people and our economy. They want to borrow money to give more tax cuts to the few rich people, many of whom have done fabulously well, some of whom lost their shirts with speculation in this recent market. Other sides of the speculators made hundreds of millions and billions of dollars by speculating on the collapse of the housing market, while the Bush administration and Alan Greenspan and everybody watched the bubble grow and grow and grow and grow and did nothing.  We need a concrete investment for the future, an investment in our transportation infrastructure, despite what Mary Peters and George Bush think is one of the best ways to promote the long-term health and competitiveness of the United States of America. We should begin to make those investments.                          ____________________
