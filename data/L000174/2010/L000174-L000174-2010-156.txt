President, today I am pleased to join my colleague and good friend Senator Sanders to introduce the boundary expansion of the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park in the State of Vermont. This amendment will add 159 acres and several historic farmstead structures to the 555-acre National Park.  This park is an extraordinary place in Vermont where a unique and enduring connection has been forged between the land and its inhabitants. The picturesque and historic landscape of the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park is nestled in the rolling hills near Woodstock, in Vermont's Windsor County. It is a small park with the powerful mission of recognizing and continuing the legacy of three generations of stewardship thought, and stewardship in action. The successive owners of this estate,for whom the park is named, were each in their own right giants of conservation ideas and practice. This legislation will expand the park's land area to help our generation and future generations to better fulfill and carry forward its mission.  The boyhood home of George Perkins Marsh, one of America's first conservationists, and later the home of Frederick Billings, the property was given to the American people by its most recent owners, Laurance S. and Mary F. Rockefeller. The park was created by an Act of Congress and signed into law by President George Bush on August 26, 1992. It is a living symbol of America's conservation ethic. The Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historic Park tells a story of conservation history and the evolving nature of land stewardship in America.  The park puts the idea of conservation stewardship into a modern context, interpreting the idea of place and the ways in which people can balance natural resource conservation with the requirements of our 21st Century world. It is also a repository for the histories of these three American families. Visitors can tour the mansion and gardens and learn more about conservation by hiking in the sustainably managed forest, and they can visit the land stewardship exhibit at the Carriage Barn Visitor Center. The park operates in partnership with The Woodstock Foundation and the adjacent Billings Farm and Museum--a working dairy farm and a museum of agricultural and rural life that offers visitors the opportunity to experience both farm and forest landscapes, in side-by-side settings.  This new legislation would expand the boundaries of the park to incorporate the neighboring King Farm. The land and structures of this historic Woodstock farm will allow the National Park Service to expand the scope and delivery of its telling of the conservation story. The farm will provide a setting for programs in sustainable agriculture and a venue for community groups and others to undertake related projects and educational opportunities activities that have been limited in the past by the sensitivity of the historic structures constituting the Rockefeller estate. Model forestry activities and the trail network will also be enhanced through this boundary expansion.  This legislation also formally establishes the Conservation Studies Institute within the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park. The Institute has evolved within the National Park Service over the past decade to enhance leadership in conservation throughout the National Park Service and to facilitate stewardship partnerships in local communities. It is through these partnerships that the Institute inspires collaborative conservation to engage communities and help them build their vision for the future. The park, the Institute and their Vermont setting are a great fit and a valuable setting in which to offer prototypes for conservation and sustainable practices on so many fronts.  A Vermont author and professor, John Elder, said this at the park's dedication on June 5th 1998:       There is a mandate to invent an entirely new kind of park.      It must be one where the human stories and the natural      history are intertwined; where the relatively small acreage      serves as an educational resource for the entire National      Park Service and a seedbed for American environmental      thought; and where the legacy of American conservation and      its future enter into dialogue, generating a new      environmental paradigm for our day.  This is a unique opportunity to enhance the mission of the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park and its service to the American people.                          ____________________
