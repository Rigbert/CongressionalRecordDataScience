President, now that we are back in session, I thank my fellow Members, and Senator Cochran especially, for their courtesy in letting us go into recess so that we could bring a group of very distinguished British parliamentarians on the floor.  I would note for the Senate that we meet every 2 years, American Senators and British parliamentarians of both the House of Commons and the House of Lords. We will do it once in England, once here. Two years ago we were over there, and this year we are meeting here. Four years ago, as Senator Cochran will recall, we met in the State of Vermont. But with changes in the Senate session, we are going to meet here in the Capitol.  I thank you very much for the courtesy.  I yield to the Senator from Mississippi.
