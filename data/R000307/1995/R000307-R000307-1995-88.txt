Speaker, doubtlessly, we will return in just a moment to the 1-minute handgrenades back and forth. But first this happy birthday greeting.  My colleagues, as chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, we are 175 years old as of today. As we begin our work on the 1995 farm bill, it is appropriate for us to take a brief moment to reflect on the long and distinguished story and history of the committee.  April 29, 1820, Congressman Lewis Williams of North Carolina, introduced a resolution to create a Committee on Agriculture in the House of Representatives. Since that time, we have remained true to the original purpose of the committee that was stated by Congressman Williams, to guard and protect the great and leading substantial interests in this country.  Hey, the House Ag Committee over the break, 16 hearings, 5,000 farmers in attendance, over 600 witnesses. When we are 200, I can assure you we will continue to do our work, to make sure we have the best quality food at the lowest price in the history of the world.  Happy birthday, House Ag Committee.                          ____________________
