 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Maryland for yielding, and I appreciate the gentleman's expression of sympathy. The gentleman has always shown a true regard for the Capitol community and the people that work here, and particularly the Capitol Police that protect us. I appreciate the gentleman joining me in this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, this resolution will do several things. I want Members to understand that this is not the only resolution we will be doing today. Later on today, when Members come back and get into town, they will be able to express themselves when we will have another resolution honoring Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut.  Mr. Speaker, this particular resolution establishes some very real principles. First of all, it authorizes the use of the Rotunda for a memorial service for Detective Gibson and Private First Class Chestnut. It also, for the first time that I know of, authorizes the placement of two plaques in honor of Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut in the general area where they lost their lives, commemorating those two spots in the Capitol.  We also want to obviously pay for their funeral expenses. This resolution allows us to do that. We also want to make sure that their surviving widows are taken care of and make sure that they do not have any concerns about their future and the future of their children, and, therefore, we authorize one year's annual salary to be paid to the widow of Detective Gibson and to the widow of Officer Chestnut. We also establish a Capitol Police Memorial Fund that will be used for whatever the needs may be of the families of Detective Gibson and Officer Chestnut.  Later on today, as I said, we will consider a concurrent resolution that honors the memory of these two officers, of these two fine, fine gentlemen. Some, probably cynically, are already asking why we are using the Capitol Rotunda to honor these two brave men. After all, police officers are slain in the line of duty all over the country; why should these two particular men receive special treatment? Is it simply because they died defending Members of Congress and their staff?  Besides their personal bravery, these men died defending the Capitol of the United States of America, the symbol of freedom across this world. They are the first Capitol Police officers to die in the line of duty since the Capitol Police Department was created 170 years ago. They died saving lives. They died doing their job. They died being professionals and representing a fine, fine law enforcement group of officers that protect this Capitol and everybody in it, whether they be tourists, Americans, people from other nations or Members of Congress and their staffs.  I just feel that it is absolutely fitting, and I greatly appreciate the leaders of both the House and Senate in agreeing to use the Rotunda to pay tribute to these two officers. By paying tribute to their sacrifice, we all pay tribute to the sacrifices of law enforcement officers all across this country. What more fitting place to pay tribute to law enforcement officers than in the Rotunda of the building that is the symbol of freedom across the world?  John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut were members of this Capitol Hill community. One of the most gratifying things that I know the families have received, as well as me and my staff, who have had a very difficult weekend, is all the calls from all across the country honoring these two wonderful men as heroes. They are leaving behind many grieving friends and associates here in this Capitol Hill community.  I saw J.J. Chestnut every night when I left this building. He was always standing there by the document door. He was always grinning, and he was always giving me, in a very warm, openhearted way, a hearty, hearty, sincere, ``Good night, Congressman. You take care of yourself.'' And every night I would respond with, ``J.J., you be careful.''  He was careful, but, unfortunately, not enough, and this shooter comes in and shoots him. But my enduring vision of J.J. will be of a professional officer who loved his job, loved his post, fought to keep his post, and he was dedicated to his duty in protecting the Nation's Capitol and everyone that was in it.  John Gibson was a member of my security detail, and, therefore, he was a member of my staff. But, as importantly, my wife and my daughter and I feel very strongly that he was a member of our family. John and I went everywhere together. We had many long talks about life, about family, about duty and about country.  John loved his detective badge. In fact, he would get in trouble for wearing it, but he wore it because he was so proud about the fact that he was a detective in the Capitol Police Corps, that he had made detective, that he was a man that believed in duty, and that he knew that it would be possible some day that he would have to throw his body in front of me or someone like me and my staff.                              {time}  1215  One never thinks that that is really going to happen, but it happened on Friday, and John did throw his body between my staff and a shooter, and he lost his life for it. The President said it so well, because it is in scripture, that ``No greater gift is there than the gift of laying down your life for another,'' and John gave the ultimate gift.  He loved his country, John did. He loved sports. John Gibson was a solid man. He was a patriot. He exemplified everything that was good about America.  Both John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut are also members of another community, and that is the Nation's community of police officers. As such, their sacrifice represents the sacrifices of thousands of police officers across the Nation who do their duty to serve and protect the public, sometimes under great abuse, sometimes under great disregard, and many times people take them for granted. It all comes together when an incident like this happens andwe realize how much we owe to police officers all across this country.  So I think by using the Rotunda to honor these fallen heroes we are honoring not only the specific acts of courage that have saved so many other Americans and we are not only honoring them because of the fact that this was their building and they were protecting it, we also honor them, all fallen law enforcement heroes who have died defending the American people from evil.  So my heart goes out to the families of John Gibson and J.J. Chestnut, and particularly those young kids that have lost a father. We have lost two wonderful heroes who have saved so many from harm. We have lost two heroes who were dedicated husbands and wonderful fathers, and I urge all my colleagues and the American people in general to pray for these families as they try to cope with this great loss.  Mr. Speaker, I will just add at the end, if people around this country want to donate to the memorial fund created by this resolution, they can send their contributions to the United States Capitol Police Memorial Fund, United States Capitol, Washington, D.C., 20515.  Let me also add, if the gentleman will further yield, something that really touched me just a while ago. One of the pages came up to me and handed me this, and I want to put it in the Record, from the pages that serve here in the United States House of Representatives.  Mr. Speaker, the Pages would like to say that ``We salute these two fallen heroes who gave their lives for ours. In the line of duty, these men stood strong and brave for their country. For that, we all owe a great debt of gratitude.  ``We are all aware of their courageous sacrifice, and we hold these officers deep in our hearts. God bless their families, and God bless America.''  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding, and I include for the Record the tribute by our Pages.          From the Pages of the U.S. House of Representatives       We salute these two fallen heroes who gave their lives for      ours. In the line of duty, these men stood strong and brave      for their country. For that, we all owe a great debt of      gratitude.       We are all aware of their courageous sacrifice, and we hold      these officers deep in our hearts. God bless their families,      and God bless America.
