President, I would like to take this moment to commemorate the life of Lorraine L. Dixon, Alderman from the 8th Ward in the City of Chicago.  Born on Father's Day, June 18, 1950, in the south side neighborhood of Bronzeville, she was the youngest of five children born to Edwin and Edra Godwin. Alderman Dixon grew up surrounded by friends and family including her four brothers Edward Jr., Eddie, Andrew and John. She was particularly close to her brothers Eddie and John who would do anything to protect and please their little sister including taking the blame for accidents. After attending Fuller Elementary School and South Shore High School, she graduated from Chicago State University in 1972 with a Bachelor ofScience Degree in Secondary Education and a minor in English Literature.  Alderman Dixon's career in the public service began soon thereafter. After graduation she became a member of the 8th Ward Young Democrats Organization and became the vice president of the organization in 1977. In that same year and again in 1978 she was elected Woman's Vice Chairman of the Cook County Young Democrats.  From these positions she went on to work for current Cook County Board President John Stroger during his 1980 congressional campaign, and thus began a strong alliance between these two public servants. President Stroger was a mentor to Alderman Dixon throughout her years of community involvement and work for her constituents. Her years of service with President Stroger were representative of the intense loyalty she had for her colleagues in public service.  Alderman Dixon next held positions with the Chicago Department of Human Services, the Chicago City Council Committee on Zoning and the Committee on Energy. She also served as an aide to Alderman Keith Caldwell, who represented the 8th Ward at the time.  Lorraine Dixon's career as an alderman began when she was appointed by Mayor Richard M. Daley to complete the term of the late Alderman Keith Caldwell in June 1990. Her commitment to the position was demonstrated by her scheduling of weekly Monday night meetings with constituents of the 8th Ward. Alderman Dixon won her first aldermanic election to represent the 8th Ward in 1991 and won overwhelming reelections in 1995 and 1999, demonstrating the support she inspired from her constituents. During her years as the standard bearer for the 8th Ward, she served as Chairman of the Human Relations Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on MBE/WBE and Affirmative Action Matters. In 1993 she was elected President Pro Tempore of the Chicago City Council, becoming the first woman in the history of the Chicago City Council to be so honored. Then in August 1994 she was elected as the first woman to serve as Chairman of the Committee on the Budget and Government Operations. From this powerful committee she was able to oversee taxpayer dollars used to support programs in the city that she loved. She served her ward, and the entire City of Chicago, with passion and grace.  Her dedication to the public was equaled only by her dedication to God and her unwavering faith gave her courage as she battled breast cancer. Alderman Dixon's faith gave her the strength to overcome the anguish of being diagnosed with this grave disease and to continue her work in the 8th Ward during the last days of her life. She worshiped at Christ Temple Cathedral and was active within the community of the 8th Ward, where she is remembered by many for her willingness to come to the aid of those in need. The constituents of the 8th Ward will not soon forget her kindness.  Alderman Dixon was a member of many community boards and professional organizations and from these activities she was able to hear and effectively respond to the issues and needs of her constituents in the 8th Ward. Her involvement touched many lives. Lorraine L. Dixon was a true leader and a true public servant. Her accomplishments in life leave a rich legacy to all who knew and respected her. She has left an extended family that includes her mother, Edra, her brothers Edward Jr. and Eddie, and countless nieces, nephews, cousins and close personal friends. I was honored to call her a friend and I will miss her warm smile, boundless energy and personal commitment to help those in need.                          ____________________
