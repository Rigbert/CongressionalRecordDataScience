Speaker, the gentleman makes an excellent point, but this is not without precedent. The gentleman came, I believe, in 1982. I was elected in a special election in 1981. The Republicans were effectively in control of the House of Representatives and took the rule away from us, and a 1,400-page bill, reconciliation bill, was put on the floor in June. It was still warm from the Xerox when they asked us to vote on it. So, there is precedent for doing this. It is business as usual from 1981 to today.
