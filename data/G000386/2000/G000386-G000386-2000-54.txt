 President, the tax relief bill we are about to pass contains many very popular tax cut measures that will be good for Americans and good for the country. One of the provisions included in the package is The Farm, Fisherman, and Ranch Risk Management Act--FFARRM.  This is a proactive measure that would give farmers a five-year window to manage their money. It would allow them to contribute up to 20% of the annual income to tax-deferred accounts, known as FFARRM accounts. The funds would be taxed as regular income upon withdrawal.  If the funds are not withdrawn five years after they were invested, they are taxed as income and subject to an additional 10% penalty. So, farmers will be able to put away savings in good years so they will have a little bit of a cushion in bad years.  Agriculture remains one of the most perilous ways to make a living. The income of a farm family depends, in large part, on factors outside their control. Weather can completely wipe out a farm family. At best, it can cause their income to fluctuate wildly. The uncertainty of International markets also threatens a farm family's income.  If European countries impose trade barriers on farm commodities, or if Asian countries devalue their currency, agricultural exports and the income of farmers will fall.  Today, farmers face one of their most severe crises with record low prices for grain and livestock. The only help for these farmers has been a reactionary policy of government intervention. While this aid is necessary to help farmers pull through the current crisis, it's merely a partial short-term solution.  Farmer Savings Accounts will help the farmer help himself. It's not a new government subsidy for agriculture and it will not create a new bureaucracy purporting to help farmers. It will simply provide farmers with a fighting chance to survive the down times and an opportunity to succeed when prices eventually increase.  Another important provision in this bill deals with farmers who want to income average but aren't able to because of the alternative minimum tax. A few years ago, Congress reinstated income averaging for farmers because we recognized that farmers' income fluctuated from year to year.  Unfortunately, many farmers are not able to make use of this benefit because they're subject to the alternative minimum tax. Our tax relief bill will fix this problem for tens of thousands of farmers.  There are many other farmer-friendly measures that I and others advocated in the Senate bill. Unfortunately, some of our House counterparts didn't agree with us. I believe that will change next year and I will certainly be working hard to pass these in the next Congress.  In the meantime, we have some very good and necessary pro-farmer proposals before us that can be passed this year.  I only hope the Clinton-Gore administration doesn't veto the family farmer by vetoing this bill.  Thank you Mr. President.                          ____________________
