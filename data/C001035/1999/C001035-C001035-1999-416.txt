President, on behalf of myself and my distinguished colleagues Senator Durbin and Senator Grassley, I rise today to introduce the Medicare Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1999. Both of these Senators have been leaders in the fight against Medicare fraud.  This bill will help solve an almost $13 billion problem. According to the HHS Inspector General, waste, fraud, abuse, and other improper payments drained about that much from the Medicare Trust Fund in fiscal year 1998. Fraud and abuse not only compromise the solvency of the Medicare program but also, in some cases, directly affect the quality of care delivered to the 38 million older and disabled Americans who depend upon this program. Although this legislation will not prevent all of the waste, fraud, and abuse that now plagues Medicare, it represents an important step toward a solution to a problem that threatens the financial integrity of this vital social program.  Unfortunately, there is no line item in the budget called ``Medicare Waste, Fraud and Abuse'' that we can simply cut to eliminate this insidious problem. It is a complicated, difficult challenge to plug the holes that make Medicare at high risk for fraud and abuse.  In May 1997, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, started an extensive investigation of the Medicare program. So far, my Subcommittee has held three hearings in an effort to expose fraud and abuse within Medicare.  As the Subcommittee's hearings revealed, we are now seeing a dangerous and growing problem with Medicare fraud. Career criminals and bogus providers with no background in health care are increasingly entering the system with the sole purpose of stealing hard-earned taxpayer dollars from the Medicare Trust Fund. Only tough deterrents can prevent these unscrupulous providers from entering the Medicare system. At the same time, however, we must be careful not to make entry into the Medicare program so difficult that the process deters legitimate health care providers. We owe it to the American public to strike this crucial balance.  During a Subcommittee hearing earlier last year, we heard testimony describing egregious examples of fraud committed by unscrupulous health care providers. For example, two physicians who submitted in excess of $690,000 in fraudulent Medicare claims listed nothing more than a Brooklyn laundromat as their office location. We were also told that over $6 million in Medicare funds were sent to durable medical equipment companies that provided no services; one of these companies even listed a fictitious address that would have placed the firm in the middle of a runway at the Miami International Airport.  While the number of unscrupulous providers in the Medicare program is very small relative to the number of honest providers, these criminals nevertheless are able to steal millions of dollars from Medicare, wreaking financial havoc on the program. This fraud contributes to the tremendous increase in health care expenditures and adversely affects the quality of health care given to our nation's elderly and disabled.  In response to the serious problems identified through my Subcommittee's investigation, Senator Durbin, Senator Grassley, and I are introducing legislation designed to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse by strengthening the Medicare enrollment process, expanding certain standards of participation, and reducing erroneous payments. Among other things, this legislation gives additional enforcement tools to the federal law enforcement agencies pursuing health care criminals.  One of the most important steps this bill takes is to prevent scam artists and criminals from securing the provider numbers that permit them to gain access to the Medicare system. Specifically, this bill requires background investigations to be conducted on all new providers to prevent career criminals from getting involved with Medicare in the first place. In addition, this bill requires site inspections of new durable medical equipment suppliers and community mental healthcenters prior to their being given a provider number. This will help close the system to those who apply for a provider number from a bogus or nonexistent location. Together, these provisions are designed to make it more difficult for unscrupulous individuals to obtain a Medicare provider number and begin submitting fraudulent claims.  This legislation also requires community mental health centers to meet applicable certification or licensing requirements in their state before they are issued a provider number, and requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish additional standards for such centers to participate in the Medicare system.  In September of last year, Health Care Financing Administration Administrator Nancy-Ann DeParle acknowledged the extensive fraud associated with community mental health centers as she announced a 10-point plan to curb abuses within this program. I applaud Administrator DeParle for taking a step in the right direction, but we can go further.  Our legislation requires each agency that bills Medicare on behalf of physicians or provider groups to register with HCFA and receive a unique registration number. Many billing companies receive a percentage of the claims they submit that are paid by Medicare. Unethical companies, therefore, have a financial incentive to inflate the cost or number of claims submitted. Because billing companies do not have a Medicare provider number, however, it is difficult for HCFA to sanction or exclude them from billing Medicare. Hence, there is little to deter unscrupulous billing companies from submitting inflated claims. This bill makes all companies accountable for their billings through a uniform registration system.  This legislation also provides that Medicare contractors should be held financially accountable for any amounts they improperly pay to excluded providers 60 or more days after being notified of the exclusion. There have been numerous instances in which a Medicare contractor has continued to pay a provider after HCFA had excluded the provider from participating in the program. As a result, excluded providers have sometimes continued to receive unauthorized payments due to the negligence of contractors.  Why should American taxpayers swallow the cost of improper payments when a contractor has been specifically told not to pay a particular provider and yet continues to do so? This bill would help deter such negligence. I realize, however, that this is a complex issue and that this accountability provision may require further refinement.  Under our legislation, providers also would be required to refund overpayments even if they filed for bankruptcy, if the overpayments were incurred through fraudulent means. This money would then be deposited into the Medicare Trust Fund. Some bad actors have used bankruptcy as a shield against repaying Medicare. Essentially, unscrupulous individuals steal literally hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Medicare program, hide or spend it quickly, and then file for bankruptcy protection when they are caught, leaving the Medicare Trust Fund in debt. With this bill, we intend to close this loophole.  Another provision of this legislation aims to halt trafficking in provider numbers. The bill makes it a felony to knowingly, purchase, sell, or distribute Medicare beneficiary or provider numbers with the intent to defraud. Our investigation revealed that there is a growing problem with unscrupulous providers using ``recruiters'' to fraudulently obtain Medicare beneficiary identification numbers, thereafter using these numbers to bill for services never delivered. This problem must be stopped.  Our legislation will also grant much needed statutory law enforcement authority to qualified special agents of the Department of Health and Human Service's Office of Inspector General. Even though one of their major responsibilities is to enforce federal criminal laws, these special agents have no statutory authority to carry firearms, make arrests, or execute search warrants. The office now operates under a temporary Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Justice.  This lack of full law enforcement authority jeopardizes the safety of HHS-OIG special agents and witnesses under their protection. As my Subcommittee's hearings have demonstrated, more and more career criminals are becoming involved in health care fraud; this increases the potential danger to the agents charged with investigating these crimes. It is time for Congress to spell out the law enforcement authorities of the HHS Office of Inspector General in a more permanent way.  I am very pleased that Senator Grassley, who has been a leader in the fight against Medicare fraud, waste, and abuse, has agreed to be an original cosponsor of our legislation. Senator Durbin and I have incorporated into our legislation a valuable proposal that Senator Grassley sponsored, namely requiring the use of Universal Product Numbers (``UPNs'') on claims forms for reimbursement under the Medicare program. Senator Grassley, and a bi-partisan coalition, introduced this concept as a freestanding bill, S.256, which I cosponsored earlier this year.  These provisions of our legislation would require that a UPN that uniquely identifies the item would be affixed by the manufacturer to medical equipment and supplies. The UPNs would be based on commercially-accepted identification standards, however, customized equipment would not be required to comply with this requirement. Senator Durbin and I believe that this proposal is complementary to our package of reforms and strengthens the legislation we are introducing today.  Mr. President, the bill we are introducing today represents our concrete commitment to improve the Medicare program by providing additional tools that are needed to combat the extensive waste, fraud, and abuse that plague our nation's most important health care program. The unscrupulous individuals who commit Medicare fraud drive legitimate providers out of business, cost taxpayers vast sums of money, deliver substandard services and equipment, and endanger our elderly by not providing needed services.  We must use common sense and cost-effective solutions to curtail the spreading infection of fraud that threatens the vitality of Medicare. Yet, we must do more. We have a serious responsibility to older Americans across the country and to the nation's taxpayers to protect the Medicare program. We urge our colleagues to join us in this bi-partisan effort to strengthen and improve the Medicare program.  Thank you, Mr. President, and I ask unanimous consent that the bill, a section-by-section analysis of the bill, and four letters endorsing the legislation be printed in the Record.

UNIVERSAL PRODUCT NUMBERS ON CLAIMS FORMS FOR                    REIMBURSEMENT UNDER THE MEDICARE PROGRAM.       (A) (a) Accommodation of UPNS on Medicare Claims Forms.--     Not later than February 1, 2001, all claims forms developed      or used by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for      reimbursement under the medicare program under title XVIII of      the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) shall      accommodate the use of universal product numbers for a UPN      covered item.       (b) Requirement for Payment of Claims.--Title XVIII of the      Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.) is amended by      adding at the end the following:                   ``use of universal product numbers       ``Sec. 1897. (a) In General.--No payment shall be made      under this title for any claim for reimbursement for any UPN      covered item unless the claim contains the universal product      number of the UPN covered item.       ``(b) Definitions.--In this section:       ``(1) UPN covered item.--       ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B),      the term `UPN covered item' means--       ``(i) a covered item as that term is defined in section      1834(a)(13);       ``(ii) an item described in paragraph (8) and (9) of      section 1861(s);       ``(iii) an item described in paragraph (5) of section 1861      (s); and       ``(iv) any other item for which payment is made under this      title that the Secretary determines to be appropriate.       ``(B) Exclusion.--The term `UPN covered item' does not      include a customized item for which payment is made under      this title.       ``(2) Universal product number.--The term `universal      product number' means a number that is--       ``(A) affixed by the manufacturer to each individual UPN      covered item that uniquely identifies the item at each      packaging level; and       ``(B) based on commercially acceptable identification      standards such as, but not limited to, standards established      by the Uniform Code Council-International Article Numbering      System or the Health Industry Business Communication      Council.''       (c) Development and Implementation of Procedures.--       (1) Information included in UPN.--The Secretary of Health      and Human Services, in consultation with manufacturers and      entities with appropriate expertise, shall determine the      relevant descriptive information appropriate for inclusion in      a universal product number for a UPN covered item.       (2) Review of procedure.--From the information obtained by      the use of universal product numbers on claims for      reimbursement under the medicare program, the Secretary of      Health and Human Services, in consultation with interested      parties, shall periodically review the UPN covered items      billed under the Health Care Financing Administration Common      Procedure Coding System and adjust such coding system to      ensure that functionally equivalent UPN covered items are      billed and reimbursed under the same codes.       (d) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (b)      shall apply to claims for reimbursement submitted on and      after February 1, 2002.       (B) Study and Reports to Congress.       (a) Study.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services      shall conduct a study on the results of the implementation of      the provisions in subsections (a) and (c) of section 2 and      the amendment to the Social Security Act in subsection (b) of      that section.       (b) Reports.--       (1) Progress report.--Not later than 6 months after the      date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and      Human Services shall submit a report to Congress that      contains a detailed description of the progress of the      matters studied pursuant to subsection (a).       (2) Implementation.--Not later than 18 months after the      date of enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter for 3      years, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall      submit a report to Congress that contains a detailed      description of the results of the study conducted pursuant to      subsection (a), together with the Secretary's recommendations      regarding the use of universal product numbers and the use of      data obtained from the use of such numbers.       (C) Defintions.       In this Act:       (1) UPN covered item.--The term `UPN covered item' has the      meaning given such term in section 1897(b)(1) of the Social      Security Act (as added by section 2(b)).       (2) Universal product number.--The term `universal product      number' has the meaning given such term in section 1897(b)(2)      of the Social Security Act (as added by section 2(b)).       (D) Authorization of Appropriations.       The are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be      necessary for the purpose of carrying out the provisions in      subsections (a) and (c) of section 2, section 3, and section      1897 of the Social Security Act (as added by section 2(b)).                                  ____   Medicare Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1999--Section-by-                            Section Summary       Sec. 1: Short Title: ``Medicare Fraud Prevention and      Enforcement Act of 1999''.       Sec. 2: Site Inspections and Background Checks       Requires the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) to      conduct a site inspection prior to issuing a provider number      for all new providers of durable medical equipment,      prosthetics, orthotics or supplies, community mental health      services, or any other provider group deemed necessary by the      Secretary.       Requires site inspections to include, at a minimum,      verification of compliance with all established standards of      enrollment relating to a particular provider type.       Requires background checks on all new providers prior to      issuing a provider number. the background check shall include      a criminal history background check. Grants the Secretary the      authority to substitute state licensing procedures for      background checks if it is determined that a State's      procedures have the same substantive requirements.       Requires the Attorney General to provide criminal      background information to the Secretary regarding individuals      applying for a Medicare provider number. The Secretary may      only use this information for determining eligibility for      participation in the Medicare program.       The Secretary may decline to issue a provider number if the      Secretary determines, after a background check, that the      applicant has a history of acts that the Secretary determines      would be detrimental to the best interests of the program or      its beneficiaries.       The Secretary shall report all decisions to refuse a      provider number as a result of a background check to the      Health Integrity Protection Database.       HCFA may use Medicare Integrity Program funds to cover the      costs of conducting the site visits and background      investigations.       A physician or hospital that provides durable medical      equipment, prosthetics, orthotics or supplies incident to an      office visit or emergency room visit is exempt from the site      visit requirement.       Explanation: Currently, site inspections and background      checks are random and typically only occur in certain areas      of the country and on certain types of providers. Mandating      site inspections and background checks would significantly      enhance the ability of HCFA to keep ``bad apples'' from      entering the program. Site inspections must do more than      simply verify that a business actually exists at a particular      location; they must ensure that the entity meets or exceeds      the established participation standards related to their      speciality.       Sec. 3: Registration of Billing Agencies       Requires agencies that bill Medicare on behalf of      physicians or provider groups to register with HCFA.       Requires HCFA to assign a unique registration number to      each billing agency.       Requires that every claim submitted by a billing agency to      Medicare for reimbursement include the agency's unique      registration number.       Allows the Secretary to exclude a billing agency from      participating in the Medicare program if it knowingly submits      a false or fraudulent claim.       Explanation: This provision would require HCFA to assign a      unique identifying number (similar to a provider number) to      each company which would then allow Medicare to sanction or      exclude these companies (and principal owners) from billing      Medicare. Federal law enforcement agencies have received      several allegations involving cases in which billing      companies that bill Medicare on behalf of providers submitted      fraudulent (upcoded/unbundled/fictitious) claims for payment.      Many billing companies receive a percentage of all claims      paid by Medicare; therefore, these companies have a financial      incentive to inflate the cost or number of claims submitted.      This occurs both with and without the knowledge of the      provider. Because these billing companies do not have a      Medicare provider number (they bill using the particular      physician's provider number), HCFA is currently unable to      sanction or exclude the companies from billing Medicare.       Sec. 4: Expand Access to the Health Integrity Protection      Database (HIPDB)       Allows any entity that bills Medicare to query the HIPDB      before hiring or initiating a contractual relationship with a      health care provider.       HIPDB is intended to provide a ``one stop shop'' data base      for public information on the imposition of health care      sanctions. Includes information such as health care-related      criminal convictions, civil judgments, exclusions, and      adverse license or certification actions.       Abuse of the information in the HIPDB is a federal felony.      Whoever knowingly uses information maintained in the database      for unauthorized purposes shall be imprisoned for not more      than 3 years or fined under title 18, United States Code,      or both.       Currently, the HIPDB is only available to government      investigators and health care plans.       Explanation: Expanding access to HIPDB for those entities      that bill Medicare will allow for better tracking and      accountability of individuals who have received an adverse      action; therefore, allowing the employer to make a more      informed hiring decision.       Sec. 5. Contractor Payments to Excluded Providers       Requires a Medicare contractor to reimburse the Secretary      for any amounts paid by HCFA for claims submitted by excluded      providers 60 days after the Secretary has provided notice of      the exclusion, unless the payment was made as a result of      incorrect information provided by the Secretary or the      individual or entity excluded from participation has      concealed or altered their identity.       Prevents an excluded provider from directly billing a      Medicare beneficiary.       Explanation: There have been numerous instances in which      Medicare contractors have continued to pay providers after      HCFA had excluded the provider from participating in the      program. As a result, excluded individuals and entities have      continued to receive Medicare payments due to the negligence      of contractor personnel. Instead of draining the Medicare      Trust Fund, Medicare contractors should be held financially      accountable for any amounts they improperly pay to excluded      providers 60 days after they have been notified of the      exclusion unless the payment was made as a result of      incorrect information by HHS or the excluded provider      intentionally concealed or altered its identity so     that the contractor could not have known the provider was      excluded. By making Medicare contractors liable for such      erroneous payments, they will be encouraged to exert greater      diligence when reviewing new provider applications and paying      claims.       Sec. 6. Community Mental Health Centers (CMHC)       CMHCs must meet applicable certification or licensing      requirements of the state in which they are located before      they are issued a provider number.       CMHCs cannot serve only Medicare patients.       CMHCs must meet additional standards of participation to be      established by the Secretary before they are issued a      provider number.       Explanation: This provision is designed to ensure that      fraudulent or fly-by-night companies are not allowed to      participate in the CMHC program. Recent subcommittee hearings      have highlighted the rampant fraud within the CMHC program.      CMHCs are paid by Medicare to provide partial hospitalization      services to patients that would otherwise have to be admitted      for inpatient psychiatric treatment. The program has grown      from about $30 million in 1993 to more than $350 million in      1997. Of the approximately 1,500 CMHCs nationwide, more than      250 of these centers are located in the State of Florida. On-     site visits to these facilities in Florida by HCFA personnel      revealed that many CMHCs did not meet the criteria for a      Medicare provider number, numerous patients did not meet      eligibility criteria, and many centers were using non-     licensed staff to furnish non-therapeutic services. In      essence, Medicare was paying for adult daycare, which is not      allowed.       Sec. 7: Bankruptcy Protection       Provides that any overpayment which is the result of      fraudulent activity is not dischargeable through the      bankruptcy process.       Provides that any civil monetary penalty or collection of      past-due obligations arising from breach of a scholarship and      loan contract are not dischargeable through the bankruptcy      process.       Explanation: Under current law, health care providers and      suppliers can use bankruptcy as a shield against recovery of      Medicare overpayments. A provider or supplier can assert that      any overpayment due to the Medicare program is discharged and      does not survive the bankruptcy proceeding. Under this      proposal, a provider or supplier would be liable to refund      overpayments even in bankruptcy if the provider obtained the      overpayment by fraudulent means. This money would eventually      be deposited into the Medicare Trust Fund. Additionally, any      civil monetary penalties levied or past-due obligations      arising from breach of a contract entered into pursuant to      the National Health Services Corp Scholarship Program, the      Physician Shortage Area Scholarship Program, or the Health      Education Assistance Loan Program, are not dischargable.       Sec. 8: Illegal Distribution of a Medicare or Medicaid      Provider Number or Beneficiary Identification Number       This provision makes it a felony for a person to knowingly,      intentionally, and with the intent to defraud, purchase,      sell, or distribute two or more Medicare or Medicaid      beneficiary identification numbers or provider numbers.       An individual convicted under this seciton shall be fined      under Title 18 of the United States Code or, whichever is      greater, an amount equal to the monetary loss to the      Government, or imprisoned for not more than 3 years, or both.       Explanation: There are no specific statutes that prohibit      the purchase, sale or distribution of a Medicare or Medicaid      provider number or beneficiary identification (billing)      number. This provision would address the growing trend of      unscrupulous providers using ``recruiters'' to fraudulently      obtain beneficiary identification numbers in order to bill      for bogus services. In addition, this provision will provide      penalties for individuals who ``steal'' legitimate provider      numbers and then submit fraudulent claims.       Sec. 9: Define Certain Crimes as Health Care Offenses       Defines criminal violations of the Medicare/Medicaid      statutes under section 1128B of the Social Security Act      (including the illegal sale or distribution of a Medicare      provider number or beneficiary identification number) as      ``federal health care offenses''.       Explanation: The Health Insurance Portability and      Accountability Act (HIPAA) established several enforcement      tools for deterring health care related crime, including      authority for injunctive relief, streamlined investigative      demand and subpoena procedures, and property forfeitures.      These remedies were made applicable to all ``Federal health      care offenses''. In identifying these criminal provisions,      however, some criminal provisions (i.e., kickbacks, false      certifications, and overcharging beneficiaries) were      inadvertently omitted. This provision defines the      aforementioned crimes as well as the offenses enumerated in      Section 8 (Illegal Distribution of a Medicare or Medicaid      beneficiary identification or provider number) of this bill      as Federal health care offenses.       Sec. 10: Authority of Inspector General for the Department      of Health and Human Services (HHS)       Gives criminal investigators within HHS' Office of      Inspector General the authority to:       Obtain and execute warrants;       Arrest without warrant if--a crime committed against the      United States is committed in their presence; or the      investigator reasonably believes a felony offense has been      committed.       Share in forfeited assets when pursuing a joint      investigation with another law enforcement agency.       The authority provided under this section shall be carried      out in accordance with guidelines approved by the Attorney      General.       Exercise those authorities necessary to carry out those      functions.       Explanation: The lack of full law enforcement authority      jeopardizes the safety of HHS-OIG agents and witnesses under      their protection. HHS-OIG agents currently exercise limited      law enforcement authority under a special deputation issued      by the Department of Justice through the U.S. Marshals      Office. This special deputation allows HHS-OIG agents to      exercise only limited law enforcement powers. All HHS-OIG      agents receive nine weeks of specialized training at the      Federal Law Enforcement Training Center. This is the same      training required by the United States Marshal Service,      United States Secret Service, and numerous other federal law      enforcement agencies. More and more career criminals are      becoming involved in health care fraud; this increases the      potential danger for those agents charged with investigating      these crimes. Both the Federal Law Enforcement Officers      Association as well as the Fraternal Order of Police support      this provision.       Sec. 11: Universal Product Numbers on Claims Forms for      Reimbursement       Requires that all Medicare claims forms accommodate a      Universal Product Number (UPN) no later than February 1,      2001, in order to receive reimbursement under the Medicare      program. The UPN requirement would apply to all durable      medical equipment and supplies, orthotics and prosthetics,      except for any customized items, billed under the Medicare      program.       The Secretary, in consultation with manufacturers and      entities with appropriate expertise, shall determine the      relevant descriptive information appropriate for inclusion in      a UPN.       The Secretary, in consultation with interested parties,      shall review information obtained by the use of UPNs on      claims forms and shall adjust the Common Procedure Coding      System (Medicare's current coding system) to ensure that      functionally equivalent UPN covered items are billed and      reimbursed under the same codes.       The UPN shall be based upon, but not limited to,      commercially acceptable identification standards established      by the Uniform Code Council-International Article Numbering      System or the Health Industry Business Communications      Council. The two Councils are not-for-profit organizations      that are currently used by the industry to establish and      issue bar codes, but should a similar entity develop, the      Secretary retains the discretion to use this as well.       No payments shall be made for claims forms not containing      UPNs submitted after February 1, 2002. This grace period      provides manufacturers that are not currently using UPNs time      to adjust to this new reimbursement system.       The Secretary shall report to Congress no later than 6      months after the date of enactment of this Act on the      progress of implementing UPNs on claims forms.       The Secretary shall report 18 months after the date of      enactment and annually thereafter for 3 years a detailed      description of the results of using the UPN for      reimbursement.       Explanation: Currently, HCFA does not know which products      it is purchasing. The only identification that is reflected      on the claims form is a billing code. The billing code for      each individual product can cover a wide range of items. For      example, GAO determined that one single Medicare code is used      for more than 200 different urological catheters and the      wholesale price range of the catheters varies from $1 to $18.      The use of a UPN would specifically identify the item and,      thus, reduce the likelihood of ``upcoding'' and combat fraud      and abuse in the Medicare program.                                  ____                                                   Health Industry                                     Distributors Association,                                 Alexandria, VA, February 8, 1999.

Created in      1902, HIDA represents over 700 companies with approximately      2500 locations nationwide. HIDA Members provide value-added      distribution services to virtually every hospital,      physician's office, nursing facility, clinic, and other      health care sites across the country, as well as to a growing      number of home care patients.       As a professional trade association, HIDA wholeheartedly      supports the rigorous enforcement of laws that ensure that      Medicare pays reasonable reimbursement amounts for medically      necessary items and services on behalf of Medicare      beneficiaries. HIDA has long advocated the responsible      administration of the Medicare program, and has repeatedly      identified specific abusive or illegal practices occurring in      the marketplace to assist the government's anti-fraud      efforts. HIDA has also assisted in the development of     additional targeted policies designed to aid the government      in the administration of the Medicare Program.       The Medicare Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Act is needed      to support the integrity of the Medicare Program. HIDA has      advocated more stringent standards for Medicare Part B      durable medical equipment, prosthetic, orthotic and supply      (DMEPOS) providers for a number of years. HIDA believes that      that the current Medicare DMEPOS supplier standards are      simply insufficient. Importantly, it is not just the de      minimus nature of the standards that is deficient, but also      the process Medicare uses to determine whether a provider      actually meets those standards. The site visits and increased      provider scrutiny included in your bill will address our      concerns.       By enacting this bill, Medicare will realize an immediate      benefit by ensuring that beneficiaries receive DMEPOS      services only from legitimate firms. Unscrupulous providers      will never have an opportunity to engage in abusive behavior      because they will never be able to bill the Medicare program      on behalf of beneficiaries. Consequently, these increased      standards and enforcement tools will significantly contribute      to reducing fraud and abuse in the Medicare program. For      these reasons HIDA strongly supports the Medicare Fraud      Prevention and Enforcement Act.       Again, thank you for introducing this important bill.      Please contact Ms. Erin H. Bush, HIDA's Associate Director of      Governmental Relations (703) 838-6110 if we can be of any      assistance.           Sincerely,                                             Cara C. Bachenheimer,     Vice President.                                  ____                               Pedorthic Footwear Association,                                     Columbia, MD, April 27, 1999.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Chair, Government Affairs Permanent Subcommittee          on Investigations, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The Pedorthic Footwear Association      (PFA) applauds your leadership and ongoing efforts to combat      fraud and abuse in the Medicare program. Your legislation,      ``The Medicare Fraud Prevention & Enforcement Act of 1999,''      is encouraging as a positive step forward to strengthen      current law and further protect both patients and providers.       PFA strongly shares your concern that only qualified      entities should be able to participate and provide health      care services to the nation's Medicare patient population. In      an effort to protect patients and provide HCFA with improved      control of its supplies, PFA greatly appreciates your      leadership and introduction of legislation to address these      important public policy issues.       The PFA, founded in 1958, is a not-for-profit organization      representing professionals in the field of pedorthics--the      design, manufacture, modification and fit of footwear,      including foot orthoses, to alleviate foot problems caused by      disease, overuse, congenital defect or injury. Pedorthists      are one of the four professionals recognized by Congress as      suppliers of the Therapeutic Shoes for Diabetics benefit.       Shoes are simply apparel for most people, but for      individuals with severe diabetic foot disease, shoes are a      part of their treatment plan. As such, PFA supports all      efforts to ensure that these patients are treated and      provided services by qualified individuals. Thank you for      your efforts to enhance HCFA's overall ability to accomplish      its mission of protecting the health of the patient and the      integrity of the Medicare program.           Sincerely,                                     Roger Marzano, C.P.O, C.Ped.,     President.                                  ____                                         The American Occupational                                    Therapy Association, Inc.,                                       Bethesda, MD, May 21, 1999.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Chair, Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Senate          Governmental Affairs Committee, Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Chairman: On behalf of the 60,000 occupational      therapists, occupational therapy assistants, and students who      are members of the American Occupational Therapy Association,      I want to express support for your Medicare Fraud Prevention      and Enforcement Act of 1999.       As providers whose services are covered under both Parts A      and B of the Medicare program, our members are well aware of      the importance of assuring that the program is well-run,      appropriately administered and monitored and that high      standards of quality are maintained, including assurance of      the use of qualified personnel.       Your efforts to require scrutiny of new providers can be an      important element of an overall improvement in the Medicare      program. We are also pleased that your bill recognizes the      validity of state licensure as a proxy for background checks.       Thank you for your efforts to promote quality, efficient      services under Medicare.           Sincerely,                                         Christina A. Metzler,                                                         Director,     Federal Affairs Department.                                  ____                                                         AARP,                                    Washington, DC, June 17, 1999.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Chair,     Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee, on          Investigations, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Madam Chair: AARP commends you and your colleague,      Sen. Richard Durbin, for introducing the ``Medicare Fraud      Prevention and Enforcement Act of 1999.'' Fraud and abuse      remain serious problems in the Medicare program that drain      valuable funds which could otherwise be used to help      strengthen the program for current and future beneficiaries.      Your legislation's focus on deterrence is constructive and      should significantly improve Medicare's ability to stop fraud      by unscrupulous providers before it happens.       The provisions in your bill to require site inspections and      background checks of certain providers, to require billing      agencies to register with the Health Care Financing      Administration, to allow entities billing Medicare to access      the Health Integrity Protection Database, and to make it a      felony to distribute provider or beneficiary identification      numbers are powerful tools that should make those intent on      defrauding the Medicare program think twice before attempting      to do so.       As we move to strengthen Medicare's ability to identify and      eliminate fraud, it is important to do this judiciously so      that the vast majority of providers--who are honest and      intent on following the rules--are not burdened. The      provisions of your bill appear reasonable and seem to reflect      this critical balance. While fraud and abuse cannot be      completely eliminated, it can be significantly reduced. Your      bill will help in this effort.       AARP is pleased to have the opportunity to comment on this      legislation and we appreciate the work you and Sen. Durbin      have done to reduce the effect of fraud and abuse on the      Medicare program and its beneficiaries. We look forward to      continuing to work with you and your colleagues in the House      and Senate on a bipartisan basis to find effective ways to      address this issue.       If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me      or have your staff contact Michele Kimball of the AARP      Federal Affairs Health Team at 202-434-3772.           Sincerely,                                                  Horace B. Deets,                                               Executive Director.
