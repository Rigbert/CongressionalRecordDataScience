President, I assume after that vote we would then go forward with the confirmation of a number of ambassadors. This is not just some small matter. It is now mid-September, and we have people who have children. The children do not know where they are going to be going to school, and they do not know whether they will move out of the house or in.  This is a very, very real situation for these families. We may have our efforts back and forth with each other, but the children ought to have some idea where they are going to be going to school, and what they are going to be doing.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.
