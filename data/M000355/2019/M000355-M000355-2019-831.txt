 President, now on a completely different matter, the Senate has accomplished a significant amount of business this week for the American people.  We have made a big dent in the backlog of President Trump's well-qualified nominees for Federal office. With respect to the judiciary, we have confirmed 13 impressive individuals to lifetime seats on the Federal bench. We have also ensured that two more key components of the President's foreign policy team will be on the job before the Senate adjourns for the August work period.  We confirmed the Deputy Secretary of Defense and a new ambassador tothe United Nations--both with bipartisan support, just as it should be for nominees who are so fully prepared for jobs that are so important.                          ____________________
