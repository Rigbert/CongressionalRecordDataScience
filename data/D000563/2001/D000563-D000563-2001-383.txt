If there were ever a moment in time when we should talk about energy, it is on the Friday before the Memorial Day weekend when families across America are making plans to head out for vacations or family reunions. It is the time when they get in the car or decide whether to take a long or short trip and become sensitized to the price of gasoline.  In Chicago and in the Midwest, for the second year running, we have seen devastating increases in the price of gasoline. It seems Easter is the kickoff for the oil companies to start raising the prices and then to catch all sorts of criticism from the public and elected officials and to bring them down after Memorial Day. In the meantime, families and businesses are being socked by the high prices.  The Senator from North Dakota puts his finger on it. This Congress has been unwilling to take a look at the energy industry. Certainly, we do not expect the White House, with the President and Vice President, with their background in this field, to do it. If this Congress will not do it, the consumers of America stand on the sidelines. They stand on the sidelines with their pockets empty because each time they go to the gasoline station, they are putting more and more money into their cars and trucks, into their vehicles to move their families.  I ask the Senator from North Dakota, if we have an opportunity for a joint conference with the House and Senate in a bipartisan approach to get into the energy pricing, how soon can we have that hearing, what kind of things can we look into, what kind of relief can we offer to businesses and families across America who are being nailed by the high energy prices?
