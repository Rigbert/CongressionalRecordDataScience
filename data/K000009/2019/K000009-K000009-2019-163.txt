Speaker, I rise today with affection in memoriam of Congressman Elijah E. Cummings of Baltimore, Maryland. He was a man for our time.  Today, I join a grateful nation in honoring the life, as well as, mourning the death of an exceptional American, a man of deep faith in his creator and fellow human beings. As I learned of Elijah's passing, I was deeply saddened by the loss of such a magnanimous human being, a devoted patriot, and a man whose heart for others never stopped beating. During my tenure in the House of Representatives, I had the honor to serve alongside Elijah for over 23 years, but it is the greatest privilege of all to call him my friend. All Members who served with him know this similar affinity. The word great is often overused, but Elijah was truly a great man. He served his district in a way that made clear to everyone his unshakable love for the City of Baltimore and its people. His love was enduring. His service and passion touched those of us serving in any capacity.  A graduate of Howard University in 1973, Elijah received his bachelor's in political science and served as the student government president. Following the completion of his undergraduate degree, he attended the University of Maryland where he studied law, which led to two-decades of legal practice in the private sector. Elijah also served as the Chief Judge on the Maryland Moot Court, where he aided law students in their studies on appellate casework.  Prior to winning his election to the House of Representatives in 1996, in 1982, at only 31 years old, Elijah became the youngest chairman of the Legislative Black Caucus in the Maryland House of Delegates. With not only an impressive 16 years to show for this service, he successfully climbed the ranks to become the first African American to serve as Speaker pro tem--one of the many groundbreaking milestones in his illustrious career. As a trailblazer, Elijah advocated for economic and racial justice, and human rights. He was constantly working to improve the condition of his community that had been devastated by the loss of over 30,000 steel jobs, which brought about great despair. Elijah persevered for his people and community using every opportunity to revitalize and to improve his hometown.  Joining the House of Representatives in 1996, Elijah became the Representative for the seventh district in Maryland, serving and dedicated to Baltimore and its suburbs. He was truly a crusader, as he tirelessly fought as an advocate against drug abuse, gun violence, and a visionary for home ownership for all and labor unions--issues that so deeply impact our nation and his district. Amid racial conflict in his home city, Elijah was able to stand above the fray in such a riot-torn landscape and bring peace and reason. As a man who lived by example, his mantra of standing up for one's beliefs was reflected through his years of diligent service and his grace under fire.  I can attest, during his medical challenge, which had been significant and prolonged, he never yielded. His dutiful work sustained the hope of his family and colleagues. History will attest his vision will have laid the foundation for a more honorable and respectful approach to governance of a free people.  May I extend my deepest condolences to his family, his devoted wife Maya, daughter Jennifer, and the people of greater Baltimore for sending a man of such substance and bearing to serve the people of the United States.  Elijah, the proud son of Baltimore, left his community, our nation, and this world a better place through his service. And for that, we shall remain eternally grateful. May God rest his soul peacefully and in full communion with the power of creation.                          ____________________
