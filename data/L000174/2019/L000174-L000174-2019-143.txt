I read an article about Sarducci's celebrating 25 years in Montpelier.  Marcelle and I have enjoyed eating at Sarducci's since it first opened and are thrilled with what Carol Paquette and Jeff Butterfield have done with the restaurant.  I remember when they first opened and how Dorothy Korshak, the original founder, wondered whether anybody would come in. I remember telling Dorothy that, if they keep providing food that good, people will show up.  My mother was born in Vermont, a first generation Italian-American. We always ate Italian food, both at my grandparents' home in South Ryegate, VT or at our home in Montpelier, VT. It feels like going home to go to Sarducci's. It is one of our favorite restaurants.  I ask unanimous consent that the article from thebridge entitled ``Sarducci's Celebrates 25 Years in Montpelier'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From thebrigde Jan. 23, 2019]              Sarducci's Celebrates 25 Years in Montelier                            (By Tim Simard)       On a recent sunny and chilly January afternoon, Sarducci's      Restaurant founder and co-owner Carol Paquette relaxed by a      front table and looked back on 25 years. Sitting alongside      head chef and new co-owner Jeff Butterfield, Paquette      marveled at surviving two-and-a-half decades in the      restaurant business--a momentous achievement. This past      weekend, the Montpelier institution quietly celebrated the      milestone birthday.       Paquette can remember Sarducci's first day quite clearly--     Jan. 19, 1994. It was a Wednesday.       ``We opened at 4 pm. It was freezing outside. Dorothy      Korshak [founder and former business partner] and I had no      idea who might or how many people might stop in. We really      hadn't done any advertising to let people know we were      opening,'' she said.       But people knew. Oh, they knew. Within the first hour of      business, it was clear that Montpelier was ready for      Sarducci's.       ``The doors opened and people just kept coming in. We      hadn't planned on so many that night, but by the end we had      served close to 200 people,'' Paquette said, still in awe of      that first night's success.       Paquette attributes Sarducci's early success to a lack of      restaurants in Montpelier at that time. She said locals were      ``desperate'' for a place where families could sit down in a      cozy atmosphere with the whole family and have an amazing,      authentic Italian dinner.       The signature wood-fired oven was also a unique feature for      a Montpelier restaurant. Paquette and Korshak--who started      their partnership as coworkers at Julio's--researched Italian      restaurants in Boston, New York, and Chicago and noted the      popularity of these ovens.       ``We saw the restaurants that had the wood-fired ovens were      becoming more and more popular,'' Paquette said.       Since those first days, Sarducci's has become a go-to      dining spot in the Capital City. In its 25 years, the      restaurant has renovated its space, added a deck overlooking      the Winooski River, and doubled its seating capacity, all      while keeping its menu remarkably consistent. Today,      Sarducci's enters a new chapter as it celebrates a quarter      century.       At end of 2018, Butterfield bought in to the business and      is now a co-owner alongside Paquette. Butterfield, an East      Montpelier native and graduate of the New England Culinary      Institute, has been with Sarducci's for nearly seven years.      His experience pre-Sarducci's included running kitchens in      tourist locales from Charleston, S.C. to Stowe.       ``When a sous chef position opened [in 2012], I jumped at      the chance. I was ready to move back home, and I fell in love      with this place on day one,'' Butterfield said.       Butterfield said that Sarducci's has a family atmosphere      amongst its employees that's unique to other places he's      worked. Paquette added that several employees have been with      the restaurant for years and even decades.       Butterfield was promoted to head chef in 2014; around the      same time Korshak decided to retire, leaving Paquette as sole      owner. But the demands of running one of the city's most      popular restaurants became challenging for one person.      Butterfield pitched himself to be Sarducci's next co-owner.      Paquette knew it would be the right fit.       ``He's so good at what he does, he's super smart, and his      ego doesn't get in the way. That last part is very      important,'' she said.       Sarducci's 25-year story is one of growth and consistency.      Customers know what they'll get each time they walk through      the doors. The pollo al marsala and salmone cucina remain the      most popular menu items, as they have since the first year.       ``Montpelier has changed a lot, but we're still here. We're      still serving great Italian food that's affordable, fresh,      and locally sourced,'' Butterfield said.                          ____________________
