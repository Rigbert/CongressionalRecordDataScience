 President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend and Phi Kappa Tau fraternity brother Ron Gist, as founder of Gist Piano Services, on the occasion of his success with his Louisville piano dealership.  After attending the University of Louisville, Ron started his piano dealership with only $1000 and two used pianos in 1971. Many years later, after persevering through a tornado in 1974, a devastating fire that nearly destroyed his business, and the hardship of an unfortunate economic downturn, Gist Piano Services has grown to become one of Louisville's most highly regarded piano dealerships, restorers, and consultants in the region.  As a natural salesman, Ron's success has led to profitable relationships with the Louisville Orchestra, Kentucky Center for the Arts, and Kentucky Fair & Exposition Center. Also, Ron is one of few in the country selected for the honor to represent Steinway pianos. Ron has also provided piano services to other prestigious performance venues and for popular entertainers like James Taylor and Carol King.  Ron should not only be congratulated for his success with Gist Piano Services, but he should be recognized for his service to the community. He has dedicated himself to making a difference in people's lives through music. By creating more avenues for young people to express themselves, like through playing the piano, children can learn how to imagine, create, and organize the power of music. These skills can later be used as key tools to succeed in the future as they enter adulthood. Thank you, Ron, for ensuring a better future for this state as the younger generations are better equipped to lead Kentucky.  Your hard work continues to display an unswerving commitment to the people of Kentucky and possesses the respect and gratitude of many in the community. The significant work which you and your wife Amanda have accomplished is appreciated by myself and the many others whose lives you have touched throughout your career.  Ron, thank you and best wishes for many more years of success. Know that your efforts to better the lives of those in the region will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues in the United States Senate, thank you for giving so much of yourself for so many others in Louisville, the state of Kentucky, and the entire music industry.                          ____________________
