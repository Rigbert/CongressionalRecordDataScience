 President, what I assume my good friend, the majority leader, is talking about is that there are three filibusterable motions prior to going to conference. What he is suggesting here is, in fact, the case, which is that rather than simply going to conference without any discussion of what might come out of conference, the matter could be discussed in some detail before we go to conference. I know that is what my good friend, the majority leader, was talking about.  Our concern, of course, was that Senator Conrad said, right here on the floor of the Senate tonight--I won't read it word for word, but these are direct quotes from the floor of the Senate tonight--that was the game plan, to simply put the tax component, which was defeated earlier today, back in the measure. That created a considerable amount of angst on this side of the aisle for obvious reasons. There was substantial opposition to this massive tax increase which would have been added to the bill.  So we will have a lengthy discussion before going to conference. Let me just say, as one of the States that does not find much to applaud in the bill in any event, there are ample reasons for voting against cloture. I certainly am going to vote against cloture and would hope that a number of our colleagues, sufficient to deny cloture, would have a similar vote.
