Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment. I appreciate the work the gentleman from Virginia and his staff put into crafting an amendment that the committee could support. Any program to help promote economic development in an area so devastated as the Appalachia is worthy of our support, so I urge my colleagues to adopt this amendment.
