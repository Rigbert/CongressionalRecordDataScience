  I wonder, why in God's name would the French Government agree to come up with money for Poland to allow them to buy an American jet instead of a French jet? Why would they possibly do that? And does this not give a veto, a veto on the part of other NATO nations, over American foreign military sales? Because unless they come up with 75 percent of what any subsidy would be, why would they possibly do that?  Is it not true--the Senator is on the Armed Services Committee--is it not true that one of the core debates in NATO beyond burdensharing has been who gets to sell NATO the equipment, whether they fly Mirages--whether NATO planes are Mirages or whether they are American made aircraft? Every other European country in NATO has been saying, ``You Americans get too much of an advantage.'' Every time we talk about burdensharing, don't they come back and say, ``Yes, but you don't get it; you get to make all that money and get all those jobs because you are supplying the equipment that all the NATO uses''?  So why in the Lord's name would we give a veto power over the ability of American manufacturers and American employees to keep their jobs to the French and the Germans and the Brits?
