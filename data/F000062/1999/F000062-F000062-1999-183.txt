 President, I thank the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator Bennett, and commend him for the fair and responsible bill that has been put together. This is my first year as the ranking member of the Legislative Branch Subcommittee, and I have found Senator Bennett to be very open and willing to discuss issues. His leadership on our subcommittee is carried out in the best bipartisan spirit.
