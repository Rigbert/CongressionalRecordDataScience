Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 4293, the Irish Peace Process Cultural and Training Program Act of 1998, provides for a new nonimmigrant visa program to assist the Irish peace process.  The author of the bill, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh) has tirelessly supported the Irish peace process. In support of the peace process, he has worked with numerous international organizations and visited Northern Ireland three times in the last year. H.R. 4293 is the result of his dedication on behalf of a cause in which he strongly believes. He is to be commended for his diligence and hard work in generating broad bipartisan support for H.R. 4293 and moving it to the House floor.  The bill sets up a 3-year program with 4,000 visas available each year. The visas are reserved for qualified applicants age 35 or under and their spouses and children. The visas are good for 3 years, and the bill requires the INS to monitor and report on any visa overstays so that the purpose of the program is met and the integrity of the United States' immigration system is maintained.  Finally, the new visas are offset against the available number of low-skilled employment visas from another nonimmigrant category, so that the overall number of available visas remains constant.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4293.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
