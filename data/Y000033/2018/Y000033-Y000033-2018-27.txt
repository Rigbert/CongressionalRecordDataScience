Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Hunter and Ranking Member Garamendi and, of course, Peter DeFazio.  This is a good piece of legislation. I had a House bill similar in fact, too. This came over from the Senate side, but I am not really interested in whose bill it is but, more likely, getting things done. So this is a good bill.  And debris is what I am interested in as one of our biggest issues; it has been well explained by both speakers prior to me. It is getting bigger, like I say. What is it? Tenfold more. And the tonnage is already there.  We have to look at preventing the debris, but also what do we do once it is in the ocean. I have some ideas. And, hopefully, later on, we can explore those ideas, how we will recover and utilize that debris, because it does harm our maritime lives, and it makes the ocean really a garbage dump, and we don't want that.  So this is a good piece of legislation. I thank each person that has been involved in it, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''
