 I urge Secretary of State Rice to encourage regional neighbors and allies to redouble their efforts to support freedom in Burma when she attends the 12th Association of Southeast Asian Nations regional forum, and post-ministerial meetings in Laos.  Happy birthday, Suu Kyi. You continue to be in our thoughts and prayers.                               Exhibit 1     Statement in Support of Aung San Suu Kyi and Freedom in Burma       I want to extend my warm greetings to those attending this      important ceremony and most of all to offer my heartfelt      support to Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. It is      a tragedy that she could not be celebrating her birthday      among her family, friends and the Burmese people. Her      continued jailing is a powerful symbol of the strength of      Burma's democracy movement and the weakness of those trying      to block this country's path to freedom.       There are those who try to argue that democracy and      individual rights are Western ideals. How wrong they are. In      Mongolia, our constitution guarantees the right to life,      religious tolerance, the right to own property, the right to      a free press and free expression, and for the public to bring      grievances before their democratically elected      representatives. These are not Western ideals, these are      rights that each of us inherit at birth from our Supreme      Creator.       Today, Burma is ruled by a military regime that inflicts      death, terror and fear on the people in their struggle to      maintain power. History as written by the Czechs, Poles,      Hungarians, Serbs, Georgians, Ukrainians, Romanians,      Indonesians, we Mongolians and many others has proven that      freedom in the face of tyranny will triumph. Burma's generals      should take this history to heart.       Friends, it is up to each of us living in free societies to      reach out and help those living under oppression to find      their freedom. I can assure the Burmese people of one thing:      No dictatorship, no military regime, no authoritarian      government can stand against the collective will of a people      determined to be tree.       Tonight, as darkness settles across Mongolia, I will light      a candle and place it in the front window of my residence as      a symbol of hope and support for the Burmese people and Aung      San Suu Kyi--Prime Minister Elbegdorj Tskahiagiin.                                  ____Statement by President Mikheil Saakashvili in Commemoration of Aung San                      Suu Kyi and Democracy in Burma       On behalf of the Georgian people I want to extend our      collective greetings to the Senators, Congressmen, and      freedom activists gathered here in support of Nobel Peace      Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Her continued arrest by      Burma's military junta is an outrage, her courage in the face      of terror and intimidation serves as an inspiration to those      throughout the world who cherish freedom and democracy.       In 1990 the Burmese people voted overwhelmingly in      parliamentary elections for Aung San Suu Kyi and her National      League for Democracy (NLD) to lead them into a new era based      on democratic governance. The junta has refused to recognize      the results of this election. Each day they must wage war on      the Burmese people, using murder, terror and intimidation, to      keep their hold on power. This is a war they are destined to      lose.       We in Georgia understand first-hand what it is like to live      under tyranny and the sacrifices necessary to gain liberty.      Following     the collapse of Soviet rule, Georgians embraced democracy and      set about building a new society dedicated to human rights      and the rule of law. When our democracy was hijacked by      corruption, the Georgian people went to the streets and took      it back in what is now known as the Rose Revolution. Today,      individual freedoms are guaranteed, religious and ethnic      groups celebrated, and we are working out at the peace table      differences that once threatened our territorial integrity. I      am proud to say that democracy is alive and well in Georgia,      but our work is far from finished.       It is up to those who are free to join the fight of the      oppressed. I know that the winds of freedom that have blown      across Georgia, touched off an Orange Revolution in Ukraine,      spawned a Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan, and shook the      cedars of Lebanon will someday soon reach Burma. To the      millions of Burmese who are imprisoned with Aung San Suu Kyi      in their own country, I say this: Doi Yea (Our Cause)!      Because your cause is our cause. Wherever freedom-loving      people rise up to carry on the legacy of the Rose Revolution,      the spirit and support of the Georgian people stand with you.                          ____________________
