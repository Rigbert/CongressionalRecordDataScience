Speaker, I rise today to recognize Curt Haensel, Senior Counsel of the Office of the Legislative Counsel of the U.S. House of Representatives.  For the past 30 years, Curt has served as Legislative Counsel to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In that time, Curt has worked to assist the Committee under eight different Committee Chairmen, half a dozen Ranking Members, and hundreds of our Committee colleagues. He formally began working with the Committee in 1989 and one of the first bills he worked on was H.R. 598, which banned smoking on commercial airlines. At the Committee markup, Curt drafted dozens of amendments as the smokers and their advocates worked to fill the amendment tree, as they tried to kill the bill by endless amendment. The back row of the dais filled with cigarette smoke as the Committee slowly worked its will and ultimately banned smoking on airlines.  After this baptism by fire, Curt went on to work on every single surface transportation, aviation, water resources, and environmental law that this Committee has enacted. He took our ideas, and working with our staffs, used his gifted legislative craftsmanship to shape our transportation future. ISTEA, TEA 21, SAFETEA-LU, and the FAST Act; Federal Aviation Administration Reauthorization Acts; WRDA after WRDA; and dozens of other Acts all bear his stamp.  One of Curt's great achievements was his work, in the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, on the Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), which enhanced aviation and surface transportation security and created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). After months of negotiation and as the Thanksgiving break approached, House and Senate Committee staffs and House Legislative Counsel spent 20-hour days drafting the agreement. The Committee Chairmen and Ranking Members finally resolved the remaining critical issues on a Thursday afternoon. House and Senate Leaders wanted the agreement passed the following day, Friday, before the House and Senate adjourned for Thanksgiving. As Committee staffs and Legislative Counsels Curt Haensel and Dave Mendelsohn finished drafting the conference agreement around 4:30 a.m., the Office of Legislative Counsel computers failed and the computer files of the agreement were completely lost. The Committees faced the prospect that Congress may not be able to pass the legislation before the Thanksgiving break There was a genuine fear that, over the break, the hard-fought agreement could fall apart. Instead, Curt and his colleagues, after a walk around the block to clear their heads, recreated the text from memory and, later that day, both the House and Senate passed the agreement. Two days later, President George W. Bush signed the bill into law and the U.S. Department of Transportation began immediately implementing it to make our country safer. This little-known story is but one example of Curt's contributions to the House of Representatives and the American people.  Curt will continue to serve in his new role. He is joining the Office of Legislative Counsel of the U.S. Department of Defense (DOD), where he will help develop DOD's request for the National Defense Authorization Act each year. I am hopeful that this new opportunity provides Curt more time to spend with his wife, Meg, and their two kids, Ada and Peter, and hopefully watching his beloved Wisconsin Badgers and spending longer vacations on Lake Michigan's shores.  The Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will truly miss his expertise, wise counsel, and friendship. I join all of my colleagues on the Committee in wishing Curt all the best in his new endeavor.                          ____________________
