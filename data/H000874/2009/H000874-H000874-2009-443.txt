 There will be a joint session tomorrow. We will meet for the counting and for the report of the electoral college votes of the November 4 election.  There will be votes on Friday, and I will be trying to get you additional information on the calendar for Friday. Clearly there will be at least two bills on the floor--there may be others--the Pay Equity bill that already passed the House last year, and the so-called Ledbetter bill are two items that have been currently already noticed, but there may be other items that we're working in conjunction with the minority on whether or not we can move those forward.  But I wanted to let Members know that there would be no further votes today that we contemplate no votes tomorrow. But there will be votes on Friday.                          ____________________
