 President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported amendment be withdrawn; that the Cardin amendment which is at the desk be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; and that the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate.
