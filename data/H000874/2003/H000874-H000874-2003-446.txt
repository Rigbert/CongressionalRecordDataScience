Speaker, I take this time for the purpose of inquiring of the schedule of the distinguished majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), and I yield to the majority leader.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Monday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices by the end of the week. Any votes called on these bills will be rolled until 6:30 p.m. on Monday.  On Tuesday, we expect to consider several additional bills under suspension of the rules, including legislation that will provide relief from student loan payments to our men and women currently serving in the Middle East. We would also hope to go to conference on the 2004 budget resolution.  For Wednesday and the balance of the week, we have several measures that we will consider under a rule. Those include H.R. 522, a bill to reauthorize the Federal Deposit Insurance Program; H.R. 735, which would alter the method used to calculate Postal Service contributions to the Federal Employee Pension System; and H.R. 743, the Social Security Protection Act.  Finally, next week, we hope to be considering the Fiscal Year 2003 War Supplemental that was requested by the President earlier this week. I believe that the Committee on Appropriations has tentatively scheduled a markup of this legislation for Tuesday.  Now, Members should be aware, while I remain hopeful that we could consider this legislation on the floor on Thursday, I know that this schedule would disrupt the traditional 3-day layover practice by the Committee on Appropriations, but if the supplemental is not available for floor consideration on Thursday, Members should be advised we would be in session next Friday to consider this very important bill.  I thank the gentleman for yielding. I would be happy to answer any questions.
