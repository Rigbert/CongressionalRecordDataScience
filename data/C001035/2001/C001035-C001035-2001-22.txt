President, I commend the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, and the Senator from Ohio, Mr. DeWine, for today's passage of the Better Pharmaceuticals for Children Act. I am very pleased to be a cosponsor of this reauthorization. The American Academy of Pediatricians said it best. They saluted this law which we are now extending as being the single most important policy development to improve children's health that this body has ever taken. I am delighted to be a cosponsor of this important legislation.  I believe it will help facilitate breakthroughs in pharmaceutical treatments of children by ensuring proper testing and dosage. I commend the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Ohio for their excellent leadership.  (The remarks of Ms. Collins pertaining to the introduction of S. 1570 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')
