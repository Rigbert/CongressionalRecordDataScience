 President, it is a rare day when we see the Vice President presiding. We welcome him here today. We look forward to welcoming him back later in the week. I know Members will have plenty to say about his life and his legacy later in the week, but today the Senate would like to specifically acknowledge his efforts to help Americans struggling with cancer.  He has known the cruel toll this disease can take, but he hasn't let it defeat him. He has chosen to fight back. He has taken a leading role, and the Senate will soon pass the 21st Century Cures Act as a testament to his tremendous effort.  I think it is fitting to dedicate this bill's critical cancer initiatives in honor of someone who would be proud of the Presiding Officer today, and that is his son Beau. In just a moment, that is exactly what the Senate will do--renaming the NIH's cancer initiatives in this bill after Beau Biden.
