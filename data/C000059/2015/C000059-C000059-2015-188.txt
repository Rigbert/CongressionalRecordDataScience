Chairman, in closing, the plus up in the BLM account was primarily to help resolve the issue in 11 States involving the sage-grouse, which is close to a listing, and we have a plus up in the Fish and Wildlife Service accounts to recognize a real problem that hits 11 Western States.  We do not underestimate the problems in the West as they involve the drought, and we are going to continue to work on that. Again, I would oppose this based upon the offset.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
