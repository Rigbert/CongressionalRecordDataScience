President, Vermont is fortunate that it still has at least one major radio station that has not forgotten its connection to the community. This station is WDEV from the town of Waterbury. It is only a few miles from where I was born and raised and I have known the Squire family who owns the station throughout my life. It is presently owned and run by Ken Squire, who carries on the family tradition of representing Vermont first and foremost. Part of that tradition has been the long running ``Wake Up Vermont'' program I heard each morning with the great team of ``Michael and Michaels.'' The program was done by Michael Carey and Eric Michaels and was one of the finest radio programs in Vermont. Eric Michaels has a great ability as an interviewer on even the most complex of subjects, and Michael Carey added a sense of continuity and comfort to the program. Between the two of them one had an enjoyable way to start the day.  I was saddened, as were most Vermonters, to hear that Michael Carey is retiring. I have known Mike for years and always enjoyed meeting with him, either at the studio in Waterbury or over the phone when I would be on their program from Washington, D.C. Eric Michaels said he will be devastated by the loss of his radio partner and I can well imagine he is, but I am thankful that Eric will remain.  I just wanted to take this opportunity to say how much Michael Carey has meant to Vermonters and how his sacrifice in getting up in the wee hours of the morning made it possible for rest of us to face the day.  I want to wish my Washington County neighbor the very best, and to thank him for the years of pleasure he has given all of us in central Vermont, and I ask that an article about this radio legend by Robin Palmer in the Times Argus be printed in the Record.  The article follows:                 [From the Times Argus, Dec. 30, 2000]                      Vermont Radio Legend Retires                           (By Robin Palmer)       Waterbury.--A radio personality whose reliability co-     workers say was unmatched, ended a nearly 40-year career      today with a final ``Wake Up, Vermont'' program on WDEV.       Michael Carey, 53, is retiring because of health reasons      and, despite a last show dedicated to Carey and his many      attributes, it was a sad day for him and for central Vermont      radio.       ``It's a retirement that's been forced upon me and not one      that I'm looking forward to. I loved the profession and      that's what makes it doubly hard,'' said Carey, who shirked      at the attention surrounding him, calling his ``just a      profession.''       Carey's profession began at an early age, and one he said      he never expected to have.       At age 13, from his parents' apartment on Elm Street in      Waterbury, Carey had an illegal radio station. He played      records and read the weather, until a WDEV employee, Norman      James, heard Carey's pirate station and thought he'd put the      illegal endeavor to some good use, Carey said.       James got Carey a job answering phones for a WDEV Saturday      night request program called ``The Green Mountain Ballroom.''       ``Norm James got my foot in the door,'' said Carey, whose      name was already familiar to those at the Waterbury radio      station.       Carey's late parents, guitarist Morton ``Smokey'' Carey and      singer Lois Carey, used to perform each morning on WDEV, said      radio station owner Ken Squier.       Carey himself was later well known as the drummer in the      popular ``Carey Brothers Band'' that entertained throughout      the area in the 1970s.       In 1965, the radio pirate turned student worker was hired      as a full-time announcer at WDEV by legendary Vermont radio      personality and former ``Wake Up, Vermont'' host Rusty      Parker, who died on the air in 1982 while reading the news.       Since his start in the 60s, Carey said, ``I've done every      shift here at the radio station except a Sunday night      shift.''       During that time, ``there have been memories both very good      and very bad ones,'' Carey said, listing Parker's death and      the death of ``Cousin'' Harold Grout as two of the worst.       Two years after Parker's death, in 1984, Carey was promoted      to sign-on the station and host the morning program,      including ``Once Around the Clock'' from 5 to 6 a.m. and      ``The Morning News Service'' from 7 to 8 a.m.       When Grout died, Carey became the voice of the long-running      ``Trading Post'' program. And in April 1994, Carey was teamed      with radio group Vice President and General Manager Eric      Michaels for a 6 to 9 a.m. morning news program that      quickly became know as ``Wake Up, Vermont with Michael and      Michaels.''       ``From the first day we were in the studio together we felt      like we had worked with each other for a long time,'' said      Michaels. ``He can read me like a book.       ``So I'm devastated (that Carey's retiring), if you want to      put it in a single word. It's like getting a divorce,''      Michaels said.       Michaels praised Carey as one of the most competent      broadcasters he's ever met. Carey can technically run a show      while not missing a beat as an announcer.       ``He's an absolutely wonderful news reader,'' said Michaels      of his co-host.       Carey was rarely flustered.       ``Doesn't matter if it was a snowstorm and floods, he could      always rise to the occasion. Squier said, ``That is his      strength.''       Bad weather and flooding once closed the Waterbury station      and after a 20-minute delay, Michael and Michaels went on-air      at a nearby studio that was so cold their lips stuck to the      microphones. Carey was unfazed, said Michaels.       And one stormy day, it took Michaels over two hours to      drive from Barre to Waterbury.       ``I called the whole program in by phone,'' said Michaels,      who all the while was guided by reliable Carey, sitting      comfortably at the station and casually chatting with      Michaels over the phone.       With Carey's retirement, Michaels will continue on with      ``Wake Up, Vermont.'' The ``Michael and Michaels'' portion of      the name will be dropped, and another WDEV radio announcer      will fill in for Carey while the radio station searches for a      replacement.       ``It's been the most reluctant job search that I've ever      had to do,'' Michaels said.       While the job search will stretch beyond Vermont's borders,      Squier said he is committed to keeping the morning broadcast      a ``Vermont sound.''       And Carey is invited back anytime he feels up to it, Squier      said.''We were terribly sorry to lose him,'' said Squier.       ``I think all of central Vermont will miss him,'' Squier      said. ``He was a steady hand for listeners in the morning.''       Carey said he may come back at some point and do part-time      work but, for now, that's not possible.       The Duxbury resident and father of three who for decades      has awoken at 3 a.m., said he will be ``trying to get back to      a normal life.       ``Just some R and R, rest and relaxation, getting on the      computer and trying to do some things. Just keeping active      and doing stuff,'' said Carey of his plans.                          ____________________
