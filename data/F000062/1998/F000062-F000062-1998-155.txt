 Brownback, Mr. Dodd, and Ms. Landrieu) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:                            S. Con. Res. 97       Whereas the legacy of the war in Afghanistan has had a      devastating impact on the civilian population, and a      particularly negative impact on the rights and security of      women and girls;       Whereas the current environment is one in which the rights      of women and girls are routinely violated, leading the      Department of State in its 1997 Country Report on Human      Rights, released January 30, 1998, to conclude that women are      beaten for violating increasingly restrictive Taliban dress      codes, which require women to be covered from head to toe,      women are strictly prohibited from working outside the home,      women and girls are denied the right to an education, women      are forbidden from appearing outside the home unless      accompanied by a male family member, and beatings and death      result from a failure to observe these restrictions;       Whereas the Secretary of State stated, in November 1997 at      the Nasir Bagh Refugee Camp in Pakistan, that if a society is      to move forward, women and girls must have access to schools      and health care, be able to participate in the economy, and      be protected from physical exploitation and abuse;       Whereas Afghanistan recognizes international human rights      conventions such as the Convention on the Prevention and      Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, the International      Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Covenant on the      Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Elimination of All      Forms of Discrimination Against Women, and the International      Covenant on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, which      espouses respect for basic human rights of all individuals      without regard to race, religion, ethnicity, or gender;       Whereas the use of rape as an instrument of war is      considered a grave breach of the Geneva Convention and a      crime against humanity;       Whereas people who commit grave breaches of the Geneva      Convention are to be apprehended and subject to trial;       Whereas there is significant credible evidence that warring      parties, factions, and powers in Afghanistan are responsible      for numerous human rights violations, including the      systematic rape of women and girls;       Whereas in recent years Afghan maternal mortality rates      have increased dramatically, and the level of women's health      care has declined significantly;       Whereas there has been a marked upswing in human rights      violations against women and girls since the Taliban      coalition seized Kabul in 1996, including Taliban edicts      denying women and girls the right to an education,      employment, access to adequate health care, and direct access      to humanitarian aid; and       Whereas peace and security in Afghanistan are conducive to      the full restoration of all human rights and fundamental      freedom, the voluntary repatriation of refugees to their      homeland in safety and dignity, the clearance of mine fields,      and the reconstruction and rehabilitation of Afghanistan:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That Congress--       (1) deplores the continued human rights violations by all      parties, factions, and powers in Afghanistan;       (2) condemns targeted discrimination against women and      girls and expresses deep concern regarding the prohibitions      on employment and education;       (3) strongly condemns the use of rape or other forms of      systematic gender discrimination by any party, faction, or      power in Afghanistan as an instrument of war;       (4) calls on all parties, factions, and powers in      Afghanistan to respect international norms and standards of      human rights;       (5) calls on all Afghan parties to bring an end without      delay to--       (A) discrimination on the basis of gender; and       (B) deprivation of human rights of women;       (6) calls on all Afghan parties in particular to take      measures to ensure--       (A) the effective participation of women in civil,      economic, political, and social life throughout the country;       (B) respect for the right of women to work;       (C) the right of women and girls to an education without      discrimination, reopening schools to women and girls at all      levels of education;       (D) respect for the right of women to physical security;       (E) those responsible for physical attacks on women are      brought to justice;       (F) respect for freedom of movement of women and their      effective access to health care; and       (G) equal access of women to health facilities;       (7) supports the work of nongovernmental organizations      advocating respect for human rights in Afghanistan and an      improvement in the status of women and their access to      humanitarian and development assistance and programs;       (8) calls on the international community to provide, on a      nondiscriminatory basis, adequate humanitarian assistance to      the people of Afghanistan and Afghan refugees in neighboring      countries pending their voluntary repatriation, and requests      all parties in Afghanistan to lift the restrictions imposed      on international aid and to cease any action which may      prevent or impede the delivery of humanitarian assistance;       (9) welcomes the appointment of Ambassador Lakhbar Brahimi      as special envoy of the United Nations Secretary General for      Afghanistan, and encourages United Nations efforts to produce      a durable peace in Afghanistan consistent with the goal of a      broad-based national government respectful of human rights;      and       (10) calls on all warring parties, factions, and powers to      participate with Ambassador Brahimi in an intra-Afghan      dialogue regarding the peace process.     SEC. 2. ADDITIONAL ACTION BY PRESIDENT.       It is the sense of Congress that the President and      Secretary of State should--       (1) work with the United Nations High Commissioner for      Refugees to--       (A) guarantee the safety of, and provide development      assistance for, Afghan women's groups in Pakistan and      Afghanistan;       (B) increase support for refugee programs in Pakistan      providing assistance to Afghan women and children with an      emphasis on health, education, and income-generating      programs; and       (C) explore options for the resettlement in western      countries of those Afghan women, particularly war widows and      their families, who are under threat or who fear for their      safety or the safety of their families;       (2) establish an Afghanistan Women's Initiative, based on      the successful model of the Bosnian Women's Initiative and      the Rwandan Women's Initiative, that is targeted at Afghan      women's groups, in order to--       (A) assist Afghan women in Pakistan and Afghanistan in      local capacity building;       (B) provide humanitarian and development services to the      women and the families most in need; and       (C) promote women's economic security;       (3) make a policy determination that--       (A) recognition of any government in Afghanistan by the      United States depends on the human rights policies towards      women adopted by that government;       (B) the United States should not recognize any government      which systematically maltreats women; and       (C) any nonemergency economic or development assistance      will be based on respect for human rights; and       (4) call for the creation of--       (A) a commission to establish an international record of      the criminal culpability of any individual or party in      Afghanistan employing rape or other crime against humanity      considered a grave breach of the Geneva Convention as an      instrument of war; and       (B) an ad hoc international criminal tribunal by the United      Nations for the purposes of indicting, prosecuting, and      imprisoning any individual responsible for crimes against      humanity in Afghanistan.     SEC. 3. REPORT.       It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State      should submit a report to Congress not later than 6 months      after the date of the adoption of this resolution regarding      actions that have been taken to implement this resolution.
