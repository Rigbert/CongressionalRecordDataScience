 President, I yield myself 1 minute. Of the 3 minutes remaining, I yield myself 1 minute, and I ask my friend from Virginia to close on behalf of the proponents.  There are a number of Senators who wished to speak today--Senator Specter, Senator Hagel, Senator Smith. There are a number of people who wanted to speak. In the interest of a limited time, we have been unable to do that. And I apologize for that.  But the reason why I think it is appropriate that the Senator from Virginia close the case for us is that no one has been more instrumental in bringing about the ability to vote up or down on this proposal as well as the outline of the proposal.  I thank him for his leadership.  I yield the remainder of the time under the control of the Senator from Delaware to the Senator from Virginia.
