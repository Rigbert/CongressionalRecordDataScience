President, on April 9, 2002, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I announced the cancelation of the Mt. Hood National Forest Eagle Creek timber sales. These sales were sold under the salvage rider, enacted in 1996 by the 104th Congress. During my floor speech, I reiterated my opposition to the salvage rider, but also inadvertently referred to salvage sales instead of confining my remarks to salvage rider sales.  I have been, and will continue to be, a supporter of salvage sales involving the commercial recovery of dead or dying timber, when such sales make sense for the health of the forest. In fact, I worked very hard to make sure that a salvage sale project went forward in the wake of the 1996 Summit and Tower fires, and I continue to support constructive salvage work being done to improve forest health throughout the National Forests.  As I continue to work toward comprehensive forestry legislation which will include both active forest management and old growth protection, I thought it important to correct the Record.                          ____________________
