I will conclude with this.  During the time that all the hearings--over 30 hearings--that Senator Boxer has had on the subject of global warming were taking place--and it was not just the Republicans but a total turnaround--the Democrats started to look into this and realized the Democrats, as a party--who always supported cap-and-trade systems, such as the 2003 bill and the 2005 bill and the 2008 bill--are now looking at it and they are cutting to the chase. I will give a few quotes here. These are all quotes from Democrats.  President Obama said: Electricity prices would necessarily skyrocket. Democratic Representative John Dingell from Michigan said: Cap and trade is a tax and a great big one. Democratic Representative Pete DeFazio said: A cap and trade system is prone to market manipulation and speculation without any guarantee of meaningful GHG emission reductions.  The best is from my good friend from North Dakota, Senator Byron Dorgan, when he said about cap and trade: The Wall Street crowd can't wait to sink their teeth into a new trillion-dollar trading market in which hedge funds and investment banks would trade and speculate on carbon credits and securities. I totally agree with my good friend, Democratic Senator Byron Dorgan.  Democratic Senator Cantwell from Washington: A cap and trade program might allow Wall Street to distort a carbon market for its own profits.  We learned, of course, from Lisa Jackson, who is the new Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, when I asked her this question in a public hearing. I said: If we should pass the Markey bill in the Senate and it gets signed into law, will this reduce carbon emissions in the world?  She said: No.  Logically, obviously, she is right. If we drive our jobs overseas to places such as China and India, where they have no intention of having any kind of emission requirements, then that would have the effect of increasing, not decreasing, the amount of emissions in the air.  Senator Kerry said: There is no way the United States of America acting alone can solve this problem. So we have to have China; we have to have India.  I say we are not going to have China and India.  Senator McCaskill said: If we go too far with this cap and trade, then all we are going to do is chase more jobs to China and India, where they have been putting up coal-fired plants every 10 minutes.  Not quite true. I would say to my good friend, Senator McCaskill, it is about two coal-fired generation plants that are built every week in China. We haven't done one in 12 years here. So we know what their intentions are.  So we have had all these hearings, and we have recognized that things have changed now. You look at the groups now, and you have the agricultural community, the American Farm Bureau, and a vast majority of the agricultural groups who oppose it. The GAO says it will send our jobs to China and India. The very eloquent chairman of the National Black Chamber of Commerce did a great job of testifying before our committee and said it would destroy over 2 million jobs. The EPA and the EIA--that is the Energy Information Agency--said it would not reduce our dependence on foreign oil. The EPA said it will do nothing to reduce global temperatures. So when all is said and done, the American people will reject it. We are sure a lot further now.  I have to say this: This was a breath of fresh air, to listen to the American people standing up at these townhall meetings all around the country. In my 12 or 14 meetings I had in my State of Oklahoma, people know the right thing is going to happen. We are here to make that happen.  With that, I thank the Senator from Nevada for allowing me to have 15 minutes of his time, and I yield the floor.                          ____________________
