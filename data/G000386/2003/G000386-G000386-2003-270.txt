 Then I will yield the floor.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 6:30 the Senate proceed to a vote in relation to Durbin amendment No. 994, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Clinton amendment No. 1000, with no second-degree amendments in order to the amendments prior to the votes, and with 2 minutes equally divided for debate prior to each vote after the first; further, that following those votes, the Senator from Iowa--me--be recognized to offer an amendment.
