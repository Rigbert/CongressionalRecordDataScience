President, in 1614, 6 years before the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth, Captain John Smith--explorer, soldier, navigator, and adventurer--landed at Monhegan Island off the coast of Maine. I wish to commemorate the 400th anniversary of that discovery and to congratulate the people of a truly remarkable community as they celebrate their quadricentennial.  In the very first sentence of his remarkable journal of that voyage, Captain Smith names the ``Isle of Monhegan,'' the Wabanaki Indian word for ``island of the ocean.'' In reference to the shared latitude with his home country, he coined the term ``New England.''  As the Wabanaki had known for centuries, the fish were plentiful. In addition, Captain Smith used the stands of timber to make small boats to explore the inlets and rivers on the mainland coast. So, Monhegan can rightly claim to be the birthplace of three industries that built the State of Maine--fishing, boatbuilding, and logging.  Certainly, there were disappointments. The whales proved elusive, and the gold Captain Smith sought was nonexistent. But the potential was everywhere.  In addressing the question of what it would take to settle the untamed region, the captain's log contains these lines that define Monhegan today. It would take, Captain Smith wrote, ``the best parts of art, judgment, courage, honesty, constancy, diligence, and industry.''  Maine's island communities are an essential part of our State's identity. They survive and thrive because of the qualities Captain Smith so wonderfully described.  The island's lobster industry is a shining example. More than 90 years ago, long before conservation was a watchword, Monhegan's lobstermen voluntarily established their own ban on harvesting small lobsters. To the list of Monhegan's firsts--fishing, boatbuilding, and logging--we can add lobster management.  By mutual agreement, rather than government edict, Monhegan lobstermen set trap limits to prevent overfishing. They established their own management zone to ensure that this generations-old fishery will sustain the generations to come. Most remarkable of all is the tradition of Trap Day, now October 1, when all boats, captains, and crews wait for each other and head to their fishing grounds together at the crack of dawn. The ethic that ``no one goes until everyone goes'' is the very definition of community.  For more than a century, Monhegan also has been a magnet for artists. In 1902, Samuel Triscott became the first artist to live there year-round, and he found the subject matter enticing enough to stay the rest of his life, nearly one-quarter century. From Rockwell Kent to Andrew and Jamie Wyeth, this singular place has inspired some of the best artists to create their greatest work.  There is no question that the magnificent scenery is part of the attraction. But as we look at the powerful works of art the island has inspired, it is clear that the people of Monhegan, their judgment, courage, honesty, constancy, diligence, and industry, enhance the natural beauty of the island so that it represents something more profound than crashing surf on rocky shores.  Captain Smith concluded his journal of that voyage four centuries ago with these words: ``We are not born for ourselves, but each to help the other. Let us imitate the virtues of our predecessors to be worthily their successors.'' Those words are fitting for a celebration of the past that looks with confidence to the future, and I congratulate the people of Monhegan, Maine, on this landmark anniversary.                          ____________________
