Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, hope of all hopes, and wishes of all wishes, I do oppose the amendment.  The administration adamantly opposes the amendment. The administration has said they support the committee substitute. We have worked with them. It gives the President the flexibility he wants. Very frankly why should Congress mandate a bureaucratic delay? If the President, and that is what were saying, finds that this is an appropriate thing, why hold his hand for 5 months when he does not want it? That is like asking a girlfriend out on a date when she does not want to hold your hand. You are not going to get anywhere.  Let's face up to it. I suggest respectfully the amendment is very frankly not supported by anyone I know other than the gentleman from Connecticut. I urge the defeat of the amendment.
