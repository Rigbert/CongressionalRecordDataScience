 President, I rise today to honor a soldier who has fallen in service to his country in Iraq. SSG Eric Steffeney of the 18th Ordnance Company died on the 23rd of February near Tuz, Iraq, when an undetected explosive detonated while he cleared the road of landmines. He was 28 years old and is survived by his mother, Annette, his father, Gary, his wife, Theresa, and their three children, Benjamin, Caitlin, and Dennis.  Staff Sergeant Steffeney grew up in Waterloo, IA, where he attended West High School. He graduated from high school early and enlisted in the Army when he was 17 years old. Initially serving as a paratrooper, Staff Sergeant Steffeney eventually joined the Army's bomb squad because he thought it would be more challenging. He was finishing his second tour of duty when he was killed.  Staff Sergeant Steffeney was described as a quiet, loyal, and responsible man who was a good soldier and an all-American boy. Indeed, it is the dedicated and courageous people such as SSG Eric Steffeney who embody the ideals of this great country best and, through the way they lived and gave their lives, keep her people standing proud and strong. I ask all of my colleagues to remember with pride and appreciation this soldier. I give my condolences to the family and friends of Staff Sergeant Steffeney who have felt this loss most deeply. I offer my most sincere gratitude and respect to SSG Eric Steffeney. This country is forever indebted to him and his colleagues for the sacrifices they have made to uphold the ideals which we treasure most as Americans.                   staff sergeant william t. robbins
