 President, I rise today to express serious concerns about the budget resolution conference report. This is a 10 year blueprint for disaster that ignores the real priorities of working families. It eliminates all of the gains we made in the Senate that addresses the real fiscal challenges we face, while setting the Nation on a course of fiscal irresponsibility. This budget's contents and consequences will hurt the health of our nation.
