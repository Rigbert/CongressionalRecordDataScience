Speaker, this evening the undefeated University of Toledo Rockets will take to the field in the Las Vegas Bowl and once again display their awesome offensive prowess as they defeat the University of Nevada Wolf Pack--for the second time this year. It's an uncommon event to have a rematch in post-season college football, but tonight Toledo and Nevada will reprise their September contest--a game in which the Rockets beat the turnover-prone Wolf Pact 49 to 35.  This is the Rockets' sixth bowl appearance. They have prevailed in all--with five solid wins and one forfeit. Now I'm sure the Wolf Pack has no intention of forfeiting, but the Rockets will prevail again nonetheless.  As is the custom in the House, I offer my friend from Reno and colleague on the Appropriations Committee, Barbara Vucanovich, a congenial wager that Toledo's irrepressible Rockets will defeat Nevada tonight. So, as Toledo is known as the glass capital of the world, I will risk a set of Libbey Glass wine glasses and Ohio Catawba nonalcoholic Sparkling Grape Juice to fill them on my conviction that Toledo's Rockets will blast off from Las Vegas victorious.
