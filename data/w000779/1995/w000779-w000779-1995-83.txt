Chairman, what troubles me is this legislation creates a Federal express line where the developer and commercial interests can come in and have their claims addressed, but when it is the typical homeowner, under this bill we say ``Sorry, Charlie, you do not get in the [[Page H2558]] same place as the commercial interests. Go to the State and local level and see if things will work out.''  That is the reason I think this bill has a double standard, one set of rules for the commercial interests, another set of rules for the typical homeowner, and why we seek to promote some balance.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.
