President, this amendment by Senator Schumer, and others, is a test as to whether this Senate is in touch with the reality of life for American families. The Schumer amendment will allow families across America, worried about paying their kids' college education expenses, a tax deduction of $12,000 a year. It will say to those paying off students loans that we will give you a tax credit of up to $1,500 a year on the interest on your student loan, and if you are a teacher who wants to go for extra training to be certified, we will give you a $5,000 tax credit so you can be the very best in the classroom. Families across America understand the Schumer amendment.  What they don't understand is the alternative on the Republican side, which says we don't need it, that our highest priority is helping the wealthiest people in America be absolved from paying any kind of estate tax.  When we start forming a line to come in the Senate for help, the Republicans put the wealthiest people in America first. The Schumer amendment puts American families first.  Watch for this vote.
