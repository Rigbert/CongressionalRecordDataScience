ENZI. I am happy to yield for a question when I complete my remarks.  As I mentioned, we have been working with retailers and a coalition, including a lot of retailers and others who rely on the sales tax or rely on businesses that have a sales tax. That includes people who build shopping malls and do other types of retail businesses. I acknowledge their help in coming to this particular bill. I thank the National League of Cities and the National Governors' Association, and most particularly, my Governor from Wyoming, Governor Geringer, and the Governor from Utah, Governor Leavitt, for the tremendous hours they have put in together trying to get everybody on the same page.  I yield for a question.
