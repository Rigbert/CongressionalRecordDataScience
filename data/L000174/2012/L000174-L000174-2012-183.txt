President, I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer, distinguished by his service here in the Senate but also as Governor of one of the most beautiful States in the Union.                       Aurora, Colorado Shootings  Before we begin--and so many others have said this--it would be impossible to state the amount of horror and sadness felt by my wife Marcelle and me at the news of what happened in Colorado, and I was reminded again today as I saw the flags lowered to half staff on this Capitol Building. We think of the Capitol as being a bastion of democracy or the light that sort of shines for the rest of the world on what democracy is. Unfortunately, so much of the world has seen the acts of a madman. It is safe to say this is one thing that united every Senator of both parties here. Our hearts go out not only to those who have been injured, obviously to the families of those who have died, and to the people in that wonderful community, because it is impossible for any one of us here to know how long or how hard that will hold in their heart, the number of people who say, as we all do: We just went to a movie. Any one of us has done that. Our children go to movies, our grandchildren go to movies. You expect them to go, have a good time, and come back, and enjoy it. The thought of what they saw there is horrible.  We have before us a Federal trial court nomination, that of Michael Shipp. This is a nomination that was voted on by the Senate Judiciary Committee more than three months ago and supported nearly unanimously by both Republican and Democratic Senators who have reviewed it. The only objection came as a protest vote from Senator Lee.  Judge Michael Shipp has served as a U.S. Magistrate Judge in the District of New Jersey since 2007 and has presided over civil and criminal matters and issued over 100 opinions. He is thefirst African-American United States Magistrate Judge in that district. Prior to his appointment to the Federal bench, he worked for the Office of the Attorney General of New Jersey for five years, where he was Assistant Attorney General in charge of Consumer Protection from 2003 to 2007 and Counsel to the Attorney General in 2007. From 1995 to 2003, Judge Shipp was an associate in the Newark office of the law firm Skadden, Arps. Upon graduation from law school, Judge Shipp clerked for Judge James Coleman on the New Jersey Supreme Court.  Despite his outstanding qualifications and bipartisan support, Senate Republicans have delayed his confirmation vote for more than three months. Despite the fact that the Senate has finally been allowed to consider his nomination and that he will be confirmed overwhelmingly, Senate Republicans have again demonstrated their obstruction of judicial nominees. This is not a nominee on whom cloture should have been filed.  They refused until today to agree to a vote on this nomination. That meant that the Majority Leader was required to file a cloture petition to put an end to their obstruction and partisan filibuster. While I am pleased we are holding a confirmation vote today, it should not have required that the Majority Leader file for cloture.  This was the 29th time the Majority Leader had been forced to file for cloture to end a Republican filibuster and get an up-or-down vote for one of President Obama's judicial nominees. By comparison, during the entire eight years that President Bush was in office, cloture was filed in connection with 18 of his judicial nominees, most of whom were opposed on their merits as extreme ideologues.  Senate Republicans used to insist that filibustering of judicial nominations was unconstitutional. The Constitution has not changed but as soon as President Obama was elected they reversed course and filibustered President Obama's very first judicial nomination. Judge David Hamilton of Indiana was a widely-respected 15-year veteran of the Federal bench nominated to the Seventh Circuit and was supported by Senator Dick Lugar, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate. They delayed his confirmation for five months. Senate Republicans then proceeded to obstruct and delay just about every circuit court nominee of this President, filibustering nine of them. They delayed confirmation of Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit for 11 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Jane Stranch of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit for 10 months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Ray Lohier of New York to the Second Circuit for seven months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Scott Matheson of Utah to the Tenth Circuit and Judge James Wynn, Jr. of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit for six months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Andre Davis of Maryland to the Fourth Circuit, Judge Henry Floyd of South Carolina to the Fourth Circuit, Judge Stephanie Thacker of West Virginia to the Fourth Circuit, and Judge Jacqueline Nguyen of California to the Ninth Circuit for five months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the Eleventh Circuit, Judge Beverly Martin of Georgia to the Eleventh Circuit, Judge Mary Murguia of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Bernice Donald of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit, Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the Fourth Circuit, Judge Thomas Vanaskie of Pennsylvania to the Third Circuit, Judge Joseph Greenaway of New Jersey to the Third Circuit, Judge Denny Chin of New York to the Second Circuit, and Judge Chris Droney of Connecticut to the Second Circuit for four months. They delayed confirmation of Judge Paul Watford of California to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Morgan Christen of Alaska to the Ninth Circuit, Judge Stephen Higginson of Louisiana to the Fifth Circuit, Judge Gerard Lynch of New York to the Second Circuit, Judge Susan Carney of Connecticut to the Second Circuit, and Judge Kathleen O'Malley of Ohio to the Federal Circuit for three months.  As a current report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service confirms, the median time circuit nominees have had to wait before a Senate vote has skyrocketed from 18 days for President Bush's nominees to 132 days for President Obama's. This is the result of Republican foot dragging and obstruction. In most cases, Senate Republicans are delaying and stalling for no good reason. How else do you explain the filibuster of the nomination of Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the Fourth Circuit who was ultimately confirmed 99-0? And how else do you explain the needless stalling and obstruction of Judge Denny Chin of New York to the Second Circuit, who was filibustered for four months before he was confirmed 98-0?  Three of the five circuit court judges finally confirmed this year after months of unnecessary delays and a filibuster should have been confirmed last year. The other two circuit court nominees confirmed this year were both subjected to stalling and a partisan filibuster by Senate Republicans. This was the case even though these circuit nominees had strong bipartisan support. We needed to overcome a filibuster to confirm Justice Andrew Hurwitz of Arizona to the Ninth Circuit despite the strong support of his home state Senators, Republicans Jon Kyl and John McCain. The Majority Leader had to file cloture to secure an up-or-down vote on Paul Watford of California to the Ninth Circuit despite his sterling credentials and bipartisan support. The year started with the Majority Leader having to file cloture to get an up-or-down vote on Judge Adalberto Jordan of Florida to the Eleventh Circuit even though he was strongly supported by his Republican home state Senator. Every single one of these nominees for whom the Majority Leader was forced to file cloture was rated unanimously well qualified by the nonpartisan ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the highest possible rating. And every one of them was nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy.  In June, Senate Republicans confirmed that they shut down the confirmation process for qualified and consensus circuit court nominees. They are now filibustering Judge Patty Shwartz of New Jersey who is nominated to the Third Circuit and Richard Taranto who is nominated to the Federal Circuit. In addition, they are filibustering two circuit court nominees who have the support of both their home state Republican Senators: William Kayatta of Maine to the First Circuit and Judge Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit. This is almost unprecedented.  During the past five presidential election years, Senate Democrats have never denied an up-or-down vote to any circuit court nominee of a Republican President who received bipartisan support in the Judiciary Committee. In fact, during the last 20 years, only four circuit nominees reported with bipartisan support have been denied an up-or-down vote by the Senate and all four were nominated by President Clinton and blocked by Senate Republicans. While Senate Democrats have been willing to work with Republican presidents to confirm circuit court nominees with bipartisan support, Senate Republicans have repeatedly obstructed the nominees of Democratic presidents. In the previous five presidential election years, a total of 13 circuit court nominees have been confirmed after June 1. Not surprisingly, 12 of the 13 were Republican nominees. Clearly, this is not tit-for-tat as some contend but, rather, a one-way street in favor of Republican presidents' nominees.  This entire year, the Senate has yet to vote on a single circuit court nominee who was nominated by President Obama this year. Since 1980, the only presidential election year in which there were no circuit nominees confirmed who was nominated that year was in 1996, when Senate Republicans shut down the process against President Clinton's circuit nominees.  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has confirmed in its reports that judicial nominees continue to be confirmed in presidential election years--except it seems when there is a Democratic President. In five of the last eight presidential election years, the Senate has confirmed at least 22 circuit and district court nominees after May 31. The notable exceptions were during the last years of President Clinton's two terms in 1996 and 2000 when Senate Republicans would notallow confirmations to continue. The third exception was in 1988, at the end of President Reagan's presidency, but that was because vacancies were at 28. In comparison, vacancies at the end of the Clinton years stood at 75 at the end of 1996 and 67 at the end of 2000. Otherwise, it has been the rule rather than the exception. So, for example, according to CRS the Senate confirmed 32 nominees in 1980; 28 in 1984; 31 in 1992; 28 in 2004 at the end of President George W. Bush's first term; and 22 after May 31 in 2008 at the end of President Bush's second term. So far this year only 7 judicial nominees have been allowed to be confirmed.  It is ironic that certain Senate Republicans are now arguing in support of a distorted version of the Thurmond Rule, as if it had the force of law. After all, it is Senate Republicans who have repeatedly asserted that the Thurmond Rule does not exist. For example, on July 14, 2008, the Senate Republican caucus held a hearing solely dedicated to arguing that the Thurmond Rule does not exist. At that hearing, the senior Senator from Kentucky stated: ``I think it's clear that there is no Thurmond Rule. And I think the facts demonstrate that.'' Similarly, the Senator from Iowa, my friend who is now serving as Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, stated that the Thurmond Rule was in his view ``plain bunk.'' He said: ``The reality is that the Senate has never stopped confirming judicial nominees during the last few months of a president's term.'' We did not in 2008 when we proceeded to confirm 22 nominees over the second half of that year. That Senate Republicans have objected to voting on the nomination of Judge Shipp is a distortion of the Thurmond rule and shows the depths to which they have gone.  There is no good reason that the Senate should not vote on consensus nominees like Judge Shipp and more than a dozen other consensus judicial nominees to fill Federal trial court vacancies in Iowa, California, Utah, Connecticut, Maryland, Florida, Oklahoma, Michigan, New York and Pennsylvania. There is no good reason the Senate should not vote on the nominations of William Kayatta of Maine to the First Circuit, Judge Robert Bacharach of Oklahoma to the Tenth Circuit, Richard Taranto to the Federal Circuit and for that matter Judge Patty Shwartz of New Jersey to the Third Circuit, who is supported by New Jersey's Republican Governor. Each of these circuit court nominees has been rated unanimously well qualified by the nonpartisan ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the highest possible rating. These should not be controversial nominees. They are qualified and should be considered as consensus nominees and confirmed.  Senate Republicans are blocking consent to vote on superbly qualified circuit court nominees with strong bipartisan support. This is a new and damaging application of the Thurmond rule.  The fact that Republican stalling tactics have meant that circuit court nominees that should have been confirmed in the spring--like Bill Kayatta, Richard Taranto and Patty Shwartz--are still awaiting a vote is no excuse for not moving forward this month to confirm these circuit nominees.  In an article dated July 16, 2012 entitled ``William Kayatta and the Needless Destruction of the Thurmond Rule,'' Andrew Cohen of the Atlantic states:       In a more prudent and practical era in Senate history,      nominees like Kayatta would have been confirmed in days . . .      Now even slam-dunk candidates like Kayatta linger in the      wings waiting for Senate ``consent'' long after the body      already has definitively ``advised'' the executive branch of      how great it thinks the nominee would be as a judge. Can you      imagine the uproar if the Senate ever used its filibuster      power to block the deployment of troops already endorsed by      the Armed Services Committee? Now please tell me the material      difference here. Surely, the judiciary needs judges as much      as the army needs soldiers.  I agree. We have outstanding nominees with the support of both Republican home State senators. Yet, we cannot vote on these nominees because Senate Republicans want to place politics over the needs of the American people.  The Los Angeles Times recently published an editorial entitled ``Reject the `Thurmond Rule' '' which concluded ``the administration of justice shouldn't be held hostage to partisan politics even in an election year.''  I ask unanimous consent that copies of the July 12 and 16 articles be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.
