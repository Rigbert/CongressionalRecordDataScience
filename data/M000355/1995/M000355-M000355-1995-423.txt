 386. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for the tax-free treatment of education savings accounts established through certain State programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.                       THE TRUST FUND SAVINGS ACT Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I introduce a bill that will help Americans defray the costs of a college education. For many, the dream of a college education can never be fulfilled simply because they can not meet the skyrocketing costs. I am sure all of my colleagues will agree that this Nation's future success is dependent on the education of our children today.  Mr. President, the facts are clear. Education costs are outpacing average wages and this has created a barrier to attending college. Throughout the 1980's education costs have risen 8 percent per year. At this pace, an average tuition bill of $5,000 will be $11,700 in the year 2000. In 1994, the average tuition in America rose by 6 percent. It was also the smallest since 1989 according to the College Board.  In Kentucky last year tuition rocketed 11.2 percent at the University of Kentucky and the University of Louisville. For other regional schools, students and parents only saw their costs rise by 5.3 percent. The largest increase, however, was felt by the students attending community colleges where costs rose 14.3 percent.  As tuition continues to increase, so does the need for assistance. In 1990, over 56 percent of all students accepted some form of financial assistance. The statistic was even higher for minority students. Also on the rise are need-based scholarships and grants. In Kentucky, between 1984 and 1992, need-based scholarships rose by 160 percent.  It is increasingly common for students to study now and pay later. In fact, more students than ever are forced to bear the additional loan costs in order to receive an education. Between 1993 and 1994 Federal loan volume rose by 57 percent from the previous year. On top of that, students have increased the size of their loan burden by an average of 28 percent. So, not only are more students taking out loans, but they are taking out bigger loans as well. Next May at graduation time, nearly half the graduates will hit the pavement with their diplomas and stack of loan repayment books.  I believe that we need to reverse this trend by boosting savings and to help parents meet the education needs of their children. The bill I am introducing today, will make changes to the Tax Code maximizing the scope and the investment in State-sponsored education savings plans.  This legislation will permit parents to contribute up to $3,000 annually in after-tax dollars to a State-sponsored plan. Also this amount will be indexed to match the annual growth in education costs. The real benefit of this program will allow earnings to accumulate tax-free when used to meet educaiton costs. Any earnings not used for educational purposes will be taxed at the students individual rate. I believe this will provide a significant benefit to families and correct, at least in this instance, the unfair tax discrimination toward savings.  For those States that have established programs, whether they are prepared, savings or bond programs this legislation will provide tax-exempt status to those organizations that administer these programs. In November 1994, the U.S. Appeals Court in Cincinnati ruled that the Michigan Education Trust is not subject to Federal income tax. This language would also remove any misunderstanding regarding the taxation of these investments.  This tax designation will serve two purposes. Once, it will send a clear message regarding each organization's mission to help families finance a child's education. Second, it will reduce the administrative expenses, thus increasing the investment in education.  Mr. President, this is not another unfunded mandate. This legislation merely provides States with an option to invest in their most important resource, their children. I am confident that following the passage of this legislation more and more States will seek to establish similar programs to stimulate both education savings and reduce the need for State assistance in the future.  Lastly, this bill would make corporate and individual endowments to the trust fund exempt from Federal taxation when distributed among participants. This will allow corporations to help finance the education of our Nation's future leaders.  This legislation is not a funding cure but is a serious effort to encourage long-term savings. Participants don't have to be rich to participate. In fact, the average monthly contribution in Kentucky is just $47.22. This program will reward an individuals long term investment in education.  The alternative funding option is to continue in our futile attempt to outpace the rising cost of education through subsidies and aid. More that likely this would exacerbate the dollar chase driving costs even higher. I am confident, that my legislation will take the burden off the Federal and State government to subsidize students.  [[Page S2495]] I hope my colleagues will join me in creating this viable and affordable means of helping families provide for their children's higher education. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 386       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
