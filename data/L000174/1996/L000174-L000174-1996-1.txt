Although this bill became entangled in several battles on other issues, I think everyone will agree that passage of this legislation in its final configuration represents the Senate's commitment to passing small, yet locally very important legislation that otherwise could have gotten lost in the shuffle. In particular, I am pleased to see one provision that will reform the Forest Service's fee structure for ski area permits on Forest Service land. Last year, Senator Murkowski and I introduced this bill to simplify the process of collecting fees from ski areas for use of Forest Service land.  When I introduced the bill with Senator Murkowski, I emphasized the importance of this bill for ski areas across the country, but also the environmental importance of this bill. Skiing is one of the best uses that we have today on our national forests. The ski industry brings millions of people to the mountains to enjoy fresh air, scenery and the mountain environment. Few other national forest activities are able to host such intense public use with relatively minimal impact.  By refining the structure of the fee structure, operators of ski areas will be able to continue in this productive relationship with the Forest Service. The streamlined fee structure will also enable the Forest Service to move towards a fee system that is closer to fair market value. It also will save the Forest Service and the ski industry considerable time and money in collecting these fees.  It is my hope that through reforms such as this, the private sector and the Federal agencies that manage our public lands will continue to build a cooperative and productive relationship in protecting and providing access to our public lands.
