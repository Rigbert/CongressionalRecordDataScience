I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to congratulate you.  For those who condemn this bill, remember, we have not had a reauthorization FAA for many, many years. And I think this has been well thought out. This bill will do the job, and we should get it done for the American people.  This is a process of compromise. And we've done this with the Senate side, which is really the problem with most of these debates we have as far as conferences go. But it would be a sad day if we didn't pass this legislation, because the work has gone into it and it does solve lots of problems. It gives assurity for the FAA: they can plan ahead, make our airports safer, make our flyers safer, and have the navigations necessary.  So I congratulate the chairman and the ranking member getting this bill done. The negotiating part was very difficult, but they've done a good job.
