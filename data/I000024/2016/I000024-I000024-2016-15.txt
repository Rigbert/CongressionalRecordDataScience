President, on behalf of Senator James Lankford and myself, it is my honor to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Department of Army civilian employee Michael G. Sauro who died 1 day after his 40th birthday on October 19, 2016, of wounds received from encountering hostile enemy fire near Kabul, Afghanistan.  The son of Michael and Christine Sauro, Mike was born on October 18, 1976 in Chambersburg, PA. He graduated from Savanna High School in Savanna, IL, and went on to graduate with his bachelor's degree from Illinois State University in Normal, IL.  ``Whether it be sports, or his friends, or his family, he always went at it 100 percent,'' recalled a fellow Savanna High School graduate, ``He was very committed to the U.S. and service members, making sure they had what they needed to do their job.'' He was passionate about life and was always willing to step in and help. His infectious smile will be remembered by everyone that knew and loved Mike.  Mike began his Federal civilian service in December of 1999 and spent his career working for the Defense Ammunition Center, McAlester Army Ammunition Plant in McAlester, OK, and at its satellite locations at Fort Riley, KS, and Schofield Barracks, HI.  While at McAlester Army Ammunition Plant, he led the effort and was instrumental in revisions of the hazardous materials course. He worked to deliver the most robust training course available at over 50 locations in and outside the continental United States. Mike was the liaison between McAlester Army Ammunition Plant and the satellite training locations helping to ensure that the mission was accomplished. McAlester Army Ammunition Plant coworkers fondly remember him for his ``sunny disposition as well as his genuine kindness.''  Mission always came first for Mike. Regardless of the complexity of the task, he quickly comprehended requirements of the task and aggressively accomplished them in a professional, timely manner. He deployed three times--the first time in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, the second in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, and the third to support the mission to train, advise and assist Afghan forces. Mike's dedicated service and expertise made a difference around the world and saved lives. He is a testament to the values of the Defense Ammunition Center, the U.S. Army Combined Services Command, the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command, and the U.S. Army.  Mike is survived by his parents Michael and Christine Sauro, his brother and sister-in-law Ben and Sarah Sauro, his sister and his brother-in-law Brienne and Lance Matthews, and their children, Dakota and William.  Today we remember Michael G. Sauro, an American hero who gave his all for his country. Our Nation lost a great American, son, grandson, brother, uncle, and friend. Mike's service and sacrifice will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
