He has been a star in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and his support of Tom Perez is one of the reasons Mr. Perez went through our committee with an overwhelming vote.  Incidentally, we do have letters of support. One I have which is very meaningful--and I think the Senator from Maryland would agree--is the letter we received from Senator Kennedy, the late Senator Kennedy. While this matter is pending, I ask unanimous consent to have the letter from the late Senator Kennedy printed in the Record, as well as letters of support from numerous attorneys general, including the attorney general of Vermont.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 2009.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,          Washington, DC.       Dear Pat, Arlen and Members of the Committee: I write to      enthusiastically endorse Tom Perez's nomination to be      Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the Department      of Justice. As you know, Tom did an excellent job for me from      1995 to 1998, on my Judiciary Committee staff when I was a      member of the Committee. I believe he's an exceptional choice      for Assistant Attorney General, and I urge his prompt      confirmation.       During Tom's impressive service on my staff, he worked hard      and well on civil rights, hate crimes, and a variety of      immigration, criminal and constitutional issues. Work on      civil rights has been at the core of Tom's career, which      began as a prosecutor in the Criminal Section of the Civil      Rights Division, where he helped bring to justice the      perpetrators of hate crimes, including racially-motivated      shootings. He also prosecuted law enforcement officials      involved in violent and corrupt practices, and his work as a      career prosecutor earned him promotion to deputy chief of the      Criminal Section.       After serving on my staff, Tom returned to the Civil Rights      Division as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General, supervising      the Division's criminal prosecutions, and its litigation in      the areas of education and employment discrimination. He had      a key role in establishing the interagency Worker      Exploitation Task Force, which coordinated enforcement of      laws against involuntary servitude and trafficking in      persons.       In 1999, Torn became Director of the Office for Civil      Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, where      he led a staff of 230 people in ensuring that health and      human services providers complied with civil rights laws.       Upon leaving the federal government in 2001, Tom became a      professor of law at the University of Maryland School of Law.      Motivated by his strong desire to make a difference in      peoples' lives, Tom also was elected to the Montgomery County      Council in Maryland, and became a leader in promoting      affordable housing and affordable health care, as well as      improvements in education. Finally, for the past two years,      Tom has served as Secretary of Maryland's Department of      Labor, Licensing and Regulation.       A main unifying theme of Tom's career is his desire to help      people, by ensuring that their rights are protected and that      they receive the services they need. His commitment to public      service and his ability to be effective in both executive and      legislative positions is impressive. He has been energetic in      seeking change, and working cooperatively with others to      achieve it.       A second main theme of Tom's career has been his      exceptional performance as a lawyer. He's been highly      successful as a prosecutor, as a lawyer serving this      Committee, as a Deputy Assistant Attorney General and     as a law professor. Importantly, Tom understands the role of      a government lawyer. Having been a career attorney in the      Department of Justice, he knows the importance of developing      effective working relationships with career employees and      making sure that law enforcement decisions are made on the      basis of the facts and the law, without favoritism based on      partisanship or ideology. In light of the challenges that the      Department of Justice, and especially the Civil Rights      Division, have faced in recent years, these are indispensible      qualities in an Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights.       Tom's outstanding legal skills, his years of impressive      experience as a prosecutor, his career-long commitment to      enforcing civil rights, and his thorough familiarity with the      legal and policy issues in the Civil Rights Division make him      uniquely well qualified to lead the Division now. I strongly      urge the Committee to report his nomination favorably.           Sincerely,     Edward M. Kennedy.                                  ____         State of New Jersey, Office of the Attorney General,            Department of Law and Public Safety,                                       Trenton NJ, April 23, 2009.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chair, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary,          Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: I am      writing to express my support for the nomination of Thomas E.      Perez for Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights      Division of the United States Department of Justice. Mr.      Perez is exceptionally qualified to lead the Division,      possessing demonstrated and impeccable legal, management, and      leadership skills.       I served in the Department of Justice's Civil Rights      Division, Criminal Section, from 2001 to 2005, and I remain      engaged with the Department through participation in the      Executive Working Group. Currently, as Attorney General for      the State of New Jersey, I am the chief law enforcement      officer in the State, with a mandate to enforce the State's      civil rights and criminal laws. I know Mr. Perez to be a      committed, dedicated, and highly effective advocate and      prosecutor. I look forward to working with Mr. Perez in      addressing shared federal and state civil rights priorities.       Mr. Perez will bring a breadth of advocacy, policy, and      leadership experience to the Division. He has had a      distinguished career in the Department of Justice, serving in      several roles in the Division. He has prosecuted civil rights      cases in the Criminal Section and, as the Deputy Assistant      Attorney General for Civil Rights, oversaw the Division's      complex criminal, education, and employment litigation. Since      leaving the Department, Mr, Perez has continued his      commitment to public service as a faculty member at the      University of Maryland School of Law and a member of the      Montgomery County Council. In his current capacity as      Secretary of the Department of Labor, Licensing and      Regulation in Maryland, Mr, Perez bas gained valuable      experience and insights into the priorities and workings of      state government, which complements his considerable federal      and local leadership experience.       For these reasons, I am pleased to recommend Mr. Perez to      the Committee. Please feel free to contact me if you have any      questions.           Sincerely yours,                                                     Anne Milgram,     Attorney General.                                  ____     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Dirksen          Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Arlen Specter,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter: As the      chief law enforcement officers of our respective states, we      write to express our strong support for the nomination of      Thomas Perez for Assistant Attorney General for the Civil      Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice.      We urge his confirmation.       Secretary Perez's qualifications and credentials are      exceptional. He is a nationally recognized civil rights      lawyer whose breadth and depth of experience make him an      ideal choice to lead the Civil Rights Division. He knows the      Division well, having worked there for almost a decade in a      variety of critical positions. As a prosecutor in the      Division, he was lead attorney in some of the Department's      most high profile and complex civil rights cases. As Deputy      Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, he oversaw      complex litigation in the employment and education areas.       In Maryland, Secretary Perez, in his current capacity as      Secretary of Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing and      Regulation, has played a key role in the state's response to      the ongoing mortgage crisis. He negotiated agreements with      six major mortgage servicing companies to provide relief to      Maryland homeowners in danger of foreclosure. One of the      largest ongoing mortgage fraud prosecutions in the nation      originated in Secretary Perez's office. With housing at the      top of the Department of Justice's agenda, Secretary Perez      will be well-situated to play a major role.       He has held leadership positions in federal, state and      local government, and has worked in all three branches of the      federal government. As such, he has an acute understanding of      the need for the federal government to work in partnership      with state and local governments to safeguard the civil      rights of all Americans.       Heading the Civil Rights Division, like running an Attorney      General's office, requires extensive legal, management and      leadership skills, as well as extensive experience in      building coalitions. Secretary Perez has led important      agencies. He currently heads a Department of about 1600      employees, and has held other senior positions in the federal      government. He has a well-earned reputation as someone who      listens, learns quickly, builds consensus, and leads      effectively.       Mr. Perez's distinguished career demonstrates his      leadership abilities, integrity and commitment to public      service. We are confident that Mr. Perez would be an      exceptional Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Rights      Division and urge you to confirm his nomination.           Sincerely,     Terry Goddard,       Attorney General of Arizona.     Tom Miller,       Attorney General of Iowa.     Martha Coakley,       Attorney General of Massachusetts.

Sorrell,       Attorney General of Vermont.                                  ____       April 29, 2009.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     Chairman,     Committee on the Judiciary.     Hon.
