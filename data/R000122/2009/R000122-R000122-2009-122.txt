We are open to finding ways to quantify the number of individuals and families experiencing housing instability and look forward to working with the Senator and the administration to do so.  I thank the Senator for her questions, and I look forward to working together on improving the prevention of homelessness and the provision of services to homeless individuals and families in order to break the cycle of homelessness.
