 President, I rise in support of a resolution, submitted by Senator Collins, to honor four women recently recognized by the Vital Voices Global Partnership.  This is a global organization that identifies, supports, and highlights women around the world who exhibit leadership to transform their communities.  I am pleased to sponsor this resolution with Senator Collins.  The four women honored by this resolution are leaders who have made a true difference in their countries in the face of adversity.  Hafsat Abiola of Nigeria founded the Kudirat Initiative for Democracy to end violence against women in Nigeria and remove barriers for the civic participation of women. She has been actively working on gender equality and women's leadership in Nigeria since she was a teenager, and continues to advance women's rights.  Khanim Latif of Iraq is the Director of Asuda, which works to combat sexual and gender-based violence in Iraq. She has worked on gender-based violence issues in Iraq for over 15 years,and has helped provide refuge to women subjected to horrific violence in her country, including to those who have been subjected to ISIL's violent campaign against the region's Yazidi population.  Yoani Sanchez of Cuba founded ``Generacion Y,'' a platform to capture daily life in Cuba as an effort to encourage political change. It stemmed from her personal experiences growing up in Cuba, and the experiences of her family.  Akanksha Hazari of India works to empower impoverished, rural communities in India. She has done this by pioneering a loyalty program--through mobile phones--to provide social goods such as clean water to rural customers in India.  These women were recognized by Vital Voices because they have made significant strides to better the communities in which they live, and they continue to do so.  The resolution, submitted by Senator Collins and myself, further recognizes their contributions, and I hope that we can all draw inspiration from their leadership.  I congratulate these women, and look forward to hearing about their continued success.                          ____________________
