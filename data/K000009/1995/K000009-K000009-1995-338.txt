You know, they have their Presidential elections in August, so everything was quiet up until August. Then we had a GATT vote here, and that was right after elections. We delayed it. Nothing was said. Nobody wanted to upset the applecart.  Then we had the vote on GATT here late in November, and, boom, right after that, when everything was set and secure, then the decision was made to devalue the peso, and our Government knew for a long time this was coming, the officials over at Treasury and the Fed.  So it was all orchestrated at the highest levels, no debate down here, no discussion, and now, as you say, our people have to foot the bill.
