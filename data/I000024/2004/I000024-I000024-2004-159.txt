President, Members of Congress, it is not often we have an opportunity to recognize a senior executive in the United States Government as a leader, loyal soldier and a patriot. Ben H. Bell III epitomizes these traits after dedicating his adult life to serving this great country in several impressive capacities. Ben protected and defended our Nation during his 21 years as an officer and leader in the Marine Corps. He safeguarded our borders for 9 years, holding his last position as Assistant Commissioner for Intelligence with the Department of Immigration and Naturalization Services. For the next 2 years, Ben helped design the Foreign Terrorism Tracking Task Force just after 9/11 under Presidential directive and direction from the Attorney General.  Soon after, Secretary Mineta and Deputy Secretary ADM James Loy recruited Mr. Bell to establish and lead this Nation's first Office of National Risk Assessment, ONRA. This congressionally mandated office and its mission define our Nation's newly emerging need to manage and mitigate extreme risk for the protection of our homeland from terrorism.  It is through great dedication, unconditional loyalty, leadership, and passion that Ben H. Bell III has protected and defended our way of life every day without ever giving it a second thought.  On behalf of my colleagues in Congress and myself, we thank you, congratulate you, and salute you on such an accomplished and dynamic career.                          ____________________
