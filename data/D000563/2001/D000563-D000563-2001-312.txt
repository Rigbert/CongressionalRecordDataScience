I recall, before my election to Congress, running a law office and buying health insurance for myself and my employees. I recall the experience when I went to one of the larger health insurance companies to cover my employees. So the belief that small businesses only do business with small insurance companies I am not sure is an accurate description. I think that small businesses often do business with large insurance companies.  If I understand the Senator from Massachusetts and the amendment of the Senator from Colorado, if one employer has 49 employees here and is doing business with a large insurance company, that large insurance company doesn't have to offer the same protections to the small business' employees that it might offer to the business next door with 60 employees. So the people who are losing are not the small business owners but the small business employees who don't get the benefit of the same protections that we are trying to guarantee to all Americans. Is that how the Senator from Massachusetts sees it?
