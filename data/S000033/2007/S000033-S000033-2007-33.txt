 President, I will say a few words about this amendment.  I thank Senator Grassley for working with me on this amendment. We modified the original amendment. This amendment is substantially similar to the amendment Senator Grassley and I offered last May on the immigration reform bill which passed the Senate with a bipartisan vote of 59 to 35.  This amendment is motivated by one major concern. We want to make certain that young Americans receive the educational opportunities they need in order to obtain the professional, good-paying jobs that are coming about in this country. To do that, we need to make sure they have the college education they need in math, science, engineering, health care, and other professional fields.  This amendment also expands the Jacob Javits Gifted and Talented Educational Program, long supported by Senator Grassley.  This amendment will accomplish these goals by adding a $3,500 surcharge on companies that utilize the H-1B program, the same surcharge that 59 Senators supported last May.
