Speaker, I yield to my friend, the majority leader, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), for the purposes of informing us of the schedule.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. The final list of those bills will be sent to Members' offices at the end of the week and any votes called for on these will be rolled to 6:30 p.m.  On Wednesday and Thursday the House will convene at 10 a.m. We will likely consider additional legislation under suspension of the rules, as well as H.R. 310, the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act. In addition, we are working on the continuity of government legislation. It is anticipated to be similar to H.R. 2844, the Continuity in Representation Act passed by the House last year. We hope to move quickly and bring that legislation to the floor next week.  Finally, assuming the other body passes S. 5, the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, in a form identical to what the Senate Committee on the Judiciary passed last week, we expect to consider that legislation next week as well.
