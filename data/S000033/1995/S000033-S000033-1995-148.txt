 Chairman, I oppose the point of order offered by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Regula] for the following reason. Originally what the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] had intended to do was to put the money into the weatherization program. That is what we all wanted to do. However, in fact, because the gentleman from Colorado [Mr. Skaggs] placed $3.5 million more into that program, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Regula] made a point of order that any more money going into that program would be out of order.  What the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] is doing is attempting to put $50 million into a fund for the State Energy Conservation Program, which has not been amended. So I would argue very strongly that the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Regula] is incorrect that this is a fund that has not been amended, and that the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Fox] is in fact in order.                         parliamentary inquiry
