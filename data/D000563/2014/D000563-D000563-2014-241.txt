President, I rise to address the horrific series of events which have occurred in Eastern Ukraine within the last week. The shooting down of a civilian Malaysian airliner and the killing of 298 innocent people is an unspeakable tragedy and one that, frankly, speaks out for us to address in terms of the responsibility.  In this situation in Eastern Ukraine there are armed thugs who are in control of the territory where this plane was shot down. They have been armed, financed, and inspired by Vladimir Putin and the Russians. That is the grim reality. All signs point to the fact that Putin, the Russians, and their supporters in Eastern Ukraine are responsible for this terrible tragedy--the loss of 298 lives.  I was in Ukraine a few weeks ago with Senator McCain and others, and it was at a time when Crimea was about to fall. It was clear then the Ukrainians did not have the capacity to stop this effort by Putin to take over territory--and he did. Then that wasn't enough. He had to reach into Eastern Ukraine for even more territory, stirring up problems, creating havoc, and, sadly, bloodshed in the process.  It is bad enough the Ukrainian citizens themselves were victims, but now 298 innocent people on a civilian airliner were shot down over this territory. As I have said, the evidence points directly to Moscow and its complicity in this horrible event.  This is a photo which has been distributed showing pro-Russian separatists holding up some of the personal effects of the victims of the Malaysian airline flight that was shot down. What is happening there since the crash is also nothing short of horrific.  At this moment in time in virtually any other place in the world, save perhaps North Korea, international inspectors would be on the scene determining the cause of that plane's crash and, of equal or even greater importance, making certain the recovery effort of the victims of this crash was done by the standards of civilized nations. But the Eastern Ukrainian separatists, inspired by Putin and Moscow, have refused to allow these people in.  What we are hearing in reports is horrible. The corpses of these victims are being taken and placed in refrigerator cars on trains. Imagine the anguish of the families associated with those victims as they hear this--a loved one shot out of the sky in a civilian airliner apparently because of some folly by Eastern Ukrainian, Russian-inspired thugs and now they cannot even recover the remains of the people they love--let alone a serious objective investigation about the cause of that crash.  It is hard to imagine that Vladimir Putin could let it reach this point and harder still to imagine that he doesn't own up to his responsibility. It is horrifying that we have reached this point where this terribly tragic scene goes from bad to worse as Putin's thugs go through the personal effects of the people who were shot down.  There is a list of those who were lost. I know the Presiding Officer from the State of Indiana has a particular attachment to one of the victims--this one--Karlijn Keijzer, a student at Indiana University. This was well publicized in the Midwest--that we lost this beautiful woman, a victim of this tragic crash.  There were more--297 more--who died. They included Quinn Lucas Schansman, a 19-year-old U.S.-Dutch citizen who was born in the United States but whose family moved back to the Netherlands when he was young. He was on his way to visit his grandfather in Indonesia.  This is Joep Lange, a renowned Dutch AIDS researcher traveling with his partner to the International AIDS conference in Australia.  I mentioned Karlijn Keijzer, doctoral student at Indiana University in Bloomington. She was going on vacation with her boyfriend when this plane was shot down.  Sister Philomene Tiernan was a 77-year-old Roman Catholic nun who was returning to her school in Australia where she had taught thousands of students over her 30-year vocation.  Andrei Anghel, 24, was a Canadian medical student going on vacation with his girlfriend.  Sri Siti Amirah, an 83-year-old, was step-grandmother of Malaysia's prime minister. She was heading to Indonesia to celebrate the end of Ramadan.  Shazana Salleh, 31 years old, was a flight attendant on the plane. Her father told the media this was her dream, to be a flight attendant.  And this heartbreaking photo is of Shuba Jaya, 38 years old, Paul Goes, and their 1-year-old daughter Kaela. Shuba was a Malaysian actress, her husband a Dutch businessman. They were returning to Malaysia from Holland after showing their daughter to her husband's parents.  These victims of Mr. Putin's recklessness and their grieving families deserve more than the tragic and revolting actions occurring now in Eastern Ukraine. The Russian people--not the leadership but the people of Russia--deserve better.  The Russian people have a proud history of accomplishment in so many different fields. But President Putin has created a climate of fear in his country, where those who dissent to his policies will be punished. His use of Soviet-style propaganda and intimidation, shutting down of independent media and voices, and his strong-arming of other peaceful nations are, sadly, an insult to the great achievements and legacy of the Russian people.  I hope Mr. Putin still sees the importance of being a responsible world leader. There is little evidence of it in recent weeks. He can start almost immediately by calling off his shameful proxies who are so disrespecting the victims and their families at this crash site--the site for which he is most certainly responsible.  My thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the victims.  To our Dutch friends who suffered such an overwhelming loss of life in this crash, I express my deepest condolences. And to the people of Ukraine, the Baltics, Poland, and everywhere else facing Russian bullying, we stand with you in your desire for democracy and peaceful relations with the West and Russia.  Earlier this evening we considered three nominations and two passed by voice vote. One of those passed by voice vote was Michael Lawson of California for the rank of Ambassador during his tenure of service as representative of the United States of America on the Council of the International Civil Aviation Organization.  The reason I bring that to the attention of the Senate is he was nominated last September and reported out of the Foreign Relations Committee in May. Mr. Lawson has been sitting on the calendar. There was no objection to him. No one had any objection to him, but he was sitting on the calendar because of objection on the Republican side of the aisle. Why was his name called today? Because of this tragedy--because this tragedy pointed out the fact that the United States would not have its representative before this important organization which investigates these airline crashes.  It has reached a point where almost 30 Ambassadors to organizations and nations are being held up on the floor of the Senate over and over until something happens--an upheaval, a tragedy--and then they are brought for a vote.  The United States of America is a better nation than that. We shouldn't be holding up in the Senate these fine men and women who are willing to serve our Nation. I urge my colleagues to reconsider this approach. Let us release these ambassadorial appointments by President Obama. For those that are controversial, so be it; let's hold them. But the vast majority of these are not controversial. Let's give them a chance to serve our Nation.                          ____________________
