 President, the best time to target a new drug with uncompromising enforcement pressure is before abuse of that drug has overwhelmed our communities.  That is why I introduced legislation last Congress to place tight federal controls on the date rape drug Rohpynol--also known as Roofies--which was becoming known as the Quaalude of the Nineties as its popularity spread throughout the United States.  My bill would have shifted Rohpynol to schedule 1 of the Federal Controlled Substances Act. Rescheduling is important for three simple reasons:  First, Federal re-scheduling triggers increases in State drug law penalties, and since we all know that more than 95 percent of all drug cases are prosecuted at the State level, not by the Federal Government, it is vitally important that we re-schedule.  Second, Federal re-scheduling to schedule 1 triggers the toughest Federal penalties--up to a year in prison and at least a $1,000 fine for a first offense of simple possession.  And, third, re-scheduling has proven to work. In 1984, I worked to reschedule Quaaludes, Congress passed the law, and the Quaalude epidemic was greatly reduced. And, in 1990, I worked to re-schedule steroids, Congress passed the law, and again a drug epidemic that had been on the rise was reversed.  Despite evidence of a growing Rohpynol epidemic, some argued that my efforts to re-schedule the drug by legislation were premature. Accordingly, I agreed to hold off on legislative action and wait for a Drug Enforcement Administration decision on whether to schedule the drug through the lengthy and cumbersome administrative process.  As I predicted, the DEA report on Rohpynol--handed down in November--correctly concludes that despite the rapid spread of Rohpynol throughout the country, DEA cannot re-schedule Rohpynol by rulemaking at this time.  The report notes, however, that Congress is not bound by the bureaucratic re-scheduling process the DEA must follow. Congress can--and in my view should--pass legislation to reschedule Rohpynol.  Specifically the report states: ``This inability to reschedule [Rohpynol] administratively . . . does not affect Congress' ability to place [the drug] in schedule 1 through the legislative process''--as we did with Quaaludes in 1984 and Anabolic Steroids in 1990.  Let me also note that the DEA report confirmed a number of facts about the extent of the Rohpynol problem:  DEA found more than 4,000 documented cases--in 36 States--of sale or possession of the drug, which is not marketed in the United States and must be smuggled in.  ``In spite of DEA's inability to reschedule [Rohypnol] through administrative proceedings, DEA remains very concerned about the abuse'' of the drug.  ``Middle and high school students have been known to use [Rohypnol] as an alternative to alcohol to achieve an intoxicated state during school hours. [The drug] is much more difficult to detect than alcohol, which produces a characteristic odor.''  ``DEA is extremely concerned about the use of [Rohypnol] in the commission of sexual assaults.''  ``The number of sexual assaults in which [Rohypnol] is used may be underreported''--because the drug's effects often cause rape victims to be unable to remember details of their assaults and because rape crisis centers, hospitals, and law enforcement have only recently become aware that Rohypnol can be used to facilitate sex crimes.  Nonetheless, ``DEA is aware of at least 5 individuals who have been convicted of rape in which the evidence suggests that [the Rohypnol drug] was used to incapacitate the victim.'' ``The actual number of sexual assault cases involving [the drug] is not known. It is difficult to obtain evidence that [the Rohypnol drug] was used in an assault.''  I would also note that my efforts to re-schedule this drug have already had beneficial results: The manufacturer of Rohypnol recently announced that it had developed a new formula to minimize the potential for abuse of the drug in sexual assaults.  This is an important step. But pills produced under the old Rohypnol formula are still in circulation, and pills made by other manufacturers can still be smuggled in. Furthermore, the new formula will not prevent kids from continuing to ingest this dangerous drug voluntarily for a cheap high.  In short, stricter, Federal controls remain necessary; and DEA is powerless to respond to Rohypnol abuse until the problem gets even worse.  Therefore, I am reintroducing my bill to re-schedule Rohypnol in schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act. I urge my colleagues to support this effort to take action against this dangerous drug now, rather than waiting for the problem to develop into an epidemic.  My bill also places ``Special K''--ketamine hydrochloride--a dangerous hallucinogen very similar to PCP, on schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act. Despite Special K's rising popularity as a ``club drug'' of choice among kids, the drug is not even illegal in most States. This has crippled Stateauthorities' ability to fight ketamine abuse.  For example, in February 1997, two men accused of stealing ketamine from a Ville Platte, Louisiana veterinary clinic and cooking the drug into a powder could not be prosecuted under State drug control laws because ketamine is not listed as a Federal controlled substance.  Similarly, a New Jersey youth recently found to be with possessing and distributing ketamine could be charged with only a disorderly persons offense.  Prosecutors are trying to combat increased Ketamine use by seeking lengthy prison terms for possession of the drugs--like marijuana--that users mix with Ketamine, but if it is just Special K, there's nothing they can do about it.  I am convinced that scheduling Ketamine will help our effort to fight the spread of this dangerous drug by triggering increases in State drug law penalties.  Without Federal scheduling, many States will not be able to address the Ketamine problem until it is too late and Special K has already infiltrated their communities.  Medical professionals who use Ketamine--including the American Veterinary Medical Association and the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists--support scheduling, having determined that it will accomplish our goal of ``preventing the diversion and unauthorized use of Ketamine'' while allowing ``continued, responsible use'' of the drug for legitimate purposes. [Letter from Mary Beth Leininger, D.V.M., President of the American Veterinary Medical Association]  And the largest manufacturer of Ketamine has concluded that ``moving the product to schedule III classification is in the best interest of the veterinary industry and the public.'' [Letter from E. Thomas Corcoran, President of Fort Dodge Animal Health, a Division of American Home Products Corporation].  Scheduling Ketamine will give State authorities the tools they desperately need to fight its abuse by young people--and end the legal anomaly that leaves those who sell Ketamine to our children beyond the reach of the law--even when they are caught ``red-handed''. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  In addition to raising controls on Rohypnol and Ketamine, the legislation I am introducing today would increase the ability of the Attorney General to respond to new drug emergencies in the future.  Our Federal drug control laws currently allow the Attorney General limited authority to respond to certain new drugs on an emergency basis--by temporarily subjecting them the strictest Federal control while the extensive administrative procedure for permanent scheduling proceeds.  But the Attorney General has not been able to use this authority to respond to the Rohypnol and Special K emergencies--because she does not have authority to--move drugs from one schedule to another, or to schedule drugs that the Food and Drug Administration has allowed companies to research but not to sell.  This amendment would grant the administration this important authority by--authorizing the Attorney General to move a scheduled drug--like Rohypnol--to schedule I in an Emergency; by applying emergency rescheduling authority to ``investigational new drugs''--like Special K--that the Food and Drug Administration has approved for research purposes only, but not for marketing.  And by providing that a rescheduling drug remains on the temporary schedule until the administrative proceedings reach a final conclusion on whether to schedule.  This legislation would give the Attorney General the necessary tools to respond quickly when evidence appears that a drug is being abused. I urge my colleagues to support the bill.                                 ______                                       By
