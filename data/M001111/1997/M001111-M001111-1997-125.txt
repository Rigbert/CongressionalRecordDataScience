 President, I am very pleased to join with my colleaguesas an original cosponsor of the Employment Nondiscrimination Act of 1997. I speak as a strong supporter of this legislation, because I have always believed that every single American deserves fair treatment under the law no matter their gender, race, religion, or sexual orientation.  As one of only a few women to ever serve in the U.S. Senate, and the first ever from Washington State, I understand what it means to be part of a group that seeks fairness and equal opportunity. I have never advocated for any special protection or special class, just equal treatment and protection under the law.  Not long ago, many thought it would be impossible for women to serve in the Senate, much less elected office of any kind. It was felt that this was not a suitable occupation for a woman and that by simply being a woman, meant you were incapable of meeting the demands of the job. It was alleged that women would take offense to the unpleasant world of politics and that the presence of women would somehow jeopardize the work done in the U.S. Congress. While these statements may seem impossible to believe today, they do illustrate what many women faced. However, these stereotypes were overcome, and I am confident that none of my colleagues today would deny the tremendous contributions women have made here, in the House, in State and local government, and at every level of public service.  People suffer when stereotypes based on fear or ignorance are used to justify discrimination. I do not believe elected leaders serve our country well if they deny any citizen equal opportunities and equal treatment under the law. A person's success or failure must depend on their qualifications, skills, efforts, and even luck. But, no one should be denied opportunities because of their race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation.  I am continually disappointed when I hear about cases of economic discrimination based solely on one's sexual orientation. It defies logic that in today's society any employer could refuse to hire an individual, deny them equal pay, or professional advancement and subject them to harassment simply because of their sexual orientation. We have a proud history of ensuring basic civil rights for all Americans. We have enacted landmark legislation that seeks to guarantee equal opportunity, but we have failed to ensure that these protections are extended to all Americans. The Employment Nondiscrimination Act will correct this wrong.  As we would all agree, discrimination based on race, gender, ethnic origin, or religion is not just unfair, but illegal as well. ENDA would simply add sexual orientation to this list. It is written even more narrowly than current law, because it does not allow positive corrective actions such as quotas or other preferential treatment. All it says, is a person cannot be treated differently in any decision related to employment, based on their sexuality--whether they are heterosexual or homosexual. Mr. President, this is a reasonable expectation and in fact it has been adopted by nine States, many local governments across the country, and many Fortune 500 companies, who recognize that it simply makes good business sense to value each and every one of their employees equally. It is time our laws reflect these values as well.  To my colleagues who believe this bill would result in increased litigation, I would ask these questions: Should we then have denied women equal rights, because it would have increased the number of cases in our courts? Should we have allowed segregation to continue because of the threat of litigation? Did the Framers of our Constitution think about caseloads in our courts when they guaranteed religious freedom?  My answer to these questions is a strong, clear ``no'', and I am surprised at the arguments against this legislation. They sound hauntingly familiar to the ones we have heard in the past against allowing women, the disabled, religious members, and racial groups equal protection under the law and equal economic opportunity.  Mr. President, this is not about one group's protection at another's expense. It is about common sense, common decency and about our fundamental values as Americans.  To quote former Senator Barry Goldwater, ``anybody who cares about real moral values understands that this is not about granting special rights, it is about protecting basic rights.''  In the last Congress, we came within one vote of adopting this important, bi-partisan legislation. I urge my colleagues to support this measure so that we can continue our proud tradition of protecting basic civil rights and opportunity for all Americans. If we do not pass this bill, our sisters and brothers, sons and daughters will remain vulnerable to discrimination. We can do better than that.                          ____________________
