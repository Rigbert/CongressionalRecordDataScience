Mr. Chairman, I would say just one thing. I was not going to get involved in this argument. But the concept that a judge can raise taxes on the public without due representation is inappropriate.  Secondly, when we hear these scare tactics about clean water and clean air and all these good things in this bill, that is pure nonsense. States have the authority to do this to begin with. The States have the right to do it, and they should do it.  I am going to suggest, I have seen small communities that EPA and other agencies have required to do certainthings and they have gone broke. They have lost their schools, they lost other facilities in the infrastructure because of the agency saying they had to raise certain amounts of money to put in certain standards in that area.  I am suggesting, respectfully, that this amendment is a mischievous amendment that will give back the authority for judges. And I do not particularly like judges to begin with. I want to tell my colleagues right now, especially those that are appointed and have a life expectancy. I think it is also time to let them recognize that the people should be represented in this Congress.
