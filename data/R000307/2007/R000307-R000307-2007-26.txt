This amendment is in the interest of Kansas and our national security. I request up to $1 million be made available for Materials Integrity Management Research for Air Force Systems, MILTEC. This project aims to develop advanced wireless sensors to be optimally placed for aircraft structure health monitoring. The processed data will provide diagnostic and prognostic information that can be further used to assist in critical mission planning. MILTEC is currently operating through Wichita State University in Wichita, KS. I have no personal, familiar, or political connection to these projects.                           Amendment No. 3128
