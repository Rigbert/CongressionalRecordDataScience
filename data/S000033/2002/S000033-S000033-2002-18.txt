 Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, the American people are outraged at the degree to which corporate America has ripped off investors and workers, and millions of American employees are equally outraged at the degree to which corporate America has ripped off their pension plans.  Let us pass this amendment. Let us join with the AARP, let us join with the AFL-CIO, let us join with the Pension Center and say ``yes'' to American workers that they deserve what they have been promised.
