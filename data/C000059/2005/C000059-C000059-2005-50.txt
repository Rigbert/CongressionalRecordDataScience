 Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Boehlert); the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Gordon), the ranking member; and the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Udall), the ranking subcommittee member.  We have worked out a good bill. This is a good rule. This recognizes the importance of human exploration, robotics, science, aeronautics. This is a good compromise, a good bipartisan solution. Let us move this rule and get on to the general debate.  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich).
