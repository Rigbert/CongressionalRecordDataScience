I thank the gentleman for bringing that up.  Back in 1984, when President Reagan first announced the Mexico City policy, it was designed to separate abortion from family planning. It got its name, as I know the gentleman knows, Mexico City policy because it was at a U.N. conference that the venue was in Mexico City; hence, its name. But it was a very well calibrated, very thoughtful policy which said that there ought to be a very bright line of demarcation between family planning and abortion, and that we would only fund those foreign nongovernmental organizations that divested themselves of lobbying, promoting, and performing abortions as a method of family planning.  It was a policy that worked. NGOs got funding. We are the largest provider of family planning in the world. But now, the organizations that will receive those funds, and we are talking about over one-half billion dollars per year of taxpayer funding, will be used to promote abortions in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia, Europe, everywhere where the law still protects and safeguards the sanctity of human life.  Most of the African countries, most of the countries in Latin America protect the lives of their innocent unborn children as a matter of human rights. Now, abortion organizations, backed with huge subsidies from the Federal Government--and President Obama was the one who signed the executive order that reversed the Mexico City policy. And, as the gentleman said, and I offered the amendment on the floor that he was talking about that regrettably failed, the misguided cheers and happiness about giving money to an organization that completely targets innocent babies in the womb for destruction.  We live in 2009. As the gentleman knows, ultrasound technology, prenatal surgeries have shattered the myth that an unborn child is human and alive. Of course they are. A child in utero may need a blood transfusion or microsurgery or some other intervention, medically speaking, to abate or mitigate some anomaly before birth. I chair the Spina Bifida Caucus. Some of the early interventions for spina bifida children can have a marvelous quality of life impact later on, from birth on. But you do it before birth.  Bernard Nathanson, as my distinguished colleague knows, was the leading abortionist in the seventies. He founded, along with Betty Friedan and Lawrence Lader, NARAL, one of the biggest pro-abortion organizations in this country. He changed positions after he was doing surgeries and looking at the unborn child as a patient at St. Luke's Hospital in New York. He ran an abortion clinic, was a big activist for years, and then became a pro-lifer. And he wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine, and I quote, ``I have come to the agonizing conclusion that I have presided over 60,000 deaths.'' And then he became a pro-lifer. And now he has spoken out for many years on behalf of the human rights of the unborn, and that the women are injured, the babies are victimized and killed, and that this death and destruction to our offspring and to our women and to mothers must cease.  We now are exporting. We don't export enough. We certainly don't export enough commodities. Our economy has been hurting for a number of months now and even years. What we are exporting, tragically, is abortion, and the taxpayers of America are the ones who are subsidizing that, enabling that promotion of abortion in Africa and Latin America and elsewhere.  There was a famous movie years ago, and my friend and colleague from Iowa probably saw it, The Ugly American. You know, I love what we can do foreign policy-wise to help and to ennoble and to make healthier people around the world, whether it be on AIDS treatments and all the other things that occur internationally, hunger alleviation, clean water, safe blood.                              {time}  2115  But abortion takes all that. It tells people in the developing world, just like the vision of Margaret Sanger that we don't want you. That your children are not--are dehumanized and are expendable. As the great Henry Hyde used to say, liable to extermination. You can terminate the innocent and inconvenient with such ease. Who is to speak out for them? They can't speak for themselves because of their immaturity and their dependency.  So I congratulate the gentleman because the time has come, the time has truly come for America to begin a great awakening when it comes to the value, the dignity and the sanctity of human life. Abortion is violence against children. Despite all of the platitudes, all of the cheap sophistry that routinely is employed to cover up abortion, it is violence. Dismembering a child, chemically poisoning a child, inducing a miscarriage whereby the child then dies very early because of the inability to cope after being separated from the mother, all of these methods of abortion have one goal in mind, the killing of the unborn child.  Recently I watched and read a statement that Father Pavone, a priest for life actually put together. And he talked about Dr. Haskell, who is the man who came up with the partial-birth abortion method. And one of the main reasons why, and maybe the primary reason why that method was crafted, where a baby is half born, his or her brain is pierced in the back of the head and the brains are literally sucked out, was to ensure that the abortion didn't produce a live birth. Years ago, the Philadelphia Inquirer, which is just south of my district, had a big story called ``The Dreaded Complication'' and spoke about the fact that every year something on the order of 500 children survived later-term abortions only to die maybe a day later, several hours later, but some went on to be adopted. For the abortionist, this was a complication, a dreaded one. So Haskell and others decided to do away with that possibility by completely collapsing the brain cavity and sucking the brains out of a child. We get accused of inflammatory rhetoric by the pro-abortion side when we describe what it is that they do in abortion clinics. It is violence. It hurts women.  And finally, as Dr. Elvita King has said so eloquently--the niece of Dr. Martin Luther King, a woman who used to be on the other side of this issue, who had two abortions herself, and has spoken out on behalf of the unborn child and his or her mother--abortion is the ultimate civil rights movement of our day. She is the niece of Martin Luther King. She knows a thing or two about human rights and civil rights. And she says that as a society, it is time to look carefully, get rid of the platitudes, get rid of the euphemisms that have stifled true debate, words like ``choice.'' Choice to do what? To destroy an unborn child in a very vicious way. We need to protect both.  One of the most beautiful things of the group that she is a part of called ``Silent No More,'' made up exclusively of women who have had abortions, is that they reach out to women who are in crisis, who have the post-traumatic stress disorder, have grave misgivings, not right away, but maybe a couple years later, maybe several years later, and say there is a path to reconciliation and peace. That is what the pro-life movement is all about. We have never been about judgment. We have always been about enfranchisement. Protect the baby. Protect the mother in the first place. And for those who have already had abortions, who like Martin Luther King's niece, Elvita King in Silent No More and other women who have bravely spoken out on behalf of the unborn and their mothers, there are two victims, one is killed, one is injured. They need our help, our love and our compassion.  Unfortunately, they don't get that from the other side. It is called ``empowerment.'' There is nothing empowering about destroying an unborn child. And it is time--and I would hope, as the gentleman would hope, that there would be a campaign that men and women in America, Members ofCongress, who have for a long time voted the pro-abortion side, would take a second look, look at Planned Parenthood this second time. To look at, as you pointed out, what Dawn Johnson has said when she says ``Women are not fetal containers,'' that degrades the beauty and the magnificence of procreation and of life and the way we all came into this world.  So I thank the gentleman for this time and hope that there will be a new, a re-evaluation, a new reappraisal of what the culture of death has done. Fifty million unborn children have been killed since 1973, a staggering loss of human life. And as you have pointed out previously, Mr. King, there has been a very suspicious disproportionality when it comes to how many African Americans have been killed. And many, including Dr. King and others, are more than suspicious, especially given Margaret Sanger's and others' viewpoint about who is desirable and who is undesirable. So I strongly urge this re-evaluation. It needs to take place now.  Finally, and I said ``finally'' before, but this will be final, President Obama sadly and tragically, with the enormous support and the wellspring of goodwill that is being afforded him, is the abortion President. Every move he has made, whether it be the reversal of Mexico City, his embrace of the Freedom of Choice Act, which may come up on this floor some time, we don't know when, the move to get rid of conscience protections that men and women in the medical profession absolutely need so they are not complicit in killing innocent human life, taxpayer funding for abortion, the embrace of embryonic stem-cell research at a time when induced pluripotent stem cells, which are embryo like but do not require the killing of an embryo and can come right off your skin and mine and be manipulated in a way that will be lifesaving, cord blood, all the adult stem cells, the alternatives to embryonic work, embryonic has not worked, and yet with great fanfare he has embraced that at every turn. And the one that the gentleman brings to the floor tonight, Dawn Johnson, in what is truly an outrageous view, an inhumane view, a tragic view towards the sanctity of life, people of her kind and people with her perspective are embedded all over the Obama administration and will daily be promoting and proffering policies, very often in a stealthy way, that will promote the culture of death.  And to our friends in Africa, Latin America and elsewhere, watch out. The abortionists are coming. And they are coming from the Obama administration. I thank my friend.
