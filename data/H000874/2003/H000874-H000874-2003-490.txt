It is coming from the Senate, and obviously there may be amendments on it. It is our understanding that will be taken in effect from the desk as the Senate bill, voted on, and sent to the President.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will continue to yield, actually the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner) intended to mark up a partial birth abortion bill next week, but under the circumstances he wanted to accelerate the Amber alert bill and take it up earlier, and so he is putting off the markup on the partial birth abortion bill that we would bring to the floor, and then hopefully go to conference with the Senate under regular order.
