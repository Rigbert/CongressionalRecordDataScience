 You know how the national debt now is reaching a point where, if we don't intervene with a constitutional requirement for a balancedbudget, it is going to become unsustainable. Statutes have not controlled deficit spending.  I was an author of one of those statutes--former Senator Harry F. Byrd of Virginia and I as a Member of the House--back in 1979. For 15 years that law was on the books, and never in those 15 years was there a balanced budget amendment. It makes it very clear that laws will not control deficit spending.  I concluded a long time ago, as I voted on previous constitutional amendments requiring a balanced budget that didn't pass, that a constitutional amendment is a must to provide Congress with the necessary discipline.
