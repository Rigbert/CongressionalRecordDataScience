Speaker, I believe in free and fair trade among free peoples conducted under a rule of law. Our nation boasts the most open markets in the world. But not all the world's markets are open house; consequently, since 1975 our nation has amassed an enormous trade deficit that will top \1/2\ billion dollars this year.  This trade gap has resulted in:  35 years of outsourced jobs by the millions to penny wage environments.  35 years of imports dwarfing our exports.  35 years of buying from countries who will not buy as much from us.  35 years of trying to penetrate the markets of countries who contort the trade and currency rules in their favor, not ours.  As our nation climbs out of its deepest recession since the 1930s, we must rebalance our trade policies and take action to dig us out of this deep hole.  Take the case of China. The massive hemorrhage of U.S. jobs and wealth to China is staggering--in 1990 America's trade deficit with China was $10.4 billion, and by 2000 it was up to $83.8 billion. As of July of this year we are already $145.4 billion in the red to Communist China. These deficits mean lost jobs in America, a shrinking middle class as production and wealth get shifted offshore.  The evidence is all around us: Americans working harder each year, plants closing down despite increasing worker productivity. Now people's health and retirement benefits are cut, or they face unemployment, as their jobs are outsourced or destroyed  This is not a recipe for a healthy economy nor a strong nation.  How did this happen?  The Chinese are gaining a mercantilist advantage in their economic practices, which some experts call ``market Leninism.'' They manipulate trade through several devices, the most potent of which is currency manipulation.  We must take the necessary steps to create a level playing field for American workers and companies by holding China accountable for unfair devaluation by 40 percent or more of its currency.  By making the Yuan cheaper than it should be, their goods are 40 percent cheaper here and in global markets than American-made products, simply because of that government's actions.  China manipulates its currency by making massive purchases of dollars, Euros, and Yen in the global exchange markets, intervening with tens of billions of purchases of other currencies weekly.  The result: the U.S. GDP drops by 1.4 percentage points annually just because of China's currency manipulation.  Jobs are lost, factories closed, and America's competitiveness weakens.  The U.S. has the following four options:  1. Negotiate with the Chinese to end their currency manipulation. The U.S. has been in such negotiations for 6 years. The talks have failed. That is why the Currency Reform for Fair Trade Act is so important.  2. Intervene in the global currency market by selling massive amounts of dollars. Intervention would result in massive inflation and if the Chinese countered, it would not work.  3. Seek WTO approval of global sanctions. This would take 3-5 years and there is no certainty that Europe or Japan would be supportive.  4. Impose an Adjustable Currency Tariff (ACT). An ACT would be set at exactly the amount that the Yuan is undervalued. Under this proposal, the amount of the undervaluation would be set by some neutral international financial organization such as the IMF. The value of the ACT would be adjusted quarterly. As China changed the value of the Yuan, the value of the ACT tariff would be altered correspondingly. When China ended their manipulation, the ACT would be zero. This is not old-fashioned protectionism, but rather a remedy against such protectionism directed towards American-based production and jobs. The crisis is huge and we must act now.  These corrections, including passage of H.R. 2378, if taken immediately, could create an estimated 500,000 manufacturing jobs here in the United States, helping to put Americans back to work and strengthening our economy.  The Chinese government's currency policy is an impediment to this great Republic of ours. It kills American jobs and weakens our nation in the global markets. It is time that we take action to fix this broken policy and stand up for our nation.  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting yes for this bill.                          ____________________
