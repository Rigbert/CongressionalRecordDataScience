 President, I rise today to pay tribute to South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond, an institution unto himself who has served with distinction in the U.S. Senate for almost a half-century. Senator Thurmond is the longest-serving member in the history of the Senate and the second Senator in history to cast 15,000 votes. During his tenure, Senator Thurmond has been a enduring witness to history, presiding over the chamber during a tremendous transformation of the American landscape. During this time, Senator Thurmond has steadfastly remained responsible to the voters of South Carolina, who have returned him to the chamber time and time again. Senator Thurmond's enduring legacy will continue on well beyond his retirement at the end of the 107th Congress.  Senator Thurmond was born in 1902, in Edgefield, SC. His early years were spent as an Army reservist, teacher, superintendent and lawyer. Senator Thurmond won election to the South Carolina State Senate in 1933, representing his home district of Edgefield for the next five years. Senator Thurmond then became a Circuit Judge of South Carolina, just as the clouds of war descended over Europe. Never one to shy away from his duty to his country, Senator Thurmond sought and received an exemption to return to military duty. On June 6, 1944, he landed in Normandy on D-Day with the 82nd Airborne Division at the age of 42. For his service in World War II, Senator Thurmond earned eighteen decorations, medals and awards, including the Purple Heart, Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster and Bronze Star for Valor. He returned to South Carolina a war hero, and was elected Governor of the Palmetto State in 1946. In 1954, Senator Thurmond was elected to the United States Senate, becoming the first, and so far, the only politician elected to the Senate as a write-in candidate.  Senator Thurmond has dedicated his life to preserving, defending and participating in our democracy. He attended the Democratic National Convention in 1932 and voted for Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sixty four years later, he attended the Republican Convention and voted for Bob Dole. In fact, Senator Thurmond was a Democrat for thirty two years and has been a Republican for the past thirty eight. Through it all, he has managed to remain relevant, active and a force on the national scene. Just two years ago, he played a critical role in helping to line up Republican support for George Bush in the South Carolina primary, helping to secure his nomination for President of the United States.  Senator Thurmond's countless achievements and awards are a testament to his distinguished career in public service. He holds thirty four honorary degrees, is in the South Carolina Hall of Fame, and is a recipient of the Presidential Citizens Award, Presidential Freedom Award, as well as other major awards from American Legion, VFW, DAV, AMVETS, the National Guard, Army and Navy associations, farm groups, business groups, education groups and several foreign countries.  It is with great admiration for Senator Thurmond's longevity and service that I commend him for his distinguished career in Congress. No one in the history of the Senate can say that they gave more of their life to this body, and while his presence may be gone after the 107th Congress, his spirit will forever remain a part of this chamber. I wish he and his family all the best in the future.                          ____________________
