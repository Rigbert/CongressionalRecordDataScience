She was doing the right thing.  I will say something to the Senator from Iowa and ask him to comment on this. I think the Federal Government is at fault here too. Somewhere along the way, Westwood College ended up qualifying for college student loans and Pell grants. Who said they are qualified? I would challenge that based on these experiences.  Are we doing our job as a Federal Government to make sure these are truly accredited colleges and universities? I ask at this point, is there more we can do to make sure these are realschools teaching real courses that can lead to jobs?
