Speaker, I would like to say that this debate is a much bigger debate, obviously. When you are talking about government mandates, they don't stop at Federal Government and State and local government, they go on to the local units.  I remember as a youngster growing up, one of the   most notable tragedies in our area in my lifetime was a fire in Chicago at Our Lady of Angels School which unfortunately claimed the lives of scores of children. As a result of that fire, our State of Illinois established a health safety code and said that every school building in our State has to meet certain basic requirements in terms of fire exits and the like, and every school district or unit that is running a school has to comply with that health safety code.  We didn't pay for all of it by a long shot, but we basically said to the families living in my State, as I'm sure in your State, ``If you should move from one school district to the next, you have got to ask a lot of obvious questions about teachers and courses and all the rest, but you can be certain that every school is going to pass the basic test that your child is physically safe from fire in that building.''  That is a mandate, a government mandate from a higher government to a lower government, but for the peace of mind of the families and kids involved in it, we said, ``That is the appropriate thing to do for the common good.''
