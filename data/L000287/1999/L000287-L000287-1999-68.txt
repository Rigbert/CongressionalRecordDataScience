Madam Speaker, this past Sunday in the Super Bowl, the Denver Broncos defeated the Atlanta Falcons 34 to 19. It was a hard-fought game, and the Atlanta Dirty Birds came up a little short.  Today I rise to say congratulations to the Denver Broncos and to my colleague, the gentlewoman from Colorado (Ms. DeGette).  Denver won the Super Bowl and our colleague won our friendly little bet. So this morning I presented to my colleague and her staff a month's supply of Georgia peanuts and Atlanta's own Coca-Cola. Enjoy the Coke and peanuts and the victory, while you can.  Next year the Dirty Birds will be back.                          ____________________
