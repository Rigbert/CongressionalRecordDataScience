 President, I yield myself such time as I might consume, and probably all of it.  Keeping the point of order means keeping the status quo. So I am asking my friends on the other side of the aisle, what is there about the status quo on Medicare that is good and acceptable? The lack of prescription drugs? The slowness in getting cheaper generic drugs out into the market? Arbitrary caps on physical therapists? Insufficient funding for rural hospitals and long waiting lines for seeing the doctors, if Medicare people can get in to see a doctor in rural America?  I ask my colleagues, is this status quo acceptable? Apparently it is, at least to the Senators who are refusing to waive the point of order.  I say nothing about Medicare's status quo is acceptable, not doctors' cuts, not decreasing hospital and home health payments, not the lack of access to health plans in rural areas such asmine. And most of all, seniors' lack of access to prescription drugs for all these years is what I find to be most unacceptable about the reality of the status quo.  For those of you happy with the status quo, I say, try telling that to your doctors, your hospitals, and, most of all, to your seniors. You try telling these people that a technical point of order is more important than changing Medicare's status quo. I will not try, and I hope my colleagues will not try either.
