I think the Bennet amendment achieves what we wanted to achieve. I think my friend from New Hampshire in his amendment goes too far and, basically, we understand what he wants to do. He doesn't want to see us create tax credits to help families pay for health insurance premiums. He believes it is an entitlement. I think your side referred to it as such. I think it is important to help businesses and individuals who are struggling to pay health insurance premiums receive some assistance in doing so.
