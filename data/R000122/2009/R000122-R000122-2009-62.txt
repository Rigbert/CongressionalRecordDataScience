As the Senator knows, I had been concerned because the table indicates that the State of Rhode Island is one of only two States, along with Maine, that would lose funding under the increased appropriation included in this bill.  I have consulted with the Federal Highway Administration, which has produced a new estimate based on more accurate assumptions. That table has been shared with the Appropriations Committee staff. Rather than a decline of over $5 million, this estimate shows an increase of nearly $6 million for the State of Rhode Island. In addition, no State is shown to lose funding in fiscal year 2010.  Would the Senator agree that this new table is a more accurate depiction of the distribution federal highway funds?
