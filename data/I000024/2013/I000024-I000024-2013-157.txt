The only thing I disagree with is we have always had these. Statistics show they are not any more intense; they are not showing that they are getting more intense, and worse, they are just bad. The storm shelters the Senator from Michigan is speaking about, you drive through Oklahoma in the rural areas, everybody has them. We have dug them, because we have been using them for many years.  The major difference here is in the major cities; they don't have them as we do. I would say 95 percent of people in the rural areas have them, but in the city, maybe half of 1 percent, so that will be getting some attention from us.  I thank the Senator from Michigan for her thoughts.
