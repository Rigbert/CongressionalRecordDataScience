Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Republican effort to sabotage realistic and meaningful health care this year. Senators Kennedy and Kassebaum have sponsored health insurance reform legislation that is a positive first step to removing the barriers for coverage for thousands of Rhode Islanders and millions of Americans.  I am cosponsor of the Kennedy-Kassebaum bill. It will be offered as a Democratic substitute, and this bill would prohibit insurance companies from dropping coverage when a person changes jobs or preventing coverage if a person has a preexisting condition. In addition, this bill would increase the tax deduction for the self-employed from 30 percent to 80 percent by the year 2002. It is also estimated that this bill would help 25 million Americans each year, with minimal impact on individual premiums or the federal budget. In Rhode Island this would be terribly helpful for thousands of Almacs workers who were recently laid off when the store closed, a supermarket chain.                              {time}  1700  These are individuals that need this type of coverage. Regrettably, House Republicans decided against taking up this bipartisan bill. House Republicans chose instead to cater to special interests and consider a bill with controversial and costly provisions. This Republican plan will doom the prospect of meaningful health care reform this year in the Congress.  Mr. Speaker, I urge rejection of this measure.
