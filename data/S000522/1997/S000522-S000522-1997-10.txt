Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me this time and I thank her for her leadership on this issue.  Let me just begin by saying that forced abortion was rightly construed by the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal to be a crime against humanity. This House of Representatives throughout the 1980's and 1990's has repeatedly gone on the record with recorded votes to again reassert that what is going on in the People's Republic of China is eerily reminiscent of what went on during the Nazi era where forced abortion was employed with devastating consequences against particularly Polish women that the Third Reich had deemed to be expendable.  It is an exploitation of women. It steals their children. It is a State-sponsored rape, and the baby dies a very cruel and merciless death either by chemical poisoning or by dismemberment. We know for a fact, and there has been much documentation on this, that many of these babies are killed very late in pregnancy. The mothers desperately want to have these children. They often try to evade the population cadres, the family planning cadres who scour the countryside looking for these women and then if they find that they are with child, they then hound them, they browbeat them, they use peer pressure and a host of other techniques of psychological persuasion, and if that does not work, then they make an example of them and truss them and get them to these abortion mills.  Just a few weeks ago, the Chinese government rolled out another hideous manifestation of this forced abortion policy. They announced about 600, according to a wire service copy, 600 new mobile abortion clinics. We put mammography and other health screening on wheels and we save lives, we mitigate the pain of breast cancer and things of that kind through those kinds of detection devices. What do the Chinese do? They are putting abortion clinics on wheels, and 600 of these will join this other army of abortionists that scour the country of China to kill the babies.  I led 3 human rights trips to the People's Republic of China. I have met with Peng Peiyun, who runs the population program and she totally denies that coercion is part of their program. I have met with Li Peng, the premier of China, totally denies that there is any kind of coercion, forced abortion or forced sterilization. When the President of China, Jiang Zemin, was in town, I raised the question at the breakfast which was attended by Members of the House and the Senate about forced abortion, and again he denied it.  Let me also remind Members, because we had some people who do not usually take the pro-life point of view today speaking, we welcome their input, that the United Nations Population Fund has whitewashed these crimes against humanity since the one child per couple policy was conceived back in 1979. They have given awards. The U.N. gave an award in the early 1980s for excellence in population matters, at a time when a high tide, at a time when forced abortions and sterilizations were actually on the rise. If that does not stand with the oppressor and the exploiter of women and children, I do not know what does.  And the UNFPA, the U.N. Population Fund continues to whitewash and to defend the policy. Dr. Sadik, the Executive Director of the UNFPA, and I have met with her a number of times. She has said this to me personally, she has also said it on Night Watch, a CBS news program and other programs that are in the public domain, that the Chinese program is purely voluntary. I say to my colleagues, nothing could be further from the truth. The U.N. Population Fund stands, I believe, accused by their own words and by their complicity in this program as being complicit in the maiming and the killing of women and children in the People's Republic of China.  Civilizations, Mr. Speaker, have long been judged by how they treat women and children, old people and strangers. Vulnerable people bring out the kindness in every society. But they also bring out the cruelty. Every so often they become the object of practices that are so heinous that all of us recoil in horror. In China today, forced abortion and forced sterilization fits that.  Let me just remind Members as well that a couple of years ago the Chinese announced another manifestation of this hideous program. In 1994, they targeted the handicapped. Again in a move that was totally reminiscent of the Third Reich, they said that the Down's syndrome kids, the kids that somehow do not measure up, would be targeted for elimination as part of their eugenics policy. We need to condemn that as well. Handicapped kids are valuable. We should love them and embrace them and protect them. No government has a right to forcibly abort and kill these children because they are found to be afflicted with some anomaly like Down's syndrome or any other kind of anomaly. I chair the Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights. I have had 4 hearings on forced abortions. Let us not forget that the Clinton administration, until it finally signed the immigration bill that reversed his policy, would not even provide asylum for women who are fleeing coerced abortion and forced sterilization in China. We brought in after, and we had to subpoena these witnesses, some of the women who had suffered this cruelty of 6-month late-term abortions, forced abortions, and I will put the entire testimony of those brave women into this record. But one of the women talked about how she had found a baby girl who had been abandoned crying. And like the good Samaritan, and maybe she never even heard of that story, I think most of my colleagues have, she picked up this little girl. And what happened to her? The family planning cadre said that counts against your number. And then they visited her, and after 10 times trying to tell her and persuade her to be sterilized, they finally forced her to be sterilized.  Another woman in the hearing, and many of my colleagues were at that hearing, my wife was at that hearing, I had a tear in my eye. She broke down and could not even continue her testimony. When she talked about how latein her pregnancy, she was worn down to the point where she could resist it no more and they took her, she was broken and beaten and finally her baby was forcibly aborted as well. I urge Members, because time does not permit a full reading of this testimony, but these people have come forward. They were even being held here, I would say parenthetically because they did not get asylum until Congress passed the law that the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde] offered as an amendment to that important bill.  Finally, just let me say to my colleagues, we need to go on record, this hopefully will be a unanimous or a near unanimous vote in favor of this legislation, but I hope that it continues when we start talking about those organizations like Planned Parenthood Federation, IPPF based in London, the United Nations Population Fund. When I hear such strong words from my colleagues on the other side of the issue as we heard today, let us not forget that these organizations front, are complicit with and become very much part of the fabric of the implementation of this coercive population control program. Let us not in any way accept the bogus denials that the Jiang Zemins and the Li Pengs and Peng Peiyuns and all the others and the Dr. Sadik, who runs the UNFPA, and others offer to try to get us to take a look and say, ``Oh, maybe it's not as bad as we thought.'' We need to stand up strongly. This legislation advances the ball.  Again we will be revisiting this over and over again. When this chapter is finally written someday, those who are complicit will have shame and sorrow over their face. Let us stand with the oppressed and not the oppressor.  Mr. Speaker, the material referred to in my remarks is as follows:       I would like to introduce Weng Kang Di, who will begin. And      he and Chen Yun Fei are husband and wife. And I just would      note parenthetically have been separated for 2 years. They      are husband and wife, and this hearing provides an      opportunity for the first time, in a long time, for them to      see one another.       If you could proceed.       [Interpreter speaking in Chinese.]       Mr. Smith. Please pull the microphone very close so we can      hear the Translator as well as the witness.       [Interpreter speaking in Chinese.]       Mr. Smith. If Weng would want to proceed with his      testimony.                statement of weng kang di, asylum seeker       Mr. Weng Kang Di. My name is Weng Kang Di. And Chen Yun Fei      is my wife.       My wife will tell you what happened to us.                statement of chen yun fei, asylum seeker       Ms. Chen Yun Fei. I am a woman from the countryside, so I      do not know how to say those very polite languages. I would      like you to forgive me for that.       I come to the United States because of the Chinese family      planning program.       The reason I came to the United States is because the      Chinese Government does not allow us to have more than one      child.       Because I have more than one child, that is why they try to      suppress me, oppress me; and that is why I escaped to the      United States.       Shall I say something more specifically?       Mr. Smith. If you could give the details about your      situation, the treatment by the family planning cadres, for      example, why did you feel so threatened, whether or not you      were mistreated.       Ms. Chen Yun Fei. The Chinese Government only allows us to      have only one child, and I have three children. And that is      why they want us, people who have more than one child, to      have sterilization and also fine a certain amount of money.       If a person got pregnant, then they want you to bear the      child before it is mature. If you are pregnant, they will      force you to have abortion. So I am a woman from the      countryside. I do not want to have sterilization.       I would like to tell you my story.       I have come to the United States. I consider the U.S.      Government is a democratic government. And I believe that you      will rescue us.       Now I am going to tell you my story.       In 1982, the second child of my husband and mine were born.      And then the local government from the people's commune, from      the sterilization group, they come to our home and noticed      us, sent us notice to have me sterilized.       Because it is so imminent, I told them, yes, OK, I will go      and have sterilization. And this is a way that I pushed them      away at first.       I took the opportunity after they left, I escaped to other      places.       I can only escape by telling them I agree that I will have      sterilization. That is the only way I can get them away.       At that time, the sterilization campaign was just at the      beginning, so they were not pursuing very tightly.       In 1986, the first part of 1986, when the sterilization      program, the family program, was at its height and it is very      unfortunate that I got pregnant again. It was like a two to 3      months pregnancy I was. And at that time, the cadres of the      local government were trying to catch women every place. So      you could hear the sound of crying, you know, everywhere. And      they used the tractors to put on this big loudspeaker to tell      people that those people who are pregnant, you have to go to      have it born immature. And then if you are pregnant, you have      to have abortion--early stage of abortion. And also, after      you have abortion, you are going to have sterilization and be      fined a certain amount of money.       I did not want to have sterilization, so I was very, very      afraid. And also I was thinking even if I had sterilization,      I have to be fined and I do not have money. I am a country      woman. So I stealthily went to a place to find a medical      student who learned to be a doctor to help me to have the      abortion. This person is in private practice.       And this person, this medical student, he was very afraid.      He did not dare to help me, because he said if the government      found out he would be in trouble. It was a great risk. But I      begged this person again and again. So finally he helped me      to have this abortion.       Because he is a medical student, he did not have the full      grasp of the technique to do this abortion, so after the      abortion I got this very serious infection because we had      done that in a hurry. From then on, I was in poor health.       Now after the abortion, I went home. But on my way home, I      saw a baby girl which was only born like seven or 8 days,      lying on the road, crying very hard, and it is very weak,      this little girl. And a lot of people were watching, so I      asked people around to help this child who can take this      child home, otherwise, this child is going to die because she      has nothing to eat. But those people around said, you are      talking nonsense. You know this is the time that the campaign      is at its height; who dare to have this child home? So if you      want to rescue this child, you are the person who will bring      this child home. So I was very angry because I thought, you      know, you people did not want to help, this child is going to      die. So I said, if nobody wants to help this child, I am      going to help the child. If you are afraid of the government,      I am not afraid of the government. So finally, I took the      child home.       People were talking that this child belonged to a family,      the last name of the family was Sun. Because in China if you      do not have a son, then people will look down upon you if      there is no way for you to have a voice. So that is why the      family abandoned this child on the roadside. And I remember      what people, the last name is Sun. So I gave her a name      called Sun Sisi, still using her own last name. So I adopted      her.       So after I returned home, later the government, the cadres      of the local government, found out. And then they came to my      home saying that, you know what you did and you already have      two boys and you picked up another girl and so you have to      have the sterilization.       So I did not want to have sterilization, and I begged them      to let me have the child. And I said, what you said is really      ridiculous because this child was not my own. I just picked      her up from the roadside. But they said, since you picked up      the child, it should be accountable among your family      planning program. It belongs to you so you have to have      sterilization since you have three children.       So I told them that the reason that women, after they have      their child born, to abandon the child at the roadside was      all due to the government policy. If I did not rescue the      child, the child was going to die. And when they heard what I      said, they were very angry.       So I did not want to have the sterilization, I told them,      if you really want to have sterilization, then you go and ask      this mother of the child to have sterilization, that is the      Sun family, this girl's mother. But they said, since you      picked up, you have to go to have sterilization. So we argued      back and forth for a long time. And they came to my home      insistent that I should have this sterilization. They came      many, many times.       So they came to my home more than 10 times, and they said      this woman who dares to counter the government; so they      forced me to sterilization. I begged them that, since I had      already had one abortion, I am in poor health. So they      insisted that I am now going to have the sterilization. And      then the cadres got very angry. They said this woman is very,      very tough, very difficult to deal with; so let us have her      husband to have the sterilization.       And when my husband heard that they wanted him to be      sterilized, so he jumped out of the window and escaped. And      so I begged them, saying that, please do not have my husband      sterilized because the whole family relied on him to till the      land. Because in China we use all manual labor. You have to      carry water bucket by bucket. So everything--he is the      mainstay of the labor in the field. So I was very, very      frightened and while at the same time I was very angry. So I      fainted, and the whole family was crying and I did not know      what happened because I fainted.       That was in 1986. Now conditions are turning better. People      are using tractors. At that time everything was manual labor.      So after I came to, the whole family was crying and the      cadres were gone and my husband was back. Then I said I would      not let my husband be sterilized because I have to rely on      him to till the land. Then I decided that we have to     go because they will not let us off the hook. Either I will      be sterilized or my husband will be sterilized. So we escaped      to a place which is closed to where Mao Zedong had his      headquarters. It is a very, very tough place, a lot of      mountains and wild places, not much to eat.       That was a very baron place. I started to work mending      other people's old shoes. It is a very, very deplorable      place. The living condition is very, very little. People      slept on this bed made of mud. And at the end of the bed,      there was a stove. You put firewood in. Then the heat would      go through under the bed. That is the heat you have to have      in the winter. That is called a kang. And people all live in      the cave. So I started up--because the people were very poor,      they have to have their old shoes mended again and again. And      I started to do this to make some money.       I would not dare to go back home, and I stayed at that      place for 7 years. That place has a very, very hurricane kind      of a big storm, windy and a lot of snow in winter. People      eat, mainly, maize and sorghum.       I was very eager to back to visit to see my children and my      family, but I was afraid if I went back home I would be      caught again. So I stayed there for 7 years. But when I first      went there, this place was deplorable; there was no family      planning program going on. But after 7 years, they started      having the family planning campaign. They came to the cave      where we stayed to check so-called identification. Everyone      has an identification. They checked the identification to see      whether there is anything wrong.       I returned home in February 1993. And then shortly after      that, the government got to know that I was back and so they      came to my home saying, that, OK, now you are back; we have      been looking for you for several years; we could not find      you. And then I begged them not to--I told them that I am not      going to have more children, so please do not ask me to have      sterilization. They said, no, you are among the list; you are      still in the list; you have to have the sterilization. And      then they said, this woman is very stubborn.       So even if you have sterilization, we are going to fine      more the money that we are going to fine you. So I was very,      very angry. I told them that the money you fine you should      not use that money. if you use that money--because they      divide the money among themselves--if you use the money to      eat or something, then you will die. Then they started to      bind me, you know, to force me to the sterilization place.      And I told them that I did not do anything wrong. I was not a      robber. I did not steal anything. They only thing I had done      is to have more children than one child.       So I was very afraid because my husband, when we just      returned, when people saw these cadres were coming, they      shouted, they are coming again, they are coming again. So my      husband left again. He escaped. I told him that, you escape;      I will deal with them by myself. So he escaped.       I told the cadres that, do not, you know, bind me together      using a rope or something. I will go and have sterilization      by myself. So under such circumstances, I was forced to have      sterilization done.       After the sterilization, five or 6 days later, I went home;      but I was not--I did not agree with their policy. And they      are going to--because I knew they, said, they are going to      fine me more money than usual. So I though that, I do not      have the money. And then my family told me that my husband      escaped because the relatives and friends thought it is very      pathetic and they helped him to escape to a foreign country.      And I thought to myself, what am I going to do by myself; I      do not have the physical strength to till the land by myself      and they are going to fine a lot of money. And I had three      children. I did not have enough money.       So I escaped, too.       So I am here.       Mr. Smith. I thank you very much for that testimony, and      there will be some questions by members of the panel. But I      would like to ask the other witnesses if they could testify      before we go to that.       Hu Shuye, if you would not mind speaking next.                  statement of hu shuye, asylum seeker       Ms. Hu Shuye. I do not speak very well Mandarin, so please      forgive me.       I left China because of the family planning program.       I was pregnant 6 months and was forced to have an abortion.       In November I was told to have sterilization because I have      two children and one abortion already. And I did not want to      have this sterilization, and I left home for a month. And      after I came home they forced me to have sterilized.       I had no way out. They forced me. They dragged me to have      this surgery done.       Mr. Hyde. Mr. Chairman, can counsel tell the story?       Mr. Smith. Craig, would that be possible?       Mr. Hyde. Do you know her story?       Mr. Wilson. Mr. Chairman, unfortunately this lady's counsel      is not present. We could for any of the others.       Mrs. Smith. Mr. Chairman?       Mr. Smith. Yes.       Mrs. Smith. Could we let someone else testify and let her      gain her composure, please.       Mr. Smith. Yes, that is a very good idea.       I would like to ask Li Bao Yu if she could make her      statement at this point.                 statement of li bao yu, asylum seeker       Ms. Li Bao Yu. I am a Chinese citizen, and my name is Li      Bao Yu. I had a daughter born in 1990. Because I was afraid      of the family planning program, I did not register her birth.      Later the government found out, and they asked me to have an      IUD put into my body; but I begged them not to do that. But      they just approved. They insisted on having an IUD in.       So they forced me to put in this IUD. And after that, my      health deteriorated. My doctor said, you have to take this      IUD out before your health can return to normal. So my      husband and I went to this family planning office to ask them      to let me have this IUD taken out, but they did not. I      promised them that I am not going to have more children.       They did not approve our request, and my husband was very      angry; so he started to quarrel with the cadres. The cadres      threatened him: ``If you are going to continue to disobey us      and quarrel with us, then we are going to sterilize you.'' So      I persuaded my husband to go home. And then after that, my      mother found a private doctor and had my IUD taken out. After      that, my health began to improve.       In my native place, they have inspections of the family      planning program every season; and I would not dare to have      inspection because they will find out that I had this IUD      taken out by myself. But they kept on sending me notice      telling me to have this inspection. I always gave them      excuse, I am not home; but they came to my home many times.      They could not find me, so they were very angry. In January I      became pregnant again. After 3 months, they still could not      find me. One day they came and I happened to be home, so they      wanted me to go have an exam.       My husband at that time was not home because he was * * * I      said: ``Let me wait until he comes home. Then I will * * *      this exam.'' They disapproved. They did not agree. So * * *      dragged me to the place to have the exam. After the exam * *      * course, they go to know that I was pregnant and had * * *      taken out. They wanted me to have an abortion. I begged them.      They did not agree. They threatened me saying that, if you do      not have this abortion, then your first child, your daughter,      will forever not allow to have her identification registered.      Because in China if you register a born baby, you have      certain kind of coupons, whatever. They threatened me that if      I do not agree to have this abortion, then my first child      will forever have no chance of being a registered, normal      citizen.       Mr. Smith. If I could interrupt, does that mean denial of      education or health care or job opportunities? What does that      mean?       Ms. Li Bao Yu. Yes.       So I was forced to have this abortion. And after that, my      health was very poor. Because that was a hospital in the      countryside, the hygienic conditions is not very good. I had      a very negative impact on my health. I was bleeding      profusely. And they wanted me to have sterilization following      the abortion. But the doctor said since I was bleeding so      much, it is not possible to have sterilization immediately.       I was not in a condition to return home, so I stayed in the      hospital; and my husband came to visit me in the hospital. He      was very angry and argued with the cadres. And the doctor had      nothing--there is nothing that the doctor can do for my poor      health. So the cadres from the family planning office, they      kept on arguing with my husband. They have the power in their      hands, so we are not in a position to fight with them. After      I went home, they again said that, when your health improved      a little, you still have to have the sterilization done.       Because I am a housewife in the countryside, I have to do      everything at home. My husband was a worker at the time. But      since my health was poor, I could not do so much. I felt      burdened. Sometimes I went to my sister's place to see a      doctor. And sometimes my husband stayed alone at home. And      the family planning program office kept on telling me that      when you have your health improved, you have to have the      sterilization. Later my husband escaped to his relative's      home and I escaped to my sister's home.       So none of us would dare to go home. Later, because of my      husband's work--the need for his work, so he has to return      home. Then the family planning office informed him to asked      him to inform me to go and have the sterilization. They      insisted on that. And my husband told them that, my wife was      still sick. So they argued again. And then they said: ``If      you argue with us, then you go and have the sterilization.''      And they then started to struggle with each other, and he      escaped later.       My husband thought at that time that under such      circumstances it is not going to maintain peace any more.      They will, anyway, come to force us to have sterilization. So      through somebody's recommendation, my husband escaped to the      United States.       After my husband left China, I was at home by myself. My      health was still not very good--no, she was not at home at      first. She would not dare to go home. But her health was not      good.       In 1992, during the Chinese New Year, she wanted to go home      to spend the New Year together with her family; so she      returned. After a few days, she did not know how they found      out. The family program cadres came to my home again and      forced--pressuring me to have sterilization. At that time, I      escaped through the back door.       I thought, since my husband was not home, they would not      pursue me any more; but it     was not the case. They kept on pressuring me. I would not      dare go home. That means, even if I had had a home, I cannot      go home. Under such circumstances, my mother and other      relatives, they helped me to find a way to escape to the      United States.       Mr. Smith. The bells that you heard, just by way of      explanation, means that there are votes again occurring on      the House floor. We will take a very short break and then      resume some of the questioning as Members do return.       Again, just let me say before we break for recess--and      perhaps you could translate this for them--hearing you tell      your stories--and I think I speak for everybody on this panel      and I speak for Members of the Congress, both parties,      Democrats and Republicans--you really represent the voices      and the tears of the women of China. The crimes that have      been committed against you and against the women of China are      no less serious than the crimes that were committed by the      Nazis.       It is even more appalling when we realize that the Clinton      administration wants to send you back to your oppressors. And      when we realize that groups like the U.N. Population Fund      stand by and cheer as China achieves these targets in      population control when every one of those numbers represents      a person who has been injured, made sick, exploited, and hurt      by their government.       The subcommittee is in recess for 10 minutes.       [Recess.]       Mr. Smith. The subcommittee will resume its hearing. Again,      I want to thank our witnesses for their very, very eloquent      statements and for their willingness to tell us in such      detail the difficulties that they have encountered and the      exploitation that they have experienced.       It is my understanding that Hu Shuye, you might be willing      to and able to, perhaps, proceed with some of your testimony.      If you could tell us, and be as brief as you would like, some      of the particulars about the government's coercive abortion      that they inflicted upon you at 6 months.       The Interpreter. She said she does not know how to speak,      so if you could ask questions, she will be able to answer.       Mr. Smith. When the government found you were pregnant,      what kind of means did they use to force you to undergo the      abortion?       The Interpreter. Let me explain for us, because Ms. Hu said      her Mandarin is not good enough to express herself.       Mr. Smith. Right. I remember that from earlier.       The Interpreter. So she is using her own dialect. And Ms.      Chen is translating her dialect to me, and I will translate      to you.       Mr. Smith. All right. Thank you.       Ms. Hu Shuye. They said--there were between 30 to 40 that      came to my home. And they said, since you have three      children, you have to have an abortion since you are now,      again, pregnant. So they dragged me to have an abortion.       Mr. Smith. Did they literally drag her?       Ms. Hu Shuye. There was a car, and these 30 to 40 people      dragged me onto the car and then drove away.       Mr. Smith. Prior to that, were there attempts to persuade      her to abort the child?       Ms. Hu Shuye. They did ask me to have this abortion. Then      since I was not willing to, they moved all my furniture,      whatever I had at home, to the government office.       I was forced to have an abortion in June when I was 6      months pregnant. And then in November, they came again to      force me to have sterilization.       I escaped in November. And in December, my mother-in-law      got cancer and passed away on December 17th. So I went home      to attend the funeral. And then on the 20th, the family      program office got to know that I was home; so they came and      dragged me away to have an abortion.       I was forced to have an abortion when I was 6 months      pregnant. And then after that, they wanted me to have      sterilization. So I escaped in November. And then in December      I went back for the funeral. And then I was forced to have      sterilization. And then after a few years, in 1989, the      family program office told me that, you have too many      children, you should be fined a certain amount of money.       Mr. Smith. So she was fined for the children that she had      is what you are saying.       You know, I would like to yield to Mr. Hyde. He has a      comment.       Mr. Hyde. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.       I wonder if I might ask both counsel to answer these      questions:       We have heard heart breaking stories of oppression and      torture and a denial of one of the primary human rights,      civil rights, namely, the right to have children. And I am      appalled at what I have heard.       But I am equally appalled at my own country at what state      these women find themselves in the ``Land of the Free,'' and      the ``Home of the Brave,'' ``Give me your Tired, your poor,      Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.''       I understand they are under arrest, they are under      manacles. Now, I well know that for years Soviet Jewish      people, who could get an exit visa, all came here as refugees      because by definition they were persecuted, being Jewish      people, in the Soviet Union. And they came here by the      thousands. And many of them did not have family here, and it      was not a question of reunification but under asylum. Because      they were persecuted, they were permitted to come in here.
