 President, this morning I am pleased to join my friend and colleague, the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Senator Dodd, in supporting the pending amendment.  When a crisis such as the one we are now facing arises, I believe the American people expect us to provide effective and timely solutions. Chairman Dodd and I have worked together to develop a package of targeted measures intended to help stabilize and strengthen the housing and the financial markets. We chose not to pursue partisan goals here. Instead, we are focusing our efforts on achieving the best possible results in a bipartisan fashion. I commend the chairman for his willingness to work with me in this manner.
