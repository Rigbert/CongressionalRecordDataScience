Speaker, the Music Modernization Act, which the House is considering is a major step forward in providing fairness for those in the music industry. This legislation updates several key provisions of U.S. copyright law regarding music licensing, including the creation of a single licensing entity to administer mechanical reproduction rights for digital music compositions, and the establishment of royalty payments for pre-1972 artists. I am proud to support it.  While this legislation is a major achievement, there are additional issues around the public performance of musical works which have been a priority for me that must be addressed. Specifically, we need to address the fact that venues such as restaurants, bars, hotels, wineries, breweries and other retail establishments cannot rely on the repertories published by the Performing Rights Organizations to make decisions about what music to play. I've heard from many business owners in my district throughout the years that have had to decrease their use of live music as a result of a complicated and convoluted music licensing process. Currently, they face a ``take it or leave it'' situation: Either buy licenses from all the Performing Rights Organizations or don't play music. This not only hurts small businesses, it hurts the artists when their music isn't played.  This problem certainly isn't localized to Wisconsin. It's happening throughout the entire country, and it's up to Congress to take the necessary steps to fix it. For this reason, I introduced H.R. 3350, the Transparency in Music Licensing and Ownership Act, last year. This bill would establish a fully searchable, up-to-date, comprehensive digital database of historical and current copyright ownership and licensing information. By increasing transparency we can help ensure that when a business pays a music licensing fee, it knows exactly what it is buying. It is my hope that this and other issues can be addressed in subsequent legislation.                          ____________________
