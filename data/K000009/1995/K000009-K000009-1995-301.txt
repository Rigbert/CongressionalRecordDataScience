They are working families who earn such low wages with such low benefits because their jobs have essentially been cashed out, they have to be in the embarrassing position, and I have seen some of them, of applying for these food stamps, because they can no longer earn a living wage in the United States of America. Frankly, I think that should be unconstitutional. I think these people should be able to earn a decent wage.  I met a woman the other day, I went into one of the stores to buy like these muffins in the morning. I met a woman working three part-time jobs. She was a divorcee, and she must be putting in 60 or 70 hours a week just to support herself. It is sobering to meet these families, and there are millions of them across our country. They have very little voice here.  We have been joined by our distinguished colleague from the State of New York, from Buffalo, NY, Chairman John LaFalce, Committee on Small Business, chairman of subcommittees on the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs, and someone who was right month and months ago and they would not listen to you, Chairman LaFalce. They would not listen to you. And I hope that the citizens of Buffalo understand what kind of voice they have here in Washington, not just for themselves but for the Nation and the world.  There are few Members of this body that understand as much about finance, and I think you talked yourself until you were blue in the face to try to get provisions in the NAFTA accord to deal with this very crisis, and they would not do it. They tried to ride their tractors right over you. You probably still got skid marks on your spine. Yet you were right. As I said a little bit earlier, this is one of those instances where it hurts to have been right.  We welcome you this evening. I yield you time.  Mr. LaFALCE. Thank you very much. First of all, I want to congratulate the gentlewoman from Ohio for the tremendous leadership she has shown, not simply on this issue, but on all issues affecting the industrial manufacturing service sector within the United States, especially as international trade impacts on those issues and our domestic workers.  I have long been concerned with the problems of Mexico and the problems of the Mexican people. I remember well August 1982, when the debt crisis first erupted, and I engaged in a great many meetings at that time with the point man for the Reagan administration, Tim McNamara, who was also a fellow graduate of Villanova University, Deputy Secretary of the Treasury. I believed firmly at that time that we had a responsibility to help the Mexican people in Mexico. I believed firmly that we should engage in leadership on the issue of debt relief. And we pretty much ran up against deaf ears.  I remember in 1982 going to a meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in Toronto in order to discuss these and so many other issues. Again, I remember the speech that President Reagan gave at the time. We must rely on the magic of the marketplace. Beryl Sprinkel was quite active in the Treasury Department too. He presented a good many difficulties in dealing with a human, considerate, responsible way with the problem.  In 1986 I was able to get two provisions in the omnibus trade bill that we passed at that time. One dealt with exchange rates, and one dealt with debt relief. Unfortunately, President Reagan vetoed that bill, and in vetoing the bill, he cited four specific provisions. Three of them were provisions that I had authored and it would be the exchange rate provision and the debt relief provision.  Fortunately, I was able to get those provisions back in the omnibus trade bill of 1988, and they then became the law of the land.  So I have a long history of concern for the problems of Mexico in extending debt relief to them, and for the whole question of sustainable exchange rates as they impact trade and the rights of capital and the rights of labor between and amongst trading countries of the world.  I was very dissatisfied with the approach taken by Secretary of the Treasury Jim Baker when he came up with the Baker plan. It was a half-hearted effort. It just did not go nearly far enough. And I remember when Nick Brady came in as Secretary of the Treasury, he called me into the office before the November 1988 election and said we are going to go way beyond Baker, but after the election, we will come up with something new.                              {time}  1750  We will come up with something new. This turned out to be the Brady plan, which basically was what I had called for in the 1988 legislation. I remember going down and talking with the leaders of the Central Bank in Mexico at the time, still there. I remember going down and talking with the chief debt negotiator, Angel Gurria, who is the foreign minister of Mexico. I remember being invited by the President-elect Salinas to attend his inauguration on December 1, 1988.  But then we came up with a lot of new ideas, too. Despite the fact that Mexico was a greatly underdeveloped country, we were going to treat it as a fully-developed country. And because we wanted to fulfill somebody's grand vision of a free-trade agreement for the Americas, we would enter into a free-trade agreement with Mexico, called NAFTA.  I had strongly favored the free-trade agreement with Canada, although even then I said we ought not to enter into that agreement without having provisions for exchange rates. Although I did not think that necessity of a provision for exchange rates was that imperative for Canada, because the swing in exchange rates, in currencies evaluations was not that great between the United States and Canada.  But with respect to Mexico, I said it was absolutely imperative. There were a number of other things that were absolutely imperative if we were to approve NAFTA and have a good agreement.  I used my Small Business Committee to have a good many hearings on some of those conditions that I thought had to be dealt with before we approved NAFTA. And so in 1992, I had hearings on the problems in Chiapas. I brought up so many of the human rights activists from Chiapas to discuss their problems. I said, these problems are festering and will soon erupt and NAFTA may make them erupt unless we do something about it beforehand.  Shortly after that, in early 1993, 2 years ago, I had a hearing on something that I thought was perhaps the most important issue that we had to deal with and could deal with within the NAFTA, and that was the issue of the valuation of the peso. I had a hearing entitled ``Whither Goest the Peso.''  We brought in some of the leading economists from around the world. And there was pretty much a general consensus at that time that the peso was overvalued by from 15 to 20 percent and that a devaluation was going to have to take place, not the trickle type of devaluation that was taking place on a day-by-day basis, but something much more significant at some point in time. And the only question was when and how harmful such a devaluation would be.  I argued that it was imperative that we anticipate that problem, deal with it in advance. And so I sent many letters. I sent, first and foremost, a letter to President Clinton, but also to the Secretary of the Treasury, at least at that time, to the present Secretary of the Treasury, who was then Chairman of the National Economic Council, to the U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor, to the head of the Business Roundtable's section on NAFTA, who at that time was the chairman of Eastern Kodak, Kay Whitmore.  I said, if NAFTA is going to pass, it ought to be a good NAFTA. It ought to be a NAFTA that protects American workers, and we cannot have a good NAFTA unless we have a provision dealing with exchange rates, something [[Page H390]] that will call for consultation, coordination, and corrective measures in the event of some type of devaluation.  Well, as the gentlewoman pointed out, my early warnings 2 years ago fell on absolute deaf ears. The problem is at that time the peso was about 3.2 to the dollar or 3,200 of the old pesos to the dollar. Of course, there had been a devaluation from 1982 to 1992 of 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 percent. We were not talking about modest devaluations. We were talking about volatile, extreme devaluation.  Let me just make this point. We have to be very careful before we go ahead and approve a $40 billion loan guarantee. The administration and the Congress, Democrat and Republican, are dedicated to doing this by next Friday without congressional hearings, without satisfactorily, without exposing this to the crucible of examination, cross-examination, public opinion.  We have to be very careful. Otherwise we are going to freeze that exchange rate in the vicinity of 5.5 or so to the dollar. And if we thought we were going to have difficulties at 3.2 pesos to the dollar, we will be unable to export to Mexico at 5.5. There will be a huge, tremendous incentive to establish American plants and other plants from around the globe in Mexico at that valuation, and this administration and this Congress does not seem concerned about it.  The only thing they seem concerned about is ensuring that there be a loan guarantee for a restructuring of the existing loans; a restructuring that in my judgment would be done without the guarantees, because the lenders have no option but to extend the maturities.  If a lender gives $100,000, the lender owes the borrower. If a lender gives $40 billion, the borrower owns the lender.  We ought to be very, very careful before we proceed. To do it without hearings, to do it without examination and cross-examination debases the democratic process.  What they are saying is, this is so important and so big that we cannot have hearings, we cannot have it tested in the crucible of public opinion, which is the committee hearing process process of the House of Representatives and the Senate. That does not wash, not in my district in any event.
