President, even though I believe we need to have a specific time in the future when Impact Aid is fully funded, I recognize there will have to be some kind of discipline in the number of amendments that are coming up to the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. For that reason, I have modified the amount down so that in the first year it will be $35 million as opposed to $78.2 million. I believe this has been agreed to on both sides.
