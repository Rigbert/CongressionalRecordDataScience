Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding public servant for Maryland, Judge John J. Garrity, who sadly passed away on April 14 at the age of eighty-two. John and I had been friends for many years, going back to the 1960's, when I was a young State Senator and he was an Assistant State's Attorney and President of the Prince George's County Young Democrats.  John began his life in the St. Joseph's Orphanage in Burlington, Vermont, and after finishing secondary school joined the U.S. Navy, where he served honorably from 1955-1959. During that time he married his wife, Bertha Ann, with whom he would spend sixty wonderful years and raise two sons, Kevin and John Jr. He earned undergraduate and law degrees from American University and began practicing law in Maryland in 1964.  John first served as Assistant State's Attorney for Prince George's County in 1967 and two years later became Assistant Attorney General for the State of Maryland. He was selected as a Prince George's County Commissioner in 1970 and then elected to the Prince George's County Council the following year, serving as its Chair in 1973. In 1974, the people of Maryland Legislative District Twenty-Two sent him to the House of Delegates in Annapolis, and in 1978 he became my colleague in the State Senate, when I was serving as its President. While in the Senate, John stood up for the rights of crime victims and sponsored legislation to ensure that victim impact statements could be given during sentencing, ensuring their voices would be heard in court. In 1982, John was appointed to the Court of Special Appeals, where he served with distinction for twelve years.  Mr. Speaker, I will miss John Garrity very dearly, and I will never forget his friendship or his kind spirit. He was so proud of his service to Maryland and to our nation, and he was proud as well of his Irish roots. My thoughts and prayers are with his Ann, Kevin, John Jr., daughter-in-law Karen, and grandchildren Kelly, Colleen, and Kerry. I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Judge John J. Garrity for lending talents and wisdom to the work of securing justice and creating opportunity for Marylanders throughout his life and career.                          ____________________
