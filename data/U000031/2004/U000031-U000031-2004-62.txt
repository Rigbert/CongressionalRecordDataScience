Speaker, I rise today to honor the dedication of Union Church in Berrien Township, as a Michigan Historical Marker. This celebrated Church has stood and continues to stand as a symbol of faith, hope, and reverence. It is vitally important to preserve our nation's sense of history and ideals, and this marker will certainly maintain both for many years to come.  On July 4, 2004, one hundred and forty-six years after its construction, Union Church's long and illustrious history was honored as a Michigan Historical Marker. I am very pleased that the communities of Southwest Michigan and Berrien Township in particular, were able to come together for this wonderful occasion and historic achievement.  Because of the dedication of individuals within the Union Church Historical Preservation Society, Southwest Michigan and our country continue to be great places to live, work, and worship.                          ____________________
