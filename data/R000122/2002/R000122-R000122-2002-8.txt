President, I rise today to introduce the ``Children's Vision Improvement and Learning Readiness Act.'' I am pleased to be joined by my colleague from Ohio, Senator DeWine, in this effort. Vision disorders are the fourth most common disability in the United States and the most prevalent handicapping condition among children. This is a startling fact when one considers that eighty percent of what children learn is acquired through vision processing information and the quality of children's eye health has a direct impact on their learning and achievement.  It is estimated that almost ten percent of children have clinically significant vision impairment, which are associated with developmental delays and the need for special education, vocational, and social services. Specifically, studies have found that among the twenty percent of school age children who have a learning disability in reading, seventy percent have some form of visual impairment, such as ocular motor, perceptual or binocular dysfunction, that could interfere with their reading skills. The ``Children's Vision Improvement and Learning Readiness Act'' recognizes the importance of diagnosing vision disorders in children at an early age so as to allow intervention at a time when these disorders are highly responsive to treatment.  Unfortunately, too many children in school today live with an undiagnosed vision impairment and too many times these same children have not had a comprehensive eye examination prior to entering school. In fact, only one-third of all children have had an eye examination or vision screening prior to entering school despite evidence that the earlier a vision problem is diagnosed and corrected, the less the potential negative impact it may have on a child's development.  In addition, undiagnosed visual problems impose economic costs on our Nation. In 1995, the economic impact of visual disorders and disabilities was approximately $38.4 billion. Yet, early, comprehensive eye exams in children can help reduce the economic and social costs associated with undiagnosed eye disorders. Providing comprehensive eye examinations to children before they enter school helps to decrease long-term medical expenditures, prevent inappropriate placement of children in special education programs, and avoid social welfare spending by improving children's ability to learn and achieve a greater degree of educational and economic attainment.  The ``Children's Vision Improvement and Learning Readiness Act'' gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services the authority to provide grants to States for a variety of educational and outreach activities related to improving and safeguarding the eye health and academic success of our nation's children. Grants may be used for the development of a voluntary statewide school-based comprehensive eye examination program for elementary school age children; the development of State-based education programs to increase public awareness of the benefits of comprehensive eye examinations; and the flexibility of providing comprehensive eye examinations through other related federal programs, such as Head Start, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, the Child Care Block Grant, and the Consolidated Health Centers programs.  This important measure will help ensure that our nation's children have access to comprehensive eye examinations from qualified health professionals so they can start school prepared for a lifetime of learning and achievement. I urge my colleagues to join me and Senator DeWine in supporting this legislation that will help to boost the well-being and academic achievement of our nation's school children.                                 ______                                       By
