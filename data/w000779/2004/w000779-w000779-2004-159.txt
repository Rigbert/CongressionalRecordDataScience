President, I so appreciate the Senator's leadership on this issue and opportunity to be a bipartisan partner in this effort. Isn't it fair to say the Federal Government is now essentially the only entity on the planet that isn't going with the kind of approach that the Senator from Missouri has been advocating? It is being done at the State level, it is being done at the local level, and it is being done through various private initiatives.  It seems to me what the Senator has identified is essentially a case for saying the Federal Government ought to join the rest of the world in its approach to this logical way. Would the distinguished sponsor of this amendment, my partner, address that briefly?
