 President, today I wish to speak on S. 994, the Protecting Religiously Affiliated Institutions Act of 2018.  First, I want to thank Senator Hatch and the other supporters of the bill. In particular, I would also like to thank the House sponsors of the bill, Representatives Kustoff and Kilmer, for their work in shepherding it through that chamber.  I am glad to see this bill finally enacted into law.  Early last year, a string of bomb threats to synagogues, mosques, and other religious affiliated institutions, such as Jewish community centers, threatened this Nation and one of its core constitutional tenants: the free exercise of religion. In the wake of these threats, the Judiciary Committee held a hearing on religious hate crimes.  Just 1 month after that hearing, two Islamic centers in northern California were attacked during Ramadan. At the largest Sacramento mosque, a burned Quran was also filled with bacon and handcuffed to a fence. That mosque alone has been targeted multiple times.  Despicable acts like these have become far too common. The statistics are startling. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, from 2014 to 2016, anti-Muslim hate crimes increased 99.4 percent, from 154 reported incidents to 307 reported incidents. There has also been a rise in anti-Semitic incidents. The Anti-Defamation League reported 1,986 anti-Semitic incidents nationally in 2017, compared to 942 in 2015, an increase of 110 percent. We heard testimony in the Judiciary Committee that this increase came after the dangerous rhetoric that was used during the 2016 election cycle.  Unfortunately, this sort of persistent hateful rhetoric continues to plague our Nation and our political discourse. This was made manifest during a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville last summer that culminated in a young woman losing her life.  The clear lesson is that all of us must strongly condemn hateful acts and state in no uncertain terms that they have no place in our country. This legislation is one way for us to do that. This bill updates the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 to specifically prohibit threats of force made against religious real property, including the property of religiously affiliated institutions.  This update is critical because, while the current law prohibits the destruction of religious real property, it did not previously specify that threats against religious real property, such as threats of violence against Jewish community centers, are also hate crimes.  Finally, while this bill addresses religious hate crimes, we must remember that the motivations behind hate crimes extend far beyond religion. It does not matter if it is a crime based on one's religion, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender, or any other element of our shared humanity.  I am hopeful that the Judiciary Committee can continue to work together to protect all victims of hate, regardless of whom they are, whom they love, where they worship, or where they are from. Thank you.                          ____________________
