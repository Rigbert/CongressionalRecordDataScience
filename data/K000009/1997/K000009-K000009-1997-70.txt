Speaker, I rise as the ranking member on the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies of the Committee on Appropriations, which means I am the lead Democrat, and to protest the action of the Committee on Rules last night in putting a tourniquet on the debate that was to have occurred on our bill.  Yesterday we had that bill on the floor, and generally it comes to the floor under an open rule. I might remind the membership that agriculture is America's most important industry. It provides our most positive balance-of-trade figures, and is an exceedingly important bill to our farmers, our food processors, our people involved in the fiber industry, the forestry industry, the fuel industry. This is not an unimportant bill.  Yet, because of anger for other reasons, for other reasons, because Members like the gentlewoman from California [Ms. Pelosi], the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Yates], and myself, the gentlewoman from Ohio [Ms. Kaptur], as ranking members of our respective committees were summarily blocked in prior weeks from bringing our amendments to the floor on other bills, we are now being punished by putting a tourniquet on the debate on the agriculture bill today.  As ranking members, we have not only been blocked from offering the amendments, but our amendments have then been given to Members of the other party. This is outrageous. In past years, I can assure you agriculture appropriations bills moved to the floor with bipartisan support. They were not the victim of ``gag'' rules. They were not used to send messages to the minority that they better behave or be punished.  So now, our agriculture bill is being forced to be debated under such limited time, that key provisions will be given short shrift, not even allowing time to explain their full meaning to the Members.  For example, on the important subject of youth tobacco prevention, the time allowed for debate is 10 minutes--to be divided 5 minutes on each side. On important commodity programs on which our families' livelihood depend--sugar, peanuts, tobacco--debate will be limited to 15 minutes per side. This is ludicrous.  Further, the rule retroactively denies many Members the ability to offer their amendments--for example, Representative Furse of Oregon on Animal Damage Control; Representative Wynn of Maryland on Civil Rights Enforcement; Representative Hall of Ohio on food assistance to Korea; and Representative Meehan of Massachusetts is allotted 5 minutes only to discuss the important Youth Tobacco Prevention initiative.  This is not the way to legislate.  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule. It truly is unfair.                          ____________________
