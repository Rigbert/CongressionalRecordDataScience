 Literally, the gentleman is right. This fish is like a guided missile except there are millions of them, and until you actually see it happen, you don't believe it. It's like some kind of movie--``The Twilight Zone''--except it's real. It came from the aquaculture industry down in Mississippi, which had an accident, and they brought these fish in to do the cleaning in the fish tanks. Yet, when the walls were breached, they started swimming north in the Mississippi River, and now they are about 30 miles from the Chicago harbor and through the ship canal there. They are about 30 miles from there, but they're coming up into the St. Joseph River in Indiana. They've caught some there. We don't know about the Ohio River, but the Maumee River, which I represent--the largest river that flows into the Great Lakes--is a spawning area for walleye, for example, and this species is really a predator, one that could wipe out our entire multibillion-dollar fishing industry in the Great Lakes.                              {time}  1515  There is no scientific solution at this point. So I hope the administration is hearing us. I hope the Army Corps and the Department of the Interior and others are hearing us. Our country needs a real solution to prevent the spread of this predator into our freshwater lakes, and it is an unsolved challenge for the Nation.  So I thank the gentleman so much for coming to the floor today. You have my full support. I know the chairman of the full committee, Mr. Frelinghuysen, will work with us in any way possible.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.  The Clerk read as follows:       Sec. 106.  As of the date of enactment of this Act and each      fiscal year hereafter, the Secretary of the Army may transfer      to the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Fish and Wildlife      Service may accept and expend, such funds as the Secretary      and the Director of the Fish and Wildlife Service determine      to be necessary to mitigate for fisheries lost due to Corps      of Engineers projects, except that in no event may the amount      of funds transferred pursuant to this section during any      fiscal year exceed the amount identified for such purpose in      the report accompanying the appropriations for that fiscal      year.       Sec. 107.  None of the funds made available in this Act or      any other Act making appropriations for Energy and Water      Development may be used by the Corps of Engineers to develop,      adopt, implement, administer, or enforce any change to the      regulations and guidance in effect on October 1, 2012,      pertaining to the definition of waters under the jurisdiction      of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et      seq.), including the provisions of the rules dated November      13, 1986, and August 25, 1993, relating to such jurisdiction,      and the guidance documents dated January 15, 2003, and      December 2, 2008, relating to such jurisdiction.
