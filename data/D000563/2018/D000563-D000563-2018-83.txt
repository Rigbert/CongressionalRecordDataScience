President, it is hard to believe that it was 3 weeks ago when we first heard the name Christine Blasey Ford. It seems like a lot longer; doesn't it?  In that period of time, a lot of things have occurred. The first thing was the announcement from Kellyanne Conway at the White House when she said that Dr. Ford's testimony and complaint would neither be ignored nor would she be insulted. Last night at a rally in Mississippi, the President of the United States mocked Christine Blasey Ford for her lack of specific memory about this terrible sexual assault, which occurred 36 years ago.  I think most people realize that she testified under oath, gave us all the information she knew, and conceded there were things she couldn't remember. Neither she nor any victim should be in any way belittled because they can't remember all of the details of something that happened in the distant past, something they would much rather forget.  Let me also remind those who are following this debate that it was Dr. Ford who stepped forward and called for an FBI investigation. She was willing to step forward before the FBI and tell her story. It was Judge Kavanaugh who resisted it, even when I asked him directly. Now the FBI investigation is under way.  For the good of the Senate and for our Nation, I hope this is a complete, professional, nonpartisan investigation, and I hope we are given the time to at least read the report from the FBI before the Republican majority leader in the Senate plows through, as he said over and over, to a vote in this Senate.  I hope those who come to this issue in good faith, regardless of their position, will be respectful of the process, which we may be using in the future and should respect as it reaches its conclusion.                        Forced Family Separation  Mr. President, on a separate issue, I wish to tell the Senate about an experience I had several months ago. I was at an immigration court in Chicago. I had never been there before. It was at a high-rise office building in the Chicago Loop. The corridors were packed with those who were waiting for an opportunity for a hearing.  I went into this courtroom where a judge was sitting, and I saw the two people who were before the court that day to have their case heard. The judge called the courtroom to order. She was very respectful to the two individuals who were there, but she had a problem. One of the people before her could not get into the chair to sit down for the proceeding. The reason that young girl, whom I will call Maria, could not get into the chair was because she was 2 years old--2 years old. One of the volunteer attorneys lifted her up and put her in the chair and handed her a stuffed owl, which she clung to through the whole hearing.  The other person who was being subject to a hearing that day had no trouble getting into the chair. He scrambled into the chair and sat down because he was anxious to play with the Matchbox car that was on the table. This young man, whom I will call Hamilton, was 4 years old.  In the United States of America, in the city of Chicago, at an immigration court of this Federal Government, these two individuals were up for a hearing because they had been separated forcibly from their parents. There was no real conclusion to the hearing. They reset the next hearing date for these two children--2 years old and 4 years old--for 4 days before Christmas.  How did we get to this point in America where we are actually having a Federal court hearing of an immigration court for a 2-year-old and a 4-year-old--one too small even to get into a chair by herself and the other who, thank goodness, found a Matchbox car to play with during the proceeding? We reached this point because of the announcement of the Trump administration of something called zero tolerance and the decision to separate over 2,700 children from their parents at the border.  Where are we today? We are in a situation where 136 of these children--months after this policy was started and then discontinued--are still being held by the government. Ninety-six of them have parents who we believe to be outside the United States.  Just this last week, the Department of Homeland Security inspector general came out with a report, which I commend to everyone, analyzing what the zero tolerance policy meant. I will tell you what it meant. It meant the absolute ultimate when it came to cruelty and incompetence. What they tell us in this report was that a decision was made by the Trump administration and by the Department of Homeland Security under Secretary Nielsen to separate children from their parents, even before these children had the ability to speak. They were called preverbal children. They separated them without any plastic bracelets on their wrists, without any fingerprints to trace them back to their parents. They were separated not by blocks or even a few miles but sometimes 1,000 miles.  I came to learn the story of a little boy I will call Hamilton because it was published in The New Yorker. It was a story about his mom from El Salvador and the little boy being taken from her in March--taken from this mother. They left the mother in Texas in detention, and they transported the child to Chicago. Initially, a volunteer lawyer came in and bought a phone card and said to the mother: You can call him. And she did. They would talk for a little while and sing a little song.  The next time she called him, he wasn't as responsive. It has now reached a point where this 4-year-old little boy will not speak to his mother on the telephone, will not communicate with her. The people at the shelter in Chicago had begged the mother: Tell him he has to eat.  Did you ever see a little 4-year-old boy you would have to tell to eat? It says something about his state of mind. Sadly, this 4-year-old has now reverted back to diapers and will not say a word to his mother on the phone--separated by a zero tolerance program of this Trump administration.  What they tell us from the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General's Office is that we are far from the end of this sad, disgraceful chapter in American history.  Who is going to be held accountable for this? Will it be the President, perhaps in some election in the future? Will it be the Attorney General, who proudly announced this new program separating mothers from children? Will it be the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, who separated these children, according to the inspector general's report, putting them in confined spaces, which were unacceptable by humane standards, which we actually have been governed by for years in the United States?  I believe Secretary Nielsen should be held responsible. I believe she should resign. Someone has to answer for this disgraceful chapter in American history, and we still must remember that 136 eligible children are still being held by our government under this policy. It is time for us to reunite these children with their parents. Except in the most extraordinary circumstances, it is time for us to try to put these families back together again. I want Hamilton to start eating again. I want him to be in his mother's arms again. I want him to try to get over this chapter in his young life. It can affect him for as long as he lives.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sullivan). The Senator from Oklahoma.
