 President, today, along with the Chairman of theJudiciary Committee, Senator Hatch, and Senators Boxer and Kerry, I am introducing the Personal Privacy Protection Act. This legislation narrowly targets threatening and endangering harassment and privacy abuses undertaken by the stalker press.  Freedom of the press is the bedrock of American Democracy. But there is something wrong when a person cannot visit a loved one in the hospital, walk their child to school, or be secure in the privacy of their own home without being dangerously chased, provoked, or trespassed upon by photographers trying to capture pictures of them to sell to the tabloids.  When people find themselves in the public eye due to a personal tragedy or circumstances beyond their control, they should not be put into personal fear of bodily injury by tabloid media persistently chasing them. And just because a person makes their living on television or in the movies should not mean they forfeit all rights to personal privacy. There is a line between legitimate news gathering and invasion of privacy; between snapping a picture of someone in a public place and chasing them to the point where they fear for their safety; between reporting the news and trespassing on private property. Unfortunately, today that line is crossed more and more frequently by an increasingly aggressive cadre of fortune-seekers with cameras.  I began the process of developing this legislation together with Senator Boxer more than a year ago, after meeting with members of the Screen Actors Guild and hearing about the abuses people suffer every day at the hands of the stalker press--photographers using telephoto lenses to peer into private homes, cars chasing them off the road, having their children stalked and harassed. The tragic death of Princess Diana last August brought the seriousness of the problem home with a blunt force that stunned the world.  This legislation is narrowly drafted. It is not aimed at, nor would it affect, the overwhelming majority of those in the media, but is specifically aimed at abusive, threatening tactics employed by some who do not respect where the line is between what is public and what is private.  The Personal Privacy Protection Act would do two basic things. First, it would make it a crime, punishable by a fine and up to a year in prison, to persistently follow or chase someone in order to photograph, film, or record them for commercial purposes, in a manner that causes a reasonable fear of bodily injury. Cases in which the persistent following or chasing actually caused serious bodily injury would be punishable by up to 5 years in prison, and where the actions caused death, by up to 20 years in prison. The legislation would also allow victims of such actions to bring a civil suit to recover compensatory and punitive damages and for injunctive and declaratory relief.  Second, the legislation would allow civil actions to be brought against those who trespass on private property in order to photograph, film, or record someone for commercial purposes. In such cases, the bill would allow victims to bring suit in Federal court to recover compensatory and punitive damages and to obtain injunctive and declaratory relief.  Furthermore, in certain specified circumstances, the bill would prevent ``technological trespass.'' Specifically, the legislation would allow a civil action where a visual or auditory enhancement device is used to capture images or recordings that could not otherwise have been captured without trespassing. This provision would apply only to images or recordings of a personal or familial activity, captured for commercial purposes, and only where the subject had a reasonable expectation of privacy. In such cases, the victim would be allowed to bring suit in Federal court to recover compensatory and punitive damages and to obtain injunctive and declaratory relief. In the case of trespass or technological trespass, only a civil suit by the victim would be allowed; no criminal penalty would be prescribed.  This legislation is needed because existing laws fail to protect against dangerous and abusive tactics. Although existing laws may cover some instances of abusive harassment or trespass by the stalker press, victims cannot be certain of protection. Existing state laws form at best a patchwork of protection, and courts often make an exception for activity undertaken ostensibly for ``news gathering'' purposes.  For example, state and local harassment law are often not codified and may require exhaustive litigation to enforce. These vary from state to state and from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and often do not apply in cases involving the media. Some statutes require proof of an intent to harass; and courts in some jurisdictions may allow a broad ``news gathering'' exception.  Similarly, reckless endangerment statutes in some states prohibit recklessly engaging in conduct which creates a substantial risk of serious physical injury to another person. However, these laws are not uniform and their application is very spotty when it comes to dealing with abusive media practices.  Federal, state, and local anti-stalking ordinances often contain loopholes and generally do not apply to activities undertaken for commercial purposes. The Federal anti-stalking ordinance and 28 of the 49 state anti-stalking ordinances--including California's--require proof of the criminal intent to cause fear in order to prosecute.  Existing state trespass laws may be insufficient to protect an owner from an invasion of privacy. For example, an Oregon Court of Appeals upheld a jury verdict for a TV news crew that filmed a police raid in executing a warrant to search the owner's home, despite the fact that the TV crew had entered the property without permission, because the jury found that the intrusion was not ``highly offensive' so as to invade the owner's privacy.  Furthermore, existing trespass laws fail to protect against technological trespass using intrusive technology such as telephoto lenses and parabolic microphones aimed at bedrooms, living rooms, and fenced backyards in which people ought to have an expectation of privacy. Because trespass law requires actual physical invasion, it does not protect against such invasive tactics.  In crafting this legislation, we worked with some of the most renowned Constitutional scholars and First Amendment advocates in the nation, including Erwin Chemerinsky of the University of Southern California Law School, Cass Sunstein of the Chicago School of Law, and Lawrence Lessig of Harvard Law School. At their recommendation, we took the approach of plugging loopholes in existing, long-recognized laws prohibiting harassment and trespassing, rather than creating new provisions out of whole cloth, in order to craft a constitutional bill that fully respects First Amendment and other constitutional rights. This bill does so. The Constitutional scholars concurred unanimously that this legislation is narrowly drafted to withstand constitutional challenge on First Amendment, federalism, or any other grounds.  Mr. President, finally, I should mention that we worked closely with Representative Sonny Bono on this legislation prior to his untimely death, and it was Representative Bono's intention to introduce companion legislation in the House of Representatives. I am deeply saddened that he is not alive today to do so.  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation in order to protect against invasive, harassing, and endangering behavior that can threaten any one of us who, for whatever reason, finds him or herself in the public spotlight. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be included in the Record, along with the letters mentioned previously.  There being no objection, the items were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 2103       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.         This Act may be cited as the ``Personal Privacy      Protection Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.         (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:         (1) Individuals and their families have been harassed and      endangered by being persistently followed or chased in a      manner that puts them in reasonable fear of bodily injury,      and in danger of serious bodily injury or even death, by      photographers, videographers, and audio recorders attempting      to capture images or other reproductions of their private      lives for commercial purposes.         (2) The legitimate privacy interests of individuals and      their families have been violated by photographers,      videographers, and audio recorders who physically trespass in      order to capture images or other reproductions of their      private lives for commercial purposes, or who do so      constructively through intrusive modern visual or auditory      enhancement devices, such as powerful telephoto lenses and      hyperbolic microphones that enable invasion of private areas      that would otherwise be impossible without trespassing.         (3) Such harassment and trespass threatens not only      professional public persons and their families, but also      private persons and their families for whom personal      tragedies or circumstances beyond their control create media      interest.         (4) Federal legislation is necessary to protect      individuals and their families from persistent following or      chasing for commercial purposes that causes reasonable fear      of bodily injury, because such harassment is not directly      regulated by applicable Federal, State, and local statutory      or common laws, because those laws provide an uneven      patchwork of coverage, and because those laws may not cover      such activities when undertaken for commercial purposes.         (5) Federal legislation is necessary to prohibit and      provide proper redress in Federal courts for trespass and      constructive trespass using intrusive visual or auditory      enhancement devices for commercial purposes, because      technological advances such as telephoto lenses and      hyperbolic microphones render inadequate existing common law      and State and local regulation of such trespass and invasion      of privacy.         (6) There is no right, under the first amendment to the      Constitution of the United States, to persistently follow or      chase another in a manner that creates a reasonable fear of      bodily injury, to trespass, or to constructively trespass      through the use of intrusive visual or auditory enhancement      devices.         (7) This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, do not      in any way regulate, prohibit, or create liability for      publication or broadcast of any image or information, but      rather use narrowly tailored means to prohibit and create      liability for specific dangerous and intrusive activities      that the Federal Government has an important interest in      preventing, and ensure a safe and secure private realm for      individuals against intrusion, which the Federal Government      has an important interest in ensuring.         (8) This Act protects against unwarranted harassment,      endangerment, invasion of privacy, and trespass in an      appropriately narrowly tailored manner without abridging the      exercise of any rights guaranteed under the first amendment      to the Constitution of the United States, or any other      provision of law.         (9) Congress has the affirmative power under section 8 of      article I of the Constitution of the United States to enact      this Act.         (10) Because this Act regulates only conduct undertaken      in order to create products intended to be and routinely      transmitted, bought, or sold in interstate or foreign      commerce, or persons who travel in interstate or foreign      commerce in order to engage in regulated conduct, the Act is      limited properly to regulation of interstate or foreign      commerce.         (11) Photographs and other reproductions of the private      activities of persons obtained through activities regulated      by this Act, and the amendments made by this Act, are      routinely reproduced and broadcast in interstate and      international commerce.         (12) Photographers, videographers, and audio recorders      routinely travel in interstate commerce in order to engage in      the activities regulated by this Act, and the amendments made      by this Act, with the intent, expectation, and routine result      of gaining material that is bought and sold in interstate      commerce.         (13) The activities regulated by this Act, and the      amendments made by this Act, occur routinely in the channels      of interstate commerce, such as the persistent following or      chasing of subjects in an inappropriate manner on public      streets and thoroughfares or in airports, and the use of      public streets and thoroughfares, interstate and      international airports, and travel in interstate and      international waters in order to physically or constructively      trespass for commercial purposes.         (14) The activities regulated by this Act, and the      amendments made by this Act, substantially affect interstate      commerce by threatening the careers, livelihoods, and rights      to publicity of professional public persons in the national      and international media, and by thrusting private persons      into the national and international media.         (15) The activities regulated by this Act, and the      amendments made by this Act, substantially affect interstate      commerce by restricting the movement of persons who are      targeted by such activities and their families, often forcing      them to curtail travel or appearances in public spaces, or,      conversely, forcing them to travel in interstate commerce in      order to escape from abuses regulated by this Act, and the      amendments made by this Act.         (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--         (1) to protect individuals and their families against      reasonable fear of bodily injury, endangerment, trespass, and      intrusions on their privacy due to activities undertaken in      connection with interstate and international commerce in      reproduction and broadcast of their private activities;         (2) to protect interstate commerce affected by such      activities, including the interstate commerce of individuals      who are the subject of such activities; and         (3) to establish the right of private parties injured by      such activities, as well as the Attorney General of the      United States and State attorneys general in appropriate      cases, to bring actions for appropriate relief.

If any provision of this Act, an amendment made by this      Act, or the application of such provision or amendment to any      person or circumstance is held to be unconstitutional, the      remainder of this Act, the amendments made by this Act, and      the application of the provisions of such to any person or      circumstance shall not be affected thereby.                                  ____                             University of Chicago Law School,                                      Chicago, IL, April 30, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Senate Judiciary Committee, Technology, Terrorism, and          Government Information Subcommittee, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: This is in response to a request      for my views on issues of federalism raised by the current      effort to prevent harassment and invasion of privacy by      certain photographers and journalists. In brief: From the      standpoint of the constitutional structure, I believe that      these efforts reflect an entirely legitimate exercise of      national power. I spell out those reasons in short compass      here.       There can be no doubt that in its current form, the      proposal is constitutional under the commerce clause. Each of      the provisions is carefully drafted to apply if and only if      there is a clear nexus with interstate commerce. Thus under      existing law, the constitutional question is a simple one,      and there is no plausible basis for legal objection.       The more plausible objection is not about technical law but      about the spirit of the federal structure. A critic might      claim that state law already protects against certain      harassing and invasive behavior, and that state law,      statutory or common, can easily be adapted to provide      stronger protections. Since the several states are generally      in the business of preventing against trespass and      threatening behavior, why should the federal government      intervene? Isn't this the kind of problem best handled at the      state level?       These questions would be good ones if they are taken to      suggest that state law could, in theory, take care of many of      the underlying problems. But the questions are not good ones      if they are taken to suggest that in practice, state law      does, or will do, all that should be done. There are three      important points here.       First, state law is both highly variable and in many places      ill-defined--a complex mixture of statutory and common law, a      mixture that does not, in many places, give a clear signal      against the kind of conduct that the proposed legislation      would ban. For example, the standards for reckless      endangerment are extremely variable. Nor is it at all clear      that most state trespass law prohibits the use of high-     technology methods to get access to people's private      enclaves. In state court, the common law of trespass is in a      notorious and continuing state of flux. So long as the      commerce clause is satisfied, there is an entirely legitimate      national interest in giving a clear signal that certain      behavior is not to be tolerated amidst uncertain and      divergent state practices.       Second, the national government often supplements or builds      on state law in order to give stronger deterrence. In many      states, for example, there are special laws protecting      against racial discrimination, environmental harm, or      uncompensated invasions of private property. But by itself,      this is not an argument that the national government should      not provide such measures as well. Congress often acts in      order to provide the kind of deterrence that national law--     with the availability of federal prosecutors and federal      courts--is uniquely in a position to provide. The simple      truth is that harassing and invasive practices have not been      adequately deterred by state law and the national government      can provide further protection. So long as the commerce      clause is satisfied, this is a perfectly ordinary and      entirely acceptable exercise of national power.       Third, it is important to see that the commercial      incentives for engaging in harassing or invasive behavior are      emphatically national incentives. If a photographer employed      by the National Enquirer chases a movie star or an ordinary      person in California, the potential profits are national, and      it is the national nature of the profits that makes such      behavior so likely. In addition, the nature of the harm tends      to involve interstate activity, with movement of people and      products across state lines to procure the relevant      photograph (when a photograph is involved). If both profits      and harms were limited to a single state, it might make more      sense to say that each state can handle the problem on its      own. But since both profits and harms are national in      character, it is far less likely that states are able to do      so, as actual practice has tended to show.       I conclude that there is no legal objection to the bill      from the standpoint of federalism. I also conclude that the      bill fits well within proper practice from the standpoint of      maintaining Congress' limited place in the federal structure.      In short, this is a national problem calling for a national      response.           Sincerely,     Cass R. Sunstein.                                  ____                                           Harvard Law School,                                  Cambridge, MA, December 7, 1997.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, D.C.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I have reviewed the draft      legislation entitled ``The Protection From Personal Intrusion      for Commercial Purposes Act,'' and wanted to write to express      my support for legislation. In my view, the legislation      represents a balanced and constitutional approach to an      increasingly important problem. It has been drafted, I      believe, to avoid jeopardizing First Amendment values, and      has a firm constitutional foundation in the Commerce Power,      and also, in my view, in Congress' Section Five power under      the Fourteenth Amendment.       The draft bill proposes three changes to strengthen privacy      protections nationally. First, the statute establishes a      criminal penalty for harassing conduct engaged in for      commercial purposes. Second, the statute establishes a civil      penalty for trespass for commercial purposes. And third, the      statute establishes a civil penalty for invasions of      legitimate interests in privacy for commercial purposes. I      consider each provision briefly below.     1. Harassment for commercial purposes       The aim of this provision is to target the repeated and      intentional chasing or following of a person in order to      record impressions of that person for commercial purpose. The      statute would make such conduct criminal, and prescribes      enhanced penalties if death or serious bodily harm is      proximately caused by such conduct.       A number of points about this provision are important to      consider.       (1) The statute is targeting traditionally prohibited      conduct, though more narrowly than might ordinarily be      expected. The statute is more narrow first because it      addresses conduct engaged in for commercial purposes only,      and second because it targets chasing or following only for      purposes of recording visual and auditory impressions. Both      limitations might be said to raise problems of      underinclusiveness. In both cases, however, no constitutional      problem is presented.       The first narrowing (to commercial purposes) is      jurisdictionally required, as the conduct aimed at here is      only that affecting interstate commerce. Even it Congress      could regulate more broadly, the choice to narrow the scope      of its regulation does not reveal any illegitimate content      based purpose in selectively proscribing speech conduct. See      generally Elena Kagan, The Changing Faces of First Amendment      Neutrality: R.A.V. v. St.     Paul, Rust v. Sullivan, and the Problem of Content-Based      Underinclusion, 1992 Sup. Ct. Rev. 29. For the same reason, I      do not believe the second narrowing (to visual and auditory      impressions) raises any significant First Amendment concern.       (2) This is a criminal statute, so one should expect the      courts to read the scope of proscribed conduct narrowly. That      means that the statute is likely to be applied only to people      who intentionally engage in this form of conduct. I believe      the statute makes that clear, since in the definition of      ``harasses,'' ``persistently'' modifies ``follows or      chases.'' That modifier will give courts adequate room to      narrow the statute to conduct that is properly within its      scope.       (3) Finally, because the statute only punishes conduct      which proximately causes serious harm, the statute will not      penalize conduct which results in serious harm, but is      actually, or legally, ``caused'' by something else. By using      the term ``proximately,'' the statute again invites courts to      narrow the application of the statute to cases where the      legally relevant cause of the harm is the conduct being      regulated.     2. Trespass for commercial purposes       The second protection for privacy added by this bill is a      protection against trespass for commercial purposes. While      the protection of property has traditionally been a function      for state regulation, the proposed statute limits the      protection to trespasses engaged in for commercial purposes,      and by definition, commercial purposes affecting interstate      commerce.       There is a long history of support for a provision such as      this, especially in the context of civil rights statutes.      Congress can well take note of a weakness in the patchwork of      state protection against trespass, and supplement such      protections with a federal statute. In my view, this statute      would fit that form.     3. Invasions of legitimate interests in privacy for          commercial purposes       The final section of this proposed bill protects against      the invasion of ``legitimate interests in privacy'' for      commercial purposes. While I believe this provision is      constitutional, it is the most innovative of the three, and      deserves special attention.       The interesting aspect of this statute is its method for      specifying the type of invasion that is not permitted. The      baseline for the statute's protection is the common law      protection against trespass. Historically, trespass law was      the foundation of our privacy jurisprudence, and this statute      is faithful to that tradition.       The innovation in the statute is to extend trespass law to      protect interests that are invaded simply because of      technological advances--advances that make it possible to      capture visual and auditory impressions that would not have      been capturable with older technologies. The statute protects      traditional interests against these new technologies.       In a sense, the statute aims at translating our traditional      protections of privacy into a context where technology has      given eavesdroppers a power that they would not originally      have had.       In my view, such an effort by Congress is important, and      laudable. It is important because we should not allow      constitutional rights to be hostage to technology. If      technology advances, jeopardizing our constitutional      protections, then it is appropriate to adjust rights to      compensate for changes in technology. See Lawrence Lessig,      Reading the Constitution in Cyberspace, 45 Emory L. J. 869,      871-75 (1996).       More importantly, it is laudable that Congress take the      lead in this process. Of course historically, the Supreme      Court has also taken part in keeping the constitution up to      date, translating old provisions to take account of current      problems. But it has always done so with hesitation, since      the act of updating often requires political judgments that      it doesn't feel well positioned to make.       Far better if those judgments are made by Congress. And in      my view, this proposed statute does just that. It represents      an effort by Congress to take the lead in the protection of      privacy against the threats that changing technology      presents. Whatever one's view about the Court doing the same,      it is emphatically the role of Congress to support this      tradition of translation.

Senator Diane Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: At the request of Mr. Richard Pfohl      of your staff, I have reviewed the proposed bill to prohibit      harassment for commercial purposes and to create a cause of      action for personal intrusion for commercial purposes. The      bill is narrowly written and does not violate the First      Amendment. Moreover, even in light of the Supreme Court's      decisions restricting the scope of Congress' commerce power,      the bill is likely to be upheld as within the scope of      congressional authority.       At the outset, it is important to note that the bill does      not prohibit anything from being published or broadcast. Nor      does it create any liability for the publication or broadcast      of any image or information. Both parts of the bill expressly      state: ``Nothing in this section may be construed to make the      sale, transmission, publication, broadcast, or use of any      image or recording of the type or under the circumstances      described in this section in any otherwise lawful manner by      any person subject to criminal charge or civil liability.''       These provisions are reinforced by sections in both parts      of the bill that limit liability to those ``physically      present at the time of, and engaging or assisting another in      engaging in violation of this section.'' No liability is      allowed ``because images or recordings captured in violation      of this section were solicited, bought, used, or sold by that      person.''       I emphasize these provisions because they make it clear      that the bill does not restrict speech or create liability      for any publication or broadcast. Rather, the bill prohibits      and creates liability for specific dangerous and intrusive      activity. At most, the effect on the press is indirect in      limiting certain conduct in the gathering of information.       In general, the Supreme Court has held that content-neutral      laws that have the effect of restricting speech must meet      intermediate scrutiny; that is, they must be shown to be      substantially related to an important government purpose.      Turner Broadcast System v. Federal Communication Commission,      114 S.Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994). Although I think that there is a      strong argument that the bill does not restrict speech at      all, even if a court found that it did, intermediate scrutiny      would be met. The government has an important interest in      stopping persistently physically following or chasing a      person ``in a manner that causes the person to have a      reasonable fear of bodily injury.'' This is simply an      extension of the prohibition of assaults; there is no First      Amendment right for the media to engage in an assault in      gathering information. Similarly, there is an important      interest in preventing trespass or intrusion on to private      property, physically or with technology. There is no First      Amendment right for the media to trespass in gathering      information.       Although the Supreme Court has recognized that ``without      some protection for seeking out the news, freedom of the      press could be eviscerated,'' Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S.      665, 681 (1972), the Court also consistently has refused to      find that the First Amendment provides the press any right to      violate the law in gathering information. The Court has      explained that ``the First Amendment does not guarantee the      press a constitutional right of special access to information      not available to the public generally.'' Id. at 684. No      member of the public has a right to commit an assault or a      trespass; nor can the press in gathering information. As the      Court declared in Associated Press v. NLRB, 301 U.S. 103,      132-33 (1937): ``The business of the Associated Press is not      immune from regulation because it is an agency of the press.      The publisher of a newspaper has no special immunity from the      application of general laws. He has no special privilege to      invade the rights and liberties of others. He must answer for      libel. He may be punished for contempt of court. He is      subject to the anti-trust laws. Like others he must pay      equitable and nondiscriminatory taxes on his business. The      regulation here in question has no relation whatever to the      impartial distribution of news.''       The Supreme Court expressly held that the press is not      exempt from general laws in Cohen v. Cowles Media Co., 501      U.S. 663 (1991). A newspaper published the identity of a      source who had been promised that his name would not be      disclosed. The Court rejected the argument that holding the      newspaper liable for breach of contract would violate the      First Amendment. The Court stressed that the case involved      the application of a general law that in no way was motivated      by a desire to interfere with the press. The Court said:      ``Generally applicable laws do not offend the First Amendment      simply because their enforcement against the press has      incidental effects on its ability to gather and report the      news. [E]nforcement of such general laws against the press is      not subject to stricter scrutiny than would be applied to      enforcement against other persons or organizations.'' Id. at      669-70.       The bill prohibits anyone from persistently following      another in a manner that reasonably creates fear of bodily      injury or committing a trespass for purposes of capturing a      visual or auditory recording. There is no First Amendment      right to engage in such activity and no First Amendment basis      for an exemption to such a narrowly tailored law.       The other possible constitutional challenge to the bill      would be on the ground that it exceeds the scope of Congress'      commerce clause authority. From 1936 until April 26, 1995,      the Supreme Court did not find one federal law      unconstitutional as exceeding the scope of Congress' commerce      power. Then in United States v. Lopez, 115 S.Ct. 1624 (1995),      the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the Gun-Free      School Zones Act of 1990 which made it a federal crime to      have a gun within 1,000 feet of a school. After reviewing the      history of decisions under the commerce clause, the Court      identified three types of activities that Congress can      regulate under this power. First, Congress can ``regulate the      use of the channels of interstate commerce.'' Id. at 1629.      Second, the Court said that Congress may regulate persons or      things in interstate commerce and ``to protect the      instrumentalities of interstate commerce.'' 115 S.Ct. at      1629. Finally, the Court said that     Congress may ``regulate those activities having a substantial      relation to interstate commerce.'' Id. at 1629-30.       The bill is limiting to regulating commercial activity in      that it prohibits and creates liability for ``harrassment for      commercial purposes'' and ``trespass and invasion of      legitimate interest in privacy for commercial purposes.''      Commercial purposes is defined as activity ``with the      expectation of sale, financial gain, or other      consideration.'' In Lopez, the Court emphasized the absence      of commercial activity in the law or its application.       Moreover, the bill fits within the categories articulated      in Lopez. Through fact-finding, Congress should be able to      document that those who engaged in such activity are engaged      in interstate commerce. This, too, is different from Lopez,      where the Court stress the lack of any evidence linking the      prohibited conduct to interstate commerce.       Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.           Sincerely,     Erwin Chemerinsky.                                  ____                             University of Chicago Law School,                                       Chicago, IL, Nov. 24, 1997.     Senator Dianne Feinstein,     Senate Judiciary Committee,     Technology, Terrorism, and Government Information          Subcommittee, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: This letter is in response to your      request for my views on the constitutionally of the proposed      statute designed to protect against harassment and invasion      of privacy by exploitative photographers, sound recorders,      and film crews. The bill would create a new federal criminal      and civil offense and two additional grounds for federal      civil liability. I believe that the bill is constitutional as      drafted. Here is a brief analysis of the legal issues.       The first question is whether the federal government has      the authority to enact a measure of this kind. The most      likely candidate is the commerce clause. Under the commerce      clause, the federal government does have this authority,      especially in light of the fact that the bill, as written,      requires a clear connection between the interstate commerce      and the harassing and invasive action. See the rules of      construction in sections 2 and 4. In fact this connection is      stronger than that in several of the cases in which the Court      has upheld congressional action under the commerce clause.      See Wickard v. Filburn, 317 U.S. 111 (1942); United States v.      Darby, 312 U.S. 100 (1941). United States v. Lopez, 115 S.      Ct. 1624 (1995), is not to the contrary, for in that case,      Congress did not require any connection between interstate      commerce and the prohibited possession of firearms on or near      school property. It is conceivable that the bill might be      challenged in some cases in which a photographer did not move      in interstate commerce and did not sell anything in      interstate commerce but intended to do so (see the rules of      construction). But under the cases cited above, its probably      constitutional even under such circumstances, because the      photographer would be part of a ``class'' of participants in      interstate commerce.       The second question is whether the bill violates the first      amendment. Here it is important to distinguish between a      constitutional challenge to the bill ``on its face'' and a      challenge to the bill ``as applied.'' I believe that a facial      challenge would fail. The bill is content neutral, see Turner      Broadcasting Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445 (1994); its      prohibitions apply regardless of the particular content of      the underlying material. This is especially important, since      the Court treats content-neutral restrictions more hospitably      than content-based restrictions. See id. Moreover, the bill      is directed at action, not at speech itself; speech itself is      left unregulated by the bill. In a way the constitutional      attack on the bill amounts to a claimed first amendment right      of access to private arenas and to information a right that      the Court has generally denied. See Pell v. Procunier, 417      U.S. 817 (1974); Houchins v. KQED, 438 U.S. 1 (1978);      Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74 (1980).       To be sure, this is not the end of the matter: A content-     neutral restriction on action may create constitutional      problems if the action would result in restrictions on the      production of speech, as this bill would undoubtedly do.      Imagine, for example, a law that defined ``trespass'' to      include any effort to take photographs near the White House      or the Supreme Court. Cf. United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S.      720 (1990). In assessing the validity of such a restriction,      some relevant questions are whether the restriction is      justified by sufficient government interests, whether there      are less restrictive alternatives for protecting those      interests, and whether the restriction on the production of      speech is small or large. See id. In most cases covered by      the bill, the restriction would be amply justified. If a      photographer has chased someone in such a way as to produce a      reasonable fear of bodily injury, the government has a strong      reason to provide protection, and the bill is a narrow      tailored means of doing so. Thus section 2, adding the new      criminal offense, seems on firm ground.       Section 4 is designed to ensure that photographers do not      engage in trespasses, or the equivalent of trespasses, in      order to invade people's privacy without their consent. This      section is also supported by the strong government interest      in ensuring that people have a secure private realm, one into      which those using the channels of interstate commerce do not      enter without consent. In most of its applications, section 4      is also likely to be constitutional. Assume, for example,      that a photographer has trespassed into the private property      of a movie star in order to take pictures of a dinner or a      romantic encounter. Since the images are themselves      unregulated (see section 4(d)), the government almost      certainly has sufficient grounds to forbid this kind of      behavior, a trespass at common law. Although the Supreme      Court has subjected some common law rules to first amendment      limitations, it has never held that the law of trespass, even      though it restricts activity that would produce speech,      generally raises constitutional questions. Thus I conclude      that section 4 is constitutional in most of its likely      applications.       There are some contexts in which harder questions might be      raised. Assume, for example, that a presidential candidate is      engaged in unlawful activity on private property, and that a      journalist and a photographer have used technological devices      in order to obtain a record of that activity. Under section      4(b)(2), there has been a kind of federal tort, giving rise      of compensatory and punitive damages. It is possible that the      special first amendment liability in such cases. Cf. New York      Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254 (1964). Thus a series of      cases might be imagined in which section 4, and conceivably      even section 2, would give rise to a reasonable      constitutional challenge as applied. This is true, however,      of a large range of generally permissible statutes; the      question for present purposes is whether the bill would be      constitutional on its face. I conclude that it would be.       I hope that these brief remarks are helpful.           Sincerely,     Cass R. Sunstein.                          ____________________
