Mr. Chairman, this en bloc amendment has been developed on a bipartisan basis and has the support of the minority leaders of the Resources Committee.  During the Resources Committee markup of this bill, several Members wanted to offer amendments but withdrew them to allow time for compromises to be drafted. This en bloc amendment includes these compromises and makes technical amendments to the bill as reported.  This amendment contains technical fixes which include a clarification in the weighing provision of the bill and correction of the placement of language addressing observer coverage.  The amendment also contains language agreed upon by myself and other Members including: corrections to the Pacific Region Stock Assessment section; additions to the use of observers in ITQ systems; and changes to the Prohibited Acts section of the bill.  I appreciate all the hard work by Members and their staffs in reaching agreement on the language in the en bloc amendment. I support this amendment and would urge my colleagues to also support it.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendments offered by the gentleman from Alaska [Mr. Young].  The amendments were agreed to.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. Are there further amendments?                Amendment Offered by Mr. Young of Alaska
