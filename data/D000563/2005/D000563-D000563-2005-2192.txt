I do want to make it clear, though, that I sincerely disagree with your conclusion. To suggest we are facing a crisis in 2008 is to suggest we did not anticipate what will happen in 2008, and that is plain wrong.  In 1983, we anticipated the baby boomer generation, larger numbers of retirees, and we did something about it because we made changes in the law. Because we are prepared for the baby boomers, we will not be in crisis in 2008. We will have the money to pay every single baby boomer every penny promised.  That is the point many on the other side of the aisle want to overlook. They want to overlook what we did in 1983. Instead, they should look to that as a model for what we should do in 2005.  If we want to do something for Social Security, let's do it on a bipartisan basis.
