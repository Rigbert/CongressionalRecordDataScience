 President, all of the Commonwealth of Kentucky has suffered a great loss with the recent death of Albert E. Dix. A fourth-generation journalist, Al Dix moved to Frankfort, Kentucky's State capital, to become publisher of The State Journal in 1962, a post he would keep until his retirement in 1996. Known for being a mentor to aspiring journalists, Al Dix helped train scores of individuals who went on to work at papers with much larger circulations. But he was more than just one of Kentucky's finest journalists. As one of his former press foremen put it, ``He treated all employees really well, just like they were his family. He was a really good person all around.''  Indeed, Al Dix leaves behind a legacy as not only a superb publisher but as a pillar of his community. While I could say much more about my friend Al Dix, I think it appropriate for me to share with my colleagues a recent account of Al's life, which was published by The State Journal on December 3, 2009. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the State-Journal, Dec. 2, 2009]          Former Publisher Al Dix Remembered as Caring Leader                           (By Charlie Pearl)       Journalists, bankers, politicians, educators and others      today paid tribute to Al Dix as a sensitive and caring      publisher who was dedicated to improving the community but      kept his good works private.       Dix died at his home in Frankfort Tuesday morning of      pancreatic cancer. He was 80. Services will be 2 p.m. Friday      at South Frankfort Presbyterian Church with visitation at      noon. Burial will follow at Frankfort Cemetery.       Richard Wilson, who retired from The (Louisville) Courier-     Journal as its higher education reporter, got his first job      in newspapers with The State Journal under Dix in 1963 and      1964.       ``That helped me immensely during a nearly 40-year career      in journalism,'' Wilson said. ``Much of the reason for that      was Al, who was unquestionably a reporter's publisher. He was      encouraging, respected quality work and openly shared his      enthusiasm for its appearance in the newspaper.       ``While he may have held strong views on many subjects, he      never permitted them to permeate The State Journal's news      columns and he respected those who believed otherwise. He      also frequently took a personal interest in his employees and      their well-being, both professionally and personally.''       Bruce Brooks, retired executive vice president at Farmers      Bank, said he always considered Dix ``a dear friend. He was a      little bit of a mentor to me.       ``He was always willing to be a listening board for any      situation. He was free with his advice and usually it was      pretty sound and analytical.''       Brooks said Dix was master of ceremonies at various      functions, ``and was really, really skilled at it. And he      always had an open checkbook for a worthy cause. He would      walk the walk and talk the talk.''       Former City Commissioner Pat Layton said Dix encouraged her      to start her real estate career.       ``He had a lot of insight of what was going on in the      community,'' Layton said. ``It wasn't because he was      publisher of a newspaper but because he really loved his      community.       ``He was truly a leader. But a lot of people didn't know      about the many things he did for Frankfort because he was      very private about it. He was a silent supporter. When there      was a need, he was there and stepped right up front. He was a      special guy.''       State Sen. Julian Carroll, who was governor while Dix was      publisher, said, ``Al was a great community-minded leader.      Although he was a Republican and I'm a Democrat, he was      always very nice and cordial to me. I considered him to be      one of our outstanding citizens.''       Bob Roach, a retired school teacher and former city      commissioner and county judge-executive, said Dix ``was      certainly interested in young people and education, and he      believed in excellence. He was a prince of a fellow.''       While teaching at Franklin County High School, Roach said      he took groups of students to Washington, D.C., for 25 years      to participate in a North American Invitational Model United      Nations program, ``and we could always count on him for a      donation.''       By sponsoring an annual State Journal All-Academic Banquet,      Dix encouraged students to excel in the classroom, Roach      said, ``and he encouraged teachers by recognizing them as      well.''       Dix could also be a confidant, Roach said.       ``You could go talk to him about an issue and you knew it      would always be in confidence,'' Roach said. ``And I knew his      advice would be on target.''       Attorney Bill Kirkland, a former Paul Sawyier Public      Library president, said Dix was on a special gifts committee      during fundraising for the new library and he came faithfully      to every meeting.       ``He had numerous contacts in the community and personally      added immeasurably to the quality of the library through the      gifts he solicited.       ``He was a person of intellect, humor, good personality and      good judgment. There was never a kinder soul and more      generous person in the community.''       Kirkland said their friendship spanned four decades.       ``About 40 years ago, we played one-wall handball at the      old YMCA on Bridge Street. I knew him first through his      connection with South Frankfort Presbyterian Church, and      through a few Republican endeavors. He certainly was a      conservative after my own heart.       ``He had extraordinary compassion and was interested in      literacy, education, good government and ethical behavior.''       Bruce Dungan, retired president of Farmers Capital Bank      Corporation, said when Dix first came to Frankfort from Ohio,      ``I could tell he was here to be a friend of Frankfort. He      was very thoughtful of people.       ``He was here to help people, charities, government and his      church. He worked so hard at charities. He would call me and      say what I had given last year, and then say, `Don't you      think you ought to raise it a little this time?'       ``If it hadn't been for Al, the YMCA (on Broadway) may      never have happened. He kept pushing everybody. He did      whatever he could to improve Frankfort. He was one of the      greatest guys in Frankfort that I know of. We're going to      miss him. I sure will.''       Irvine Gershman, a retired downtown merchant, said Dix      ``coming here from Ohio was probably one of the best things      to happen to Frankfort. He was always willing to do things      for other people.       ``He and his family have contributed so much to this      community. When I would call on him for a little help (to      various charities), he would just say, `How much do you      need?' ''       Gershman's wife, Priscilla, said Dix ``was a precious      jewel. He will be sorely missed by everyone.''       Russ McClure, a former vice president of Morehead State      University, said he was ``under the gun a lot of times''      while serving as Finance Cabinet secretary to Carroll and      assistant budget director to Bert Combs when they were      governors.       ``One thing I could always count on was Al being straight      up and fair,'' McClure said. ``He was always straightforward      with his questions and always accurate in his reporting of my      answers and the facts.''       The Rev. John Hunt, retired pastor of South Frankfort      Presbyterian Church, said he has fond memories of getting to      cover one of the launches of the Gemini space program in the      early 1960s for The State Journal because of Dix.       ``He knew of my interest in science and he credentialed      me,'' Hunt recalled.       When Hunt got to Cape Canaveral, bad weather caused the      flight to be postponed, so he figured he would have to miss      the experience because he would need to get back to Frankfort      for Sunday church services.       But Dix encouraged him to stay in Florida, saying he would      give the sermon on Sunday, Hunt said.       ``He filled the pulpit for me and did an excellent job,''      Hunt said. ``He got rave reviews and supplied the pulpit on      my absences after that. I was about ready to swap places with      him.''       Scottie Willard, who retired in September as press foreman      after 44 years at The State Journal, remembers when Dix      became publisher in 1962.       ``He made a lot of improvements as far as press equipment      when he took over,'' Willard said. ``He treated all employees      really well, just like they were his family. He was a really      good person all around.''       Ronnie Martin, retired composing foreman who worked at the      newspaper 43 years, agrees.       ``He was super to work for,'' Martin said. ``He gave me all      sorts of opportunities and challenges at the same time, but      they all worked out. He was a great guy. He treated everybody      fairly.''       Ann Maenza, Dix's daughter, now publisher of The State      Journal, said her father ``never cut corners. He always made      sure things were done right. He was old school, fair and      honest.''       Amy Dix Rock, senior director of regulatory and scientific      affairs at Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. in Nashville,      Tenn., said her father was ``always thinking of others. We      don't know how many things he's done for others because he      didn't talk about it.       ``That's the way he was. He was soft-spoken but when he did      speak you listened.''       Al Smith, who rose to prominence in the state as a weekly      newspaper publisher and as the longtime host of KET's      ``Comment on Kentucky,'' said Dix was a newspaper publisher      of the old school, ``but the opposite of the domineering      egotistic bosses who bullied employees and squeezed the news      to match their biases.       `` `Old school' means that we always knew that with Al at      The State Journal, it was like the grocery slogan of years      ago, `the owner is in the store.' He didn't have to call a      distant headquarters to know what to say or do.       ``He had strong views, conservative Republican in a      `company town' (state government) of readers who are mostly      Democratic, but he ran the paper on principles of fairness in      the news columns and gave his editorial writers, who were      mostly more liberal than he, free rein on the opinion page.''       Smith noted how The State Journal under Dix supported a      constitutional amendment that overhauled the state's judicial      system and created what is today the Supreme Court. Smith      also noted the newspaper's spotlight on corruption in      government and how Dix shunned personal publicity.       ``Once I wrote him a private note about something very      generous he had done to help someone in trouble,'' Smith      said. ``I heard nary a word in reply. But I didn't expect it.      I am sure he was embarrassed that I even knew.''       Born Aug. 18, 1929, in Ravenna, Ohio, Albert E. Dix majored      in political science and was a 1951 graduate of Denison      University in Granville, Ohio.       He served in the U.S. Army Intelligence from 1953-1955.       A fourth-generation journalist, Dix first worked at The      Times-Leader in Bellaire, Ohio, where his father was      publisher. He moved to Frankfort in October 1962 to become      publisher of The State Journal. He retired in 1996 as      publisher and president of Wooster Republican Printing Co.,      the parent company of The State Journal, which now owns seven      newspapers.       The Kentucky Book Fair was founded by The State Journal in      1981.       Dix also was a member of the board of directors of First      Capital Bank of Kentucky, the Frankfort/Franklin County      Industrial Development Authority and the local Kiwanis Club;      and served two terms as chairman of the American Saddlebred      Museum at the Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington.       He loved fishing and making fishing rods, electric trains      and saddlebred horses.       Other survivors include his wife of 56 years, Edna Dix; a      son, Troy Dix, publisher of the Ashland Times-Gazette in      Ohio; and four grandchildren, Evan, Stewart and Melissa Dix      and Lauren Maenza.                          ____________________
