 President, as chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, I take a moment to thank all the members of that committee for their hard work over the last year. At a time when there is obviously an enormous amount of divisiveness and partisanship here in the Senate, I am happy to report that by and large there has been a great deal of bipartisan effort being made in the Veterans' Affairs Committee, and I think very productive work as well.  (The remarks of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Blumenthal pertaining to the introduction of S. 1950 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')                        Thanks to Patrick Kilcur
