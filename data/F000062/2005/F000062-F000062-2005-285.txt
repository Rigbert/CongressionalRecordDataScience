5 million in defense. It is a different strategy this year. The money was split.  Last year the request was for $27.5 million and a 5-year projection of $486 million. That is fact.  Now, their projection over 5 years is not this year in the budget so it is a little tricky because they have split it up and they have operated it into two budgets. The House removed all of the money. The House removed the authorization.  Clearly, there are people on this Hill who believe it is a mistake. Last year, the money was removed. So this year is a slightly different approach by the administration.  What we are saying is, it is a new weapon. If you do not have it today, and you might have it tomorrow, it is a new weapon. What we are saying is, there is not one physicist who will say that a casing can be built to drive a weapon deep enough into the Earth with enough explosive power that will take out a bunker and not spew radiation that can kill hundreds of thousands and, yes, even millions of people. We urge a ``yes'' vote.
