 Schumer) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:                              S. Res. 706       Whereas, in the case of Jacob R. Kent, et al., v. R.L.      Vallee, Inc., et al., Case No. 617-6-15, pending in the      Superior Court of Vermont in Chittenden County, defendant      R.L. Vallee, Inc. has issued a deposition subpoena for      testimony and documents to Daniel McLean, an employee in      Senator Sanders' office;       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the      Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a)      and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to      represent current or former Members, officers, and employees      of the Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request      for testimony or documents relating to their official      responsibilities;       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United      States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no      evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate      may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from      such control or possession but by permission of the Senate:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to      represent Senator Sanders' office and Mr. McLean in this      matter and in all proceedings related to it.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a resolution authorizing representation by the Senate Legal Counsel and ask for its immediate consideration.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a State court civil case alleging price fixing in gasoline markets in northwest Vermont, in which one of the defendants has issued to an employee in Senator Sanders' Burlington, Vermont office a deposition subpoena for testimony and documents arising out of his Senate duties. Senator Sanders is opposing this subpoena on grounds of sovereign immunity and the absolute immunity afforded the Senator and his staff under the Speech or Debate Clause, as well as for imposing an undue burden. This resolution would authorize the Senate Legal Counsel to represent Senator Sanders' office and his employee and to move to quash the subpoena.                          ____________________
