President, a vote in favor of the amendment offered by my colleague, Mr. Daschle, would prevent timely enactment of H.J. Res. 51. Swift passage of a clean bill allows the measure to move as quickly as possible to the President for his signature. Any delay will lead to a default on the national debt and the inability of our government to meet its financial obligations, including its obligation to pay Social Security checks on time.  With the House adjourned for the Memorial Day recess, I am concerned that any further delay in enactment of the debt limit bill will cause Social Security beneficiaries to receive their monthly checks much later than scheduled. While I agree with Senator Daschle that the COLA should not be reduced, ironically, his amendment would immediately hurt those seniors for whom Social Security is a lifeline by delaying receipt of their checks. I would never vote to cut or tax Social Security benefits. With far too many seniors on limited budgets, I cannot support adoption of an amendment that could lead to a delay in the delivery of these vital benefits.
