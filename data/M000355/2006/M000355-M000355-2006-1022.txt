 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:45 a.m. tomorrow, Tuesday, April 25. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate proceed to a period of morning business for up to 60 minutes, with the first 30 minutes under the control of the majority leader or his designee and the final 30 minutes under the control of the Democratic leader or his designee; further, that following the vote on thedistrict judge that was ordered earlier, the Senate then resume consideration of H.R. 4939, the emergency supplemental appropriations bill, for debate only until after the 2:15 recess. I further ask that the Senate stand in recess from 12:30 until 2:15 to accommodate the weekly policy luncheons.
