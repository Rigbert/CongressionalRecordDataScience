Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  In respect to my good friend, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Chambliss), I have to keep reminding everybody that this is on-budget. We did do that. This is money that we have collected for this program that has not been spent. I frankly, as one of my biggest loves, is for fish and wildlife do not want to have them wait for 6 years. I think that is a terrible, terrible blow to this bill.  If you believe in conservation, if you believe in the establishment and protecting endangered species that are endangered or will be endangered if we do not act these next 6 years, there will be a lot of areas shut down. I honestly will tell you, I think this 6 years would be a terrible detriment. I did request from the leadership prior to this bill before the budget was acted on to have this included. That was denied. They said, ``Don't worry about it. We'll make sure if the bill passes that the money will be there some way.''  If we pass this bill, which I hope we will, we will find that money. This bill will go to the Senate. The President has a plan of his own. We have a plan of ours. Eventually we will reach a solution. But to have us wait 6 years, in fact, will defeat the purpose of the whole bill. Animals will not be around. The parks that these kids need will not be there. The crime rate will rise. Lands that were destroyed by the government on Indian reservations will not be reclaimed. Farmers that want to remain farming will not be able to farm because they will not have the easement provisions. Coastal States that are losing acres of land every minute will not have any recourse. Six years from now, probably most of us will not be here, in all due respect. I will be because I am going to be chairman of another committee. But I am just suggesting that to wait 6 years is a bad precedent to be set. I urge the gentleman to consider that. Keep in mind this process is begun. Let us finish it.
