 President, before we go to this vote, I would just remind all Senators that at the end of this vote there will be up to 40 minutes of debate before the next amendment. I would ask all Senators who leave the floor to be back here by 6:30, maybe a little bit before that. But I would remind all of my colleagues that if you drift back in for half an hour on the first vote, it will be later and later as we get through this. So I would really ask everyone who leaves after they vote to be back here at 6:30 at the latest. We may yield a little bit back, but please be back by that time.  With that, I ask for the yeas and nays.
