 President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter to which I referred from Dr. Donohue be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   Catholic League                               for Religious and Civil Rights,                                      New York, NY, July 25, 2003.       Dear Senator: You will soon be voting on the candidacy of      Alabama Attorney General Bill Pryor for the federal appeals      court in Alabama. As president of the nation's largest      Catholic civil rights organization, I ask that you subject      him to the same standards as you would any candidate. I am      also asking that you challenge any colleague of yours who may      attempt to subject Pryor to a de facto religious test.       I have plainly said there are no anti-Catholics in the U.S.      Senate. But I have also said that this does not empty the      issue.       Bill Pryor's deeply held opposition to abortion as a moral      issue, as well as his deeply held opposition to the      jurisprudential reasoning as evidenced in Roe v. Wade, have      made him a lightning rod for abortion-rights advocates. In      other words, it is precisely Pryor's religious convictions      that are bring scrutinized. Given the cast of mind of some of      his critics, it makes it virtually impossible for practicing      Catholics to ascend to the federal bench.       Some of Pryor's critics are themselves Catholic and thus      resist the contention that he is being opposed because of his      religion. But they do so by falsely claiming that on the      subject of abortion, there is more than one acceptable      position for Catholics to take. They are dead wrong. Catholic      teaching on abortion is unequivocal: it is gravely sinful.      This is not a matter of dispute--it is a matter of doctrine      that all Catholics are expected to uphold. Especially public      officials.       The danger, then, is that Bill Pryor may be rejected      because of his religious convictions. This would be      outrageous and that is why I am asking you to do what you can      to prevent this from happening.           Sincerely,                                        William A. Donohue, Ph.D.,                                                        President.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask the chairman of the committee, isn't the important thing whether there is demonstrable evidence that a nominee has been unwilling to follow established law and it is my understanding--I ask the chairman whether it is his understanding--that Attorney General Pryor has followed the law when it was very tough to do so as an elected official in Alabama.  I believe our friend from Alabama, the junior Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, cited a number of cases upon which Attorney General Pryor, as an elected official and not insulated from the wishes of the voters, took very tough positions on various issues because he was following the law. Isn't that the fundamental question that we ought to ask of nominees, whether to the left or to the right? Will you follow the law? And if they have demonstrated examples where they have done so, that would be relevant to whether or not they ought to be confirmed.
