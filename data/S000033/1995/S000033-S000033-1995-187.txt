 Between 1979 and 1989, when the rich were getting richer, the number of taxpayers reporting adjusted gross incomes of $200,000 a year or more grew by 8 times. A lot more people were getting rich. Meanwhile, according to the House Ways and Means Committee, tax savings in 1992 for families in the upper 1 percent income bracket, total tax savings, totalled $41,886, a result of the drop in the effective tax rate for those families--it is the upper 1 percent--from 35.5 percent in 1977 to 29.3 percent in 1992.  So the point that the gentleman makes is absolutely right. When we talk about why we have a $4.7 trillion debt, how can we not talk about the huge tax breaks given to the wealthiest people in America and to the largest corporations?  Mr. DeFAZIO If the gentleman would yield for a moment, perhaps we can bring the discussion to what we are confronted with today.  The House Republican budget starts out moving the United States toward a balanced budget by first further reducing taxes on the most wealthy, those who earn over $100,000 a year, and on the largest, most profitable corporation by $353 billion.  So they first start with a--here we are. We are in the hole. We are all agree we need to have fiscal responsibility and move toward a balanced budget. First thing we do is we make the hole $353 billion deeper in order to benefit people who earn over $100,000 a year and in order give further tax relief to the corporations, and, as the gentleman from New York pointed out, who were paying taxes at about--what is it? About a quarter, a third of the rate----
