Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that my remarks be expunged from the record as soon as they are made.  Mr. Speaker, but for the fact that the rules prohibit it, I would wear this jersey during the course of my remarks; but our Parliamentarian would have a heart attack and think that I had stepped egregiously on the rules. So only because the parliamentarian wants me to take off the Duke shirt do I do so. But I will hold it up.
