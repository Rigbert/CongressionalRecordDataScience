 President, the State of Vermont will celebrate the year 2010 by marking the 250th anniversary of the historic town of Pownal, VT.  In celebrating Pownal, we celebrate a town that has done much more than merely survive the centuries. This bucolic little hamlet represents the strength and progress of our great State through the years.  Since its original charter in 1760, Pownal was built on a rich history that dates back to the divisive years of the revolution. During its earliest days many Pownal residents were stirred to join the Green Mountain Boys to fight for our independence. The fervor demonstrated by the original residents of this town set its course as the bedrock of loyalty and excellence in the State of Vermont.  Today we cherish the historic Mooar-Wright House which is the oldest house in both Pownal and the Green Mountain State. We commend the town's early emphasis on education, with two former U.S. Presidents serving as teachers in north Pownal. Over the centuries this town was a pocket of industrial accomplishment in Vermont. Some of the State's largest cotton and woolen mills were housed in Pownal and later replaced by lime quarries. They helped carry Vermont through years of industrial development and growth. These auspicious achievements, however, also served as a reminder of our capacity for change because the industrial mills in Pownal were singled out for child labor. This documented injustice symbolized the past and put the town on the national map in 1916 when it was depicted on a United States postage stamp to commemorate the passage of the first child labor laws. The heart of the town became its national image in 1946 when the United Nations Bulletin featured a photo of the Pownal Center as ``a picture of peace.'' Throughout the years this town was both the root of tradition and the spark of progress: a balance that few places or populations can claim.  Today, Pownal has developed into a town of more than three thousand. The buildings have grown and the industries have changed, but the ideals remain the same. On its 250th anniversary, Pownal continues to encapsulate the beauty and independence of our State. I thank the residents of Pownal for their contributions to our State's rich and unique history.  Mr. President, it is indeed an honor to represent the State of Vermont and the Town of Pownal and to promote its many successes.                          ____________________
