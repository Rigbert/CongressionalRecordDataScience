We have voted on this amendment before. We voted three different times. This was actually structured as the Inouye-Inhofe amendment once and the Inhofe-Inouye amendment once. It has passed overwhelmingly. This is the only way we can see that we can assure we are not going to have those individuals who are now at Gitmo in the United States. I think we have discussed this several times. I strongly support this amendment.
