 President, very briefly, today following morning business, at approximately 10:45, the Senate will resume consideration of H.R. 4, the welfare reauthorization bill. At 12:15 we will proceed to a vote on the Snowe amendment on child care. Following that vote the Senate will recess for our weekly party lunches. For the remainder of the day the Senate will continue with the welfare bill and amendments thereto. The chairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee will be here throughout the day to work through those amendments. Senators should therefore expect votes throughout the day. I encourage Members who have amendments to notify the bill managers in the hopes that we can process those amendments and move forward with this bill.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
