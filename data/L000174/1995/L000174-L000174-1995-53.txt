President, the distinguished Presiding Officer and I both come from States where we know what winter weather is. I daresay the distinguished Presiding Officer has probably heard a weather report in his State--one of the most beautiful in this country--probably heard a weather report similar to one I heard in Vermont last weekend. In the news they said, ``By the way, we expect a dusting of snow tonight, accumulations of no more than 3 to 4 inches.'' And nobody thinks anything of it. If we have 10 inches of snow overnight, schools still open, people still go to work.  I contrast that with the situation we face in the Washington area. How many times have we turned on the TV in the morning and see we have remote locations and you have all the people out there bundled up, and the poor camera person has the bright lights on, trying to find one snowflake coming down. They say, ``Oh, and the latest report is the snow appears to be gathering and we switch now to the head meteorologist,'' who, in a state of panic, is saying, ``And we may get accumulations of up to an inch.'' An inch? My 86-year-old mother goes out with a broom and sweeps anything up to 2 or 3 inches off the walk. Schools will open, but here, if they open at all, it is 5 hours late. ``Two inches were spotted somewhere in the continental United States and it might be moving this way.''  Last night I drove home around midnight and I saw cars spinning off the road for two reasons. One, they did not know how to drive; and second, notwithstanding the fact that everybody knew an ice storm was coming, apparently nobody thought to send out the sand trucks and sand the road. This morning, at about 5:45 or so, when I drove with my wife to work--she was going to the hospital, she is on the morning shift--again, we saw cars spinning out all over the place. They come roaring down to an intersection, slamming on the brakes--of course they had not bothered to sand the intersections--and looked amazed and surprised that the law of physics applied. You have a heavy object, you have no traction: It does not stop. It has some aspect to do with the law of friction and physics, something I suggest maybe we may want to teach.  We get into a situation around this area that the only effective snow or ice removal is a couple of days of warm weather. I once thought the reason we keep everything going in the little State of Vermont is we must have a lot more equipment and a lot more people. Apparently that is not so. Actually they have more down here. I think they are saving it, though. They do not want to use up this equipment. Maybe they are thinking someday another Ice Age will come and we will need it then.  But in Vermont we do have cold weather. I remember a year or so ago they closed down the Government here because it was about 25 degrees.  I was in Montpelier, VT, in the State capital that day and it was 15 degrees below zero. I walked from my office to the capitol. Every place was open, everybody went to work. I constantly got stopped by people on the streets who said, ``We heard on the news they closed down Government offices and everything in Washington because it is 25 degrees. They really mean 25 below, don't they?''  I said, ``No, 25 degrees. That is 40 degrees warmer than it is here where we are all going to work.''  But we do have that 25- to 30-degree below zero weather. I mention that, to be serious, because we need money in LIHEAP. In Vermont we have about 25,000 families eligible for LIHEAP, aid for those who need heating assistance. I think last year our families received slightly less than $400 a home. But because of the budget, in Vermont they can be promised only about $50 this year.  Mr. President, 70 percent of those recipients earn $8,000 a year or less, 30 percent of them are AFDC homes with children. Mr. President, 32 percent of them are working Vermonters who need help; 41 percent of the recipients are elderly or disabled. People are going to be dying from the cold. It does get cold back in my State. We have had many below-zero days already. We will have days where it will go down to 20 or 30 below zero.  Congress is no closer to passing a Labor-HHS bill with LIHEAP funding than they were back in September. If Congress feels that block grants are such a good idea for school lunches and Medicaid, at least show they are consistent and keep the LIHEAP block grant going. Food shelves are getting empty. Frost is on the windows day and night. People are down to the question of heating versus eating. If you are elderly or disabled, that is one heck of a question to have to ask.  We need to pass a LIHEAP budget. It is a gaping new hole in the welfare net and it is hurting Americans, especially those who live in the frost belt. I hope we will pass it.  Mr. President, I thank the Chair for its forbearance and I will be happy to join with the distinguished Presiding Officer in offering snowtime driving lessons to any of our colleagues who may wish them--certainly to the media who report on four or five snowflakes as though it was the coming of a new Ice Age.                          ____________________
