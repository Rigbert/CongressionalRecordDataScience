President, in the end of October, the Center for American Progress, in conjunction with The American Prospect magazine and The Century Foundation, held a conference on U.S. national security titled, ``New American Strategies for Security and Peace.'' Three of my fellow senators--Senator Hillary Clinton, Senator Joe Biden, and Senator Chuck Hagel--and Dr. Zbigniew Brzezinski made incisive remarks at this conference about the direction of our country's foreign policy and its effects on Americans at home and abroad. They also spoke about how to restore America to respected international leadership. I ask unanimous consent that the remarks of Senator Clinton and Dr. Brzezinski be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Remarks of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton       Washington, Oct. 29, 2003.--Thank you, John for that      introduction. I want to compliment you for all the hard work      that you have put into the creation of the Center for      American Progress, an institution that I am convinced will be      a tremendous force in engaging in the war of ideas so      critical to our country's future. And there is no better      leader for that effort than John Podesta who has the warrior      spirit and strategic mind needed for such an endeavor. I also      want to thank Bob Kuttner at the American Prospect and Dick      Leone at the Century Foundation for their work on this      conference.       Today's conference, ``New American Strategies for Security      and Peace'' comes at a critical point in our nation's history      and I commend the Center for American Progress, the American      Prospect and the Century Foundation for putting together from      what is, by all accounts, an outstanding program.       Today is a critical moment, not just in our history, but in      the history of democracy. As we seek to build democratic      institutions in Iraq, and we in this room push for us to      reach out to our global partners in this endeavor, this      nation must remember the tenets of the democratic process      that we advocate.       The issue I'd like to address is whether we apply the      fundamental principles of democracy--rule of law,      transparency and accountability, informed consent--not only      to what we do at home but to what we do in the world. There      can be no real question that we must do so because foreign      policy involves the most important decisions a democracy can      make--going to war, our relations with the world, and our use      of power in that world.       But the fact is that new doctrines and actions by the Bush      administration undermine these core democratic principles--     both at home and abroad. I believe they do so at a severe      cost.       In our efforts abroad, we now go to war as a first resort      against perceived threats, not as a necessary final resort.      Preemption is an option every President since Washington has      had and many have used. But to elevate it to the organizing      principle of American strategic policy at the outset of the      21st century is to grant legitimacy to every nation to make      war on their enemies before their enemies make war on them.      It is a giant step backward.       In our dealings abroad, we claim to champion rule of law,      yet we too often have turned our backs on international      agreements. The Kyoto Treaty, which represents an attempt by      the international community to meaningfully address the      global problem of climate change and global warming. The      biological weapons enforcement protocol. The Comprehensive      Test Ban Treaty. This unwillingness to engage the      international community on problems that will require      international cooperation sends a clear signal to other      nations that we believe in the rule of law--if it is our law      as we interpret it. That is the antithesis of the rule of      law. The administration argues that international agreements,      like the Kyoto Treaty, are flawed. And the fact is they have      some good arguments. When the Clinton administration signed      the Kyoto Protocol it said that, working, inside the tent, it      would try to make further improvements. But rather than try      to make further improvements from inside the process, the      Bush administration stomped out in an effort to knock over      the tent. That is not the prudent exercise of power. It is      the petulant exercise of ideology.       In our dealings abroad, we more often than not have      promoted, not the principles of     international cooperation, but the propensity for an      aggressive unilateralism that alienates our allies and      undermines our tenets. It deeply saddens me, as I speak with      friends and colleagues around the world, that the friends of      America from my generation tell me painfully that for the      first time in their lives they are on the defensive when it      comes to explaining to their own children that America truly      is a good and benign nation. Their children, too often, have      seen an America that disregards their concerns, insists they      embrace our concerns and forces them to be with us or against      us. Our Declaration of Independence calls for `` a decent      respect for the opinions of mankind,'' yet this      administration quite simply doesn't listen to our friends and      allies. From our most important allies in Europe to relations      with our neighbors in this hemisphere, this administration      has spanned the range of emotions from dismissive to      indifferent. Ask President Vincente Fox, who staked his      Presidency on a political alliance with Mexico's historically      controversial ally to the north, only to discover that he got      no farther north than Crawford, Texas.       If we are to lead this world into a wholly democratic      future, we must first be consistent in the principles we      champion and the ones we pursue.       Nowhere is this more apparent than in the transparency of      government decisions. Without such transparency, how can      leaders be accountable? How can the people by informed?      Without such transparency--openness and information--the      pillars of democracy lose their foundation.       Of course in a democracy, there always is tension between      the information that the Executive Branch needs to keep      secret and the information that must be provided to the      public to have an informed citizenry. There are no easy      answers to striking the right balance. But we must always be      vigilant against letting our desire to keep information      confidential be used as a pretext for classifying information      that is more than political embarrassment than national      security. Let me be absolutely clear. This is not a      propensity that is confined to one party or the other. It is      a propensity of power that we must guard against. Because      when that happens, we move away from the bedrock principle of      informed consent that governs all State actions in a      democracy. Getting back, once again, to our founders who I      think were not only extraordinary statesmen, but brilliant      psychologists--they understood profoundly the dangers and      temptations of power. The balance of power that they      enshrined in our Constitution and our system of      government was a check on all of our human natures and the      propensity for anyone, no matter how convinced they are of      the righteousness of their cause and view of the world, to      be held in a check and a balance by other institutions.       Since 9/11, this question has much more salience since the      War on Terror will often be fought in the shadows outside the      public limelight. New doctrines of preemption raise profound      questions about democratic oversight by making decisions      effecting war and peace. They also raise profound questions      about the quality of the intelligence information that is not      open to public scrutiny. One of the most critical issues that      we confront is what is wrong with our intelligence, the      gathering and the analysis and the use?       Anybody who follows what is going on on Capitol Hill is      aware that we are locked in a partisan conflict as to how far      to go in analyzing the intelligence with respect to Iraq--     with the other side complaining that we can look to the      intelligence community, but we cannot look at the decision      makers. We can't look at the uses to which the intelligence      was put and we can't look at the particular viewpoint that      was brought to that analysis. I think that is a profound      error and undermining to our democratic institutions.       The American people, and indeed the international      community, need to have confidence that when the U.S.      government acts, it is acting in good faith--sharing      information where appropriate and developing appropriate      mechanisms to insure that power is not being abused. A      perception that our government is not providing honest      assessments of the rationale for war or is unwilling to admit      error will diminish the support for U.S. foreign policy of      the American people and the international community. The      American people will be far more willing to accept the      administration's statement's about what is going right in      Iraq if they believe that the administration is more      forthright about what is going wrong. It is difficult to      convince people that everything is fine when we are asking      them to essentially shelve their common sense and human      experience.       An example that hits close to home for me can be found in      the administration's approach to the investigation      surrounding 9/11. As Senator of New York, there is no more      searing event than what happened to us on September 11th. My      constituents have a right to know all the facts of how our      government was prepared--or not--for the attacks. Yet, over      the weekend, we learned that the 9/11 Commission, charged      with the important task of investigating how 9/11 happened,      complains that it isn't getting access to all the documents      that it needs. This is a hugely important issue and one that      must be addressed. The lack of transparency on the part of      the Bush administration has forced Governor Kean, the former      Republican governor of New Jersey, to threaten subpoenas.      This should not be happening.       As bad as it was for Vice President Cheney to keep secret      how the administration developed its energy policy--this is      far worse. The 9/11 commission is not trying to embarrass the      President, any former Presidents, or anyone else. It is      trying to learn what happened--what went wrong--in hopes that      we can become better prepared to protect ourselves from      future attacks. In taking this action, the administration      unnecessarily raises suspicions that it has something to      hide--that it might use national security to hide mistakes.      That is not necessary or appropriate.       Meanwhile, on Iraq, the Bush administration describes      progress on many fronts in direct contravention to what we      are hearing every day. There undoubtedly are many instances      where U.S. efforts in Iraq are successful. But what is going      right should not delude us about what is going wrong. There      is too much at stake to treat war as a political spin zone.       We need to level with the American people--the good, the      bad and the ugly. For the simple fact is that we cannot fail      in Iraq. On that fundamental principle, I am in full and      profound agreement with the President. The stakes are simply      too high. That means we need to improve our transparency and      credibility in Iraq. In the recent $87 billion supplemental      appropriations bill passed by the Senate, an amendment that I      offered, and which was included in the final bill, would      require GAO audits of these opaque supplemental      appropriations. Another amendment that I co-sponsored with      Senator Harkin would require the GAO to examine the level of      profits being made by U.S. contractors in Iraq. This is a      historic mission that our government has encouraged, going      back to George Washington, to make sure that no private      company profited off the spoils of war. We need to assure the      American people that their money is being spent wisely,      assure the Iraqi people that it is being spent in their      interest and assure the world that it is not being spent for      profiteering by American companies. I understand both of      these amendments, my amendment and the one I co-sponsored      with Senator Harkin, are the subject of some dispute by the      administration. And in fact, I understand that the majority      party has been advised to ensure the final package doesn't      include those amendments. I can only hope that they have a      change of mind. They are creating a level of mistrust in our      government by our citizens for which we will reap the      consequences for years to come.       As we discuss and debate these issues, let us remember the      simple fact that we remain at war. That is not a fact lost on      the men and women stationed in Iraq. It is not a fact lost on      their families who sit at home worrying about their well-     being. It should not lead to the administration refusing to      release injury figures. We should be willing to admit the      price that is being paid by these brave young men and women      to pursue this policy. I believe that the Executive Branch      has a strong prerogative on national security issues. As      Senator, I have supported that prerogative. But the men and      women elected to serve in the Congress also have a great deal      of wisdom to bring to bear. And quite honestly, my friends,      things, have not gone so well in Iraq that we have a single      mind to waste.       Recent articles in The New York Times and Newsweek report      that many Republicans share the frustration that comes from      lack of genuine consultations--failure to construct a genuine      bipartisan consensus for the sacrifices we are asking      Americans to make. My Republican colleagues Senator McCain      and Senator Hagel, who is speaking at this conference, have      cautioned the administration of the dangers of a failure to      be open and honest with the American people on the situation      in Iraq.       As Senator Hagel and others have suggested, Congress needs      to be more than just a rubber stamp for the administration's      policies. Tell me what war America has won without seeking,      achieving, and maintaining a bipartisan consensus.       President Truman worked closely with Senator Vandenberg      after WWII to secure U.S. support for the United Nations.      President George H.W. Bush consulted closely with Democratic      congressional leaders during the first Gulf War. My husband      consulted closely with Senator Dole and other Republican      leaders during the military action in Bosnia and Kosovo.       In giving Iraqis more of a say and in making transactions      and contracting more open, the U.S. simply is practicing the      habits of democracy--inclusion, empowerment and openness.      Fundamentally, this is about trust--winning and earning the      trust of the Iraqi people and trusting in the Iraqi people      who eventually are going to be left to govern themselves and      keeping the trust of the American people. I cannot stress      strongly enough how significant it is that the American      people across the board, are beginning to ask such serious      questions about our direction in our efforts to pursue a      course in Iraq, but also from the Middle East to North Korea      as well. An unwillingness of the administration to be more      forthright can undermine the greatest capital we have, the      capital of human trust between a government and the governed.      I think we're on the edge of losing both the confidence of      the Iraqi people and of the American people. We can prevent      that from happening with a heavy dose of straight talk.       At the same time that we are trying to build a democratic      society in Iraq, we must     abide by those basic principles that we hold dear and      demonstrate that we are willing to be open and have      partnerships and build coalitions that are more than just in      a name.       I think this moment in American history is wrought with      danger and challenge. If you look back at our security and      goals in WWII they were clear, the Cold War was clear, the      post Cold War era, prior to 9/11, was a little more muddy      because it wasn't as obvious what our strategic objectives      were and how we would achieve them.       Now we do have, once again, a very clear adversary. But      just proclaiming the evil of our adversary is not a strategy;      just assuming that everyone will understand that we are well      motivated and people to be trusted is beyond the range of      human experiences that I understand. This administration is      in danger of squandering not just our surplus which is      already gone in financial terms, but the surplus of good      feeling and hopefulness and care and that we had in almost      global unanimity after 9/11. We are a resilient, optimistic      and effective people and I'm confident that we can regain our      footing, but it needs to be the first order of business, not      only for the administration, but also for Congress and the      American public. It is my hope this conference will provide      more ammunition and more support for those of us who are      trying to get back on track and to give America the chance to      lead consistent with our values and ideals. Thank you very      much.                                  ____                     Remarks of Zbigniew Brzezinski       Washington, Oct. 28, 2003.--Ladies and gentlemen, 40 years      ago almost to the day an important Presidential emissary was      sent abroad by a beleaguered President of the United States.      The United States was facing the prospect of nuclear war.      These were the days of the Cuban Missile Crisis.       Several emissaries went to our principal allies. One of      them was a tough-minded former Secretary of State, Dean      Acheson whose mission was to brief President De Gaulle and to      solicit French support in what could be a nuclear war      involving not just the United States and the Soviet Union but      the entire NATO Alliance and the Warsaw Pact.       The former Secretary of State briefed the French President      and then said to him at the end of the briefing, I would now      like to show you the evidence, the photographs that we have      of Soviet missiles armed with nuclear weapons. The French      President responded by saying, I do not wish to see the      photographs. The word of the President of the United States      is good enough for me. Please tell him that France stands      with America.       Would any foreign leader today react the same way to an      American emissary who would go abroad and say that country X      is armed with weapons of mass destruction which threaten the      United States? There's food for thought in that question.      Fifty-three years ago, almost the same month following the      Soviet-sponsored assault by North Korea on South Korea, the      Soviet Union boycotted a proposed resolution in the U.N.      Security Council for a collective response to that act.       That left the Soviet Union alone in opposition, stamping it      as a global pariah. In the last three weeks there were two      votes on the subject of the Middle East in the General      Assembly of the United Nations. In one of them the vote was      133 to four. In the other one the vote was 141 to four, and      the four included the United States, Israel, Marshall Islands      and Micronesia.       All of our NATO allies voted with the majority including      Great Britain, including the so-called new allies in Europe--     in fact almost all of the EU--and Japan. I cite these events      because I think they underline two very disturbing      phenomena--the loss of U.S. international credibility, the      growing U.S. international isolation.       Both together can be summed up in a troubling paradox      regarding the American position and role in the world today.      American power worldwide is at its historic zenith. American      global political standing is at its nadir. Why? What is the      cause of this? These are facts. They're measurable facts.      They're also felt facts when one talks to one's friends      abroad who like America, who value what we treasure but do      not understand our policies, are troubled by our actions      and are perplexed by what they perceive to be either      demagogy or mendacity.       Maybe the explanation is that we are rich, and we are, and      that we are powerful, and we certainly are. But if anyone      thinks that this is the full explanation I think he or she is      taking the easy way out and engaging in a self-serving      justification. I think we have to take into account two      troubling conditions.       Since the tragedy of 9/11 which understandably shook and      outraged everyone in this country, we have increasingly      embraced at the highest official level what I think fairly      can be called a paranoiac view of the world. Summarized in a      phrase repeatedly used at the highest level, ``he who is not      with us is against us.'' I say repeatedly because actually      some months ago I did a computer check to see how often it's      been used at the very highest level in public statements.       The count then quite literally was 99. So it's a phrase      which obviously reflects a deeply felt perception. I strongly      suspect the person who uses that phrase doesn't know its      historical or intellectual origins. It is a phrase      popularized by Lenin when he attacked the social democrats on      the grounds that they were anti-Bolshevik and therefore he      who is not with us is against us and can be handled      accordingly.       This phrase in a way is part of what might be considered to      be the central defining focus that our policy-makers embrace      in determining the American position in the world and is      summed up by the words ``war on terrorism.'' War on terrorism      defines the central preoccupation of the United States in the      world today, and it does reflect in my view a rather narrow      and extremist vision of foreign policy of the world's first      superpower, of a great democracy, with genuinely idealistic      traditions.       The second condition, troubling condition, which      contributes in my view to the crisis of credibility and to      the state of isolation in which the United States finds      itself today is due in part because that skewed view of the      world is intensified by a fear that periodically verges on      panic that is in itself blind. By this I mean the absence of      a clearly, sharply defined perception of what is transpiring      abroad regarding particularly such critically important      security issues as the existence or the spread or the      availability or the readiness in alien hands of weapons of      mass destruction.       We have actually experienced in recent months a dramatic      demonstration of an unprecedented intelligence failure,      perhaps the most significant intelligence failure in the      history of the United States. That failure was contributed to      and was compensated for by extremist demagogy which      emphasizes the worst case scenarios which stimulates fear,      which induces a very simple dichotomic view of world reality.       I think it is important to ask ourselves as citizens, not      as Democrats attacking the administration, but as citizens,      whether a world power can really provide global leadership on      the basis of fear and anxiety? Can it really mobilize support      and particularly the support of friends when we tell them      that if you are not with us you are against us?       I think that calls for serious debate in America about the      role of America in the world, and I do not believe that that      serious debate is satisfied simply by a very abstract, vague      and quasi-theological definition of the war on terrorism as      the central preoccupation of the United States in today's      world. That definition of the challenge in my view simply      narrows down and over-simplifies a complex and varied set of      challenges that needs to be addressed on a broad front.       It deals with abstractions. It theologizes the challenge.      It doesn't point directly at the problem. It talks about a      broad phenomenon, terrorism, as the enemy overlooking the      fact that terrorism is a technique for killing people. That      doesn't tell us who the enemy is. It's as if we said that      World War II was not against the Nazis but against      blitzkrieg. We need to ask who is the enemy, and the enemies      are terrorists.       But not in an abstract, theologically-defined fashion,      people, to quote again our highest spokesmen, ``people who      hate things, whereas we love things''--literally. Not to      mention the fact that of course terrorists hate freedom. I      think they do hate. But believe me, I don't think they sit      there abstractly hating freedom. They hate some of us. They      hate some countries. They hate some particular targets. But      it's a lot more concrete than these vague quasi-theological      formulations.       I think in the heat of debate Democrats should not be nay-     sayers only, criticizing. They certainly should not be      cheerleaders as some were roughly a year ago. But they should      stress a return to fundamentals in so far as American foreign      policy is concerned. Above all else in stressing these      fundamentals, Democrats particularly should insist that the      foreign policy of a pluralistic democracy like the United      States should be based on bipartisanship because      bipartisanship is the means and the framework for formulating      policies based on moderation and on the recognition of the      complexity of the human condition.       That has been the tradition since the days of Truman and      Vandenberg all the way until recent times. That has been the      basis for American foreign policy that has been remarkably      successful and has led us not only to a triumph in the Cold      War but to emerging as the only global superpower with      special responsibilities.       Bipartisanship helps to avoid extremes and imbalances. It      causes compromises and accommodations. So let's cooperate.      Let's cooperate and challenge the administration to cooperate      with us because within the administration there are also      moderates and people who are not fully comfortable with the      tendencies that have prevailed in recent times.       That has a number of specific implications that are of a      policy type. The first and most important is to emphasize the      enduring nature of the alliance relationship particularly      with Europe which does share our values and interests even if      it disagrees with us on specific policies. But the sharing of      values and interests is fundamental, and we partake of the      same basic beliefs.       We cannot have that relationship if we only dictate or      threaten and condemn those who disagree. Sometimes we may be      right. Sometimes they may be right. But there is something      transcendental about shared values that shouldn't be      subordinated to tactical requirements. We should seek to      cooperate with Europe, not to divide Europe to a fictitious      new and a fictitious old.       And we should recognize that in some parts of the world      Europeans have more experience and more knowledge than we and      certain interests as important as ours. I think particularly      of the Middle East. We should be therefore supporting a      larger Europe, and in so doing we should strive to expand the      zone of peace and prosperity in the     world which is the necessary foundation for a stable      international system in which our leadership could be      fruitfully exercised.       Part of the process of building a larger zone of peace      involves also engaging Russia and drawing it into a closer      relationship simultaneously with Europe and with the Euro-     Atlantic community. But we can only do that if we are clear      as to what we are seeking in pursuing that strategy. I would      say that what we ought to be seeking unambiguously is the      promotion of democracy and decency in Russia and not tactical      help of a very specific and not always all that very useful      type purchased at the cost of compromising even our own      concept of what democracy is.       I am troubled by the unqualified endorsements of a      government in which former KGB types are preponderant as a      successful democracy. That has been the judgment rendered at      the highest levels again within the last few weeks without      any qualification. But in fairness we have to say that some      of that happened before this administration assumed office as      well.       We should be aware of that. If we are going to pursue a      bipartisan policy let's be willing also to accept some      shortcomings on our part. But if Russia is to be part of this      larger zone of peace it cannot bring into it its imperial      baggage. It cannot bring into it a policy of genocide against      the Chechens, and cannot kill journalists, and it cannot      repress the mass media.       I think we should be sensitive to that even if they do      arrest oligarchs with whom some of our friends on K Street      have shared interests. That is not to be approved. It is to      be condemned, but surely there are deeper causes for      emphasizing that it is important that Russia should move      towards democracy.       To increase the zone of peace is to build the inner core of      a stable international zone. While America is paramount it      isn't omnipotent. We need the Europeans. We need the European      Union. (Applause) We have to consistently strive to draw in      Russia while at the same time being quite unambiguous in what      it is that disqualifies Russia still from genuine membership      in the community of democratic, law abiding states.       Secondly, we have to deal with that part of the world which      is a zone of conflict and try to transform it into a zone of      peace, and that means above all else the Middle East. In Iraq      we must succeed. Failure is not an option. But once we say      that we have to ask ourselves what is the definition of      success? More killing, more repression, more effective      counter-insurgency, the introduction of newer devices of      technological type to crush the resistance or whatever one      wishes to call it--the terrorism?       Or is it a deliberate effort to promote by using force a      political solution? And if there's going to be a political      solution in Iraq, clearly I think it is obvious that two      prerequisites have to be fulfilled as rapidly as feasible      namely the internationalization of the foreign presence in      Iraq regarding which too much time has been lost and which is      going to be increasingly difficult to accomplish in spite of      the somewhat dialectical successes with which we are defining      progress in Iraq lately.       In addition to the internationalization of Iraq we have to      transfer power as soon as is possible to a sovereign Iraqi      authority. Sovereignty is a word that is often used but it      has really no specific meaning. Sovereignty today is nominal.      Any number of countries that are sovereign are sovereign only      nominally and relatively. Ultimately even the United States      is not fully sovereign as we go around asking for more men      and money to help us in Iraq.       Therefore there's nothing to be lost in prematurely      declaring the Iraqi authority as sovereign if it helps it to      gain political legitimacy in a country which is searching to      define itself, which has been humiliated, in which there is a      great deal of ambivalence, welcoming on the one hand the      overthrow of Saddam as the majority does, and on the other      hand resenting our presence and our domination.       The sooner we do that the more likely is an Iraqi authority      under an international umbrella that becomes itself more      effective in dealing with the residual terrorism and      opposition that we continue to confront. We will not      understand what is happening right now in Iraq by analogies      to Vietnam because I think they are all together misplaced,      and one could speak at length about it.       If you want to understand what is happening right now in      Iraq I suggest a movie that was quite well known to a number      of people some years ago. Maybe not many in this audience,      given the age of some present, but it's a movie which deals      with a reality which is very similar to that that we confront      today in Baghdad. It's called ``The Battle For Algiers.'' It      is a movie that deals with what happened in Algeria after the      Algerian Liberation Army was defeated in the field by the      French army and the resistance which used urban violence,      bombs, assassinations, and turned Algiers into a continuing      battle that eventually wore down the French.       I do not expect we'll be worn down, but I think we want to      understand the dynamics of the resistance. This provides a      much better analogy for grappling with what is becoming an      increasingly painful and difficult challenge for us. A      challenge which will be more successful in meeting if we have      more friends engaged in meeting it and if more Iraqis begin      to feel that they are responsible for the key decisions      pertaining to their country.       We will not turn the Middle East into a zone of peace      instead of a zone of violence unless we more clearly identify      the United States with the pursuit of peace in the Israeli/     Palestinian relationship. Palestinian terrorism has to be      rejected and condemned, yes. But it should not be translated      de facto into a policy of support for a really increasingly      brutal repression, colonial settlements and a new wall.       Let us not kid ourselves. At stake is the destiny of a      democratic country, Israel, to the security of which, the      well-being of which, the United States has been committed      historically for more than half a century for very good      historical and moral reasons. But soon there will be no      option of a two-state solution.       Soon the reality of the settlements which are colonial      fortifications on the hill with swimming pools next to      favelas below where there's no drinking water and where the      population is 50 percent unemployed, there will be no      opportunity for a two-state solution with a wall that cuts up      the West Bank even more and creates more human suffering.       Indeed as some Israelis have lately pointed out, and I      emphasize some Israelis have lately pointed out, increasingly      the only prospect if this continues is Israel becoming      increasingly like apartheid South Africa--the minority      dominating the majority, locked in a conflict from which      there is no extraction. If we want to prevent this the United      States above all else must identify itself with peace and      help those who are the majority in Israel, who want peace and      are prepared to accept peace.       All public opinion polls show that and the majority of the      Palestinians, and I believe the majority of the Jewish      community in this country which is liberal, open-minded,      idealistic and not committed to extremist repressions.       The United States as the government, but all of us as      citizens and Democrats particularly, will soon have an      opportunity to underline their commitments to a peaceful      solution in the Middle East because in the next two weeks a      group of Israelis and Palestinians are going to unveil a      detailed peace plan on which they have been working for      months and months. It's a fifty-page document with maps and      detailed compromise solutions for all of the major      contentious issues, solutions which opinion shows 70 percent      of the Israelis would accept.       When that happens what will be the stance of the United      States? Sharon has already condemned it, and not      surprisingly. I hope we do not decide to condemn it. I hope      we will show at least a positive interest, and many of us as      citizens, as people concerned, should I think endorse it      because if we count on the people who want peace eventually      we will move towards peace. But they have to be mobilized and      given support.       I think one of the reasons that that support from the      United States has not been forthcoming is in fact political      cowardice which I think is unjustified because I have real      confidence in the good judgment, both of the Israeli people      and of the American Jewish community and more basically of      the basic American preference for a moderate peaceful      solution.       The last third area pertains more broadly to strategic      doctrine and to strategic commitment. It involves trying to      deal with nuclear proliferation, and we are learning      fortunately that we can only deal with that problem when it      comes to North Korea or to Iran by cooperation with other      major powers.       That we have to support, and if the administration moves in      that direction or is prodded to move in that direction that      is all to the good because there is no alternative. If we to      resolve the North Korean problem by arms alone we will      produce a violent reaction against the United States in South      Korea--and don't underestimate the growing anti-American      tendencies in South Korean nationalism--and will precipitate      a nuclear armed Japan and thereby create a whole duel      strategic dynamic in the Far East.       In the case of Iran it is also in our interest that the      theocratic despotism fade. It is beginning to fade. It is in      its thermidorian phase. The young people of Iran are      increasingly alienated. The women of Iran are increasingly      assertive and bold. Notice the reception given to the Nobel      Peace Prize winner when she returned to Tehran. That is a      symptom of things to come.       And if we take preemptory action we will reinforce the      worst tendencies in the theocratic fundamentalist regime, not      to speak about the widening of the zone of conflict in the      Middle East. But beyond that we still have one more challenge      in the area of strategic doctrine which is how to respond to      the new conditions of uncertainty of weapons of mass      destruction perhaps eventually being available to terrorist      groups.       Here I think it is terribly important not to plunge      headlong into the tempting notion that we will preempt      unilaterally on suspicion which is what the doctrine right      now amounts to. The reason for that being we simply do not      know enough to be able to preempt with confidence. That to me      involves one fundamentally important lesson. We have to      undertake a genuine national effort to revitalize and      restructure our intelligence services.       For four years I was the principal channel of intelligence      to the President of the United States. We had a pretty good      idea of the nature of the security challenge that we faced      because the challenge itself was based on a highly advanced      scientific technological system of arms. Today the problem is      much more difficult.       It's more elusive. We're not dealing with nuclear silos and      coordinated structures necessary for an effective assault on      American security, structures that we could begin to decipher      and also technologically seek to undermine or in the event of      warfare paralyze. We were really remarkably well informed and      in some respects prepared for a central nuclear war to a      degree to which we certainly are not today in dealing with      the new challenges of security.       These can only be addressed if we have what we do not have,      a really effective intelligence service. I find it appalling      that when we went into Iraq we did not know if they had      weapons of mass destruction. We thought they had weapons of      mass destruction based largely on extrapolation. But that      also means that our commanders in the field went into battle      without any knowledge of the Iraqi WMD order of battle.       They did not know what units, brigades or divisions in the      Iraqi armed forces were equipped with what kind, allegedly,      of weapons of mass destruction. Were there chemical weapons      on the battalion level or on the brigade level or were there      special units in the different divisions that were supposed      to use chemical weapons?       What about the alleged existence of bacteriological      weapons? Who had them? Who had the right to dispose of them?      What about the allegedly reconstituted nuclear program? At      what level of development was it? Where were these weapons to      be deployed? The fact is none of that was known regarding a      country that was permeable, that was not as isolated as the      Soviet Union.       All of that cumulatively testifies to a fundamental      shortcoming in our national security policy. If we want to      lead we have to have other countries trust us. When we speak      that have to think it is the truth. This is why DeGaulle said      what he did. This is why others believed us. This is why they      believed us prior to the war in Iraq.       It isn't that the Norwegians or the Germans or whoever else      had their own independent intelligence services. They      believed us, and they no longer do. To correct that we have      to have an intelligence that speaks with authority, that can      be trusted, and if preemption becomes necessary can truly      tell us that as a last resort preemption is necessary. Right      now there's no way of knowing.       Ultimately at issue, and I end on this, is the relationship      between the new requirements of security and the traditions      of American idealism. We have for decades and decades played      a unique role in the world because we were viewed as a      society that was generally committed to certain ideals and      that we were prepared to practice them at home and to defend      them abroad.       Today for the first time our commitment to idealism      worldwide is challenged by a sense of security vulnerability.      We have to be very careful in that setting not to become      self-centered, preoccupied only with ourselves and      subordinate everything else in the world to an exaggerated      sense of insecurity.       We are going to live in an insecure world. It cannot be      avoided. We have to learn to live in it with dignity, with      idealism, with steadfastness. Thank you.                          ____________________
