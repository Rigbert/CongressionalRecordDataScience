 President, I will use my time in morning business to update the Senate on the status of the electricity crisis in California.  April is typically the best time of year for California when it comes to meeting its energy needs. Winter has ended in northern California, and the southern part of the State has not yet begun to get hot. Thus, the demand for energy is low throughout the State, and California has always had more than enough power to meet its needs. As a result, electricity is usually very cheap. So this is as good a time as any to provide an update of where the State is and to see how this year is different from all other years. The last ten months provide a gloomy picture of what may well happen this summer.  The average cost of electricity for California this month has been about $300 a megawatt hour. This is more than 10 times higher than the average for last April, right before the crisis began. The average price for electricity in the States of Washington and Oregon is even higher, and the price for electricity bought in the futures market for this summer is now averaging more than $750 a single megawatt hour.  The State Department of Water Resources, which since January has been purchasing all of California's power needs, has now spent $5.2 billion purchasing power just in the first months of this year. It is spending at a rate of $73 million a day. This is having a serious financial impact on the State'scredit standing. Yesterday's Standard & Poor's downgraded the State's credit rating two notches from AA to A-plus.  It is important to point out that the money the State is spending to buy electricity is gone. It does not buy a textbook or a computer for a school. It won't repair a bridge or road. It will not build a highway. It doesn't go for law enforcement. It is money that simply disappears. As a result, the State could well be out of money.  At the same time, the Northwest is experiencing what may well be its driest year on record. Consequently, California will not be able to rely on the 7,000 to 8,000 megawatts of power it typically imports from the Northwest in the summer--usually enough for 7 to 8 million homes. There will not be enough power in the Northwest to even meet its own energy needs this summer.  Meanwhile, natural gas prices in most of the United States are about three times higher than their historic average, and in southern California they are eight times higher. Independent analysts, such as the Brattle Group, have raised significant questions about malfeasance on the part of the few companies that have an oligopoly on the natural gas pipelines. Meanwhile, it has been more than 5 months since the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the FERC, found that electricity rates were ``unjust and unreasonable'', and still they have not acted to fulfill the mandate of the Federal Power Act which directs the FERC to set reasonable rates when the market is not functioning properly.  Allow me to read from the language of the Federal Power Act.       Whenever the Commission, after a hearing had upon its own      motion or upon complaint, shall find that any rate, charge,      or classification, demanded, observed, charged, or collected      by any public utility for any transmission or sale subject to      jurisdiction of the Commission, or that any rule, regulation,      practice, or contract affected such rate, charge, or      classification is unjust, unreasonable, unduly discriminatory      or preferential, the Commission shall determine the just and      reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation,      practice, or contract to be thereafter observed and in force,      and shall fix the same by order.  That is the Federal Power Act. The Federal Power Act very clearly says: FERC, once you find that rates are unjust and unreasonable, you must then fix reasonable rates or charges.  The FERC has not done its duty.  The problems in California began in 1996, when the State became the first to pass a comprehensive energy deregulation bill. That bill was known as AB 1890. The bill passed very quickly at the end of the legislative session. It enjoyed nearly unanimous bipartisan support.  AB 1890 was supposed to increase supplies of energy and decrease prices for consumers, but the exact opposite happened. The bill assumed that increases in energy supply, competition, and efficiency would drive down energy prices. This assumption turned out to be badly flawed, and as a result the State was burned by several provisions of the bill.  First, the bill forced the utilities to purchase at least 95 percent of their electricity in the day-ahead and spot market and did not permit utilities to hedge their bets with long-term, bilateral contracts. That is a huge problem because if 95 percent of the power is bought on the spot market, and those spot market prices go up, the State is in the pickle that it is in today.  Second, the State forced its investor-owned utilities to sell off their generating assets, allowing out-of-State energy generators to purchase the plants and sell the electricity back to the utilities at market rates.  Let me give you an example of that. For Southern California Edison, when it divested of a generating facility, at the time Southern California Edison was selling its power at $30 a megawatt hour. As soon as it sold it to a generating facility, the out-of-State generating facility turned around to sell the power back to Southern California Edison at $300 a megawatt hour. That is part of the problem.  Third, the bill immediately deregulated wholesale prices, but left retail rates regulated until March of 2002, or until a utility has sold off all of its generating units, creating a half-regulated, half-deregulated system. So the free market that we heard so much about can't function as a market should because it is broken. The price on the wholesale end is deregulated. The utility cannot pass that price through to the consumer--or has not been able to.  Incidentally, that is going to change because the State will pass more than a 30-percent rate increase that should go into play in either May or June of this year. So some of that will be corrected.  Fourth, the State set up a power exchange as a product of that bill that aimed to attract sellers by promising the highest clearing price of energy to all bidders. So no matter what you bid your power in for, you are guaranteed the highest price paid to any other bidder. That proved to be fatal.  Energy suppliers realized that simply withholding power from the power exchange and from the California energy market would drastically drive up the prices. And they did.  Spot prices increased dramatically. The costs could not be passed on to consumers. The State's largest investor-owned utility filed for bankruptcy, and the State's second largest investor-owned utility, Southern California Edison, remains on the brink of bankruptcy. The result has been this crisis, and this crisis could well become an economic disaster not only for California, but for the entire West.  Now, what has the State done? I am the first to admit that California has been slow to address the crisis. I think part of this was an actual disbelief that the situation could have gotten this bad this fast. Let me speak about supply because there had not been much supply--very little supply, less than 2,000 megawatts actually--added to the State's power supply in the last decade. But since the first of the year, the State has licensed and approved 14 new gas-fired plants and 8 new peaker plants, which will all be on line within the next 2 years. The State expects to add 9,810 megawatts--that is enough power for 9.810 million households--and have that power on line by the summer of 2003. And the State, in total, will add 20,000 megawatts, enough to power 20 million homes, and have that on line by the end of 2004.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a chart which lists the plants that have been approved, plant by plant, by the State, and the expected dates they will come on line.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      CALIFORNIA POWER PLANTS COMING ONLINE----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------              Plant name                       Capacity             Location--(Peaker?)
