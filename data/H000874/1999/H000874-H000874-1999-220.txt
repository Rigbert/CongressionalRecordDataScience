Chairman, I rise in strong support of the effort being undertaken by NATO in Kosovo and Serbia. I rise in agreement that we must fund our armed services at increased levels to ensure that our security and our ability to join our allies in maintaining international security and stability is maintained.  Mr. Chairman, I believe the President has requested the correct sum for the war until September 30th of this year, $5.9 billion. I believe that war against Serbian genocide and ethnic cleansing is absolutely essential for us to participate in.  But, Mr. Chairman, I also believe we must assist our farmers who find themselves in real crises, and the almost 1 million victims of this hemisphere's worst natural disaster in this century. I therefore, Mr. Chairman, will support the Obey amendment.  I will also, I tell my good friend and the chairman, be supporting increasing the fiscal year 2000 appropriations for our military to ensure the objectives of which I have spoken and of which the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) has so eloquently spoken.  Our national interest, our commitment to humanitarian and moral principles, will be served by the passage of the Obey amendment and it will do so in a way more consistent, I believe, with fiscal responsibility and our responsibility to our men and women in the Armed Forces and to our allies in this just war in which we are now involved.  Mr. Chairman, if the Obey amendment fails, I fully intend to support the Young alternative.
