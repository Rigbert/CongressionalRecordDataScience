President, I ask through the Chair, did the majority leader not hear the distinguished Republican leader say they don't want to give consent to these hearings that the majority may want? I was wondering if the distinguished majority leader was aware of this discussion on May 15 of this year about this judgeship act. First, I quote Senator Sessions, a noted Republican:       My comments on the judges' bill, as a member and Ranking on      the Courts Subcommittee, we did have hearings several years      ago but not recently.  Then we heard from Senator Kyl, the distinguished deputy minority leader:       So what I would like to do, Mr. Chairman, is just recommend      that you take our colleagues up on the suggestion that we      have a hearing to validate the requirements.  At which point Senator Coburn, another Republican, said:       If we're going to fix it, let's fix it right. Let's have a      great hearing. Let's bring the GAO in, let's bring the      Conference in, and let's find out [how] to do it right.  And then Senator Grassley, another noted Republican said:       That is the purpose of a hearing, and that's why it is very      important that we give this adequate study. I ask the      distinguished leader, was he aware of the fact that this      hearing was being held after four senior members of the      Republican caucus asked me to have the hearing?
