Speaker, I include in the Record an article from the Toledo Blade, dated the 20th of April 2018.  In doing so, I want to recognize the conservation work of the Sisters of St. Francis in Sylvania, Ohio and Sister M. Jeremias Stinson.  As the superintendent of Environmental Stewardship, Gardens, Shrines and Woodland Management, in Sylvania, Sister Jeremias has committed her life to protecting over 250 native species of trees under her care.  With Earth Day being this past Sunday, and a few weeks away from Arbor Day, we as a Nation need to recognize the part we take in our environment.  As said by Sister Jeremias, ``To care for all creation, we have to balance the forces of creation. You have to make wise decisions.''                    [From the Blade, Apr. 20, 2018] Nun Oversees Conservation of Saint Francis' Wooded Grounds in Sylvania                            (By Nicki Gorny)       It's a bright spring afternoon at the motherhouse of the      Sisters of St. Francis in Sylvania, and Sister M. Jeremias      Stinson is zipping around the grounds on a John Deere Gator,      navigating stick-strewn paths through the woods as adeptly as      the manicured lawns between buildings.       ``We're going to fly,'' the 74-year-old nun tells a      reporter beside her at one point, fully committed to showing      off the full scope of the grounds within a time-crunched      tour.       The tour, arranged just a few weeks before Arbor Day,      celebrated in Ohio on the last Friday in April, covered just      a sampling of the more than 5,000 mature trees that shade the      grounds. As Sister Jeremias drove, she rattled off the names      of species that stand tall in wooded areas and in deliberate      clusters, like an arboretum between buildings just north of      the Franciscan Center.       There are oaks, firs, and pines--250 native species in all      to keep straight. Sister Jeremias, superintendent of the      environmental stewardship, gardens, shrines, arid woodland      management, has mapped and documented them all.       The motherhouseholds the distinction of having the most      diverse number of plant specimens in the region, said Sister      Jeremias, who undertook a canopy study of the grounds that      began in 2006. The grounds are also recognized as a      conservation sanctuary, as approved in 1930 by the Lucas      County Conservation District and Ohio Forestry Division.       ``They're a great leader in promoting conversation on      private lands,'' said Jamie Kochensparger, education and      outreach director of Lucas County Soil and Water Conservation      District.       Her agency is one of several at the county, state, and      federal level to interact with Sister Jeremias and the      religious community on forestry and conservation-related      matters. With the vast majority of land in the United States      under private ownership, Mrs. Kochensparger said,      conscientious private partners play an important role in this      arena.       ``They've been great ambassadors for that,'' she said.       The distinctions reflect deliberate planning and      maintenance on the part of the sisters, who arrived in      Sylvania. in 1916. Sister Jeremias sees practicality and      spirituality in the number and diversity of trees on the      grounds, pointing to their assistance as groundcover and      windbreaks as well as their alignment with the values of St.      Francis Assisi.       ``Francis of Assisi; our founder, was extremely sensitive      to all facets of nature,'' she said. ''He respected it in all      its forms.''       ``As Franciscans, we are each called--we are all called,      but as Franciscans, we have a strong leaning and a strong      responsibility--to look and care for all creation.''       Sister Jeremias has overseen the grounds since 1974, when      she submitted a proposal to leave her position as a local      schoolteacher and ``put full time into the witness to the      dignity of manual work and contemplation.'' She started with      the renovation of the Portiuncula chapel on the grounds, she      said, and went on to maintain and, in many more instances,      develop the shrines, paths, and other landscape elements that      create to a prayerful environment on the campus.       Her work continues and forwards that of her predecessor,      whose name came up frequently during her recent tour of the      grounds.       ``That fir tree over there, the tall one, was planted by      Mother Adelaide,'' she said at one point, a variation on a      theme that applied to some of the tallest trees on the      grounds.       Mother Adelaide led the original sisters who established a      convent in Sylvania in 1916. While some of the 89 acres they      settled on were natively wooded, Sister Jeremias said, much      was farmland. Mother Adelaide took it upon herself to obtain      and plant trees on the campus to stabilize sandy hills,      create windbreaks, and fulfill other practical functions.       ``Her footprint is still here,'' Sister Jeremias said.       It's there, for example, in a cluster of Norway spruces      behind the Our Lady of Lourdes Grotto. It's also there in a      handful of original trees in the arboretum, whose      establishment Sister Jeremias credited to Mother Adelaide,      even if she's had to since replace many of the original trees      that were planted there over the years.       This sort of maintenance has been an important part of      Sister Jeremias' work on the grounds. She's overseeing      several ponderosa pine seedlings in a patch near the Rosary      Care Center, which will find permanent homes on the grounds      as they grow larger. When the emerald ash borer more      dramatically killed off 1,841 trees on the campus in 2006,      she replanted an area that she now calls     the ``new woods'' on the grounds near Ten Mile Creek.       Whenever she removes trees from the grounds, with an eye      toward long-term sustainability, she replaces them with new      trees that maintain respect to species diversity and the      individual site. While all species are native to the region,      not all thrive in the same soil or at the same elevation.       ``To care for all of creation, we have to balance the      forces of creation,'' Sister Jeremias said. ``You have to      make wise decisions.''       When Sister Jeremias proposed that she focus solely on      grounds work in 1974, Mother Adelaide had died only about 10      years earlier. Sister Jeremias recalled that she began to      notice downed trees and other effects of the community having      gone without a dedicated grounds presence in these years.       It was a role for which the outdoorsy Sister Jeremias, who      grew up in Port Clinton, tagging along to work sites with her      father, a builder, felt she was well suited--and one that      she's been fulfilling faithfully for more than 40 years.       ``I followed her footprint,'' she said of Mother Adelaide.
