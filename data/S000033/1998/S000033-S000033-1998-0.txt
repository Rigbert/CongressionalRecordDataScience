 Speaker, I have never fully appreciated before just how out of touch this institution is with the needs of the American people.  Forty-three million Americans have no health insurance. Millions of senior citizens cannot afford their prescription drugs. And this House is going to vote to send to the Senate for a trial to go on month after month after month to discuss where Bill Clinton touched Monica Lewinsky.  The global economy is volatile. The average American today is working longer hours for lower wages. We have the widest gap between the rich and the poor, and we are voting today perhaps to paralyze our government as the Senate explores the President's extramarital relations and his lies and his cover-up of that relationship.  Mr. Speaker, Bill Clinton acted deplorably in his personal behavior. But what the American people are saying loudly and clearly is, let's get on with the business of the American people.  Mr. Speaker, I rise today as the only Independent in the House--someone who is not a Democrat or a Republican.  There is a great political instability in the world--wars and famine in Africa, tensions in the middle-east, in Bosnia, in Latin America, in Ireland--and a war being fought as we speak in Iraq. There are weapons of mass destruction in place all over the world--nuclear weapons, biological and chemical weapons--all of which can destroy the world.  And we are voting today to impeach a President has extra-marital sexual relations, lied about them and attempted to cover them up.  Mr. Speaker, Bill Clinton acted deplorably in his personal behavior with a 22 year old intern. What he did was wrong--and he should be censured. He should not be impeached, however, and the United States Congress should get on with the business of the American people.
