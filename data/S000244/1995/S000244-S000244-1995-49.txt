I think it is only fair, the gentlewoman from Colorado, that the opponents use their time to lay out the case and not horn in on the opponents' time and take all of the time in support of it.  Second, what the gentlewoman from Colorado's amendment also proposes to do is to limit the cap on punitive damages. Punitive damages are not compensation for anything. It is designed to be punishment for the party or the parties that are at fault. And the bill provides an elastic ceiling on punitive damages of $250,000, or three times the actual damages, whichever is greater. [[Page H2921]] So if there is more than $83,000 or $84,000 of actual damages, then the punitive damages cap goes up.  Punitive damages are not compensation for anything, whether it is an economic loss or a noneconomic loss.  So the gentlewoman is now trying to increase punitive damages awards, which will end up, of course, enriching not only a plaintiff for not what they actually lost but also manufacture's attorney.  I would hope, for these two reasons, that this killer amendment would be defeated.
