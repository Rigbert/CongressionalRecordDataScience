 This project is being developed at the National Aviation and Transportation Center on Long Island and is anticipated to provide an intermodal transportation simulation training, education and planning asset for the entire nation. A total of $19.5 million in federal funding over the next five years has been determined by officials at the National Aviation and Transportation Center as needed to help carry out this project. According to these same officials, this level of federal funding is expected to trigger at least $5 million in private sector contributions and up to $7.5 million in funding from New York State.  Mr. D'AMATO. As my friend knows, no specific appropriation was provided in the fiscal year 1998 conference agreement to allow CAST to go forward in this fiscal year. Therefore, I would like to work with the Chairman, the Long Island Congressional delegation and the Department of Transportation in an effort to find a source of funding to continue work on CAST in this fiscal year.
