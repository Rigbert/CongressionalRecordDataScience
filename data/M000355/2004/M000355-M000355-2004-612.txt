 President, the Senate has a full agenda of business this session. To give the American people a full year's worth of work, I had hoped the politics of the election this fall would maybe wait at least until some of the leaves had sprouted on the trees late this spring.  Sadly, that is not the case. We see the one thing in full bloom in Washington, DC, right now is all politics, all the time.
