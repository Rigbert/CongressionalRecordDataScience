 President, I am pleased today to introduce a bill with Senators Durbin, Kennedy, and Clinton that will help our Nation's high school students graduate with the knowledge necessary to succeed in post-secondary education and the skills needed to succeed in the workforce.  Unfortunately too many high school students today are not completing high school at all or with the skills necessary to enter post-secondary education or the workforce.
