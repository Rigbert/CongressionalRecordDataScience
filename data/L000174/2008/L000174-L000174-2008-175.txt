The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message from the House of Representatives:                                S. 2146         Resolved, That the bill from the Senate (S. 2146)      entitled ``An Act to authorize the Administrator of the      Environmental Protection Agency to accept, as part of a      settlement, diesel emission reduction Supplemental      Environmental Projects, and for other purposes'', do pass      with the following amendment:Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:     SECTION 1. EPA AUTHORITY TO ACCEPT DIESEL EMISSIONS REDUCTION                    SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS.       The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency      (hereinafter, the ``Agency'') may accept (notwithstanding      sections 3302 and 1301 of title 31, United States Code)      diesel emissions reduction Supplemental Environmental      Projects if the projects, as part of a settlement of any      alleged violations of environmental law--       (1) protect human health or the environment;       (2) are related to the underlying alleged violations;       (3) do not constitute activities that the defendant would      otherwise be legally required to perform; and       (4) do not provide funds for the staff of the Agency or for      contractors to carry out the Agency's internal operations.     SEC. 2. SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PROVISIONS.       In any settlement agreement regarding alleged violations of      environmental law in which a defendant agrees to perform a      diesel emissions reduction Supplemental Environmental      Project, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection      Agency shall require the defendant to include in the      settlement documents a certification under penalty of law      that the defendant would have agreed to perform a comparably      valued, alternative project other than a diesel emissions      reduction Supplemental Environmental Project if the      Administrator were precluded by law from accepting a diesel      emission reduction Supplemental Environmental Project. A      failure by the Administrator to include this language in such      a settlement agreement shall not create a cause of action      against the United States under the Clean Air Act or any      other law or create a basis for overturning a settlement      agreement entered into by the United States.     SEC. 3. INCLUSION OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN CERTAIN                    STATE AND LOCAL GRANT PROGRAMS FOR DIESEL                    EMISSION REDUCTIONS.
