 President, my colleague and cosponsor, Senator Snowe, is present in the Chamber. I will yield her time in just a moment.  I point out a woman's health care decision to have or not have an abortion should be with herself, her family, her doctor, and her religion. That is not the case in the military today. When a woman has to go to her commanding officer and request permission to fly home on a military transport, she no longer has the ability to make that decision on her own. It becomes a very public decision.  This amendment simply gives back her privacy and allows her to pay for at her own expense a health care procedure in a military hospital where she is safe and taken care of.  I am delighted my cosponsor, Senator Snowe, is here, and I yield her as much time as she needs.
