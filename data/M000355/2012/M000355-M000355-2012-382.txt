 President, let me start on a sort of sober note by saying we are all thinking of our colleague Mark Kirk. It is at moments such as these that we are all reminded of how fragile life is, and that there are far more important things in life than politics. So we send Mark and his family our prayers and our wishes for a speedy recovery.                          ____________________
