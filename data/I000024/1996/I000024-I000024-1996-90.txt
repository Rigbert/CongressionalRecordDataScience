President, the distinguished Senator from North Dakota talked about star wars. He and I have had this discussion. There is, I guess, nothing to be gained other than to update it and put it in the context of today's debate, but it always offends me when we talk about star wars. Star wars is a phrase that was coined to make it look like this is something fictitious, something imaginary, when in fact there is a very real threat that is facing the United States of America, that of missile attack.  We know the Russians have their SS-25. They have the SS-18, which is a MIRV'd missile with a number of warheads capability, some 10 warheads. We know the Chinese have a missile that can reach us. We know the North Koreans are in the final stages of developing the Taepo Dong missile that originally was going to reach the United States by 2002. Now we feel, our intelligence community feels, it will be the year 1999.  We were on schedule from 1983 to protect ourselves against a missile attack, so that we would have protection, or a defense system in place, by the year 1999. We are not talking about star wars. We are not talking about even space-based launchers. We are talking about technology that is alive today. We have bought and paid for and have almost $50 billion invested in 22 Aegis ships that are floating now, paid for. They have launching capability. They can knock down missiles coming in. But they cannot knock down missiles coming in, ICBM's, that would come in from above the atmosphere. So we are trying merely to take that $50 billion that has already been spent, spend $4 billion more so they can reach above the atmosphere and knock down a missile that might be coming from North Korea.  We would have some 30 minutes' time between the time a missile is launched and our technology tells us when that was launched. I am an aviator. I flew an airplane around the world a couple of years ago. I used the global positioning system, that is satellites, for navigation all the way around. We can know what is happening around the world today. The technology is there.  So, if a missile is launched in North Korea, we know it is coming, we have 30 minutes to do something about it, but you cannot hit it because it is above the upper tier. All we need to do is spend about 10 percent more of the money that we have spent to be able to give the capability to knock it down. That is not star wars. I do not know where they come up with this $70 billion or $60 billion. The CBO came out and said it would cost about $31 billion to $60 billion more, over the next 14 years, if we installed and made a reality all of the proposed missile defense systems. We are not suggesting that. No one is.  The other day on this floor I said it is like going into a used car lot and saying I want to buy all the cars. You do not need to do that. You get the one that works, the one that fits your needs, and that takes care of it. That is the way we are in our missile defense system. I hate to use that as an example. I hate to be redundant by coming back over and over again, talking about it, but it has to be talked about.  When the distinguished Senator from North Dakota said we are talking about a budget next week about spending $11 billion more than the Pentagon wants--yes, I will be supporting that. Those of us who are conservatives over here, we want cuts in programs. We have to defend America. I was so proud of the chiefs of the four services testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, who came in and--this is the first time, I think, in the history of this country this has happened--they defied their own President and said we have to have $20 billion more in order to defend America. This is what they said.  They are not the top. There is the Secretary of Defense, appointed by the President; not the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, JohnShalikashvili, who is also appointed. These are the ones in charge of the four services, and it took a lot of courage. We do need it and it took courage.  ``Where is the money going to come from for all these,'' the Senator said. If he had been listening, I outlined a program we have been talking about for several years now. The Heritage Foundation and others came up with it. If we take all our Government programs and not eliminate one program, but only expand each one by 1.5 percent, we would be able to balance the budget and have the tax cuts that we have talked about that Americans desperately need.  That is not realistically what is going to happen, but we could do it, and I would live with that in a heartbeat, a 1.5 percent increase in the defense budget. We have cut our defense budget 11 consecutive years. We are down now below the level where we were in 1980 when we could not afford spare parts. So that is significant.                          ____________________
