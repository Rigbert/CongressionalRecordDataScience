 President, will the Senator suspend? Could I ask what the order of business is?  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The order is to resume consideration of H.R. 2299.  Mr. McCONNELL. Seeing no one else on the floor, I ask unanimous consent I be allowed to proceed for 5 minutes as in morning business.
