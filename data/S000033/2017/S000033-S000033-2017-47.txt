 President, let me begin by pointing out an op-ed that appeared in the Boston Globe today. It is an op-ed that I wrote. It is called ``The health care crisis no one is talking about.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this op-ed be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Boston Globe, Oct. 31, 2017]       The Health Care Crisis No One Is Talking About                          (By Bernie Sanders)       The United States faces a major crisis in primary health      care, and unless Congress acts immediately it is likely to      become much worse.       Millions of Americans are at risk of losing their access to      health care because Congress did not renew funding for the      community health center program at the end of the fiscal      year, Sept. 30. Unless we renew funding immediately, 70      percent of funding will be cut, the doors of 2,800 community      health centers will close, and 9 million patients will lose      access to quality health care. That is unacceptable.       Our nation's community health centers provide affordable,      high-quality health care to more than 27 million people. This      includes not only primary health care, but also dentistry,      counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs. For the 13      million rural patients served, community health centers often      are the only health care provider for hundreds of     miles. And they provide good jobs in communities that need      them the most.       Community health centers not only save lives, they also      save money. Instead of people ending up in expensive      emergency room care, or in the hospital, they get the primary      care they need, when they need it, at high quality medical      centers. Compared to other providers, community health      centers save on average $2,371 per Medicaid patient and up to      $1,210 per Medicare patient. What's more, community health      centers have played a pivotal role in generating more than      $49 billion in savings to the entire health care system.       Not only do we have to renew funding for the community      health center program, we must also improve and expand the      National Health Service Corps--the program that provides debt      forgiveness for young doctors, nurses, dentists, mental      health providers, and pharmacists who are prepared to work in      our nation's most underserved areas. Without debt      forgiveness, it is very hard to get new doctors to choose      primary care--an area of medicine that does not pay the big      bucks. It is also difficult to attract medical professionals      into the underserved areas of our country where they are      needed the most.       It is widely acknowledged that we currently have the most      wasteful, inefficient, and expensive health care system in      the world. Despite spending almost $10,000 per capita on      health care, twice as much as any other country, 28 million      Americans have no insurance, even more are underinsured, with      high copayments and deductibles, and we pay the highest      prices in the world for prescription drugs. The rarely      discussed truth is that thousands of Americans die each year      because they cannot afford to get to a doctor when they      should.       We must not allow a bad situation to get worse.       We cannot tell millions of low-income and working people in      every state in this country that they will no longer be able      to access the health care, dental care, mental health      counseling, and low-cost prescription drugs they desperately      need.       We cannot tell pregnant women that they will not be able to      get the necessary prenatal care they require in order to have      healthy babies.       We cannot tell the young person addicted to opioids or      heroin that there is no treatment available.       We cannot tell chronically ill senior citizens that they      will have to survive without the prescription drugs they have      used for years.       We cannot force community health centers, which provide      some of the most cost-effective health care in the country,      to lay off the doctors, nurses, dentists, and administrators      who keep these centers going.       Historically, the community health center program has      enjoyed widespread bipartisan support, and that support      continues. Today, along with almost all Democrats, there are      a number of Republicans who fully understand how important      these centers are to the well-being of their states and want      to see the program refunded.       The time for delay is over. Congress must act immediately      to fully fund the community health center program and the      associated workforce programs that provide them with the      well-trained staffing they need.
