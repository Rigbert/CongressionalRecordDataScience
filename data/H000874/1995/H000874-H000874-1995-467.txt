Speaker, I rise to inform my colleagues that later this afternoon I hope to have the opportunity to offer an amendment to lift the arms embargo against Bosnia and Herzegovina.  Mr. Chairman, I do so knowing that difficult circumstances confront the United States as well as our allies. It is after all their forces that are still being held hostage by Bosnian Serb forces.  I think we all recognize that the U.N. peacekeeping forces went in to provide critically needed humanitarian aid. But, it has ended up providing a cover, enabling the Serbs to continue the war largely without the credible threat of resolute military action by the United Nation or NATO.  The fact is there is no peace being kept. In this the United Nation has failed.  I am encouraged by the more forceful actions that are being planned by our allies, that is the plan to deploy a rapid-expansion force to protect UNPROFOR, thereby giving some muscle to those forces in Bosnia. I am also pleased by the statements coming from a number of our allies, notably president Chirac that France ``refuses to yield to fatalism and irresponsibility.''  My concern remains, however, that we are still confronted with a U.N. force that is mandated to be ``impartial'' in a war of aggression and a genocide that claims the lives of mostly civilians. It is an untenable position both from the members of UNPROFOR who must stand by and watch the killings, and the ethnic-cleansing, and for the nations who have failed to take the necessary action to protect the hundreds of thousands of victims from their persecutors. It is a position which states as its working premise to choose no sides to treat the aggressor and victim the same. Yet at the same time UNPROFOR watches in horror, the arms embargo has the effect of denying the right of Bosnians to defend themselves, their families, and their nation from a well-armed and well-trained military force that seeks to annihilate them.  Once this current crisis is resolved we must not allow the status quo to be reinstated. And what I mean by that is for a slightly reinforced UNPROFOR merely to go back to what it was doing, or I should say not doing.  This is a war between sovereign nations in the heart of Europe. It is a war that has been and continues to be the result of an illegal act of aggression by Serbia against the peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is a war and genocide of a scale that we have not witnessed since World War II in Europe. And most tragically of all it is a war against a nation that stands for the very values which the United States, NATO and the U.N. security council espouse over and over again, and which Serbian policy is bent on exterminating.                              {time}  1310  I believe, Mr. Speaker, that the United States must act to lift the arms embargo against the victims of a war of aggression not of their making. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting that amendment.  Mr. Speaker, I also rise to express concern about this rule. This issue is a critically important issue. I believe that the amendment to be offered by the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde], the War Powers Act amendment, is also a critically important amendment, worthy of more than a few minutes of debate on the floor of the House of Representatives.  The gentleman from Ohio is correct: If we are serious about being the policy makers and enunciating the policies that this Nation ought to pursue, I think the American public expects us to do so in a considered way, allowing full time for debate.  These are not unserious issues. These are not issues of little consequence. Indeed, the issue of which I speak speaks to the very essence of what America stands for, of what the United Nations stands for, and what NATO has pledged to protect: The opportunities of a people freely elected to be free from international aggression. That is what America stands for.  The gentleman who just preceded me spoke about the unwillingness of North Korea to allow a bipartisan delegation to come in and to talk and to see. The lesson that we learned in World War II and the lesson that we ought to be learning is that openness in foreign policy leads to international security on all sides.  I regret very much, Mr. Speaker, that time is being limited; that in effect some of us are going to be, I think, prevented as I understand it from offering a critically important amendment that passed this House overwhelming 1 year ago, when we said then we ought to lift unilaterally the embargo imposed upon Bosnia and Herzegovina.  What does that mean in real terms? It means you have two people confronting one another in a war. One is heavily armed and one is very lightly armed, and we say we are neutral. We will not allow any arms to go in. We will not allow others to help the combatants.  What does that mean? That means by definition you have taken the side of the party that has been heavily armed, in this case the Bosnian-Serb aggressors who have succeeded to the Yugoslavian arms heavy weapons.  Mr. Speaker, I have had a discussion with the chairman of the Committee on International Relations, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman]. He is my good friend and I believe a supporter of this amendment. I do not want to speak for him. He and I have fought together on the side of preventing the genocide that has occurred in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  But I must tell my friend I am deeply disappointed we will not be able to, if that is the case, address this issue today. As a result, I will not support the rule, because I believe we need more time.
