The analysis by eminent attorneys looking at this legislation, looking at the exemptions, suggests in the case of Bull's Eye that this dealer would not be subject to liability; he would be immunized from liability because of this particular bill.  This is a situation that has to be made very clear to people. We are essentially giving this individual an opportunity to walk away from serious negligence. I don't think it is appropriate. In fact, I think it is unconscionable.  There is a factual discussion about the status of the Bull's Eye Shooting Gallery. My understanding is--and it is close, I think, to that of the Senator from Idaho with additional detail--as I understand it, the individual who was in fact the owner-operator, Brian Borgelt, had his license revoked. He is appealing that revocation in court. That is his right. He somehow transferred ownership of the store to someone we have been informed is a friend, a colleague, which is also permissible under the law. It appears, though, that Mr. Borgelt is operating a shooting gallery in the same building, but it does look as if this might be an entirely legal transaction.  The point was raised earlier, and Senator Lautenberg and I have tried to clarify, at least there was an impression this store was closed, out of business, and not operating. The agreement and the factual accuracy as of this point that we both share is the store is operating. The individual who owned it is no longer operating it because his license has been revoked and he is challenging the revocation.
