President, more than 30 years ago, in the midst of Guatemala's civil war, the construction of a large hydroelectric dam on the Chixoy River resulted in destruction of 33 indigenous Mayan communities and the massacres of more than 400 villagers and other abuses by the Guatemalan army.  The history of that tragedy is well known so I will not recount it here. Suffice it to say that a great injustice was committed. There was ample blame to go around between the Army, the World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank that financed the dam, governments, including the United States, whose representatives on the banks' boards of directors voted for the construction, and subsequent Guatemalan Governments that failed to compensate the victims or punish those responsible.  Last month, the Guatemalan Government and representatives of the communities culminated many months of negotiations with an agreement to implement the contents of the 2010 reparations plan, including individual payments and community development investments that will be financed over a period of years. The agreement was formalized at a public ceremony on Saturday, November 1, attended by Guatemala's President Otto Perez Molina, members of the communities, other government officials, and representatives of the multilateral banks and the United Nations.  There are many who thought this day would never come, and I commend the commitment and patience of the members of the communities, particularly those who lost loved ones so many years ago, the Guatemalan officials who negotiated the agreement, President Perez Molina for his personal support, as well as key officials from the multilateral banks who played an indispensable role, and Inter-American Development Bank President Luis Moreno, who also took a personal interest. I also commend the U.S. Embassy officials and representatives of the Catholic Church who provided encouragement and support during this process. Finally, I want to acknowledge Guatemala's Ambassador to the United States and the U.S. Treasury Department officials who recognized the need to resolve this issue.  This is a historic milestone that finally begins to right a grievous wrong, a wrong that was emblematic of the horrors of the armed conflict that engulfed Guatemala a generation ago. A great many innocent people lost their lives or their livelihoods in that war, and many of the key provisions of the 1992 Peace Accords remain unfulfilled.  Until now, Chixoy was among the unfinished business, so this is a welcome and important step toward addressing the damages suffered by these communities. Yet I am as mindful as others that in many respects this agreement is only the beginning. The task ahead is to ensure its implementation, which will be the responsibility of the current and future Guatemalan Governments, the multilateral banks that have pledged to redirect some of their own resources to this effort, and all those who care about Guatemala's past, present, and future.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a description of Saturday's ceremony formalizing the agreement, provided by the Guatemalan Embassy in Washington, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          President Perez Molina Formalizes Historic Agreement       The President of Guatemala, Otto Perez Molina, formalized      an historic agreement for economical reparations for 33      communities of Baja Verapaz affected by the construction of      the Chixoy Hydroelectric in 1978.       A public event was held in the Municipal Stadium in      Rabinal, Baja Verapaz on Saturday, where representatives of      the Executive, the affected communities, the Human Rights      Ombudsman's Office, the Organization of American States and      the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human      Rights handed the Government Decree number 378-2014 to the      Communities.       ``Today is an historic day'' expressed President Perez      Molina, ``one that closes a shameful chapter of abuses, human      rights violations and injustices suffered by thousands of      families that lived in the area where Chixoy was built''.      Also, in front of thousands of people from the affected      communities that attended the formalization of the Government      Decree at the Rabinal Municipal Stadium, he ratified his      administration's commitment to comply with the terms of the      Public Policy.       He continued to express, on behalf of the State of      Guatemala, a public apology to the families of the 33      communities that were wronged by the construction in 1978 of      the Chixoy Hydroelectric Dam. With this public apology, he      began implementing the Government Decree for moral and      material reparations. ``I want to be the first to follow      through with the public policy of reparations and comply with      one of the main points of the agreement which is      responsibility of the Presidency of Guatemala. So today, in      this historic day of happiness and celebration of     the Agreement reached by the Government and the Communities,      I want to take the first step and publicly apologize as      President of the Republic, as representative of the unity of      our citizens, for the abuse and human rights violations that      each one of the communities suffered''.       He continued to say: ``On behalf of the State of Guatemala      I ask you to accept these apologies so that we can heal the      wounds in our hearts without forgetting the injustices and      human rights violations that occurred''.       President Perez Molina also said that he felt honored that      his administration managed to reach an historic agreement      that will contribute to overcome the drama that the      Communities suffered for more than three decades. He      continued to say that with the public event to recognize and      repair the affected populations, one of his main objectives      when taking office in January of 2012 was fulfilled. He went      back and quoted his inauguration speech: ``I ask God to grant      us the wisdom to actively promote true reconciliation. A      reconciliation that gives us the strength to work on our      pending issues, on unattended injustices, on reconstructing      our social fabric and to keep investing on the most valuable      thing our Guatemala has, its citizens.''                Public Policy for Reparation of Damages       Several Government officials attended the public event,      which had Vice President Roxana Baldetti as honor witness.      Present also were representatives of the communities, local      authorities and representatives of international      organizations.       President Perez Molina highlighted that the agreement      required a public policy for reparations and a structured      plan to combat poverty, social injustice, inequality and the      abandonment that these communities have suffered.       The Government Decree that gives life to this agreement was      published on Friday in the Official Gazette and establishes      the Public Policy for the Reparation of the Communities      Affected by the Construction of the Chixoy Hydroelectric Dam.       The Policy will be applied to benefit 11,383 families and      will offer basic infrastructure for 33 communities in Baja      Verapaz, Alta Verapaz and Quiche, where the affected      populations lived when the violations occurred.       President Perez Molina highlighted that the implementation      during 2015 and 2016 has a budget of 200 million dollars for      individual reparations. Besides individual pay, the      Government will direct 1 billion quetzals in the next 15      years to build basic infrastructure in the 33 affected      communities.                          ____________________
