 I certainly do understand the concern of the two gentlemen who have offered the amendment, the concern regarding cleanup in the State of New York and elsewhere; and do share their concerns that we are not adequately investing and cleaning up contaminated communities where we do as the Federal Government have an obligation.  I also do point out that, given the constraints faced by the subcommittee, I believe that the chairman has made wise choices, the best that he could, relative to the spreading of resources; and join in his opposition to the amendment. Obviously, we would like to continue to work together to see that adequate funding at some point is provided for these and other programs.
