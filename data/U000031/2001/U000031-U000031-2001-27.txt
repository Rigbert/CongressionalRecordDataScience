Speaker, I am pleased to recognize the outstanding career of John W. Clark, who, after 16 years of service to CMS Energy Corporation, will retire as Senior Vice President of Governmental and Public Affairs.  As a result of his hard work, expertise and character, Mr. Clark has earned the respect and admiration of his colleagues and of countless individuals who have benefited from his capabilities.  The success Mr. Clark has attained throughout the years will stand as a testimony to his integrity, dedication and loyalty.  Mr. Clark's efforts and achievements have established him as an invaluable asset to Consumers Energy and will reflect positively for many years to come--his talents will certainly be missed.  It is with great pride and respect that I join with John Clark's friends and colleagues in paying tribute to his many years of service to CMS Energy Corporation, and in wishing him the very best that retirement has to offer.                          ____________________
