Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding me this time, and I thank the chairman.  I particularly want to congratulate the committee on the additional money for firefighting. I know it is a tough budget year. I know their allocations were inadequate. But it was absolutely crucial that we get the up-front money we need for what is expected to be the worst fire year in Western history so we can be better prepared and also have the assurances of an additional funding for next year so that the Forest Service can begin to get into long-term contracts for larger aircraft, for fuel retardant crops.  That said, I am concerned that after last year's vigorous debate and final resolution of the Healthy Forest Restoration Act, with the promise of $760 million a year from the White House committed to hazardous fuel reductions in Western forests, that there is only $266 million in this bill. That is not adequate. At that level, if there was no additional fuels buildup, it would take 100 years to deal with the already accumulated buildup. That is part of the reason why they have to so robustly fund firefighting. We simply have to get ahead of this problem. We can provide jobs in rural communities, we can do fuel reduction in a way that is labor intensive, but will protect resources, protect our communities, and enhance the forests. But at the $266 million level, that is simply not going to get done. In fact, we will probably see the backlog grow over the coming years.  So again, I congratulate the committee for the additional money for firefighting and hope in the conference committee that they can find some additional funds to move ahead with fuel reduction.
