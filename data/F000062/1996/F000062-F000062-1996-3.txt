 President, I want to address my remarks today to pending judicial nominations. It is my understanding that there may be some agreement to bring forward some additional judicial appointments before this Senate adjourns. I certainly hope that is the case. I want to point out five specific judges, relating to California, some of which have been before this body for a substantial period of time, and the importance of those nominations.  We essentially have two appointments to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals which could be filled by this Senate in the next day. The first is William Fletcher. He is a Harvard College graduate. He is a Rhodes Scholar. He is a Navy officer. He is a graduate of Yale Law School. He has been a law clerk for Justice Brennan, and a law professor at the University of California at Berkeley since 1977. He actually received the university's distinguished teaching award in 1993.  I was sitting on the Judiciary Committee when he came up for review. He passed that committee with a favorable recommendation by a vote of 12 to 6. At that time there was some concern about his mother's service on the ninth circuit. An overture was made, as to whether his mother would be willing to either retire or take senior status. She has since said that she would be willing to take senior status to avoid any tinge of nepotism, should he be appointed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  I might say this. The American Bar Association has unanimously rated Professor Fletcher, ``well qualified.'' That is its highest rating. His academic colleagues have stated to us that he is fair minded and politically moderate.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a number of letters regarding Professor Fletcher's nomination be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.
