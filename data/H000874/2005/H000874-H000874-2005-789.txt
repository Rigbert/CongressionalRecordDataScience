 Mr. DeLAY. I appreciate the gentleman yielding. The White House has indicated to us that they will submit, as the gentleman said, the supplemental request on the tsunami next week. But we also expect the supplemental requests on the war on terror, and I would expect the House to consider some supplemental sometime in the month of March.
