Chairman, I thank the gentleman very much for yielding me this time, and I rise in strong support of the Blumenauer-Tancredo amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I recognize that the limited additional funds being proposed here for the Inspector General to focus on animal fighting certainly reflects what is happening in our country. Last year, we supported the amendments to provide $800,000 for the Inspector General to focus on animal fighting cases. This is a modest expansion to that.  One of the items I wanted to point out is that when the Inspector General gets funds and they are able to work on a problem, if there is criminal wrongdoing there is a financial recovery to the government of the United States. An absolute relationship between the funds we give to the Inspector General and the ability for general accounts, Treasury accounts, to have increased criminal payments because of the litigation that is done through the Inspector General's office.  So even though there is a little more money being provided in the amendment, believe me, it will be recovered and returned to the Treasury because of the fantastic job that the Inspector General does. In fact, we will probably end up with more money in the general treasury as a result of this amendment.  With all that is going on with animal diseases, I think it is fair to say the Department should be more vigilant with respect to animal welfare issues. And I want to commend the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) and the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tancredo) for bringing this forward. It is a shame that funds are not requested within the administration's request; but they, like us, are trying to deal with unrealistically small allocations that our committee has been given.  We will certainly support this amendment and hope to increase the Inspector General's accounts even more as we move toward conference. So the gentleman has my support and I commend him very much.
