Chairman, I say to the gentleman from Louisiana (Chairman Livingston), my friend, I tell him honestly that I have heard him say that before. He said it on the emergency bill that we had for the flood victims in the Midwest. The gentleman has said it before in terms of the budget and the shutdown of government.  The fact of the matter is this President believes he is part of this process and he believes that there are certain things he will not accept. We understand that. And I agree wholeheartedly with the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young) who said some of these items, yes, they ought to be debated in a larger context, but not on an emergency supplemental.  The gentleman from Louisiana (Chairman Livingston) himself was for not having offsets, and I agreed with him on that. This is important and ought to pass as quickly as possible. And to facilitate that, we ought to take these extraneous issues, bring them on the floor, put in a day or two of debate. We certainly have not used much time in the last 90 days. We would have time to debate.  Mr. Chairman, I will tell the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murtha), ranking member of the Subcommittee on National Security, I intend to enthusiastically support his motion to recommit because I think it is the right way to go to get this critical bill through in a timely fashion.
