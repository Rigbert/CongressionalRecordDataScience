 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it adjourn until 12 noon tomorrow, Tuesday, January 27. I further ask that following the prayer and the pledge, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and the Senate then resume consideration of H.R. 3108, the pensions bill, with the time until 12:30 equally divided between the bill's managers or their designees.  I further ask unanimous consent that the Senate recess from 12:30 to 2:15 for the weekly policy luncheons. In addition, I ask unanimous consent that the time from 2:15 to 2:30 be equally divided between Senators Kyl and Baucus or their designees; provided that at 2:30 the Senate proceed to a vote on or in relation to the Kyl amendment No. 2234, with no intervening action or debate.
