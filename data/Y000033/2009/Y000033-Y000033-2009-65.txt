Madam Speaker, pursuant to the Republican Leadership standards on earmarks, I am submitting the following information regarding earmarks I received as part of H.R. 3326, the Departments of Defense Appropriations Act, 2010.  Project Name: Synthetic Liquid Fuels  Bill Number: H.R. 3326  Legal Name and address of entity receiving earmark: Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding isjustified: This project will supply the U.S. Air Force and other military branches a secure supply of synthetic fuels to operate fighters, bombers and other aircraft and military equipment. It will help the Air Force to achieve its stated goal of certifying its fleet of aircraft on a synthetic fuel blend and purchasing 50 percent of its fuels in the form of a synthetic fuel blend by 2016.  Appropriated Amount: $2,400,000  Detailed Finance Plan: Research and Development, $2,400,000  Project Name: AutoScan Under-Vehicle Inspection System  Bill Number: H.R. 3326  Legal Name and address of entity receiving earmark: Kachemak Research Development, Inc., 59584 East End Road, Homer, Alaska 99603  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: Kachemak Research Development, Inc. is a woman owned, HUBZone, 8(a) entity. AutoScan, an under vehicle inspection system developed by KRD, is a stationary system that captures the entire undercarriage image of vehicles, ranging in size from passenger vehicles to semi-trucks. Because of the unique capabilities of AutoScan, vehicles do not need to maintain a constant speed as they travel across the system. Funding will be used for product enhancement and beta testing of Autoscan generation 2 and 3 architecture. As part of the inspection protocol at every military base, CONUS and OCONUS, the undercarriage of every delivery vehicle must be inspected. Standard inspection protocols have been comprised of a mirror-mounted stick or search pits. AutoScan makes it possible for inspection personnel to maintain a safe stand-off distance. Additionally, it stores images for later comparison and analysis if needed. And it provides one, complete, clear image of any vehicle's under-side in real-time and capabilities that no similar system is able to provide.  Appropriated Amount: $2,400,000  Detailed Finance Plan: Research and Development, and Testing, $2,400,000  Project Name: Electromagnetic Interference Hardened Expandable Rigid Wall Shelter  Bill Number: H.R. 3326  Legal Name and address of entity receiving earmark: Alkan Shelter, LLC, 1701 South Cushman Street, Fairbanks, Alaska 99701  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: The U.S. Marine Corps has a requirement to develop an EMI hardened, expandable composite rigid wall shelter, which currently does not exist. The USMC Electronic Maintenance Shelter Program, Calibration Laboratory Program, and the Communication Maintenance Shelter Program are several funded programs with an immediate need. Sufficient funding is not available for an EMI hardened, expandable rigid wall composite shelter development program. Alkan Shelter, LLC, a small business located in a HUBZone in Fairbanks, AK, proposes a three-phase development and test program for an expandable, composite EMI hardened shelter for the U.S. Marine Corps. First phase is to study the feasibility of EMI hardening to 60-80dB attenuation for the entire expandable shelter or hardening one wing of the shelter. The second phase is to manufacture the EMI hardened composite expandable shelter prototype. The third phase will be to perform EMI and environmental testing to ensure requirements are met. The Marine Corps now uses 1980's technology rigid wall shelters that have aluminum skins and a paper honeycomb core. These shelters are: poorly insulated, have a limited roof and floor load, do not have ballistic protection, the roof cannot be sandbagged, are highly subject to corrosion and can only be stacked six-high on ocean going container ships. Additionally, the U.S. military does not have an EMI hardened expandable rigid wall shelter. Alkan's new carbon fiber hybrid composite expandable shelter will provide a technologically superior structure that will correct the deficiencies of old 1980's technology. Combining high tech carbon fiber composites with EMI protection will provide the USMC and the U.S. military with a lightweight, expandable, rugged, thermally efficient, and safer working environment for carrying out their sensitive electronics and calibration repair and maintenance missions.
