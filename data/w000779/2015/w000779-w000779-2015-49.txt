There is nothing better than having Carolina barbecue unless it is Oregon salmon. Yes, we old jocks, former football players and basketball players, we have tough debates and then we go out and enjoy a meal.  Here is how I would like to start this afternoon. The distinguished chairman of the committee is absolutely correct in saying that cyber security is a very substantial problem. My constituents know a lot about that because one of our prominent employers, SolarWorld, a major manufacturer in renewable energy, was hacked by the Chinese simply because this employer was trying to protect its rights under trade law. In fact, our government indicted the People's Liberation Army for their hacking into this major Oregon employer. So no question that cyber security is a major problem.  Second, there is no question in my mind that information sharing can be very valuable in a number of instances. If we know, for example, someone is associated with hackers, malware, this sort of thing, of course it is important to promote that kind of sharing. The difference of opinion is that I believe this bill is badly flawed because it doesn't pass the test of showing that when we share information, we have to have robust privacy standards or else millions of Americans are going to look up and they are going to say that is really not cyber security. They are going to say it is a surveillance bill. So that is what the difference of opinion is.                    Amendment No. 2621, as Modified  Let me turn to how I have been trying to improve the legislation. I am going to speak for a few minutes on my amendment No. 2621 to the bill that we have been discussing and that is now pending in the Senate. Obviously, anybody who has been watching the debate on this cyber security bill has seen what we would have to call a spirited exchange of views. Senators are debating the substance of the legislation and, as I just indicated to Chairman Burr and I have indicated to ranking minority member Senator Feinstein, there is agreement on a wide variety of points and issues.  Both supporters and opponents of the bill agree that sharing information about cyber security threats, samples of malware, information about malicious hackers, and all of this makes sense and one ought to try to promote more of it. Both supporters and opponents now agree that giving corporations immunity from customer lawsuits isn't going to stop sophisticated attacks such as the OPM personnel records breach.  I am very glad that there has been agreement on that point recently, because proponents of the bill sometimes said that their legislation would stop hacks such as the one that took place at OPM. When technologists reviewed it, that was clearly not the case, and the claim has been withdrawn that somehow this bill would prevent hacks like we saw at OPM.  The differences of opinion between supporters and opponents of the bill--who do agree on a variety of these issues--surround the likely privacy impact of the bill. Supporters have essentially argued that the benefits of this bill, perhaps, are limited--particularly now that they have withdrawn the claim that this would help against an OPM attack--but that every little bit helps. But there is no downside to them to just pass the bill. It makes sense. Pass the bill. There is no downside.  Opponents of the bill, who grow in number virtually every day, have been arguing that the bill is likely to have a significant negative impact on the personal privacy of a large number of Americans and that this greatly outweighs the limited security benefits. If an information sharing bill doesn't include adequate privacy protections, I am telling you, colleagues, I think those proponents are going to have people wake up and say: I really don't see this as a cyber security bill, but it really looks to me like a surveillance bill by another name.
