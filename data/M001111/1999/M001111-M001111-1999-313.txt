 Education is absolutely the No. 1 priority for families across this country, but it is not just families. We go and talk to businesses, and business people tell us we need to be able to hire students out of our schools with math and science and reading and English skills. Studies show--and I will be delighted, when we get to the debate on this, to go through the studies again--that reducing class size makes a difference in a child's ability to learn to write and to read, to do math and to do science, just the skills our businesses are looking for. They are looking to us to make a commitment on this.  I commend my colleague from Oregon, as well, for his work on this. I know he is committed to this issue and has pledged his support as well. He knows, too, how important class size is.  Let me end by reminding my colleagues this is a bipartisan effort. It was passed in a bipartisan way last October. There is no reason not to do this now. In fact, a former Republican House Member said, on education, We should champion communities and parents, reduce class size, and increase accountability.  I ask unanimous consent to have the letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   Republican Main                                           Street Partnership,                                                    Arlington, VA.               An Open Letter to Republicans in Congress       Dear Colleagues & Friends: The Republican Main Street      Partnership was founded in 1998. Our goal is to demonstrate      that the Republican Party can govern and achieve our goals of      bipartisan cooperation in enacting centrist policies. We are      focused on speaking out, setting the agenda and demonstrating      a new discipline for reaching consensus on difficult issues;      without that, we believe that we will not be a Majority Party      by the close of the Year 2000.       Immediately, the rhetoric of partisan hostility must stop.      Our language too often has been heard as mean, judgmental and      partisan. That ``the other side does it'' is no excuse. We      need Republican unity to replace division or our statistical      majority will never become a governing majority. We must      restore dignity to our debate, civility to our conversations      and compassion to our perspective. We need a new language and      a new voice.       Our agenda must be positive; it must be an agenda for      governance. On education, we should champion communities and      parents, reducing class size and increasing accountability.      On Social Security, we should press for personal choice, not      100% governmental custody of our retirement funds. On health      care, Medicaid and Medicare we must legislate with compassion      as well as prudence. On taxes, we must work to reduce the      burden on hardworking middle-class American families. And      when we discuss our agenda, we must do it in terms that      dispel the fears and inspire the hopes of American families      and businesses.       Both governance and civility will demand discipline.      Challenges will rise from partisan and ideological quarters.      That is when we must stay the course with unity, courage--and      discipline.       If we can stand tall within our own tradition--if we can      bring to the 106th Congress Lincoln's urgency for justice,      Roosevelt's commitment to the environment, Eisenhower's      vision of public education--then the finest elements of our      party's legacy, the tone of our speeches, the content of our      legislation and the discipline of our behavior will make this      a season of triumph for the Republican Party, and for the      nation!           Sincerely,       The Republican Main Street Partnership Board of Directors         Gov. John McKernan, Hon. Mike Castle, Hon. Amo Houghton,            Hon. Rick Lazio, Hon. Fred Upton, Mr. Allan Cors.
