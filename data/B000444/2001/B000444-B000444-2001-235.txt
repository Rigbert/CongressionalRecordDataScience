 It is kind of a dead period for different reasons.  I ask the Senator to consider the request. If the Senator from Minnesota is willing to knock down his time--the Senator can speak for himself--the staff of the Senator from Illinois tells me he will be willing to cut down his time as well so they both can get a vote on their amendments prior to 4 o'clock.  What I am asking the Senator from Utah, whom I support on this bill, is to give them a chance, if they will cut down their time, to have a vote on both of their amendments. That is my request of the Senator from Utah. They are both here and can speak for themselves, obviously, better than I can.
