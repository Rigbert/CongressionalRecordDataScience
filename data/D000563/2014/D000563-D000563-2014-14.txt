I am glad the Senator from Alabama is still on the floor, but I just don't understand this.  How many speeches have we heard on the floor of the Senate that the No. 1 priority on the Republican side is border enforcement? How many times have we heard over and over again that before we can have any conversation about those in the United States, we have to seal our borders from the illegal immigrants coming into our country? I have heard it from the beginning. In fact, I heard it every time a Republican Member initiated a conversation about immigration. Isn't this interesting.  Two days ago we passed the budget bill for the remainder of this fiscal year that was initiated by the House of Representatives and sent over here. It was not called an omnibus spending bill, which would have meant all of the agencies of the government are in the budget. It had this peculiar name--CRomnibus. I don't know who came up with it, but what they were trying to say was that there was one agency of government that was not included in the overall budget. What was that agency? Well, it turned out it was the Department of Homeland Security.
