President, let me make sure everyone understands what we are doing here. The budget act of 2015 had major cuts in the Federal Crop Insurance Program. Some of those were restored in the highway bill. Now, if the highway bill is changed--if this should pass--it has to go back to the House, which means we could not have it this year. In other words, the issue here is not how you feel about crop insurance; it is whether or not you want this bill.  I would suggest to the 65 Members who are here today and who voted for the bill that it would be very difficult to explain how you could vote for the bill and then turn around and vote for the very order against it that would kill the bill for this year in 2015.
