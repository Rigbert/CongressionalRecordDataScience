President, yesterday the Senate voted on a modest package of trade bills which included the African Growth and Opportunity Act and the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act. As a long time supporter of expanding trade opportunities for Vermonters and all Americans, as well as people in developing countries, I reluctantly cast my vote against this bill.  Exports are a key component of Vermont's economy. As a small state, we must promote our products beyond the Green Mountains. Vermonters are reaping the benefits of more open markets around the world and these markets are creating new jobs here at home. Not long ago, I led a Vermont trade delegation to Ireland which has one of the fastest growing economies in Europe.  Having said that, trade is about more than financial statistics. It is about more than increasing market opportunities for American products, as important and laudable a goal as that is. In our increasingly inter-connected world, trade involves a broad range of issues and concerns. As the wealthiest nation, we also have a responsibility to do what we can to ensure that the benefits of the global economy are enjoyed by people from every walk of life, here and abroad. And when we vote, we have a responsibility to ensure that legislation entitled the ``African Growth and Opportunity Act'', actually benefits African workers and protects their families' health and welfare, and the natural environment. The bill that was passed yesterday will not do that.  I have felt for some time that our relationship with Africa needs to change. It cannot continue to be based almost exclusively on aid, when the real engine of development, as we have seenelsewhere in the world, is investment and trade. However, in developing a trade policy toward Africa--where poverty is deeply rooted and protections for the environment and the rights of workers are virtually non-existent--precautions must be taken to ensure that it is a sound policy that responds to Africa's unique and urgent needs.  It used to be that workers' rights and environmental concerns were treated separately from trade considerations, or not at all. Fortunately, that has begun to change. One of the reasons I voted for NAFTA was because it contained side agreements on labor and environmental issues.  However, while those agreements were a step forward, time has shown that they did not go far enough. Unfortunately, even the modest labor and environmental agreements that we fought hard to include in NAFTA were not included in the African Growth and Opportunity Act and virtually every amendment to add similar provisions was defeated. Such a step backward makes absolutely no sense.  The African Growth and Opportunity Act's provision on workers' rights, which has been included in other trade legislation, has routinely allowed countries notorious for abuses to escape without penalty. Unions have rightly criticized this provision for being vague and unenforceable. It is an invitation for exploitation of cheap African labor.  The African Growth and Opportunity Act does not include a single provision related to environmental concerns. Multinational corporations, especially mining and timber companies, have a long history of taking advantage of Africa's weak environmental laws and contributing to pollution, deforestation and the uprooting of people. If barriers to foreign investment are lowered or eliminated--as the Act calls for--and meaningful, enforceable environmental protections are not put in place, these problems will only get worse.  Like the NAFTA debate, however, the rhetoric on both sides of this issue was overblown. The African Growth and Opportunity Act is not, as some of its supporters claimed, an historic step toward integrating Africa into the global economy. At best, this Act will have a modest impact. It simply offers limited market access to African countries under the Generalized System of Preferences and establishes a U.S.-African trade and economic forum.  On the other hand, the African Growth and Opportunity Act will not, as some of its opponents claimed, force African countries to cut spending on education and health care, and to adhere to stringent International Monetary Fund conditions. It rewards African countries that are taking steps toward economic and political reforms, as most African countries are already doing, but it does not force them to do anything.  In all my time in the Senate, this is the first attempt that has been made to redefine our relationship with Africa from one of dependency to one which begins to promotes economic growth and self-reliance. This is long overdue, and the opportunity to address these issues is not likely to come again soon. I had hoped that when the African Growth and Opportunity Act reached the floor it would have provided for expanded export opportunities for both Africans and Americans while protecting African workers and the environment.  Many of my concerns about the African Growth and Opportunity Act, also hold true for the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act. I fully support efforts to expand U.S. trade with Caribbean Basin countries and to provide these countries with trade benefits that will help them compete in the global economy. However, again, it is vitally important that the trade benefits included in this Act actually benefit those who often need them the most--workers and their families. Virtually every amendment that would have required Caribbean companies to institute fair and enforceable labor standards before they could be eligible for trade benefits under the Caribbean Basin Trade Enhancement Act was defeated, and crucial protections were therefore not included.  Mr. President, it is disappointing that given the opportunity to simultaneously redefine our relationship with Africa, re-examine our trade policy toward the Caribbean Basin and expand international economic opportunities for Americans, that the approach and the outcome was so flawed.                          ____________________
