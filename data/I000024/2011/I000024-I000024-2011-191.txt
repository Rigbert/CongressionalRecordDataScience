President, Senator Leahy and I have two amendments. He has Leahy amendment No. 50 and my amendment is No. 6. I say to my friend from Iowa, I will just be a few minutes, as he was kind enough to allow us to do this first.  This has to do with the liability of those individuals who are making their own sacrifice to help people in distress. It is something that those of us who are pilots have done--helping individuals in being relieved of some of the individual liability that might be incurred. The Leahy amendment goes a little further than mine, but I am satisfied with his. So what I wish to do is request unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment No. 6 that gives liability protection to volunteer pilots and organizations, as well as request to be added as a cosponsor to the Leahy amendment No. 50. We have been in negotiations for a number of weeks. In fact, we were even last year. I think wehave reached an agreement we both find acceptable.
