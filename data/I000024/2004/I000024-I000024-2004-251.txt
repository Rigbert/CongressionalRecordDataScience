 There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        Summary of Finance Committee Highway Trust Fund Proposal       Finance Committee jurisdiction extends to the highway use-     related excise taxes, the Highway Trust Fund, and the      expenditure authority of the Highway Trust Fund. The Finance      Committee acted primarily on the cash flow into and out of      the trust fund. Cash flow into the trust fund is represented      by trust fund excise tax receipts. Cash flow out of the trust      fund is represented by trust fund outlays. Matters involving      contract authority and obligation limits are not Finance      Committee subject matter and the committee did not speak to      them.       According to the Congressional Budget Office (``CBO''),      current law trust fund receipts will total $227.8 billion      over the six year period. CBO projects $196 billion in      highway account receipts and $31.8 billion in mass transit      account receipts.       The authorizing committees' actions placed demands on the      trust fund of $231 billion for highways and $36.6 billion for      transit for the six year authorization period. That means a      total of $267.6 billion in demands on the trust fund.       Prior to Finance Committee action, demands on the trust      fund exceeded receipts by $39.8 billion over the six year      period. To make up this funding gap, the Finance Committee      developed two categories of proposals. The first category      increased trust fund receipts by tightening compliance. The      second category included accounting changes that raised trust      fund receipts.       The compliance changes raised trust fund receipts by $5.6      billion over the authorization period. These changes were      also scored as revenue raisers by the Joint Committee on      Taxation. These proposals have no impact on the budget      deficient.       The budget resolution assumes that 2.5 cents per gallon of      gasohol receipts, currently held by the general fund, will be      transferred to the trust fund. That transfer raises trust      fund receipts by $5 billion over the authorization period.      The Finance Committee also assumed that trust fund balances      would be spent down by $7.5 billion over the authorization      period. Adding all of these changes together with the      compliance changes, the Finance Committee closed the gap by      $18.1 billion over the authorization period. That left a      funding gap of $21.7 billion.       The Finance Committee proposed to close this gap with a      group of trust fund accounting changes. These proposals raise      trust fund receipts by shifting the burden of tax policies      from the trust fund to the general fund. In the view of      Finance Committee, these tax policy benefits have nothing to      do with highway use and should not burden the trust fund.      Included in these proposals is a repeal of the partial      exemption for ethanol-blended fuels. The tax benefit for      ethanol, like nearly all energy production incentives, is      transferred to the general fund through a tax credit. The      same effect is applied to refunds for special categories of      users such as State and local governments. Finally, the      Highway trust Fund will earn interest on its balance, so that      the highway and transit programs are not prejudiced. This      second category of proposals closed the funding gap, but,      without revenue offsets, would have increased the budget      deficit by $21.7 billion.       Finance Committee members decided that this second category      of proposals should not have a deficit impact. To this end,      the Finance Committee title includes a group of loophole      closers previously approved by the committee.       Ninety-five percent cost over $120 billion . . . the cost      forced us to construct a new method. Equity Bonus keeps the      cost of rectifying donor states affordable.    comparison of nh and vt [both low population states per mccain]       Response: VT does very well under the formulas for the core      programs (not changed from TEA-21 in this bill). Former NH      Sen. Smith's position on the EPW committee during TEA-21      ensured that NH did well under the politically drafted 1104      table despite their relative poor performance under the      formulas.                        co is getting a raw deal       Response: Colorado has the highest rate of growth . . .      Senator Allard, a member of EPW has been very supportive of      the bill.                          additional comments       Highway Trust Fund was raided during TEA-21 of $8 billion      (Note: argument will be made that the $8 billion was given up      in order to get the ``firewalls'')       If we were to accelerate getting all states to 95 percent      sooner it would add to the cost of the bill and donee states      like PA and NH would have a lower rate of return       On average, in SAFETEA, donee states lost 4 cents from TEA-     21 and donor states gained 4 cents from TEA-21 . . . I would      call that a fair exchange.
