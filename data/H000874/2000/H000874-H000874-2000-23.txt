Speaker, I tell my friend from Illinois, my point was, A, that the money in Head Start is in our bill. I said in our bill. I understand it is not in the education title because it is administered under HHS. It happens to be run by the education department in my county, and about one-quarter of the Head Start programs, as the gentleman knows, in America are under the education departments. Three-quarters are not.  My point was that the Head Start money is money that is identified for a particular program. I tell my friend from Illinois that we made a determination that children from at-risk homes needed a special start, a head start. It is a program Ronald Reagan said worked.  We, therefore, at the Federal level made a determination that we were going to, in our case, make billions of dollars available, but for this purpose, because we have made, as a Federal legislative body, a determination of a need.  My point to you, sir, is that I believe that we have made on our side of the aisle a similar determination that there is a classroom shortage in America, that there are crowded classrooms in America, and that we have a teacher shortage in America as a result of having more students in our schools than any time in our history.
