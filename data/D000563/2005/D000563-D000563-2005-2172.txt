President, today I am introducing a bill to honor Abraham Lincoln in 2009, the bicentennial of his birth, by issuing a series of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are emblematic of the 4 major periods of his life, in Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Washington, D.C. The bill would also provide for a longer-term redesign of the reverse of 1-cent coins so that after 2009 they will bear an image emblematic of Lincoln's preservation of the United States as a single and united country.  Abraham Lincoln was one of our greatest leaders, demonstrating enormous courage and strength of character during the Civil War, perhaps the greatest crisis in our Nation's history. Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the Nation in Washington, DC. He rose to the Presidency through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence, and commitment to the United States.  Adhering to the belief that all men are created equal, Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United States. Despite the great passions aroused by the Civil War, Lincoln had a generous heart and acted with malice toward none and with charity for all. Lincoln made the ultimate sacrifice for the country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April 15, 1865. All Americans could benefit from studying the life of Abraham Lincoln.  The ``Lincoln cent'' was introduced in 1909 on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the front design by sculptor Victor David Brenner the most enduring image on the Nation's coinage. President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by Brenner's talent that he was chosen to design the likeness of Lincoln for the coin, adapting a design from a plaque Brenner had prepared earlier. In the nearly 100 years of production of the ``Lincoln cent,'' there have been only two designs on the reverse: the original, featuring two wheat-heads, and the current representation of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, DC.  On the occasion of the bicentennial of Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production of the Lincoln cent, we should recognize his great achievement in ensuring that the United States remained one Nation, united and inseparable.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 341       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Abraham Lincoln Bicentennial      1-Cent Coin Redesign Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds as follows:       (1) Abraham Lincoln, the 16th President, was one of the      Nation's greatest leaders, demonstrating true courage during      the Civil War, one of the greatest crises in the Nation's      history.       (2) Born of humble roots in Hardin County, Kentucky, on      February 12, 1809, Abraham Lincoln rose to the Presidency      through a combination of honesty, integrity, intelligence,      and commitment to the United States.       (3) With the belief that all men are created equal, Abraham      Lincoln led the effort to free all slaves in the United      States.       (4) Abraham Lincoln had a generous heart, with malice      toward none and with charity for all.       (5) Abraham Lincoln gave the ultimate sacrifice for the      country he loved, dying from an assassin's bullet on April      15, 1865.       (6) All Americans could benefit from studying the life of      Abraham Lincoln, for Lincoln's life is a model for      accomplishing the ``American dream'' through honesty,      integrity, loyalty, and a lifetime of education.       (7) The year 2009 will be the bicentennial anniversary of      the birth of Abraham Lincoln.       (8) Abraham Lincoln was born in Kentucky, grew to adulthood      in Indiana, achieved fame in Illinois, and led the nation in      Washington, D.C.       (9) The so-called ``Lincoln cent'' was introduced in 1909      on the 100th anniversary of Lincoln's birth, making the      obverse design the most enduring on the nation's coinage.       (10) President Theodore Roosevelt was so impressed by the      talent of Victor David     Brenner that the sculptor was chosen to design the likeness      of President Lincoln for the coin, adapting a design from a      plaque Brenner had prepared earlier.       (11) In the nearly 100 years of production of the ``Lincoln      cent'', there have been only 2 designs on the reverse: the      original, featuring 2 wheat-heads in memorial style enclosing      mottoes, and the current representation of the Lincoln      Memorial in Washington, D.C.       (12) On the occasion of the bicentennial of President      Lincoln's birth and the 100th anniversary of the production      of the Lincoln cent, it is entirely fitting to issue a series      of 1-cent coins with designs on the reverse that are      emblematic of the 4 major periods of President Lincoln's      life.     SEC. 3. REDESIGN OF LINCOLN CENT FOR 2009.       (a) In General.--During the year 2009, the Secretary of the      Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in accordance with the      following design specifications:       (1) Obverse.--The obverse of the 1-cent coin shall continue      to bear the Victor David Brenner likeness of President      Abraham Lincoln.       (2) Reverse.--The reverse of the coins shall bear 4      different designs each representing a different aspect of the      life of Abraham Lincoln, such as--       (A) his birth and early childhood in Kentucky;       (B) his formative years in Indiana;       (C) his professional life in Illinois; and       (D) his presidency, in Washington, D.C.       (b) Issuance of Redesigned Lincoln Cents in 2009.--       (1) Order.--The 1-cent coins to which this section applies      shall be issued with 1 of the 4 designs referred to in      subsection (a)(2) beginning at the start of each calendar      quarter of 2009.       (2) Number.--The Secretary shall prescribe, on the basis of      such factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate,      the number of 1-cent coins that shall be issued with each of      the designs selected for each calendar quarter of 2009.       (c) Design Selection.--The designs for the coins specified      in this section shall be chosen by the Secretary--       (1) after consultation with the Abraham Lincoln      Bicentennial Commission and the Commission of Fine Arts; and       (2) after review by the Citizens Coinage Advisory      Committee.     SEC. 4. REDESIGN OF REVERSE OF 1-CENT COINS AFTER 2009.       The design on the reverse of the 1-cent coins issued after      December 31, 2009, shall bear an image emblematic of      President Lincoln's preservation of the United States of      America as a single and united country.     SEC. 5. NUMISMATIC PENNIES WITH THE SAME METALLIC CONTENT AS                    THE 1909 PENNY.       The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue 1-cent coins in      2009 with the exact metallic content as the 1-cent coin      contained in 1909 in such number as the Secretary determines      to be appropriate for numismatic purposes.     SEC. 6. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS.        It is the sense of the Congress that the original Victor      David Brenner design for the 1-cent coin was a dramatic      departure from previous American coinage that should be      reproduced, using the original form and relief of the      likeness of Abraham Lincoln, on the 1-cent coins issued in      2009.                                 ______                                       By Mr. McCAIN (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, Ms. Snowe, Mrs.         Feinstein, Mr. Chafee, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mrs. Murray,         Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Corzine, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Kerry,         and Mr. Dayton):  S. 342. A bill to provide for a program of scientific research on abrupt climate change, to accelerate the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by establishing a market-driven system of greenhouse gas tradeable allowances, to limit greenhouse gas emissions in the United States and reduce dependence upon foreign oil, and ensure benefits to consumers from the trading in such allowances; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to be joined with Senator Lieberman in introducing the Climate Stewardship Act of 2005. This bill is nearly identical to a proposal we offered during the 108th Congress. It is designed to begin a meaningful and shared effort among the emission-producing sectors of our country to address the world's greatest environmental challenge--climate change.  The National Academy of Sciences reported:       Greenhouse gases are accumulating in the Earth's atmosphere      as a result of human activities, causing surface air      temperatures and subsurface ocean temperatures to rise.      Temperatures are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over      the last several decades are likely mostly due to human      activities.  Again, ``temperatures are, in fact, rising.'' Those are the words of the National Academy of Sciences, a body created by the Congress in 1863 to provide advice to the Federal Government on scientific and technical matters. These comments were written after much thoughtful deliberation and should not be taken lightly. The Academy has a 140-year history and a strong reputation of service to the people of this great country.  In October 2003, in response to the alarming changes in the climate that are being reported worldwide, we were joined by a number of other Senators in the first offering of our proposal for addressing climate change for Senate consideration. We had a hard-fought debate and found ourselves eight votes short of achieving a majority in passage. Today, we resume what we finally can consider a worthy and necessary cause.  I state at the outset that this issue is not going away. This issue is one of transcendent importance outside the boundaries of the United States of America. If you travel to Europe today and visit with our European friends, you will find that climate change/Kyoto treaty are major sources of dissatisfaction on that side of the Atlantic with the United States of America and its policies. But far more important than that, the overwhelming body of scientific evidence shows that climate change is real, that it is happening as we speak. The Arctic and Antarctic are the ``miner's canary'' of climate change, and profound and terrible things are happening at the poles, not to mention other parts of the world.  Democracies usually respond to crises when they are faced with them and, at least in the case of this Nation, we address problems and crises that confront us and we move on. We are not very good at long-term planning and long-term addressing of issues that face us in the future. The divisions concerning the issue of Social Security are clearly an example of what I just said.  If we do not move on this issue, our children and grandchildren are going to pay an incredibly heavy price because this crisis is upon us, only we do not see its visible aspects in all of its enormity.  Prime Minister Tony Blair, assuming the stewardship of the G-8, has made it his highest priority. He has very aptly pointed out: Suppose that all of the scientific opinion is wrong; suppose that the ice that is breaking up in the Antarctic in huge chunks is just something which is temporary; suppose that the glaciers receding in the Arctic at a higher rate than at any time in history is something that is a one-time deal; suppose that the melting of the permafrost in Alaska and the Inuit villages collapsing into the ocean is a one-time thing; suppose these increases in violent climate occurrences are all something that are just temporary aberrations; suppose that happens to be true and we have acted. Then the world and the Nation will be better off because we would have developed technologies which are cleaner. We would have taken actions to reduce what everybody agrees is harmful, and that is excess greenhouse gases. And the Nation and the world would be better off.  But suppose the scientists are right. Suppose that the National Academy of Sciences report that says, ``Greenhouse gases are accumulating in the Earth's atmosphere as a result of human activities. Temperatures are, in fact, rising. The changes observed over the last several decades are likely mostly due to human activities[ . . . ]'' is right; suppose that Dr. Robert Corell, chair of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, assessing the economic impacts and consequences of the changing Arctic, and the Arctic Council, composed of the senior officials from the eight Arctic countries that reached the conclusion that the Arctic climate is changing rapidly; that over the past 50 years, temperatures across Alaska, Canada, and much of Russia have increased 3 to 5 degrees Fahrenheit, with winter temperatures in these areas increasing by up to 7 degrees Fahrenheit; that in the past 30 years, the Arctic has lost an area of annual average sea ice larger than all of Arizona and Texas combined, with even stronger declines observed in summer sea ice; that mountain glaciers have also receded dramatically, and the snow cover seasonhas been shrinking; that greenhouse gas concentration continues to rise; and even larger changes in climate are projected for the next 100 years; suppose they are right.  The observed warming is already having significant impacts on Arctic people and ecosystems. Much larger projected climate changes will result in even greater impacts on the people in the Arctic and beyond. Increasing coastal erosion threatens many Alaskan villages. Warming is also affecting the oil industry. The number of days in which oil exploration and extraction activities on the tundra are allowed under Alaska Department of Natural Resources standards has been halved over the past 30 years.  The projected changes in Arctic climate will also have global implications. Amplified global warming, rising sea levels, and potential alterations in ocean circulation patterns that can have large-scale climatic effects are among the global concerns. Melting Arctic snow and ice cause additional absorption of solar energy by the darker land surface, amplifying the warming trend at the global scale.  Recently, the Australians have predicted that the Great Barrier Reef will be dead by 2050. What is the impact of coral reefs around the world being bleached and dying on the food chain?  Dr. William Fraser, president of Polar Oceans Research Group, testified that mountain ranges flanking the southeastern boundary of the glacier, not visible 30 years ago, are emerging into full view. The amount of ice-free land along the entire southwest coast of Anver Island has been redefined by glacier retreat. Populations of the ice-avoiding Chinstrap and Gentoo penguins have increased by 55 to 90 percent.  The coral reefs are the most biologically diverse ecosystem of the ocean, as we all know. Almost 1,000 coral species currently exist. With the majority of human populations living in coastal regions, many people depend on living coral reef for food and protection from storm surges.  Dr. Lara Hansen stated:       While the Great Barrier Reef is widely considered to be one      of the best managed reef systems in the world, local      conservation actions will not be sufficient to protect coral      reefs from the effects of climate change. To date, studies      indicate that the best chance for successful conservation in      the face of climate change is to limit the temperature      increase. . . .  ADM James Watkins, who was chairman of the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, testified that climate change impacts every topic in the report from the health and safety of humans, the health of environment and fisheries to the distribution of marine organisms, including pathogens. Admiral Watkins, former Chief of Naval Operations and former Secretary of Energy, not a renowned environmentalist, went on to say climate change is a serious problem, and it could affect all of the recommendations from the report.  There will be people who will come to this floor and say that climate change is a myth; it is not serious. They will find a scientist, they will find some study group, some of them funded by people with special interests here, but I hope that we will pay attention to Prime Minister Tony Blair, who has made climate change one of the two issues he hopes to address during his presidency of the G-8. This issue I believe is very well understood by a majority of scientists in America.  I have a couple of pictures I will show. I see my colleague from Connecticut is in the Chamber.  Recently, Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, the chairman of the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, stated that he personally believes that the world has ``already reached the level of dangerous concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.''  He went on to say:       Climate change is for real. We have just a small window of      opportunity, and it is closing rapidly. There is not a moment      to lose.  The International Climate Change Task Force, chaired by Senator Snowe and the Right Honorable Stephen Byers, Member of Parliament of the United Kingdom, stated in 1 of its 10 recommendations concerning climate change that ``all developed countries introduce mandatory cap-and-trade systems for carbon emissions and construct them to allow for future integration into a single global market.'' That is already being done in Europe as we speak, which is the substance of Senator Lieberman's and my legislation.  States are acting. Nine States in the East have signed on as full participants in this initiative to elevate climate mitigation strategies from voluntary initiatives to a regulatory program. The State of California has approved a new State regulation aimed at decreasing carbon dioxide emissions from vehicles. The States are way ahead of us. I believe one of the reasons for that is because special interests are less active in the States.  This is a chart that shows that the CO2 data has gone up from, as we can see, 1860 to 2001.  This is a picture of the Arctic sea ice loss. The red outline is 1979. This was the Arctic sea ice, which is outlined in red. We can see the size of the Arctic sea ice today. I made a visit with some of my colleagues to the Arctic. We took a ship and stopped at where this glacier was 5 years ago, traveling a number of miles and saw where that glacier is today.  I want to emphasize again, the Arctic and the Antarctic are the miner's canary of global warming because of the thinness of the atmosphere there.  This chart is sea level changes in areas of Florida that would be inundated with a sea level rise.  I usually have--it is probably not here--I usually have a picture of Mount Kilimanjaro, which is known to many of us.  This is a chart of coral bleaching which is taking place as we speak.  If I can add a little parochialism, if I can show a picture of Lake Powell in Arizona, it has been drying up since 1999, draining Lake Powell to well below its high watermark. It is at an alltime low in its seventh year. The lake has shrunk to 10 percent of its capacity.  The signs of climate change are all around us. We need to act. We need to develop technologies and make it economically attractive for industry to find it in their interest to develop technology which will reduce and bring into check the greenhouse gas emissions in the world.  We need to do a lot of things, but a cap and trade, which would put an end to the increase of greenhouse gases and a gradual reduction, is an integral part.  Finally, I would like to return to my other argument in closing.  Suppose the Senator from Connecticut and I are deluded, that all of this scientific evidence, all these opinions, people such as Admiral Watkins in the oceans report, the National Academy of Sciences, the literally hundreds of people in the scientific community with whom Senator Lieberman and I have met and talked are wrong.  Here is the picture of Kilimanjaro in 1912, 1970, and 2000.  Suppose we are deluded, that we are tree-hugging environmentalists who have taken leave of our senses and are sounding a false alarm to the world, and we go ahead and put in a cap and trade, we encourage technologies to be developed and funded, some by the Federal Government in the form of pure research, and we do put a cap on the greenhouse gases, we negotiate an alternate Kyoto Treaty with our friends throughout the world--140 nations are signatories to the Kyoto Treaty--and we join on the provision India and China have to be included and other provisions which we have every right to demand, and we start moving forward on this issue and we are wrong, that the year after next, everything is fine in the world? Then we will have made probably a significant contribution to the betterment of the world and the Earth by reducing greenhouse gases, by developing cleaner technologies, by doing good things, and then Senator Lieberman and I will come to the floor and apologize for sounding this alarm.  But suppose, Mr. President, that we are right. Suppose the National Academy of Sciences is right. Suppose the eight-nation research council that is deeply alarmed at these effects in both the Arctic and Antarctic is wrong; suppose Admiral Watkins is wrong; suppose the Australian Government is wrong when it says the Great Barrier Reef is going to be dead by 2050, and we have done nothing? We have done relatively nothing besides gather additional data and make reports. That is what the U.S. national policy is today: gather information and make reports. Iwould argue that is a pretty heavy burden to lay on future generations of Americans.  I welcome the participation, friendship, and commitment of my friend from Connecticut.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record an article entitled ``Arid Arizona Points to Global Warming as Culprit,'' and a response to Senator Inhofe's floor statement on January 4, 2005.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Feb. 6, 2005]            Arid Arizona Points to Global Warming as Culprit                          (By Juliet Eilperin)       Tucson.--Reese Woodling remembers the mornings when he      would walk the grounds of his ranch and come back with his      clothes soaked with dew, moisture that fostered enough grass      to feed 500 cows and their calves.       But by 1993, he says, the dew was disappearing around      Cascabel--his 2,700-acre ranch in the Malpai borderlands      straddling New Mexico and Arizona--and shrubs were taking      over the grassland. Five years later Woodling had sold off      half his cows, and by 2004 he abandoned the ranch.       Reese Woodling, in white, used to own a 2,700-acre ranch,      but lack of rain reduced the grassland--his main source of      cattle feed.       ``How do you respond when the grass is dying? You hope to      hell it starts to rain next year,'' he says.       When the rain stopped coming in the 1990s, he and other      Southwest ranchers began to suspect there was a larger      weather pattern afoot. ``People started talking about how      we've got some major problems out here,'' he said in an      interview. ``Do I believe in global warming? Absolutely.''       Dramatic weather changes in the West--whether it is      Arizona's decade-long drought or this winter's torrential      rains in Southern California--have pushed some former      skeptics to reevaluate their views on climate change. A      number of scientists, and some Westerners, are now convinced      that global warming is the best explanation for the higher      temperatures, rapid precipitation shifts, and accelerated      blooming and breeding patterns that are changing the      Southwest, one of the nation's most vulnerable ecosystems.       In the face of shrinking water reservoirs, massive forest      fires and temperature-related disease outbreaks, several said      they now believe that warming is transforming their daily      lives. Although it has rained some during the past three      months, the state is still struggling with a persistent      drought that has hurt its economy, costing cattle-related      industries $2.8 billion in 2002.       ``Everyone's from Missouri: When they see it, they believe      it,'' said Gregg Garfin, who has assessed the Southwest's      climate for the federal government since 1998. ``When we used      to talk about climate, eyes would glaze over. . . . Then the      drought came. The phone started ringing off the hook.''       Jonathan Overpeck, who directs the university- and      government-funded Institute for the Study of Planet Earth at      the University of Arizona, said current drought and weather      disruptions signal what is to come over the next century.      Twenty-five years ago, he said, scientists produced computer      models of the drought that Arizona is now experiencing.       ``It's going to get warmer, we're going to have more      people, and we're going to have more droughts more frequently      and in harsher terms,'' Overpeck said. ``We should be at the      forefront of demanding action on global warming because we're      at the forefront of the impacts of global warming. . . . In      the West we're seeing what's happening now.''       There are dissenters who say it is impossible to attribute      the recent drought and higher temperatures to global warming.      Sherwood Idso, president of the Tempe, Ariz.-based Center for      the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, said he does      not believe the state's drought ``has anything to do with      CO2 or global warming,'' because the region      experienced more-severe droughts between 1600 and 1800.      Idso, who also said he did not believe there is a link      between human-generated carbon dioxide emissions and      climate change, declined to say who funds his center.       The stakes are enormous for Arizona, which is growing six      times faster than the national average and must meet mounting      demands for water and space with scarce resources. Gov. Janet      Napolitano (D) is urging Arizonans to embrace ``a culture of      conservation'' with water, but some conservationists and      scientists wonder whether that will be enough.       Dale Turner of the Nature Conservancy tracks changes in the      state's mountaintop ``sky islands''--a region east and south      of Tucson that hosts a bevy of rare plants and animals. Human      activities over the past century have degraded local      habitats, Turner said, and now climate change threatens to      push these populations ``over the edge.''       The Mount Graham red squirrel, on the federal endangered      species list since 1987, has been at the center of a long-     running fight between environmentalists and development-     minded Arizonans. Forest fires and rising temperatures have      worsened the animals' plight as they depend on Douglas firs      at the top of a 10,720-foot mountain for food and nest-     building materials. The population has dipped from about 562      animals in spring 1999 to 264 last fall.       ``They are so on the downhill slide,'' said Thetis Gamberg,      a U.S. Fish and Wildlife biologist who has an image of the      endangered squirrel on her business card. Atop Mount Graham,      the squirrels' predicament is readily visible. Mixed conifers      are replacing Douglas firs at higher altitudes, and recent      fires have destroyed other parts of the forest, depriving the      animals of the cones they need.       Environmentalists such as Turner worry about the      disappearance of the Mount Graham squirrel, the long-tailed,      mouselike vole and native wet meadows known as cienegas, but      many lawmakers and state officials are more focused on the      practical question of water supply.       Reese Woodling, in white, used to own a 2,700-acre ranch,      but lack of rain reduced the grassland--his main source of      cattle feed.       Arizona gets its water from groundwater and rivers such as      the massive Colorado, a 1,450-mile waterway that supplies      water to seven states: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada,      New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.       The recent drought and changing weather patterns have      shrunk the western snowpack and drained the region's two      biggest reservoirs, lakes Mead and Powell, to half their      capacity. More precipitation is falling as rain instead of      snow, and it is coming earlier in the year, which leads to      rapid runoff that disappears quickly.       Scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography predict      that by 2090 global warming will reduce the Sierra Nevada      snowpack, which accounts for half of California's water      reserves, by 30 percent to 90 percent. ``It makes water      management more challenging,'' said Kathy Jacobs, who spent      two decades managing state water resources before joining the      University of Arizona's Water Resources Research Center.      ``You can either reduce demand or increase supply.''       Water managers have just begun to consider climate change      in their long-term planning. Forest managers have also      started asking for climate briefings, now that scientists      have documented that short, wet periods followed by drought      lead to the kind of giant forest fires that have been      devastating the West.       This month, scientists at the National Center for      Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., published a study      showing that worldwide, regions suffering from serious      drought more than doubled in area from the early 1970s to the      early 2000s, with much of the change attributed to global      warming. A separate recent report in the journal Science      concluded that higher temperatures could cause serious long-     term drought over western North America.       C. Mark Eakin, a paleoclimatologist at the National Oceanic      and Atmospheric Administration who co-wrote the study in      Science, said historical climate records suggest the current      drought could just be the beginning.       ``When you've got an increased tendency toward drought in a      region that's already stressed, then you're just looking for      trouble,'' Eakin said. ``Weather is like rolling the dice,      and climate change is like loading the dice.''       Still, Arizona politicians remain divided on how to address      global warming. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has led the      national fight to impose mandatory limits on industrial      carbon dioxide emissions that are linked to warming, though      his bill remains stalled.       ``We'll win on this issue because the evidence continues to      accumulate,'' McCain said in an interview. ``The question is      how much damage will be done until we do prevail.''       But other Arizona Republicans are resistant. State Sen.      Robert Blendu, who opposed a bill last year to establish a      climate change study committee, said he wants to make sure      politicians ``avoid the public knee-jerk reaction before we      get sound science.''       That mind-set frustrates ranchers such as Woodling, who is      raising 10 grass-fed cows on a leased pasture. At age 69, he      will never be able to rebuild his herd, he said, but he      believes politicians have an obligation to help restore the      environment.       ``Man has been a great cause of this, and man needs to      address it,'' he said.                                  ____   USCAN Rebuttal to Key Points in Senator Inhofe's Floor Statement,                             January 4, 2005       The following individuals contributed to this response:      U.S. Delegation at COP10, Debbie Reed, National Environmental      Trust; EU Targets: Jeff Fiedler, Natural Resources Defense      Council; Scientific Consensus: Brenda Ekwurzel, Julie      Anderson Union of Concerned Scientists; and Costs: Ansje      Miller, Environmental Justice and Climate Change Initiative.

U.S. Delegation at COP10       Senator Inhofe's characterization of Under Secretary Paula      Dobriansky's rebuff at attempts to ``drag the U.S. into      discussions concerning post-Kyoto climate change      commitments'' at the recent UNFCCC conference in Buenos Aires      is only partially accurate. Ms. Dobriansky did, indeed make      clear the fact that the Bush administration believes that      post-2012 talks are ``premature.'' Some countries, including      the E.U., were indeed hopeful that the U.S., the world's      largest emitter of greenhouse gas pollution, would join post-     2012 discussions, having previously     withdrawn from the Kyoto Protocol, and having proclaimed      domestic action to reduce GHG emissions, despite the fact      that U.S. emissions continue to increase unabated. Senator      Inhofe's material omission from this statement, however, is      illustrative of his and the Bush administration's true goals:      to prevent the rest of the world from making progress on      reducing global GHG emissions. What Senator Inhofe failed to      mention in his diatribe was that the Bush administration in      Buenos Aires not only demurred from participating in these      discussions, but also acted to prevent the rest of the      world's countries from beginning those discussions even in      the absence of U.S. participation. Without objections from      the United States, the post-20l2 discussions could have      begun, and would have allowed some ideas and suggestions for      the post-20l2 period to be presented to the next meeting of      the UNFCCC in November, 2005. But Under Secretary Dobriansky      and the Bush administration objected and threw up every      possible obstacle to allowing other countries to have those      discussions, with or without the U.S. The result is that one      multiple-day meeting, with a narrowly defined agenda to      discuss post-2012 strategies was agreed to--but the exact      nature of the discussions, and the ability of the meeting's      participants to report to the UNFCCC in November 2005 was a      matter of disagreement even as the agreement was made. It is      highly likely that the meeting itself will be contentious,      for these reasons. But the real question is why the U.S.      insists on blocking the rest of the world from moving on,      even if it chooses not to? Senator Inhofe would better serve      his constituents and his colleagues to accurately and      completely report the Administration's actions at the      meeting.       Similarly, the Senator reported that there was discussion      but no resolution at the meeting on how to address emissions      from developing countries. He claimed that developing      countries, ``most notably China, remained adamant in Buenos      Aires in opposing any mandatory greenhouse gas reductions,      now or in the future.'' Again, his material omission is      significant. The United States remained adamant in Buenos      Aires in opposing any mandatory greenhouse gas reductions,      now or in the future. And the United States urged China and      India to do the same. The Bush administration's duplicity--     claiming that they will not act until China and India do, and      then visibly and vocally urging China and India not to act--     is unconscionable, as is Senator Inhofe's. And the Senator      perhaps should acknowledge the fact that, since the Senate      passed the Byrd-Hagel resolution in 1997, it has passed three      additional resolutions on climate change--all of which      clearly state that climate change is happening and that the      United States should take a credible, leadership role in      combating global warming--including by re-engaging in the      international climate change negotiations. Paula Dobriansky,      when asked whether the Bush administration knew of these      resolutions, and if so, whether they intended to comply, said      ``yes,'' they were fully aware of resolutions, but ``no'',      they had no intention of complying. If that is the case, so      be it--but let's be honest and open about it, Senator Inhofe.                               EU Targets       In contrast to Senator Inhofe's contention that ``most EU      member states will not meet their Kyoto targets and have no      real intentions of doing so,'' a recent analysis by the      European Environment Agency (EEA) concluded that the EU is in      fact on track to meet its Kyoto targets. This analysis      examined existing and planned policies, as well as the use of      the Kyoto emissions trading measures.       Looking only at policies that were being implemented at the      time of the analysis, EEA projected that the EU would indeed      fall short of its targets (with emissions 1% below 1990      instead of 8%). However, looking at planned policies, the EU      is on track to exceed its -8% target. Domestic EU policies      alone are projected to achieve a 7.7% reduction. The small      remaining gap is covered by international emission reduction      projects for which funds have already been budgeted.       The effect of ``planned policies'' cannot be dismissed as      wishful thinking. Included in the list of ``planned      policies'' is the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, a mandatory      cap-and-trade policy for large stationary sources, which      started operation this year. Many other EU-wide policies have      been adopted by the EU Council and Parliament, and are now      being incorporated into law by EU member states. These      policies include measures to promote renewable electricity      production, increase building efficiency, and restructure      energy taxes. A complete list of future policies that are in      advanced stages is available in EEA 2004, at page 21.       The EEA projections cited above exclude two additional      means of meeting the targets. First, activities in the forest      and agriculture sectors are projected to contribute an      additional 0.7% emission reduction. Second, the EU can make      up any shortfall in existing and planned policies by using      the Kyoto Protocol's International Emissions Trading system,      ironically an element of the protocol designed by the US.      Under this system EU countries will be able to purchase      emissions allowances from other Kyoto countries. This      includes Russia, which by most projections will have      significant excess allowances. Therefore, although it is      environmentally preferable for the EU to meet its Kyoto      targets solely through domestic policies, it is almost      inconceivable that the EU would not be able to achieve      compliance through the purchase of Russian allowances.                              Hockey Stick       Senator Inhofe made the following statements regarding      research that reconstructs northern hemisphere temperature      over the past millennium. ``The conclusion inferred from the      hockey stick is that industrialization, which spawned      widespread use of fossil fuels, is causing the planet to      warm. I spent considerable time examining this work in my      2003 speech. Because Mann effectively erased the well-known      phenomena of the Medieval Warming Period--when, by the way,      it was warmer than it is today--and the Little Ice Age, I      didn't find it very credible. I find it even less credible      now.'' Senator Inhofe went on to state, ``In other words, in      obliterating the Medieval Warming Period and the Little Ice      Age, Mann's hockey stick just doesn't pass muster.''       Recent warming trends are confirmed by many independent and      reinforcing . indicators. Direct temperature measurements      from the past 140 years, combined with past temperature      measurements inferred from tree rings, ice cores, and annual      sediment layers, show that average northern hemisphere      temperatures in the late 20th century are higher than they      have been in the last 1,000 years. More recent publications      push the temperature reconstruction back to 1,800 years.      Indeed, the last 10 years (1995-2004), excluding 1996, are      the warmest in the instrumental record from 1861 to the      present. This unprecedented recent warming trend is one of      many pieces of evidence that ties global warming to human-     caused emissions of heat-trapping gases from land-use change      and fossil fuel burning.       Heat-trapping gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2)      absorb energy emitted from the earth's surface and radiate it      back downward to warm the lower atmosphere and the surface.      The general correlation between temperature and atmospheric      CO2 concentration is apparent in ice core records      at many locations at the poles and in the temperate and      tropical regions throughout the world. The Antarctic ice core      records vividly illustrate that current atmospheric carbon      dioxide levels are unmatched during the past 420,000 years.      Furthermore, CO2 concentration has risen a      dramatic 30 percent in the last 150 years. When scientists      compare the timing of the recent rise in atmospheric carbon      dioxide concentrations with the magnitude of other factors      that influence climate--solar variation, volcanic eruptions,      and pollutant emissions such as sulfur dioxide--the link      between recent warming and human activities is      unmistakable.       (2) Debate over the ``hockey stick'' temperature      reconstruction is largely irrelevant to our current policy      choices. The shape of the sharp rise in northern hemisphere      average temperature, at the end of the last millennium, led      to the common practice of referring to the plot as the      ``hockey stick'' figure. Projections of future climate      changes, however, are based on the well-known physics linking      increasing heat-trapping gas concentrations to conditions at      the earth's surface, and these projections do not depend on      details of the earth's temperature hundreds of years ago.      Thus, debate over the ``hockey stick'' temperature      reconstruction is largely irrelevant to our current policy      choices. Nevertheless, because the scientific debate on this      issue has been misinterpreted, most recently in Senator      Inhofe's January 4, 2005 speech, it is worth clarifying a few      points.       The hockey stick analysis is one of many independent      reinforcing indicators of the recent warming. For example,      glacier melting is increasing, sea level is rising, and many      species' ranges are shifting.       The hockey stick reconstruction represents the average      temperature across the entire northern hemisphere--an average      of many measurements taken from locations north of the      equator. This averaging is important because local      temperatures can vary considerably for many climatological      reasons, and so a hemispheric average gives a truer picture      of a warming climate. Therefore, looking at regional data in      isolation, such as temperatures from the ``Medieval Warm      Period'' in the North Atlantic area, and to therefore claim      that the hockey stick temperature reconstruction is invalid,      is inaccurate.     Additional Remarks       In criticizing the ``hockey stick'' temperature record,      Senator Inhofe charges that the Mann analysis has been      criticized in the pages of Geophysical Research Letters      (GRL), a respected, peer-reviewed journal, as ``just bad      science.'' This quote does actually appear in GRL in a      commentary by Chapman et al. (2004), but Inhofe's citation is      quite misleading.       The criticism leveled by Chapman et al did not apply to the      ``hockey stick''-that is, the 1OOO-year temperature      reconstruction by Mann and others. Rather, the Chapman et al.      criticism was leveled at a totally different, much more      narrow and technical modeling study by Mann and Schmidt in      2003 about borehole reconstructions.                                 Arctic       Senator Inhofe asserted, using the words of Dr. George      Taylor from Oregon, that the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment      ``appears to be guilty of selective use of data. Many of the      trends described in the document begin in the 1960s or 1970s.      . . . Yet data are readily available for the 1930s and early      1940s, when temperatures were comparable to (and probably      higher than) those observed today.''       (1) Temperature trends and sea ice trends shown in the      Arctic report are century long trends, from 1900-2000.      Therefore, Senator Inhofe's attack on the scientific      integrity of the Arctic impact assessment is inappropriate.       (2) Arctic researchers concluded that the recent warming,      in contrast to the earlier warming during the 1930s and      1940s, is in response to human activities. No one disputes      that Arctic temperatures were almost as high in the 1930s and      1940s as they are now, least of all the scientists involved      in the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment. The conclusion that      the Arctic is now experiencing a stronger, longer, and more      widespread warming trend is based on a robust combination of      temperature measurements, sea ice retreat, glacial melting,      and increasing permafrost temperatures. For example, the      century-long sea ice record clearly shows a strong retreat in      sea ice extent in recent decades, whereas no such trend is      evident during the earlier warm period.       Scientists have employed observations and models to analyze      these two pronounced twentieth-century warming events, both      amplified in the Arctic, and found that the earlier warming      was due to natural internal climate-system variability and      was not as widespread as today's, whereas the recent warming      is in response to human activities.       Furthermore, earlier periods of warming either this century      or in past centuries do not preclude a human influence on the      current warming trend. By way of analogy, just because      wildfires are often caused by lightning does not mean that      they cannot also be caused by a careless camper. The same can      be said for carbon dioxide--just because it has natural      sources does not mean that humans do not also contribute to      atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and thereby contribute to      the resulting warming.                             Sea Level Rise     Sea level talking points       Senator Inhofe stated: ``But in a study published this year      in Global and Planetary Change, Dr. Nils-Axel Morner of      Sweden found that sea level rise hysteria is overblown. In      his study, which relied not only on observational records,      but also on satellites, he concluded: `There is a total      absence of any recent `acceleration in sea level rise' as      often claimed by IPCC and related groups.' Yet we still hear      of a future world overwhelmed by floods due to global      warming. Such claims are completely out of touch with      science. As Sweden's Morner puts it, `there is no fear of      massive future flooding as claimed in most global warming      scenarios.' ''       (1) Research and observation has solidly established that      sea level is rising. Our longest historical records come from      tide gauge measurements taken along the world's coastlines.      These measurements indicate that the globally averaged      coastal sea level rose at a rate of about 3.5 inches over 50      years (or 0.7 inch per decade since 1950). Since 1993,      satellites have continuously measured sea level over the      entire ocean, not just along the shoreline as do tide gauges.      Satellite measurements can monitor global sea level with a      greater accuracy, and they record a higher global sea-level      rise rate of about 1 inch per decade. Given the short record      of these satellite measurements, scientists cannot yet      conclude if the last decade was unusually high or if it      represents an acceleration of sea level rise.       (2) Global sea-level rise is primarily the result of      expansion of seawater as it warms plus meltwater from land-     based ice sheets and land-based mountain glaciers. Many      factors contribute to sea level rise, and scientific efforts      continue to refine our understanding of the relative      contribution of each to the observed sea-level rise. As the      climate warms, we expect to see two different effects in the      ocean. First, sea level rises as the ocean temperature      increases. Just as a gas expands when it is heated, water      also expands as its temperature rises. Second, the amount of      water entering the ocean increases as land-based ice sheets      and glaciers melt. Increased meltwater adds more freshwater      to the ocean and increases sea level, just like adding water      to a bathtub. This influx of freshwater also lowers the      oceans' salinity. Recent research suggests that all      continental sources added the equivalent of about 2.7 inches      of fresh water over 50 years to the ocean.       (3) Rising sea levels increase the impacts from coastal      hazards. Because of the steadily rising seas we can expect      increased damage to coastal communities around the world.      Sea-level rise increases coastal erosion, further inundates      coastal wetlands, increases the salinity in estuaries and      pushes saltwater further landward in coastal rivers,      contaminates coastal freshwater aquifers with saltwater, and      increases the risks from flooding. Coastal storms of the same      intensity as in the past will create greater damage in the      future simply because the baseline sea level is higher.      Low-lying coastlands such as Louisiana, Florida,      Bangladesh, and the Maldives will be impacted most      acutely.                                 costs       Senator Inhofe claimed that Kyoto-like policies harm      Americans, especially the poor and minorities. This statement      is a false scare tactic directed at our most vulnerable      communities. The well-documented truth is that not taking      action to slow global warning harms Americans, especially the      poor and minorities.       Global warming is already hurting Americans, especially the      poor, its Indigenous Peoples, and people of color, and is      projected to get worse if we don't act now.       People of color communities--already burdened with poor air      quality and twice as likely to be uninsured as whites will      become even more vulnerable to climate change related      respiratory ailments, heat-related illness and death, and      illness from insect-carried diseases.       Scientists have determined that the ice in Alaska and the      Arctic region is melting so rapidly that much of it could be      gone by the end of the century. The results could be      catastrophic for polar-region Indigenous peoples and animals,      while low-lying lands as far away as Florida could be      inundated by rising sea levels.       ``We found that scientific observations and those of      Indigenous people over many generations are meshing . . . Sea      ice is retreating, glaciers are reducing in size, permafrost      is thawing, all [these indicators] provide strong evidence      that it has been warming rapidly in the Arctic in recent      decades.''--Susan Joy Hassol, global warming analyst and      author of the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA)      synthesis report Impacts of a Warming Arctic.       Flooding and erosion affects 184 out of 213, or 86 percent,      of Alaska Native Villages to some extent. While many of the      problems are long-standing, various studies indicate that      coastal villages are becoming more susceptible to flooding      and erosion caused in part by rising temperatures. Four      villages--Kivalina, Koyukuk, Newtok, and Shismaref--are      in imminent danger and are planning to relocate. Costs for      relocation could be high--from $100-$400 million per      village.       ``Everything is under threat. Our homes are threatened by      storms and melting permafrost, our livelihoods are threatened      by changes to the plants and animals we harvest. Even our      lives are threatened, as traditional travel routes become      dangerous.''--Alaska Chickaloon Village Chief Gary Harrison      of the Arctic Athabaskan Council       A recent study in Los Angeles found that if we don't act      now to slow global warming, L.A. residents will face      significant heat-related mortality increases. Under a high      emissions scenario, heat-related mortality rates could      increase sixteen-fold for Blacks, fourteen-fold for Asians,      twelve-fold for Hispanics, and eight-fold for Whites, by      2090.       Climate change will likely raise food and energy prices,      which already represent a large proportion of a low-income      family's budget. Integrated Assessment models indicate that      the annual cost of gradual climate change with no adaptation      may be as high as 1.0 to 1.5 percent of GDP (roughly $80 to      $120 billion per year). People of color and the poor may be      disproportionately impacted by these changes, due to the      higher fraction of incomes spent on food and energy.       ``We are long past the point where global warming is      considered a myth. We are seeing its effects all around us--     especially in my hometown of New Orleans, Louisiana, which is      expected to experience an increased incidence of flooding      that could potentially destabilize its economy and endangers      its populace. We must be realistic about longterm solutions      to global warming.''--Rep. William Jefferson, (D-LA)       ``African Americans and other vulnerable populations live      disproportionately in areas that are exposed to toxic waste,      air pollution and other environmental hazards. Now we learn,      through this report, that global warming will expose these      communities to further environmental hazards that will      continue to have a devastating impact on their health and      economic conditions. We must involve all of the various      stakeholders and continue to use forward-thinking,      comprehensive principals when developing transportation,      energy and environmental policies because of their enormous      effect on vulnerable populations.''--Rep. James E. Clyburn,      (D-TX)       Taking action to slow global warming protects low-income,      people of color, and Indigenous communities, and is good for      all Americans by boosting job growth, saving money for      consumers, and strengthening national security.       Studies have found that the benefits of reducing carbon      emissions, such as lower air pollution, new jobs, and reduced      oil imports, would prove helpful to all Americans. The best      policies for the health of people of color and the poor      involve a substantial decrease in emissions of carbon dioxide      and associated pollutants, and encourage international      cooperation in mitigating climate change.       Policies to reduce global warming can boost job growth,      save money for consumers, and strengthen national security      (Hoerner and Barrett). How America benefits:       1.4 million additional new jobs created;       Average household saving on energy bills of $1,275 per      year; and       Reduced dependence on foreign oil, strengthening national      and economic security for all Americans.       ``It is a travesty that we live in a country where African      Americans expend more of their income on energy costs yet are      the most negatively impacted by energy byproducts such as      carbon emissions. In the current scenario, African Americans      are paying a premium for poor health resulting from air      pollution and climate change. We must mobilize and energize      our policymakers to enact legislation that will mitigate the      unjust effects of global warming.''--Rev. Jesse L. Jackson,      Sr., Rainbow Push Coalition  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.
