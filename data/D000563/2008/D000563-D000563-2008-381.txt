Senator Dorgan tried to lead the fight on this side, and Senator Kyl was a great help in that regard. Let the record be clear. If there is to be future help for Indian Health Services and other Native American needs, I am certain the Senator from Arizona will be part of that effort.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
