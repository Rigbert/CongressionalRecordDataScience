Speaker, on Saturday, April 19, 1997 we mark the 2-year anniversary of the Oklahoma City bombing, one of the most reprehensible tragedies in our Nation's history. I rise today to pay tribute to the fallen Federal workers and the other victims who perished in an event that continues to tug at the heart strings of the entire Nation.  The cowardly and meaningless act of terrorism against the civil servants and children in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal building has touched off a 2-year period of national soul-searching and introspection. Many of the victims families are attempting to move forward in their lives. In fact, the mother of Baylee Almon, whose limp body in the arms of a firefighter became the symbol of the heroism and heartbreak of the bombing, was recently married and is taking steps to move beyond her daughter's death.  We lost many of these fine men and women 2 years ago and I want to once again extend my heartfelt sympathies to all of their families, their friends, their coworkers, their neighbors, and those they serve. As the old saying goes, ``time heals all wounds''; but, the Oklahoma City tragedy will require significantly more than 2 years to diminish the effect it has had on the entire country.  Mr. Speaker, it has long been my view that Federal workers are one of our Nation's greatest assets. As President Lyndon Johnson once noted:       So very much of what we are as a Nation--and what we are to      achieve as a people--depends on the calibre and character of      the Federal career people. In no other endeavor can you more      directly serve our country's cause--or the values on which we      stand--than in the public service.  Mr. Speaker, the people we lost in the bombing were not nameless faceless bureaucrats, and, Mr. Speaker let me be perfectly clear and to the point--I get angry over those who would denigrate our civil servants. All too often it is the prevailing habit of this body to attack the character and devotion of our Federal employees. Mr. Speaker, we must stop the senseless scapegoating and needless bashing of our civil servants.  Yes, there are nonperformers, just like there are at corporations and factories across our country. But, Mr. Speaker, the great majority of these men and women are Americans with a deep love for their Nation who, in many cases, have bypassed more lucrative careers to serve their fellow citizens.  Federal employees play an integral, albeit often invisible role in our daily lives. Federal employees make sure that our senior citizens get their monthly Social Security checks and that our veterans get the care and treatment they need. Federal employees are responsible for printing our money and insuring it when we make deposits at the bank. Federal employees protect our borders and make sure the food we eat is safe. The bottom line is that Federal employees devote their days, and often their nights, to ensuring that our Government and our country is a better place to live.  So, as we pay tribute to the victims and survivors of the Oklahoma City tragedy, I urge my colleagues and my fellow Americans to give great care and thought to those who would criticize our Federal Government. Yes, you get angry at the IRS; yes, you may get angry at law enforcement officials, but do not allow that anger to be directed at individuals. Let it be directed at policy. Let us all be a civil society and strive to make America the great Nation we all know it can be.                          ____________________
