Chairman, the last point. I appreciate the gentlewoman's concern about the deficit that we have.  When I came here 24 years ago, 40 percent of our expenditures were on the entitlement side of the budget. Today it is over 60 percent, over 60 percent. So we need to attack that side of the budget line.  If we placed as much energy on entitlement spending as we have on discretionary, not only would the budget be balanced, but we would be moving toward paying off our national debt.  With that, I reluctantly oppose the gentlewoman's amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes appeared to have it.
