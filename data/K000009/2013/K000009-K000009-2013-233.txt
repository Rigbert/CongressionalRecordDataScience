Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to Dick Boers, who passed from this life on Wednesday October 2, 2013. Dick's family and friends will remember him in a memorial service at the Toledo Botanical Gardens on October 15, 2013.  Dick Boers was ``a man for all seasons.'' A horticulturalist and landscape architect, Dick was instrumental in the establishment of the Toledo Botanical Gardens, then known as Crosby Gardens. He was later named Trustee Emeritus of the Gardens' Board and was affectionately known as ``Mr. Crosby.'' The gardens were a signature achievement in a distinguished career.  Born in 1941 in Rochester, New York, Richard Boers graduated from Cornell University. He was pursuing his graduate degree at the University of Michigan when he was recruited by the City of Toledo as a seasonal park designer. In 1965 he was named the City's Forestry Commissioner, at age 25 the youngest in the city's history and the youngest in the nation. Dick spent the next thirty years in the City of Toledo's Parks Department. A dedicated public service, Dick's efforts during his tenure were evident and everywhere. He was widely credited with ``greening up'' industrial Toledo. Even as he served the City and the citizens of Toledo, Dick was a respected member of several professional organizations and his talent was sought by many.  The Toledo Blade noted that ``A sign in Dick's office summed up who he was, `There is no limit to what a man can do or where he can go if he doesn't mind who gets the credit.'' Philosophers' words indeed, and characteristic of Dick's wisdom.  Dick Boers' efforts of his lifetime are all around us in our city. His legacy is a gift of beautiful landscapes to be enjoyed for generations to come. When the flowering pear trees burst into bloom in early spring in downtown Toledo, and along the city's thoroughfares, we shall fondly remember Dick Boers. When the annual arts festival is held at the Toledo Botanical Gardens, we shall say thank you to Dick Boers. When native plant species like the blue lupine displace invasive species, we express appreciation to Dick Boers for beautifying our parks and environs. For every part of nature he tended and stewarded to the next generation, we say thank you always to Dick Boers.                          ____________________
