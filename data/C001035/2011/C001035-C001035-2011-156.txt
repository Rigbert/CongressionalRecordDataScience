President, it is a great pleasure to offer my heartfelt congratulations to Senator Barbara Mikulski on becoming the longest-serving woman in Senate history. While this is a milestone to celebrate, the true cause for celebration is not just Senator Mikulski's decades of service to this chamber, but her lifetime of service to her beloved Baltimore, her state of Maryland, and our Nation.  This occasion has a special meaning for Sen. Snowe and me. As she begins her 25th year in the Senate, Senator Mikulski now surpasses my personal role model in public service, Senator Margaret Chase Smith. Just as the Great Lady from Maine inspired Sen. Snowe and me as well as countless other young women of my generation to serve, Senator Mikulski inspires the young women of today.  As a new Senator in 1997, I was one of those tutored by Senator Mikulski. She taught me the ropes of the appropriations process and instituted regular bipartisan dinners for the women of the Senate.  It has been a privilege to work with Senator Mikulski for 14 years. During that time, I have come to know her as a fighter, a trailblazer, and as a dear friend. She is committed to the people of her state and of America.  Senator Mikulski is, above all, a hard worker. Growing up in East Baltimore, she learned the value of hard work at her family's grocery store. Her commitment to making a difference in her neighborhood led her to become a social worker, helping at-risk children and the elderly.  Her activism and understanding of community needs led to her first successful run for public office, the Baltimore City Council in 1971. Five years later, she came to Washington as a member of Congress, representing Maryland's 3rd District.  After 10 years of service in the House, she was elected to the Senate in 1986. In so doing, she became the first Democratic Senator elected in her own right.
