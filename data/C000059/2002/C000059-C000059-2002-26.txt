Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication to the community and to the overall well-being of California's Inland Empire and the Nation is unparalleled--Colonel Peter T. Bentley.  Calvin Coolidge, America's 13th President, once said, ``Patriotism is easy to understand in America; it means looking out for yourself by looking out for your country.'' On Saturday February 9th 2002, Colonel Bentley will be honored for over 30 years of distinguished military service in which he dedicated his career in protecting fellow Americans.  Colonel Bentley is the outgoing commander of the Air Force Reserve Command's 452nd Air Mobility Wing at March Air Reserve base in Riverside California. The wing is the Air Force Reserve's only unit-equipped air mobility wing with 18 C-141Cs, 10 KC-135Rs and more than 4,000 reservists.  With true valor and love of country, Colonel Bentley voluntarily enlisted in the United States Air Force in 1970 through Officer Training School in Lackland Air Force Base, Texas. He has served in a variety of flying, command and staff positions throughout his career in the Air Force and Air Force Reserve. He is a command pilot with more than 8,000 hours in airrefueling, cargo and troop transport aircraft. Colonel Bentley is a veteran of the Southeast Asia conflict having flown 60 combat hours there,.  Throughout his career, Colonel Bentley earned numerous medals some of which include the Air Force Commendation Medal, National Defense Medal, Air Force Achievement Medal with one oak leaf cluster, the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal with service star and the Vietnam Service Medal. His commitment to service and the protection of America and her citizens is an example of the greatness that exists within this Nation.  Mr. Speaker, in my district of Riverside, California we are fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated individuals who give unselfishly of their time, talents and their lives to ensure the well-being of our city, state, nation and in Colonel Peter T. Bentley's case--world.                          ____________________
