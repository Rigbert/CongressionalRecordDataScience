 President, I commend the Senator from Maine. I think it is an excellent amendment that ensures that smaller States are able to obtain grant funds to improve their voting systems.  This amendment secures truly minimal amounts for each and every State, obligating only 25 percent of the overall amount authorized. So every State, it seems to me, wins under this amendment.  I commend the Senator from Maine for her suggestion. It certainly is, as far as I know, agreeable on this side of the aisle.  I say to the Senator from Connecticut, I support the amendment and hope maybe we can accept it.
