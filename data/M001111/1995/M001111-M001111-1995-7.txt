 President, I want to take a moment to commend the efforts made by Senators Bond and Mikulski to improve the fiscal year 1996 VA-HUD appropriations bill. Given the budget constraints, they have done an admirable job of trying to craft appropriate and acceptable language.  Unfortunately, I am still frustrated by what this legislation does to this Nation's veterans programs, housing assistance priorities, and environmental protection policies. This bill not only compromises successful programs like AmeriCorps and Youthbuild, it cuts our housing budget by more than 20 percent.  Mr. President, we have an obligation to improve each and every American's access to safe and affordable housing. Unfortunately, as I warned last spring, the bill before us weakens our ability to provide adequate housing, and it ultimately cuts valuable programs that work.  Mr. President, the HOPE VI Program is designed to replace this Nation's most desperate and distressed housing stock with new, sustainable housing communities that will instill a sense of pride and community. The fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill cuts the HOPE VI Program from $500 million to $280 million. Mr. President, this cut will make it very difficult for current HOPE VI projects to complete their work. Because of this, I want to emphasize how important it will be for the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to comply with the Senate report language that expresses the Senate's intent to give priority funding to already-approved HOPE VI sites.  The Senate language allows us to follow through on our commitment to improving housing conditions and opportunities in a time of severe funding constraints.  Mr. President, I am also deeply concerned about the funding cuts the conference bill has imposed on the Environmental Protection Agency. While the conference opted to stay with the higher funding levels urged by the Senate, this level of $5.7 billion still results in a 22.5 percent reduction from the President's budget request and a 14 percent cut from 1995. However, I am most worried about the reductions in several important programs, including environmental and public health standards enforcement, drinking water and wastewater treatment infrastructure projects for States, and hazardous waste site cleanup.  Mr. President, we are finally making real progress in environmental protection. Our rivers and lakes are cleaner, our air is more breathable, and our drinking water is safer. Now is not the time to slow that progress. Instead, we should move forward so that we leave our world a safer, healthier place for our children.  Mr. President, for these reasons, I must vote against this legislation. But, should the President veto this bill, I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve the bill.                        spelman college outreach
