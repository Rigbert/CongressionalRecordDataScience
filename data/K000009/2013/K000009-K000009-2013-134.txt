Chairman, I want to thank the gentlelady for bringing this issue before us during this debate.  You know, when I look at the executives that come and appear before our subcommittee from the Department, I would have to say that the gentlelady brings a very important concern to our subcommittee.  I would not say that if I look at those who have come, they are completely representative of our country. So I'm not sure that the consciousness exists at the highest level for assuring that all communities in America are engaged in the activities of the Department.  I don't know--I heard the chairman, and there is a concern about which accounts have been included in the gentlelady's amendment. I would hope that, as this legislation moves forward, we could find a way to accomplish the gentlelady's objectives in a way that would not raise concerns on the other side.  So I think that she has really brought an important proposal before us here, and I would hate to see that it would not be considered simply because a wrong account has been identified, for example. So I would just like to remain open to the gentlelady's proposal in a manner in which it could be considered and ultimately approved.
