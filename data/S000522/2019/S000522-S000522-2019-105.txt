Madam Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.  First of all, if you were to say ``unilateral nuclear disarmament'' to most people, I think, if you look at the plain language of the words, what that would say is we are going to universally nuclear disarm all nuclear weapons. That is what unilateral nuclear disarmament would mean. So that is not what we are doing here.  Again, we literally have thousands of nuclear weapons. What we are doing here is trying to decide whether or not we want to deploy one in a different form, which is a smaller yield.  So we are not--let me assure my colleagues again--getting rid of all of our nuclear weapons and unilaterally disarming from nuclear weapons. We are not doing that.                              {time}  2045  This is one weapon with a small yield.  The other thing that is worth noting; there is actually no evidence that the Russians have decided that they are going to use a low-yield nuclear weapon first without any new clear provocation.  I have had this debate with a number of different people. There have been various conversations about this; just like we have had various conversations about a wide range of scenarios. But it is not at all clear that Russia has decided to launch a nuclear weapon.  I believe that the purpose of a nuclear arsenal is deterrence; and we ought to find a clear message. In fact, I find this debate, which we have been having for a while, very dangerous because what we are saying to the Russians is there is a scenario under which they can use a nuclear weapon and we won't respond, and I don't think that should ever be true.  We should say a nuclear weapon is a red line. You step across it, we will respond.  It is also very untrue--this debate has said, Well, gosh, if they do a low yield, we have no option but to hit them with something 10 times as large.  We have a wide range of yields on our nuclear weapons, a wide range of options in terms of where and when we could respond.  But what introducing a low-yield nuclear weapon does is we take the Russian mutterings about doing an escalate to de-escalate and say, yeah, we are with you. This could happen.  Former Secretary of State George Shultz, a Republican, is the one who has been most critical of deployment of this weapon, because, as he correctly states, when we start talking about low-yield nuclear weapons, you start making nuclear war acceptable.  That is why deployment of this weapon is such a mistake. It takes us down the road of saying, we can have a manageable nuclear war. No. Make it clear to the Russians, if they start a nuclear war, we can't promise that our response is going to be proportional, but we can promise that we will respond.  This is a mistake. But we are not unilaterally nuclear disarming.  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
