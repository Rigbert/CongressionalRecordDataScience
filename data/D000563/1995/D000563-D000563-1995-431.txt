Speaker, if the Government closes, so should its pocketbook. Today, I am introducing legislation to cut off the paychecks of Members of Congress if the Federal Government shuts down because of budget gridlock. Senator Boxer of California is introducing identical legislation in the Senate.  Under Federal law, the House and the Senate must pass all appropriations bills by October 1. If all the bills are not approved and a stop-gap measure is not enacted, the Federal Government will be unable to make payments or meet its obligations. Such a ``train wreck'' could result in a shutdown of certain Federal operations.  Too many politicians on Capitol Hill are talking about a ``train wreck'' as if we're dealing with toy trains. A shutdown of the Federal Government is a serious matter, and Members of Congress should take it seriously.  The bill I am introducing is simple--if we don't finish the job, we don't get paid. The bill has three simple provisions.  First, Members would not receive basic pay for any period in which there is a lapse in appropriations for any Federal agency or department as a result of a failure to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing resolution.  Second, Members would not receive basic pay for any period in which the Federal Government is unable to make payments or meet obligations because the public debt limit has been reached.  Third, no pay forfeited under this measure could be paid retroactively.  A Government shutdown is not child's play. If a ``train wreck'' occurs, it will disrupt the lives of millions of Americans.  Even if so-called essential services are continued, many people will be affected by the shutdown of Federal offices. Let me give a few examples.  The small business owner looking for a Federally-assisted loan or technical assistance may be told to put his business plans on hold until the shutdown ends.  The senior citizen trying to apply for Social Security benefits may have to delay her retirement because her application can't be processed.  The farmer looking for advice from the Soil Conservation Service may find the office closed and no one answering the telephones.  These disruptions are not necessary. It's our responsibility to avoid a ``train wreck'' while Congress and the President debate the broader spending priorities over which we differ. We ought to be able to allow the Government to continue operating while we negotiate our differences over spending priorities. If not, Congressional salaries should be first on the budget chopping block.  I urge my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this legislation to make Members feel the pain that will be inflicted on others if the Government shuts down.                          ____________________
