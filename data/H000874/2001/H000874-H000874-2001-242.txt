Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Meeks) for his contribution. And the gentleman is correct, the history of this institution would not be nearly as rich, as important as it is without the contribution of Americans of African descent. Mr. Speaker, I thank him for his contribution.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), a distinguished representative of a great State. She is the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.
