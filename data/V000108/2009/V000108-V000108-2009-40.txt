Throughout its history, the struggle for racial equality has been and continues to be one of the greatest testaments of America's progress.  The theme for this year's Black History Month, The Quest for Black Citizenship in the Americas, is a reminder that in striving for a greater society, we must examine the past. No group has contributed more to reflecting on the past in order to create a better future than the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). As the NAACP celebrates a remarkable milestone, its 100th anniversary, we take this time to rememberthe outstanding contributions of so many proud and courageous individuals: black, white, men, women, young and old. These men and women have given hope in the bleakest of times and allowed us, as a society, to make strides toward equality once considered impossible.  Recognizing that emancipation was only the beginning of the fight for true equality, the NAACP was founded with the ideals of creating and preserving equal citizenship for all men and women throughout America. Knowing that there is still work to be done, it is the vision of the NAACP that, one day, all individuals will have equal rights and the United States will see an end to racial hatred and discrimination. As the first page of the NAACP Constitution indicates, the principal goals of the organization are: to ensure political, educational, social, and economic equality, to eliminate racial prejudice in America, to remove racial barriers through the democratic process, to secure civil rights, to inform the public and seek the elimination of racial discrimination, and to educate individuals about their constitutional rights.  In the First Congressional District, I am proud to serve as the representative for three branches of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. At this time, I would like to pay special tribute to these three groups, which have played such a critical role, locally, in the fight for racial equality and in improving Northwest Indiana for all residents. These three outstanding representatives of the First Congressional District include the East Chicago Branch, led by President Philip Hinton, the Gary Branch, led by President Karen Pulliam, and the Hammond Branch, led by President Mary Aaron.  It is the efforts of organizations like these that allow us to reflect on what makes the United States of America so special. Nowhere else in the world do you find such an integrated society. While the United States is made up of people from so many different racial, religious, social, and ideological backgrounds, it is the efforts of the many brave citizens who have fought and continue to struggle for equality that have made America what it is.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in remembering the many brave men and women who have led the struggle for equality among all Americans, and I ask that you join me in honoring the work and tireless dedication of the members of organizations, such as the NAACP, who continue their selfless work today. Through the efforts of these honorable individuals and organizations, we are reminded of how far we have come as a nation, while realizing that there is still progress to be made.                          ____________________
