 President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. on Monday, February 9, the Senate proceed to executive session to consider Calendar No. 10, the nomination of Michael P. Botticelli to be Director of National Drug Control Policy. I further ask that there be 30 minutes of debate equally divided on the nomination, and that following the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on confirmation, and that if the nomination is confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.
