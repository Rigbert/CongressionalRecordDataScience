 President, I will be brief.  First of all, I commend my friend and colleague, Senator Bryan, who brought this to the attention of the Senate. We have discussed this before. He feels very strongly about it. I believe if you look at it in its entirety, it has some merit. But I also think this should be addressed at the level of the appropriate committee. At the time when he pursues this, I will tell every one of my colleagues to look at this very carefully because I believe what he is proposing should be evaluated in that light. Personally, I think it has some merit.  I commend the Senator from Nevada, who is also a member of the Intelligence Committee, and a senior member. Perhaps soon he will be the vice chairman of the committee--next year.
