President, I will speak to the Defense appropriations bill which is before the Senate and discuss the war in Iraq in the context of this bill.  This bill includes $50 billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Earlier this week, we added another $13.1 billion for emergency funding for the Army and Marine Corps to repair and replace badly needed equipment. I supported these additional funds and I support this bill.  I have this vision in my mind of our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan driving down those dusty roads wondering if a bomb is going to explode, and I think about us in the safety of this Senate Chamber here at home. I think to myself, if it were my son or daughter in uniform serving our country, risking their lives, would I want them to have everything possible to come home safely?
