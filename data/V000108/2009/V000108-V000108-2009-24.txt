Throughout the years, Whiting Park has been an integral part of the community providing residents with a place to create lasting memories while preserving the history of the city. Whiting commemorated this extraordinary milestone on July 18, 2009, with a celebration in the park presented by the Whiting Park Festival Orchestra.  In the early 1900s the idea for Whiting Park began to take shape. Many activists in the area, at the time, could envision the potential for a magnificent park that would serve to bring the community closer together. In 1908, Frank Long, Chairman of the City Council Park Committee, along with Mayor Fred J. Smith, helped the city to acquire 22 acres of land bounded by Front and 117th Streets, the New York Central Railroad tracks and Lake Michigan. Whiting purchased the land from the Forsythe Estate for $75,000. Whiting Park continued to expand, and by the 1920s the park included a man-made lagoon, fountains, attractive walkways, a baseball diamond, trapshooting facility, tennis courts, a playground, and a pavilion used for ballroom dancing and different music venues. In addition, a bath house was built for the beach lakefront activities, which included two waterslides and a diving board. The winter months at the park were filled with ice skaters, sledding, and ice hockey games. Over the next two and a half decades, thousands of people would flock to Whiting Park for the amenities on the land and in the water, all year round making the park one of the most popular on the entire lakeshore.  The next 30 years proved to be a troublesome time for Whiting Park, and there were many factors that led to the downfall of the park's glorious days of the past. Whiting Park Beach was closed in the late 1940s due to a high bacteria count in the water. The war emergency, at the time, led to limited city and federal funding for the upkeep of the park and beach. While there were proposed solutions over the years to bring back the Whiting Park of the past, many of them fell through. People began to think that the once famous Whiting Park would never be restored.  Finally, in 1977, the Whiting Park and Recreation Board was established. Through the efforts of the Parks Department, the beach was reopened on August 23, 1981, and came to be known as Whihala Beach County Park. The name ``Whihala'' stands for Whiting, Hammond, and Lake County Parks Department. With the new beach open, the Whiting Parks Department began again to concentrate on restoring the beauty of Whiting Park. Over the years, volunteer groups spent much time planting new flowers, and restoring the main garden, pond and waterfall area near the entrance of the park, bringing the park back to life. Today, Whiting Park spans approximately 15 acres and includes playground equipment, walking paths, four tennis courts, one baseball diamond, picnic facilities, a concession area, a fishing pier, two sand volleyball courts, an in-line skate/hockey rink, and a fish pond including a waterfall.  As Whiting Park celebrates its 100th anniversary, there are also many innovative plans for the future, including working to become an integral part of the proposed Marquette Plan, a project that will better utilize Northwest Indiana's Lake Michigan shoreline.  Madam Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in honoring and congratulating the city of Whiting on their 100th anniversary of Whiting Park. Throughout the years, Whiting Park has been a historical reminder of a city whose people continue to push forward with enthusiasm and faith to return this park to one of the most prized recreational lakefronts in the region, just as it was at the turn of the century. Their constant dedication and commitment is worthy of our deepest admiration.                          ____________________
