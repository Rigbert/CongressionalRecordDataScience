President.  I respect what the Senator from Texas has said. I agree with much of what she said. I certainly agree the college tuition assistance program is a good one. I support it.  I hope you can tell from the debate that our point of disagreement is on the tax cut, and my belief is that tax cut money--at least a portion of it--should be dedicated toward making the District a safer place to live, and making D.C. schools better schools--and addressing some of the serious problems the children in this District face, problems which are, frankly, of a third world nature and seem to be ignored by this D.C. City Council.  Let me tell you, you shouldn't take the word of a Senator from Illinois, nor a Senator from Texas, about what D.C. residents are interested in; you should take their own word.  When you look at the surveys of the people of the District of Columbia, Washington, DC, and their priorities, you search down that list for a long way before they start talking about taxes. High on the list is their concern about safety and crime in their neighborhoods. How low could you bring taxes to attract a person into a neighborhood where they felt as though they were not safe?  So many members of my staff who would love to live on Capitol Hill where I live have finally reached the conclusion that they can't. One member of my staff, after she was mugged a second time on Capitol Hill, and her face was swollen for about a week, gave up and moved out of Washington, DC, to a neighboring suburb. The taxes had nothing to do with that.  I talked to another young couple, just the kind of people who should be living in the District to make a great contribution. They said it finally just wore them down--their concern about crime, their concern about the filth they saw in the streets, and the rats running across the streets as they came home in the evening. It finally just wore them down, and they picked up and moved to a neighboring suburb. They didn't mention taxes. I am sure it is a concern. Nobody wants to pay any more taxes than they have to.  But I think if this District were more livable when it came to the basics of protecting families in their own homes and neighborhoods that you would attract more people to live in what is otherwise in many places one of the most beautiful cities in America. The Senator from Texas said she wants Washington, DC, to be family friendly. I couldn't agree more. But first it has to be family safe. Unfortunately, it isn't close.  When they did a survey of the people in the District of Columbia, 48 percent said they live in fear of crime in their neighborhood. When they asked people in the District of Columbia, they had the highest percentage of residents among 12 cities surveyed indicating the presence of abandoned cars and rundown buildings. When they asked the residents in the District of Columbia whether or not they had problems of public drug sales, they had the highest response in the Nation. Panhandling and begging was the highest in the Nation.  These are quality-of-life issues that need to be addressed by the city council that should get its head out of the clouds and down on the street, talking to the people they represent.                      amendment no. 1224 withdrawn
