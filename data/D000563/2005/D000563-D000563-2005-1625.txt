It would dramatically raise the standards for receiving asylum. This provision is supposedly aimed at terrorists but applies to all asylum applicants. Current law already prohibits--already prohibits--suspected terrorists from obtaining asylum. That is not an issue.  In Illinois, there is a wonderful social-services agency called Heartland Alliance. One of the things they do is provide assistance to refugees who have come to Illinois from all over the world. Heartland Alliance is not a political organization. They are down in the trenches doing important work for people in need. So when I received a letter from them telling me the REAL ID Act would hurt the people they serve, I paid attention.  Let me tell you what they said:       REAL ID threatens to eliminate relief for immigrants most      in need of protection--those fleeing persecution in their      home countries. REAL ID is inconsistent with our commitment      to international agreements relating to refugees, and it      violates some of the rights that we, as a nation of      immigrants and a global leader of human rights, cherish.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Heartland Alliance,                                      Chicago, IL, March 25, 2005.       Dear Senator Durbin: At the opening of the 109th Congress,      national security and immigration reform concern Americans as      never before. In response to these concerns, the House of      Representatives introduced legislation that, if passed into      law, would undermine the asylum provisions of immigration law      while doing nothing to effectively advance national security      REAL ID (HR 418) will not provide the immigration reform      needed or advance national security, but it will force us to      turn our backs on asylum seekers.       REAL ID is not Congress' first attempt to dismantle the      asylum system in an effort to further national security.      These ill-conceived changes to asylum law were proposed as      part of the intelligence reform bill last year, but Congress      (following the lead of the 9/11 Commission which found no      fault with the current asylum system) wisely excluded these      changes from the National Intelligence Reform Act of 2004.      Despite the findings of the 9/11 Commission, REAL ID      threatens to eliminate relief for immigrants most in need of      protection--those fleeing persecution in their home      countries. REAL ID is inconsistent with our commitments to      international agreements relating to refugees, and it      violates some of the rights that we, a nation of immigrants      and a global leader of human rights, cherish.       REAL ID Eviscerates Due Process Protections In the Asylum      Adjudication Process:       Judicial oversight guarantees a full and fair process in      proceedings that can literally mean life or death to asylum      applicants. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals has recognized      that ``caseload pressures and . . . resource constraints''      can cause errors in Immigration Courts; the growing dockets      make these errors more inevitable. However, because all      immigrants are ``entitled to a national analysis of the      evidence,'' judicial review must exist to maintain this      standard.       REAL ID would suspend habeas corpus review for many      immigrants, denying them one of the most cherished      protections from government abuse. This provision would      prevent parole for immigrants challenging unwarranted      detention or deprivation of fundamental freedoms.       REAL ID eliminates stays of removal pending judicial      review. Stays of removal exist to allow asylum seekers to      remain in the United States while petitioning for relief. The      7th Circuit has explained that this right is especially      ``vital when the alien seeks asylum or contends that he would      be subject to torture if returned,'' but by deporting asylum      seekers, REAL ID would make it impossible for these asylum      seekers to see their case to its judicial end.       REAL ID Will Result in the Denial of Asylum to Those Who      Are Persecuted:       REAL ID raises the burden of proof for asylum applicants by      requiring them to prove that the central reason for their      persecution is one of the five protected grounds. Applicants      can rarely prove the unspoken intent of their persecutors.      Moreover, persecution rarely happens for one specific reason.      The current law recognizes this limitation and grants asylum      to many individuals who have suffered persecution for complex      or multiple reasons. Women fleeing female genital      mutilation, domestic violence, and honor killings, and      victims from political contexts where economic or sexual      violence such as extortion, kidnapping for ransom, and      rape are political tools can find safe haven in the United      States. REAL ID would eliminate asylum for these and other      deserving individuals.       Under current law and longstanding international authority,      individuals may be granted asylum based solely on their      credible testimony explaining their well-founded fear of      persecution. The law relects the reality that refugees cannot      obtain documents from their persecutors. REAL ID would give      Immigration Judges wide discretion to deny relief from      removal simply because the immigrant lacks corroborating      evidence, even when the applicant's testimony is found to be      credible. For example, under this provision, a refugee may be      denied protection if his country lacks sufficient      infrastructure to issue official documentation.       Because credibility determinations are notoriously      subjective, judges must substantiate their findings in      reasoned judgments, and they may not make negative      credibility findings based on minor inconsistencies in      testimony. REAL ID eliminates these safeguards. It would      allow judges to determine credibility based on any alleged      inconsistency with any prior statements, even if that      inconsistency is immaterial to the person's claim. Judges      could also use an applicant's demeanor, perceived candor, or      responsiveness as a basis for a credibility finding.       REAL ID will damage asylum seekers' right to protection      while doing nothing to enhance our national security. The      current U.S. asylum system screens all applicants using      thorough background checks and allows the U.S. State      Department to comment on all applications. Under the existing      system, asylum is granted only to those who establish that      they are refugees and who have no ties to criminal or      terrorist organizations. If REAL ID is passed in its current      form, many deserving applicants will be denied refuge in this      country.       If Congress truly wishes to address the link between      immigration and national security, it must turn its full      attention to the problem. Because of their piecemeal nature,      the asylum provisions of REAL ID are ineffective.      Furthermore, attempts to tack on these provisions as      amendments to appropriations bills reflect an unwillingness      to recognize the need for immigration reform. We need a      better system for tracking arriving and departing non-     citizens; we need to improve security screening while      reducing backlogs that keep families separated for years and      U.S. employers short of labor. We do not, however, need to      throw out an effective system and replace it with harmful      provisions in REAL ID.       As a representative of the people of Illinois and a Senate      leader, we appeal to you to vigorously oppose REAL ID and to      encourage your colleagues to do the same. We hope you will      work as our ally to ensure that the bill docs not pass.      Moreover, we hope to continue working with you to ensure      comprehensive reform that improves our immigration system,      strengthens our national security, and reflects the will of      the general public and our common values; REAL ID docs none      of these. We would welcome an opportunity to talk to you      further about the REAL ID and will contact your office within      the next few days to arrange a meeting with you or your      staff.
