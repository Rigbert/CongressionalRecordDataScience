 President, when we debated the Senate budget resolution in committee and on the floor over the last few weeks, I raised a concern about the transparency of the budget. One of the problems I pointed out was the over reliance of the budget resolution on unspecified revenue raisers. As ranking member of the Finance Committee, I referred mainly to Finance Committee policy demands that weren't realistically reflected in the budget. I referred to currently expiring tax, trade, and health and welfare spending provisions.
