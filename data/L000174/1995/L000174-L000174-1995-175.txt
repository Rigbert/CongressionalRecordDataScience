President, today on Capitol Hill a number of religious organizations concerned with hunger in the United States are gathering to highlight what I believe is one of the great injustices being perpetrated in the name of welfare reform in this Congress.  Most of my colleagues, I believe, had the best of intentions when they voted for H.R. 4, the welfare reform package. But I am very concerned with the impact of the final welfare reform package on the nutritional safety net for children, families, and senior citizens. Quite simply, under either the House or Senate versions of this bill, more children will go hungry.  The majority of the savings in the Senate version of welfare reform have come out of nutrition programs, whose main beneficiaries are children. H.R. 4 contains a little bit of reform. But even the Senate version contains a whole lot of cuts--more than $30 billion in total cuts, including more than $20 billion in reduced nutrition benefits to children alone. Less than one-half of 1 percent of the bill's savings come from antifraud provisions, according to CBO estimates. Over half of the savings come from across-the-board cuts, and another 12 percent of the savings come from households with high utility costs.  Under the Senate bill, by 2002, a working-poor family of four supported by a full-time minimum wage worker would lose $324 a year in food stamp benefits from the across-the-board benefit reductions, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. An elderly SSI recipient, typically a poor woman living alone, would lose $228 a year--that's a 32-percent reduction.  The Senate bill also contains an optional block grant that will allow States to cancel the national nutritional safety net, divert funds away from food, and slash benefits during a recession.  Wrongheaded as it is, however, the Senate version is actually preferable in many ways to the House version of H.R. 4. The House bill repeals school lunches, school breakfasts, WIC, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, and other programs for children. These are among the great success stories of public policy in the 20th century. Conservative House Republicans seem to say, ``If it works--but it does not fit our ideology--break it.'' I am pleased that many moderates of both parties are rebelling against this position.  The House bill would replace real food with junk food in school cafeterias. It would reduce food stamp benefits so they no longer pay for a decent diet. It would end scientifically based nutritional supplements for pregnant women. It would cancel the guarantee of free meals for poor schoolchildren.  This is bad public policy, and it is immoral. If we are going to turn school lunches into junk-food bonanzas and shrivel food stamps down to a meaningless few pennies per meal, we might as well feed our children stones.  Today, the Christian citizens' group Bread for the World and other religious and antihunger groups are gathering on Capitol Hill to ponder Jesus' question in the New Testament (Matthew 7:9): ``Is there anyone among you who, if your child asks for bread, will give a stone?'' To symbolize this concern, they are holding a ``lunch of stones.'' Members of these groups, which include the Salvation Army, the Second Harvest National Network of Food Banks, Lutheran Social Services, the NETWORK Catholic social justice lobby, and other national religious and charitable leaders, will be visiting offices on Capitol Hill. These groups represent tens of thousands of concerned citizens who donate their time and effort to improving the diet and health of children, families, and senior citizens.  These dedicated citizens and I urge Members of this Congress to protect the national nutritional safety net that Republicans and Democrats together have constructed over the last 25 years. The safety net ensures that, even during recessions and natural disasters, children in need receive food assistance so they do not go hungry. I urge my colleagues to listen carefully to the concerns voiced in the ``lunch of stones.''  I also want to caution my colleagues against some of the phony arguments being bandied about on this topic. None of these gigantic cuts will reform welfare. And these cuts are not necessary to balance the budget--the President has put forward a plan to balance the budget without such gigantic cuts in nutrition programs. I believe these cuts are, quite simply, mistakes and errors in judgment. Right now there is still time to correct these errors, before more children must go hungry.                          ____________________
