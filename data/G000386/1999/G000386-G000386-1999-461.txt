 President, earlier this week, Senator Graham of Forida and I introduced a bill to revitalize and modernize our efforts to defend U.S. borders from drug traffickers. This bill, the ``Comprehensive Border Protection Act'', S. 689, is part of a bi-partisan effort by Congress to provide the resources for this critical effort. Its goal is to stop dangerous drugs and other contraband from reaching our streets. Last year, we took an important step in this direction with increased funding for our counter-drug efforts in the Western Hemisphere Drug Elimination Act. As needed as that funding was, we left something undone.  One of the critical frontline agencies in our counter-drug efforts in the U.S. Customs Service. Despite the fact that trade has increased exponentially in the last several years, we have not provided the resources to expand the ability of Customs to manage this increased volume. Every year, more than the total population of the United States crosses our borders. In practice, that means more than 400 million people annually coming into our airports, across our land borders, and into our seaports. Nearly 15 million containers enter our ports. Some 125 million privately owned vehicles come into the country. That is every year. To deal with this volume, Customs has fewer than 20,000 employees and equipment that is outdated.  Most of this traffic is legal. But criminal gangs, terrorists, and drug traffickers willfully and cynically seek to hide their illegal acts in this flow. They use every means that vast resources and ruthless intent puts into their hands to commit their crimes. And they have increasingly sophisticated means to conceal their illegal activities. Short of sealing our borders to all trade and financial transactions, we must depend upon agencies like Customs to secure our borders We must, however, do this while facilitating the flow of people and legitimate trade. It is a daunting task.  Recognizing that our borders were under intense pressure from illegal alien smuggling, the Congress increased the resources to the Immigration Service. We almost doubled that agency's capacity. The challenge facing Customs is far greater. Yet, we have not provided the resources, the technological improvements, or the support that is needed to get the job done.  We have not given our men and women who do this job the support that the task requires. And it is a demanding and dangerous job. It's not glamorous to spend hours a day at a major U.S. port of entry watching tens of thousands of vehicles and people cross the border. It's a lonely and risky livelihood to patrol long stretches of our border. The long hours spent in undercover investigations and in analyzing reams of information go largely unnoticed. But being out of sight should not put their efforts or why they are undertaken out of mind.  That is what the legislation that we are offering today aims to do--to remind us of what we must be doing and to give the tools and support needed to do the job to those we ask to do it. I have for the passed several years urged the Administration to provide Congress with a comprehensive plan. We know that drug thugs have no respect for national sovereignty, for the rule of law, or for international borders. These criminal gangs are ruthless and shrewd. And they are flexible. We have to be flexible also.  I have repeatedly noted that we need to develop a capacity to guard our borders with flexibility and forethought. Too often we simply react. We respond to a threat in one area only to find the traffickers have switched tactics. We need a comprehensive approach and a sustainable plan. Such a plan, however, has not been forthcoming. For too long, we have been merely reactive to the initiative of traffickers, moving resources around to meet their latest tactic. We need to be anticipating their efforts and we need to be comprehensive. That is why this legislation addresses both our northern and southern borders, our ports and airports and our coastlines. We need the intelligence and investigative resources to focus our efforts. And we need that consistency of purpose and sustained effort that characterizes resolve. We cannot affort to be less committed in our purpose than drug traffickers are in theirs. We must not be any less comprehensive.  While this bill is not the whole solution to our quest for a coherent and comprehensive approach, it is an important step. I urge my colleagues in the Senate and the House to join us in making this effort a reality.                          ____________________
