 The American people are saying--some 70 percent of them--that we ought to open the Outer Continental Shelf, those portions that are currently off limits, and it is my understanding that 85 percent of the Outer Continental Shelf is currently off limits. Ihave been proposing a series of consents, basically drafted consistent with the Coleman amendment that would have been offered had we had a chance to offer it.  I would ask my friend from Minnesota if he would describe his proposal?
