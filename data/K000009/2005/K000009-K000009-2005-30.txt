Speaker, I would like to thank my dear colleague, the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt), for yielding me the remaining time and thank our colleagues, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Coble) and the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Simmons), for participating in this great tribute to the Coast Guard, which we on the Great Lakes know so well.  I am honored to add these words this evening as we close the House. That is, Mr. Speaker, summer's end has ushered in the end of an era to the region I represent of northwest Ohio. Our community's elder statesman, Barney Quilter, passed from this life on August 17, 2005, and he had achieved 86 years young. As husband, father, father figure for our community, kind and generous spirit, and political leader, he built a legacy that spanned more than 3 decades of service, even after his 1994 retirement from Ohio's General Assembly.  His achievements were stellar. He championed the Maumee Bay State Park on Lake Erie as a lasting legacy to the future, the largest State park in Ohio. He sponsored worker protection laws, guiding into place in our State cornerstones to working men and women's rights. Barney Quilter left so much to all of us. His quiet diligence brought so many efforts to fruition. Improvements throughout our State may be laid to his credit. Former colleague Patrick Sweeney of Cleveland explained that Representative Quilter's legacy can really be found in all of the accomplishments that do not carry his name. He noted, it just got done. You never saw Barney's fingerprints on a news release; it was just the way he was. His influence is, and will be for many years, enormous.  Born in 1919 to James and Helen Marie Quilter, James Barney Quilter grew up on Toledo's famous East Side. A boxer, his career ended when he was called into service in World War II where he served in the Army's 167th Combat Engineering Battalion. In 1967, he was persuaded to run for State representative. Reluctant, he finally agreed, but only for one term. Toledo's voters decided differently and reelectedhim to successive 2-year terms until he retired at the end of his 14th term.  Truly a statesman in the best sense of the word, Barney Quilter rose to power and prominence in the Ohio legislature, serving as its speaker pro tempore, leading the Ohio House in tandem with Speaker Riffe for 20 years, an acclaimed and effective, powerful team. Partisanship was not Barney's goal. He worked side by side with legislators to move forward initiatives which benefited all the people of Ohio.  Henry Clay said: ``Government is a trust, and the officers of the government are trustees; and both the trust and the trustees are created for the benefit of the people.'' This creed expressed by the 19th century giant was exemplified in the tenure of Representative Barney Quilter. His example should be emulated by all of us in public life.  A noble public servant, Barney shared his expertise and wisdom with any and all who asked. He was a real mentor to many, including myself; to his own son Bernie who also followed a path into public service. His daughter Mary Ann has devoted herself to her family and to educating the next generation. Barney and Mary's family are living testimonials to the dedication to others their stellar family exemplifies.  Despite his legislative career, Barney Quilter never lost sight of his true happiness: his wife and his children. He and his wife Mary shared 52 loving years together until Mary's passing in 1996. For nearly 2 decades, Barney faithfully would minister to her, even reading to her regularly, as she bore gracefully a debilitating illness that made it impossible to communicate with her family. He loved her so much.  Barney's own passing leaves his son Bernie and daughter Mary Ann and six grandchildren with our heartfelt condolences. We mourn the passing of this great American. We can celebrate his life and his service. May his strength and goodness guide us all as we seek to follow in his footsteps, always moving forward, no matter how steep the hill. Thank you, Barney Quilter. Onward.                          ____________________
