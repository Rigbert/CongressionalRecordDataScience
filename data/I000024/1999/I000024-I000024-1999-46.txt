 First of all, let me say I respect the Senator from Nebraska so much, and yet I have to disagree with him. I respect certainly the senior Senator from New York as well as the Senator from Delaware. But the reason I disagree with them is, it is not as if this came up all of a sudden and we did not have any time to look at it. This treaty has been here for 2 years. We could read it. We could study it. We could prepare amendments. We could spend time evaluating it, talk to the experts. I have been doing this. I assume many of my colleagues have been doing this.  So procedurally let me just explain, so there is no misunderstanding where we are, what my position is.  We had a unanimous-consent request propounded--it was agreed to a few days ago--that said we were going to have possibly up to two amendments, not necessarily, but if we did, it would be 4 hours of debate equally divided. Then we would have a vote on the treaty. There would be 14 hours of debate, which we are in the process of having right now.  This was done by unanimous consent. That means any one of these Senators we have been listening to this morning could have objected to that unanimous-consent request. Certainly, the senior Senator from New York could have done it, the Senator from Nebraska, the Senator from Delaware. Anyone could have done it. Only one Senator has said he would not have done it if he had been on the floor or if he had been aware of it. That was the Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd.  That is the way the Senate is run. It is run by unanimous consent. So anyone could have stopped it. And they did not do it. But they could have.  It takes unanimous consent to vitiate that unanimous consent agreement. If this happens, I made an announcement yesterday and the day before, sitting on the Armed Services Committee--with such distinguished witnesses as our Secretary of Defense, Bill Cohen; as General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; as the Directors of all the labs, all three of them--and I said in the event someone asks for a unanimous-consent agreement to delay this vote, I will object. I want everybody to know right now, I will object to that.  There may be some parliamentary maneuvering where they can figure out a way to get around my objection. If they do, I am sure it will have to be passed on by the Parliamentarian. And that might happen. I might lose this thing.  But we have been looking at this right now for over 2 years. Certainly we have had ample time to study it and digest it. It is not something that just jumped up. Any Senator, of 100 Senators, could have stopped the vote that is supposed to take place on Tuesday or Wednesday when the debate time expires. So let me just serve notice I will be here to object to that, so we get down to it. The reason is, we do not need to keep delaying and delaying this thing.  The President has been yelling for 2 years: Bring it up. Bring it up. We want to bring this up for a vote. Yet now that it is up and he knows--he suspects; he does not know--he suspects he does not have the votes for ratification, he wants to bring it back. So anyway, that is where we are today.  Let me just respond to a few of the comments that have been made on the floor. The distinguished Senator from Delaware talked about the distinguished list of supporters of this test ban treaty. I would like to submit for the Record a list of those who are opposed to the ratification of this treaty. They include six former Secretaries of Defense--Schlesinger, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Laird, Carlucci, Weinberger--and several former Directors of Central Intelligence; 13 generals, commanding generals, who are now retired.  In fact, I would suggest--I might be challenged on this so I will say probably most of the military officials who are supporting the ratification of this treaty now are serving in the capacity in which they are serving at the will of the President.  So I ask unanimous consent this distinguished list of some 33 leaders saying we should oppose and vote down this treaty be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the list was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Partial List of Opponents of CTBT       Jim Schlesinger (Former Secretary of Defense); Dick Cheney      (Former Secretary of Defense); Don Rumsfeld (Former Secretary      of Defense); Melvin Laird (Former Secretary of Defense);      Frank Carlucci (Former Secretary of Defense); Caspar      Weinberger (Former Secretary of Defense); Jim Woolsey (Former      Director of Central Intelligence); Bob Dole; Governor George      W. Bush; Elizabeth Dole; Judge William Clark (Reagan National      Security Adviser); Richard Allen (Reagan National Security      Advisor); Jeane Kirkpatrick (Former US Ambassador to the      United Nations); William Graham (Reagan Science Adviser);      Gen. Russ Dougherty, USAF (Former Commander, Strategic Air      Command).       Gen, Louis Wilson (Former Commandant, US Marine Corps);      Gen.
