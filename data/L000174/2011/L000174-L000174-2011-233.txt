We balanced the budget. Wecreated an amazing surplus. We created millions and millions of new jobs.  But you know what. Not a single Republican voted for that. It passed in the Senate only because the Vice President of the United States cast the deciding vote. No Republican voted--we actually had to do more than just have a bumper sticker ``Let's Balance the Budget.'' We actually did balance the budget, which required some very tough choices. No Republican voted for that.  In fact, they all condemned it saying: This would bring about wrack and ruin, and on and on. It did not. It created an enormous budget surplus and created 22 million new jobs. We were paying down the national debt. We left a very large surplus to President Clinton's successor, President Bush, who immediately wasted it on a needless war in Iraq and tax cuts, both of which I voted against.  It is also interesting to be lectured by the other side of the aisle about balancing the budget when they voted to go into two of the longest wars in our history, and for the first time in our history voted to pay for them by borrowing the money. Now look where trillions of dollars will have gone because of Iraq and Afghanistan, and now to be told that to continue to pay for unnecessary wars we must cut out things for Americans such as education, medical care, housing, scientific research, and things such as finding cures for cancer, Alzheimer's, repairing our aging bridges, roads--even hearing a Member of the other body saying: We cannot respond to the tragedies caused by Irene in the distinguished Presiding Officer's home State, mine and others, unless we take the money from other needs in this country. Yet that same Member supported an unnecessary war in Iraq and supports paying for it on the credit card. Come on. Let's be real. Let's start thinking about things in America.
