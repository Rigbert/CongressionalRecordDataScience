 President, I am very pleased to see that a bill has been introduced to repeal the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 [PUHCA]. PUHCA has long since outlived its usefulness. It has become duplicative with other regulation, both at the Federal and State levels. The utility industry, both gas and electric, has changed dramatically since PUHCA was first enacted, and particularly the new competitive pressures and State regulation that now exists, makes PUHCA unnecessary. I thank Chairman D'Amato and my colleagues on the Banking Committee, and the Securities and Exchanges Commission [SEC], which has recommended repeal, for their diligence in bringing this legislation before us.  While the utility industry is changing, there are some who argue that any action on the repeal of PUHCA must be tied to broader changes in the structure of the electric utility industry. I do not accept or support that position, but rather believe that PUHCA can and should be repealed while the debate on the other broader issues matures. The SEC first recommended repeal of PUHCA in 1982, and have more recently, in June, called again for the antiquated law's repeal. We should act accordingly.                          ____________________
