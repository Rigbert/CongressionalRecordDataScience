 President, I would like to discuss an important issue that should be addressed by House and Senate conferees meeting to resolve differences regarding the Higher Education Reauthorization Act.  Various institutions of higher education have tried for a number of years to have the Age Discrimination in Employment Act amended to allow certain types of early retirement plans for tenured faculty. Various Members ofthis Body have traditionally viewed such an amendment with concern.  At the same time, some Members of this Body are concerned that potentially meritorious ADEA claims have faced statute of limitations problems based on the application of the Supreme Court decision in Lorance versus AT Technologies.  I understand there have been efforts to address these concerns, and I would like to pose a question to my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy. Senator Kennedy, is it your understanding that the House of Representatives has addressed one or both of these issues in its version of this bill?
