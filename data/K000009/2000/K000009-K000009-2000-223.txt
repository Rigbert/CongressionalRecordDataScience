Chairman, I wish to say I have the greatest respect in the world for the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), chairman of the full committee, and also the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Skeen), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies.  I would hope that, as we move toward conference, we might find some language that would achieve some of what we wish to have happen here, giving direction to the administration at a time in our country where the American people expect us to do more than dither here in the Nation's chief legislative body. I really think we have a reasonable direction here.  I thank the gentleman from Florida for permitting me to talk on this amendment. I will withdraw the amendment in hopes that, as we move toward conference, we might be able to find some reasonable course here to help America find a better way in this new century.
