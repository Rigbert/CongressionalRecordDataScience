  I always get a kick out of whenever there is a war, everyone tells us how much they love our soldiers and the veterans. But let us be clear. In the Republican budget and in Clinton's budget, we are talking about many billions of dollars in cutbacks for our veterans, many of the people who fought in World War II, they defeated Nazism, the VA needs more help, not less money.  Also we are talking about major, major cutbacks in student loans and in education. I know that Mr. Owens and his community are very concerned about the high cost of education. We want our people to get a college education. What does this budget do to the ability of your constituents and mine to get a college education?
