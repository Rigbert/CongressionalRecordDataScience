 In a region which struggles to produce a stable democracy, Ukraine is poised to become a shining example of a strong and viable democratic state. Upon establishment of its independence in 1991, Ukraine moved towards becoming a free society through the creation of democratic institutions and a fledgling market economy.  More recently, the Orange Revolution of 2004 showed the Ukrainian people's desire for a more open, free, and prosperous country--for a resolute democracy. Since its independence, Ukraine has been an ally of the United States. The signing of the United States-Ukraine Charter on Strategic Partnership in 2008 expands our already existing cooperation on defense, energy, democratic development, and cultural exchange.  However, obstacles exist which threaten to derail Ukraine's progress. The global financial crisis has taken a harsh toll on the country, causing the government to seek international assistance. Ukraine must take the difficult internal steps necessary to maintain her financial independence, to ensure that she is not beholden to outside financial institutions and interests.  It is imperative to the future of Ukraine that this month's elections be free, fair, and transparent. Without elections that accurately express the will of the people, Ukraine's democracy cannot, and will not, achieve its full potential.  Given the determination of Ukraine to maintain itself as a democratic nation, it is more important now than ever for the United States to support Ukraine's continued political and economic development.  We stand by Ukraine as she continues her endeavor to become a standard bearer for democracy. In strong support of Ukraine and her people, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this resolution.
