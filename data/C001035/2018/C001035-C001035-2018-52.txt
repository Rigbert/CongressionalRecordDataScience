President, I rise to speak on my resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Purple Heart Recognition Day. I am pleased to have been joined in sponsoring this resolution by the senior senator from West Virginia, Senator Manchin, and 22 of our Senate colleagues.  The Purple Heart's history goes as far back as the founding of our Nation. General George Washington established what is now known as the Purple Heart Medal when he issued an order establishing the Military Badge of Merit on August 7, 1782. General Washington wished for the award to be used to recognize meritorious action performed by members of the Continental Army, and it took the form of a purple heart.  The Military Badge of Merit was discontinued after the Revolution and was not revived until 1932, when the Purple Heart medal was authorized as its official successor decoration. On February 22, 1932, the 200th Anniversary of the birth of George Washington, then-Army Chief of Staff General Douglas MacArthur resurrected the award, and it was re-designated as the Purple Heart. Quite appropriately, this reestablished Purple Heart Medal exhibits the bust and profile of George Washington.  It is around this time that the Purple Heart became synonymous with those unfortunate heroes who were killed or wounded in combat. Since 1932, the U.S. Military has awarded more than 1.8 million Purple Hearts.  Just as the Purple Heart Medal has held a special meaning to its millions of recipients and their families, it also has special significance to me and my family. My father, who died earlier this year, was a proud World War II veteran who was wounded twice during the Battle of the Bulge. He earned two Purple Hearts and the Bronze Star, and it was from him that I first learned to honor and respect our veterans.  Mr. President, the Purple Heart is a reminder that freedom is a gift purchased at the greatest possible price, and it is for that reason that I am sponsoring this resolution supporting the goals and ideals of National Purple Heart Recognition Day. I believe it is vitally important for all Americans to learn the history of this important military award, and to understand and honor the sacrifices of the many men and women in uniform who have earned the Purple Heart. I am grateful to all of my colleagues who have joined me in supporting this important resolution.                          ____________________
