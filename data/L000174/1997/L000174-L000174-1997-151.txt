I cannot quite say it--I cannot quite say it like my good friend from South Carolina. He is the only person I know who can get five syllables in the word ``zero,'' but zero. It was 100 to nothing; 100 to nothing.  But what we have is, while the Judicial Conference, Chief Justice Rehnquist was asking for more justices, we have 27 vacancies in the court of appeals. We have all kinds of problems. And the ninth circuit is notgoing to be helped by politicizing it on an appropriations bill.  The ninth circuit can at least be helped by doing what the Senator from California said, have a nonpartisan professional panel look, make a recommendation, go to the Senate Judiciary Committee, vote it up or down, which is exactly what we should be doing on these judges. If we do not want them, vote them down.  But what we have is always some mysterious person who has a problem. But when we have to vote in the light of day, there is no mysterious person at all because they vote for them. So, Mr. President, I know there are others who wish to speak.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter be printed in the Record addressed to Majority Leader Lott from all the leaders of seven national legal groups, asking him to finally move these judges that are being held hostage.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     American Bar Association,                                                    July 14, 1997.     Hon. William J. Clinton,     The President, The White House,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Trent Lott,     The Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President and Mr. Majority Leader: Among the      constitutional responsibilities entrusted to the President      and the Senate, none is more essential to the foundation upon      which our democracy rests than the appointment of justices      and judges to serve at all levels of the federal bench.      Notwithstanding the intensely political nature of the      process, historically this critical duty has been carried out      with bipartisan cooperation to ensure a highly qualified and      effective federal judiciary.       There is a looming crisis in the Nation brought on by the      extraordinary number of vacant federal judicial positions and      the resulting problems that are associated with delayed      judicial appointments. There are 102 pending judicial      vacancies, or 11% of the number of authorized judicial      positions. A record 24 of these Article III positions have      been vacant for more than 18 months. Those courts hardest hit      are among the nation's busiest; for example, the Ninth      Circuit Court of Appeals has 9 of its 28 positions vacant. At      the district court level, six states have unusually high      vacancy rates: 10 in California, 8 in Pennsylvania, 6 in New      York, 5 in Illinois, and 4 each in Texas and Louisiana.       The injustice of this situation for all of society cannot      be overstated. Dangerously crowded dockets, suspended civil      case dockets, burgeoning criminal caseloads, overburdened      judges, and chronically undermanned courts undermine our      democracy and respect for the supremacy of law.       We, the undersigned representatives of national legal      organizations, call upon the President and the Senate to      devote the time and resources necessary to expedite the      selection and confirmation process for federal judicial      nominees. We respectfully urge all participants in the      process to move quickly to resolve the issues that have      resulted in these numerous and longstanding vacancies in      order to preserve the integrity of our justice system.         N. Lee Cooper, President, American Bar Association; U.            Lawrence Boze, President, National Bar Association;            Hugo Chavaino, President, Hispanic National Bar            Association; Paul Chan, President, National Asian            Pacific American Bar Association; Howard Twiggs,            President, Association of Trial Lawyers of America;            Sally Lee Foley, President, National Association of            Women Lawyers; Juliet Gee, President, National            Conference of Women's Bar Association.
