 I ask the Senator from Nevada: Did the Senator from Nevada not ask unanimous consent to extend the PATRIOT Act as written for 3 months, and is it not true that when you made that request a few days ago, the Republican leader of the Senate objected to extending the PATRIOT Act for 3 months, after the revision of the law was held up here on the Senate floor?
