Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of George Davis; a friend, an honorable leader, and a valued member of our Toledo community.  George Davis was born in Toledo, Ohio on July 11, 1927 to Polly Ann and George Davis. He grew up on Scott Street and from the age of 6 sold newspapers and did odd jobs to help his family in the Depression.  He was a Scott High School student when he went to work at Willys-Overland Motors at the age of 15. He retired in 1993 as a representative for Local 12, United Auto Workers. George was a veteran of the Army Air Corps.  George Davis became the first African-American appointed as a union steward and served as chairman of the Jeep unit. He sat on the Jeep executive committee and, when the former American Motors Corporation owned the Toledo plant, George was a leader in a UAW intracorporate council. When he retired, he was on the state board of UAW's Community Action Program.  George Davis served the Toledo Branch, NAACP, as the President, first vice president, chairman of committees and as a nuts-and-bolts member. In 2012 he was among the honorees recognized at an annual luncheon of the African American Legacy Project of Northwest Ohio.  George Davis is survived by his sons, George III, Larry, Calvin and Norman; stepdaughters Helen and Patricia Webb; stepsons Walter Webb III and Robert Webb; four grandchildren; three great-grandchildren, as well as step-grandchildren and step-great-grandchildren. His wife of 25 years, Gladys, died in 2002.  George Davis was a great leader in all realms--his family, his church, his chosen profession as a union officer, his civil rights advocacy, and as a valued community leader whose opinion was sought and appreciated. He was blessed with an exceptional mind and an exceptional instinct. He knew how to read people, how to anticipate them, and how to counsel them. He had a gift for politics in the best sense. His goals were to serve people and to take their cause to those who could make a difference. And he did. He was an honorable leader, an indefatigable ally, and a courageous and unyielding advocate for people whose voices needed uplifting. He had a God given talent to accomplish good works, and he did.  George Davis led our community to a better place every day of his working life, which extended to the day of his homegoing. May God bless him and bring peace to his family and friends as they bear this enormous loss. And may George Davis' precious talents, good nature, and unyielding spirit carry his legacy forward and inspire others to emulate his life.                          ____________________
