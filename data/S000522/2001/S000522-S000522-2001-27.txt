Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as chairman of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am very proud and happy to bring to the floor H.R. 1291, as amended, the Veterans Education and Benefits Expansion Act of 2001.                              {time}  1645  Mr. Speaker, this bill is derived from measures which the House approved overwhelmingly earlier this year: H.R. 801, the Veterans Opportunities Act of 2001; H.R. 1291, the 21st Century Montgomery G.I. Bill Enhancement Act; H.R. 2540, the Veterans Benefits Act of 2001. It also includes a number of provisions contained in S. 1088, the Benefits Veterans Improvement Act of 2001.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans); former chairman of the Subcommittee on Benefits, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Hayworth); the ranking member, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Reyes); and the current subcommittee chairman, the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson), for working with me in crafting these bills.  Little did we know last spring what terrorists would do to America on September 11. Although our resolve was already firm, the events of September 11 have heightened the Nation's concern that we provide adequate benefits for those who serve in our Nation's Armed Forces. I am proud that we have been able to respond so positively to their concerns.  We had two goals in mind, Mr. Speaker, when we were preparing these bills. The first goal was to continue our Nation's commitment to those veterans who have already been in harm's way in past wars and conflicts.  Second, we wanted to create a level playing field for the generation of veterans who protect our freedoms now and into the future.  Our bipartisan legislation carried out these two broad goals in three primary ways: first, through improvements in the Montgomery G.I. bill and other VA education programs, so as to position our returning service members for long-term, sustained employment; second, through improvements in VA programs for disabled veterans and their widows and orphans, so as to honor our commitment to them; and third, by building on former Under Secretary Joe Thompson's initiatives to reach out to America's sons and daughters before, rather than after, they leave the military to ease their transition to civilian life.  Mr. Speaker, with respect to veterans education, I am pleased that the compromise agreement contains no less than 11 provisions to improve the Montgomery G.I. bill and other VA education programs. Under current law, a full-time veteran-student receives $672 monthly under the Montgomery G.I. bill, from which the veteran-student pays the tuitions, books, supplies, fees, and subsistence, including housing, food, and transportation.  H.R. 1291, as amended, would increase the $672 monthly amount to $800 per month effective this January; to $900, effective October 1 of 2002; and to $985 per month effective October 1, 2003. Mr. Speaker, this represents a 52 percent increase in the monthly benefit, phased in over 3 years.  According to data furnished by the College Board this spring, the monthly G.I. bill benefit would have had to rise to $1,025 per month for a veteran-student to attend a 4-year student as a commuter student at an average cost of $9,229 per year. This figure includes tuition, fees, and living expenses.  Veteran students are highly engaging and resourceful individuals, but the $1,025 per month figure has been shown to be woefully inadequate and that the Montgomery G.I. bill just simply did not cover those costs. That is what we are trying to rectify with this legislation.  Frankly, we should not be surprised, Mr. Speaker, that only about half of the eligible veterans for the Montgomery G.I. bill have used it since 1985, one of the main reasons being the lack of funding in the actual benefit provided.  The bill also builds on the wisdom and foresight of former chairmanSonny Montgomery, who, back in 1980, understood the linkage between the success of an all-volunteer force and a sound educational incentive to recruit high-quality individuals. Serving one's country literally has taken on a new meaning since September 11. Now more than ever we need a new G.I. bill that does reflect the selflessness of our service members who are putting their lives on the line to ferret out and to eliminate terrorism. This bill goes a long way to closing the gap between school costs and benefits.  The compromise agreement also contains nine provisions that make improvements in VA programs benefiting disabled veterans and their dependents and keeps our commitments to veterans who suffer from chronic illnesses subsequent to their service during the Persian Gulf War.  Effective April 1, 2002, the bill revises the definition of ``undiagnosed illnesses'' for Persian Gulf War veterans to include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome and chronic multisyndrome illnesses, and other illnesses that cannot be clearly defined.  I thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans), the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis), the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Buyer), the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Gibbons), and the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Manzullo) for their leadership on this particular provision.  This bill keeps America's promise to disabled veterans by increasing specially adapted housing allowances for severely disabled veterans from $43,000 to $48,000 per year; increases the automobile and adaptive equipment grant for severely disabled veterans from $8,000 to $9,000; increases the payments for burial and funeral expenses for service-connected veterans from $1,500 to $2,000; and increases the burial plot allowance for eligible veterans from $150 to $300.  Lastly, the measure makes the second improvement in as many years for spouses of children of 100 percent service-connected disabled veterans or their survivors of veterans who die from their service-connected disability. The monthly education benefit would increase from $588 per month to $670 per month.  Lastly, following the recommendations of the congressional Veterans Claim Adjudication Commission and the congressional Commission on Service Members and Veterans Transition Assistance, the bill gives the VA greater authority to reach out to those service members defending our freedom around the world before they leave the military.  The VA will now have the authority to create regional offices overseas, thus creating a vision for a world-class worldwide organization. And the Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Labor will be able to make transition counseling available to first-time service members as early as 12 months before separation and 24 months prior to separation for retirees.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the Explanatory Statement on the House Amendment. Explanatory Statement on House Amendment to Senate Amendments to H.R.                                   1291       The House amendment to the Senate amendments to H.R. 1291      reflect a compromise agreement that the House and Senate      Committees on Veterans' Affairs have reached on H.R. 801,      H.R. 1291, H.R. 2540, H.R. 3240, and S. 1088. H.R. 801 passed      the House on March 27, 2001. H.R. 1291 passed the House on      June 19, 2001. H.R. 2540 passed the House on July 31, 2001.      H.R. 3240 passed the House on November 13, 2001. The Senate      considered S. 1088 (hereinafter known as the ``Senate bill'')      on December 7, 2001. This measure was incorporated in H.R.      1291 as an amendment and passed the Senate by unanimous      consent on December 7, 2001.       The House and Senate Committees on Veterans' Affairs have      prepared the following explanation of H.R. 1291, as amended,      (hereinafter referred to as the ``Compromise Agreement'').      Differences between the provisions contained in the      Compromise Agreement and the related provisions of H.R. 801,      H.R. 1291, H.R. 2540, H.R. 3240, and S. 1088 are noted in      this document, except for clerical corrections, conforming      changes made necessary by the Compromise Agreement, and minor      drafting, technical, and clarifying changes.               TITLE I--EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE PROVISIONSINCREASES IN RATES OF BASIC EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE UNDER THE MONTGOMERY                                 GI BILL     Current Law       Section 3011 of title 38, United States Code, establishes      basic educational assistance entitlement under the All-     Volunteer Force Educational Assistance Program, commonly      referred to as the Montgomery GI Bill or MGIB--Active Duty      program. Section 3015 establishes the base amount of such      educational assistance at the monthly rate of $528 for a 3-     year period of service and $429 for a 2-year period of      service. These amounts increased to $650 per month and $528      per month, respectively, on November 1, 2000. With the      addition of a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) on October 1,      2001, the rates are $672 and $546, respectively.     House Bill       Section 2(a)(1) of H.R. 1291 would amend section 3015(a)(1)      to increase the amount of educational benefits under the      Montgomery GI Bill for an approved program of education on a      full-time basis from the current monthly rate of $650 ($672      with COLA) for an obligated period of active duty of 3 or      more years to $800 effective October 1, 2001, $950 effective      October 1, 2002, and $1,100 effective October 1, 2003.       Section 2(a)(2) of H.R. 1291 would amend section 3015(b)(1)      of title 38, United States Code, to increase the amount of      educational benefits for an obligated period of active duty      of 2 years from the current monthly rate of $528 ($546 with      COLA) to $650 effective October 1, 2001, $772 effective      October 1, 2002, and $894 effective October 1, 2003.       Section 2(b) of H.R. 1291 would suspend the statutory      annual adjustment in MGIB rates based on the Consumer Price      Index beginning in fiscal year 2002 and reinstate that      adjustment beginning in fiscal year 2005.     Senate Bill       Section 101 of the Senate bill would increase the amount of      educational benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill for      veterans whose original service obligation was 3 or more      years to $700 in fiscal year 2002, $800 in fiscal year 2003,      and $950 in fiscal year 2004. For veterans whose original      service obligation was 2 years, the monthly educational      benefit would be increased to $569 in fiscal year 2002, $650      in fiscal year 2003, and $772 in fiscal year 2004.     Compromise Agreement       Section 101 of the compromise agreement would increase the      amount of educational benefits under the Montgomery GI Bill      for an obligated period of active duty of 3 or more years to      $800 effective January 1, 2002; $900 effective October 1,      2002; and $985 effective October 1, 2003. For service      obligation of 2 years, increases are to $650 effective      January 1, 2002; $732 effective October 1, 2002; and $800      effective October 1, 2003. The COLA is suspended for Fiscal      Years 2003 and 2004. INCREASE IN RATES OF SURVIVORS' AND DEPENDENTS' EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE     Current Law       Chapter 35 of title 38, United States Code, provides      educational assistance to spouses and dependent children of      veterans who are totally disabled or who die as a result of a      service-connected condition. Eligible persons are paid at a      monthly rate of $588, $441, and $294, respectively, for full,      three-quarter, and half-time studies. The cost-of-living      adjustment (COLA) furnished on October 1, 2001, increased      these rates to $608, $456, and $304, respectively.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 106 of the Senate bill would increase the monthly      amount of education benefits provided under chapter 35 of      title 38, United States Code, for full-time students from      $588 ($608 with the COLA) to $690, from $441 ($456 of COLA)      to $517 for three-quarter time students, and from $294 ($306      with the COLA) to $345 for half-time students (rates in      current law after cost-of-living adjustment). These      increases would take effect October 1, 2001.     Compromise Agreement       Section 102 of the compromise agreement would follow the      language of the Senate bill, except that it would increase      the monthly amount of education benefits provided to full-     time students in traditional education programs, training in      business or industry, correspondence courses or special      restorative training from $608 to $670 on January 1, 2002.      The compromise agreement would also include increases for on-     job training, apprenticeship, and farm cooperative programs.RESTORATION OF CERTAIN EDUCATION BENEFITS OF INDIVIDUALS BEING ORDERED                              TO ACTIVE DUTY     Current Law       Sections 3013(f)(2), 3231(a)(5), and 3511(a)(2)(B)(i) of      title 38, United States Code, provide that no educational      allowance paid to servicemembers, reservists, or eligible      dependents shall be counted against the total length or      amount of their education entitlement if the pursuit of an      educational objective was interrupted as a result of being      ordered to serve in connection with the Persian Gulf War.     House Bill       H.R. 3240 would restore entitlement under the Montgomery GI      Bill (MGIB), Veterans' Educational Assistance Program (VEAP),      and Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance program      (DEA) for any servicemembers, reservists, or DEA recipients      called to active duty during Operation Enduring Freedom and      at any time in the future.     Senate Bill       Section 105 of the Senate bill would restore entitlement      under the MGIB, VEAP, and     Survivor's and DEA programs for any servicemembers,      reservists, or DEA recipients called to active duty in      connection with the National Emergency declared by the      Presidential Proclamation dated September 14, 2001.     Compromise Bill       Section 103 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language and adds entitlement restoration for persons      pursuing education or training under chapter 31 of title 38,      United States Code. Further, the period during which the      person may use his or her educational benefits under chapters      31 or 35 would be the period equal to the length of active      service for which the person is recalled, plus four months.ACCELERATED PAYMENTS OF EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE UNDER MONTGOMERY GI BILL     FOR EDUCATION LEADING TO EMPLOYMENT IN HIGH TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY     Current Law       Section 3014 of title 38, United States Code, provides that      the basic educational benefit available under the Montgomery      GI Bill be disbursed in up to 36 monthly installments.      Benefits are provided for each month in which the MGIB      participant is certified to be participating in a course of      study. If requested by a veteran, section 3680(d)(2) of title      38, United States Code, allows for an advance payment of      educational assistance in an amount equivalent to the      allowance for the month, or fraction thereof, in which      pursuit of an education program will commence, plus the      allowance for the succeeding month. This payment structure is      geared primarily toward the pursuit of traditional two- and      four-year degrees.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 103 of the Senate bill would further expand the      Montgomery GI Bill benefit to accommodate a compressed      schedule of courses leading to employment in a high      technology industry by authorizing accelerated payment      covering up to 60% of the cost of a high technology course,      provided the cost of such course exceeds 200% of the monthly      MGIB rate. This lump sum would be deducted from the veteran's      remaining MGIB entitlement.     Compromise Agreement       Section 104 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate      language, effective October 1, 2002.   ELIGIBILITY FOR MONTGOMERY GI BILL BENEFITS OF CERTAIN ADDITIONAL                           VIETNAM-ERA VETERANS     Current Law       Section 3011 of title 38, United States Code, provides that      a Vietnam-era veteran may convert his or her Vietnam-era GI      Bill benefit to the Montgomery GI Bill educational benefit,      if the veteran had eligibility for Vietnam-era GI Bill      benefits as of December 31, 1989, was on active duty on      October 19, 1984, and served 3 continuous years after June      30, 1985.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 104 of the Senate bill would enable Vietnam-era      veterans to convert their Vietnam-era GI Bill benefits to      Montgomery GI Bill benefits if the veteran had eligibility      for the Vietnam-era GI Bill benefits as of December 31, 1989,      was not on active duty on October 19, 1984, and served 3      continuous years in the Armed Forces on or after July 1,      1985.     Compromise Agreement       Section 105 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate      language.  increase in maximum allowable annual rotc award for eligibility for                  benefits under the montgomery gi bill     Current Law       Sections 3011(c)(3)(B) and 3012(d)(3)(B) of title 38,      United States Code, provide that $2,000 is the maximum annual      amount of a partial scholarship that a participant in the      Senior Reserve Officers' Training Corps (SROTC) may receive      and still be eligible for basic educational assistance      entitlement for service on active duty under the Montgomery      GI Bill educational assistance program.     House Bill       Section 101 of H.R. 801 would increase from $2,000 to      $3,400 per year the amount a student under SROTC may receive      in scholarship assistance and still retain eligibility for      the Montgomery GI Bill--Active Duty under chapter 30, of      title 38, United States Code.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 106 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language.                 expansion of work-study opportunities     Current Law       Section 3485(a)(1) of title 38, United States Code,      establishes work-study policies for veteran-students and      eligible dependents. In general, VA work-study students may      prepare or process VA paperwork at schools or VA facilities,      provide care at VA hospitals and domiciliaries, or work at      Department of Defense facilities in certain circumstances.     House Bill       Section 102 of H.R. 801 would expand work-study      opportunities for veteran-students and eligible dependents to      include: outreach services furnished by State Approving      Agencies to servicemembers and veterans; activities for      veteran-students and/or dependents (who have declared an      academic major) within the department of an academic      discipline that complements and reinforces the program of      education pursued by the veteran-student; and the provision      of chapter 17 of title 38, United States Code, domiciliary      care and nursing home and hospital care to veterans,      including state veterans homes.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 107 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language but excludes work-study opportunities within the      department of the veteran-student's academic discipline, and      adds additional work-study opportunities through national and      state veterans cemeteries.   eligibility for survivors' and dependents' educational assistance    benefits of spouses and surviving spouses of veterans with total                      service-connected disabilities     Current Law       Spouses of veterans who die of service-connected      conditions, who are rated as totally and permanently      disabled, or who die while rated as totally and permanently      disabled, are eligible for Survivors' and Dependents'      Educational Assistance (DEA) benefits. Prior to Ozer v.      Principi, a 2001 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for      Veterans Claims, 14 Vet. App. 257 (2001), VA applied a 10-     year delimiting period during which spouses were eligible to      use their DEA benefits. VA had been following regulations      stating that the 10-year delimiting period began when      eligibility is first established. However, the statute which      authorized the DEA regulations prescribed that a spouse may      not receive educational assistance beyond 10 years after the      last occurrence of three eligibility criteria, one of which      is the veteran's death. In its Ozer decision, the Court      invalidated the VA regulation, reasoning that the delimiting      period established by VA was in conflict with the authorizing      statute.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 107 of the Senate bill would reinstate a 10-year      delimiting period in which spouses may, upon first becoming      eligible, use DEA benefits. Spouses made eligible for DEA      under more than one of the eligibility criteria would have      two separate 10-year delimiting periods in which to use      their DEA benefits, but in no case would their aggregate      entitlement exceed 45 months.     Compromise Agreement       Section 108 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate      language. expansion of special restorative training benefit to certain disabled                       spouses or surviving spouses     Current Law       Section 3541 of title 38, United States Code, provides that      eligible children entitled to assistance under the Survivors'      and Dependents' Educational Assistance program of chapter 35      may receive special restorative training to overcome or      lessen the effects of a physical or mental disability and      enable them to undertake a program of education.     House Bill       Section 104 of H.R. 801 would expand the special      restorative training benefit provided under the chapter 35      program to include certain disabled spouses or surviving      spouses.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 109 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language. inclusion of certain private technology entities in the definition of                         educational institution     Current Law       Section 3452(c) of title 38, United States Code, defines      ``educational institution'' as any public or private      elementary school, secondary school, vocational school,      correspondence school, business school, junior college,      teachers' college, college, normal school, professional      school, university, scientific or technical institution      furnishing education for adults. Section 3501(a)(6) of title      38, United States Code, uses a substantively identical      definition with the addition of any other institution if it      furnishes education at the secondary school level or above.     House Bill       Section 103 of H.R. 801 would expand the definition of an      educational institution to include any private entity that      offers, either directly or under an agreement with another      entity, a course or courses to fulfill a requirement for the      attainment of a license or certificate generally recognized      as necessary to obtain, maintain, or advance in employment in      a profession or vocation in a technological occupation, as      determined by the Secretary.     Senate Bill       Section 105 of the Senate bill contains a substantively      identical provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 110 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate      language.                           distance education     Current Law       Section 3680A(a)(4) of title 38, United States Code, limits      the enrollment of an eligible veteran to an accredited      independent study program (including open circuit television)      leading to a standard college degree.     House Bill       Section 105 of H.R. 801 would permit eligible veterans to      receive VA education benefits while pursuing non college-     degree courses that are offered through independent study by      institutions of higher learning.     Senate bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 111 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language.             TITLE II--COMPENSATION AND PENSION PROVISIONS  modification and extension of authorities on presumption of service- connection for herbicide-related disabilities of vietnam-era veterans     Current Law       Under section 1116(a)(2)(F) of title 38, the presumption of      service-connection with respect to respiratory cancers is      limited to those cancers manifesting within 30 years of a      servicemember's last active-duty date in Vietnam.       The CAVC decision in McCartt v. West, 12 Vet. App. 164      (1999) held that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) can      only presume exposure to Agent Orange if the Vietnam veteran      has one of the diseases listed as related to such exposure in      38 U.S.C. Sec. 1116(a) or 38 C.F.R. Sec. 3.309(e). VA      practice prior to this decision had been to presume exposure      for anyone who had served in Vietnam during the      statutorily defined period of war unless there was      affirmative evidence to the contrary.       Section 1116 authorizes the Secretary of Veterans' Affairs      to establish, through regulation, a presumption of service-     connection for diseases associated with exposure to Agent      Orange. The Secretary is further authorized to contract with      the National Academy of Sciences for the purposes of studying      the effects of dioxin, and is required to base the      establishment of a presumption of service-connection on NAS      findings. This authority commenced in 1993 and will expire at      the end of Fiscal Year 2003.     House Bill       Section 201 of H.R. 2540 codifies VA's July 9, 2001,      regulation providing benefits for Vietnam veterans with Type      2 diabetes.     Senate Bill       Section 201 of the Senate bill would remove the 30-year      limitation on the manifestation of respiratory cancer. This      section would also change the result of the CAVC decision in      McCartt by requiring VA to presume exposure to Agent Orange      for all persons serving in Vietnam during the statutorily      defined period of that conflict.       Section 201 would extend the Secretary's authority to      determine a presumption of service-connection for additional      diseases, based on future NAS Reports, through 2011. VA's      authority to contract with the NAS to review scientific      evidence on the effects of dioxin or herbicide exposure would      be extended through 2011.     Compromise Agreement       Section 201(a)(1) of the compromise agreement follows the      Senate language, but modifies the effective date for      subsection (a) of the Senate bill to January 1, 2002. Section      201(a)(2) of the compromise directs the Secretary to enter      into a contract with the National Academy of Sciences      specifically to review available scientific literature on      exposure to herbicides and dioxin and the development of      respiratory cancers. Section 201(a)(3) allows the Secretary      to consider whether an upper limit on manifestation of      respiratory cancers can be supported, and to impose such a      limit by regulation if warranted, by available scientific      evidence. Section 201(4) protects a grant of service-     connection made under this section for purposes of all      benefits administered by the Secretary; section 201(b) of the      compromise agreement provides a statutory presumption of      service-connection of Diabetes Type 2 for veterans exposed to      Agent Orange and follows the House language; section 201(c)      of the compromise agreement presumes that veterans who served      in the Republic of Vietnam during the time period when      herbicides were used were exposed to herbicides and follows      the Senate language; and section 201(d) of the compromise      agreement extends the Secretary's authority to contract with      NAS through October 1, 2014, and extends the Secretary's      authority to determine a presumption of service-connection      through September 30, 2015.  PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION FOR PERSIAN GULF WAR VETERANS WITH CERTAIN                           CHRONIC DISABILITIES     Current Law       Public Law 103-446 gave the Secretary the authority to      compensate a Gulf War veteran who suffers from disabilities      that cannot be diagnosed or clearly defined, when other      causes cannot be identified. Section 1117 of title 38, United      States Code, sets forth parameters for compensating      disabilities occurring in Gulf War veterans.     House Bill       Section 202 of H.R. 2540 would expand, effective April 1,      2002, the definition of ``undiagnosed illness'' for Gulf War      veterans to include fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome,      and chronic multisymptom illness, as well as other illnesses      that cannot be clearly defined. Signs and symptoms listed in      the House bill that are associated with an undiagnosed      illness include headache, muscle pain, joint pain, neurologic      signs or symptoms, neuropsychological signs or symptoms,      signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or      lower), sleep disturbances, gastrointestinal signs or      symptoms, cardiovascular signs or symptoms, abnormal weight      loss, and/or menstrual disorders.     Senate Bill       Section 202(b) of the Senate bill would expand the      definition of ``undiagnosed illness'' by adding poorly      defined chronic multisymptom illnesses of unknown etiology,      regardless of diagnosis, characterized by two or more of the      symptoms already listed in VA regulations. This section would      also extend the presumptive period for service connection for      Gulf War veterans by 10 years.     Compromise Agreement       Section 202 of the compromise agreement authorizes the      Secretary effective March 1, 2002, to pay compensation to any      eligible Gulf War veteran chronically disabled by an      ``undiagnosed illness,'' a ``medically unexplained chronic      multisymptom illness defined by a cluster of signs or      symptoms,'' or ``any diagnosed illness that the Secretary      determines in regulations prescribed under subsection (d)      warrants a presumption of service-connection'' (or any      combination of these). The term ``undiagnosed illnesses'' has      been interpreted by VA to preclude from eligibility for      benefits under section 1117 or 1118 of title 38, United      States Code, any veteran who has received a diagnosis, even      if that diagnosis is merely a descriptive label for a      collection of unexplained symptoms. This provision's addition      of ``medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness      defined by a cluster of signs or symptoms'' to the list of      compensable conditions fully implements the intent of Public      Law 103-446. Public Law 103-446 authorized the Secretary to      compensate certain Gulf War veterans disabled by symptoms      that could not be connected conclusively to specific wartime      exposures otherwise not compensable under other existing      statutory bases.       In selecting this language, it is the intent of the      Committees to ensure eligibility for chronically disabled      Gulf War veterans not withstanding a diagnostic label by a      clinician in the absence of conclusive pathophysiology or      etiology. The compromise agreement's definition encompasses a      variety of unexplained clinical conditions, characterized by      overlapping symptoms and signs, that share features such as      fatigue, pain, disability out of proportion to physical      findings, and inconsistent demonstration of laboratory      abnormalities. Aaron and Buchwald, A Review of the Evidence      for Overlap Among Unexplained Clinical Conditions, 134(9)      Annals of Internal Med: 868-880 (2001). Although chronic      fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, and irritable bowel syndrome      are the most common diagnoses under this definition, other      conditions that may be characterized similarly include other      chronic musculoskeletal pain disorders and chronic headache      disorders.       By listing the first three diagnoses as examples, it is the      Committees' intent to give guidance to the Secretary rather      than to limit eligibility for compensation based upon other      similarly described conditions that may be defined or      redefined in the future. The Committees do not intend this      definition to assert that the cited syndromes can be      clinically or scientifically linked to Gulf War service based      on current evidence, nor do they intend to include chronic      multisymptom illnesses of partially understood etiology and      pathophysiology such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis.       In evaluating chronic multisymptom illnesses, the      Committees expect that VA will develop a schedule for rating      disabilities based on severity of symptoms and the degree to      which these impair a veteran's ability to obtain and retain      substantially gainful employment. The ratings schedule      already established by VA in section 4.88b of 38 CFR (6354)      for chronic fatigue syndrome bases the degree of disability      on the veteran's incapacitation rather than specific medical      findings. This schedule can be used as a model for rating      disabilities stemming from chronic multisymptom illnesses in      general.       The compromise agreement includes a technical correction      substituting a date certain of October 1, 2010, for ``10      years after the last day of the fiscal year in which the      National Academy of Sciences (NAS) submits the first report''      as written under current law in section 1603(j) of the      Persian Gulf War Veterans Act of 1998. This provision      requires the Secretary to contract with the NAS for five      biennial reports on Gulf War health issues. The compromise      also amends sections 1117 and 1118 of title 38, United States      Code, to clarify that the authority of the Secretary to      determine that a disease warrants presumptive service-     connection based on these NAS reports continuing through      September 30, 2011.PRESERVATION OF SERVICE CONNECTION FOR UNDIAGNOSED ILLNESSES TO PROVIDE       FOR PARTICIPATION IN RESEARCH PROJECTS BY GULF WAR VETERANS     Current Law       Under current law, the Secretary does not have specific      authority to protect a Persian Gulf War veteran's grant of      service connection for an undiagnosed illness if, as a result      of participating in a medical research study, the condition      is diagnosed.     House Bill       Section 203 of H.R. 2540 would authorize the Secretary to      protect the grant of service connection for an undiagnosed      illness when a Persian Gulf War veteran participates in a VA-     sponsored medical research project. The Secretary would be      required to publish in the Federal Register any medical      research project whose participants would be protected under      this section. The Secretary's authority extends to research      projects commenced before, on or after date of enactment.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 203 of the compromise agreement protects veterans      participating in medical research projects sponsored by the      Department from loss of service-connection if the Secretary      determines that such protection is necessary for conduct of      the medical research. The Secretary is required to publish in      the Federal Register a list of medical research projects      sponsored by the Department for which service-connection is      protected under this section.    REPEAL OF THE LIMITATION ON PAYMENTS OF BENEFITS TO INCOMPETENT                                 VETERANS     Current Law       Subsections (b) and (c) of section 5503 of title 38, United      States Code, establishes that compensation and pension      benefits cannot be issued to an incompetent,      institutionalized veteran with no dependents whose assets      exceed five times the 100-percent compensation rate. Public      Law 106-419 raised the dollar amount of the cutoff from      $1,500 to its present level.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 209 of the Senate bill would repeal the asset      limitation on payment of benefits to incompetent      institutionalized veterans who have no dependents.     Compromise Agreement       Section 204 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate      language.  EXTENSION OF ROUND-DOWN REQUIREMENT FOR COMPENSATION COST-OF-LIVING                               ADJUSTMENTS     Current Law       Under sections 1104 and 1303 of title 38, United States      Code, the Secretary has the authority to round down to the      next lower whole dollar amount in the computation of cost-of-     living adjustments through fiscal year 2002.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 205 of the compromise agreement extends the      Secretary's authority to round down to the next lower whole      dollar amount the computation of cost-of-living adjustments      through Fiscal Year 2011.    EXPANSION OF PRESUMPTIONS OF PERMANENT AND TOTAL DISABILITY FOR            VETERANS APPLYING FOR NONSERVICE-CONNECTED PENSION     Current Law       Under section 1502(a) of title 38, United States Code,      applicants for nonservice-connected pensions are considered      to be totally and permanently disabled if they are      unemployable, unable to follow a gainful occupation, or      determined by the Secretary to be totally and permanently      disabled. It is the Committees' understanding that VA      regional office directors have been verbally instructed to      implement a policy of presuming permanent and total      disability for veterans who are patients in nursing homes for      long-term care, or veterans determined permanently disabled      by the Social Security Administration.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 203 of the Senate bill would presume that veterans      who are in nursing homes for long-term care; are determined      to be permanently disabled by the Social Security      Administration (SSA); are at least 65 years old and have no      current, recurring income from employment; or are      unemployable as a result of a disability reasonably certain      to continue throughout life, are permanently and totally      disabled for purposes of nonservice-connected pension. This      provision would be made retroactive to September 10, 2001.     Compromise Agreement       According to information provided to the Committees, VA has      recently instructed its employees to adjudicate pension      claims for veterans who are patients in long-term care      facilities or who have been determined to be permanently      disabled by the Social Security Administration without      requiring a VA determination of disability. The Committees      express their strong disapproval of the verbal manner in      which the policy changes concerning evaluation of disability      for patients in long-term care and those determined disabled      by SSA were implemented. Verbally advising VA regional office      directors to implement major policy changes without issuing      either formal regulations or written guidance invites      misinterpretation and confusion. The Committees strongly urge      the Secretary to communicate all interpretative changes to      policy in writing to appropriate officials, to make such      instructions available to the public, and to comply with the      notice and comment requirements of the Administrative      Procedures Act for all substantive rules.       Section 206(a)(1) of the compromise agreement provides      specific statutory authority for the evidentiary presumption      verbally communicated to regional office directors for      determining the eligibility of patients in a nursing home for      long-term care to be disabled for purposes of pension      benefits. The compromise agreement follows the Senate      language and provides for an effective date of September 17,      2001, the date VA regional offices are believed to have      implemented this policy.       Section 206(a)(2) of the compromise agreement provides that      persons who have been determined disabled by the Social      Security Administration (SSA) will be considered disabled for      purposes of pension benefits. Since the Committees believe      that a SSA disability determination is an appropriate      evidentiary basis for considering a veteran disabled, the      compromise agreement considers a veteran disabled if SSA has      made a determination of disability. The bill provides for an      effective date of September 17, 2001, the date VA regional      offices are believed to have implemented this policy.       Section 206(a)(3) of the compromise agreement provides that      a person shall be considered disabled if the veteran is      unemployable as a result of disability reasonably certain to      continue throughout the life of the person. The compromise      agreement follows the Senate language.       Section 206(a)(4) restates provisions currently contained      in section 1502(a)(1) and (2) of current law. The compromise      agreement follows the Senate language.ELIGIBILITY OF VETERANS 65 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER FOR VETERANS' PENSION                                 BENEFITS     Current Law       Public Law 90-77 provided that a veteran is presumed      disabled for purposes of pension benefits at age 65. Public      Law 101-508 revoked the Secretary's authority to presume that      a veteran was disabled for purposes of pension benefits at      age 65. Although the Secretary lacks statutory authority to      presume disability at age 65, it is the Committees'      understanding that VA regional office directors were      verbally instructed to implement a policy of presuming      disability for pension applicants aged 65 and older.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 203(a)(3) of the Senate bill would restore the      presumption of disability for purposes of pension eligibility      at age 65 for veterans who based on evidence available to the      Secretary have no current recurring income from employment.     Compromise Agreement       According to information provided to the Committees, VA has      recently instructed its employees to adjudicate pension      claims for veterans who are aged 65 or older and who have no      wages from employment without requiring a VA determination of      disability. The Committees express their strong disapproval      of the Secretary's decision to ignore the requirements of      Public Law 101-508 prohibiting a presumption of disability      for purposes of pension eligibility at age 65 by verbally      reinstating the policy. When the Secretary believes that      legislation passed by Congress and enacted into law is unwise      or administratively inefficient, it is the Secretary's      responsibility to propose appropriate legislation to the      Congress so that the problem identified can be corrected.      Verbally instructing VA regional office directors to ignore      statutory requirements and to presume that veterans are      disabled at age 65 without authorizing legislation violates      current law. The Committees expect the Secretary to advise      Congress of any statutory provisions, which in the judgment      of the Secretary are detrimental to caring for our Nation's      veterans, and to transmit appropriate corrective legislative      proposals for consideration.       Section 207 of the compromise agreement provides that a      pension will be provided to wartime veterans aged 65 and      older without regard to disability. These veterans must still      meet the nondisability requirements of section 1521 of title      38, United States Code, such as income and net worth. In      determining that benefits will be provided at age 65 without      regard to employment status, the Committees note that any      veteran employed full-time and receiving at least a minimum      wage would not qualify for pension based on the pension      income limitations.       Nonetheless, the Committees agree that a policy of      requiring proof of disability for an     aged wartime veteran with incomes below the pension benefit      amount involves use of scarce agency resources without a      commensurate return. The Committees have determined that aged      wartime veterans should be provided a needs-based pension      under conditions similar to that provided for veterans of the      Indian Wars and the Spanish-American War. The compromise      agreement renders a wartime veteran eligible for a needs-     based pension upon attaining age 65 effective September 17,      2001, the date VA regional offices are believed to have      implemented a policy of providing a presumption of disability      for wartime veterans aged 65 and older.             TITLE III--TRANSITION AND OUTREACH PROVISIONS AUTHORITY TO ESTABLISH OVERSEAS VETERANS ASSISTANCE OFFICES TO EXPAND                          TRANSITION ASSISTANCE     Current Law       Sections 7722, 7723 and 7724 of title 38, United States      Code, set forth VA's responsibilities with respect to      outreach services, including outreach provided to separating      servicemembers and eligible dependents. These sections do not      specifically provide for the establishment and maintenance of      veterans' assistance offices on military installations      outside of the United States, its territorial possessions, or      the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. Through a funding      arrangement with the Department of Defense, VA currently      assigns representatives overseas on a rotational basis in a      number of locations with large military populations.     House Bill       Section 201(a) of H.R. 801 would amend section 7723(a) of      title 38, United States Code, to give the Secretary specific      discretionary authority to establish veterans' assistance      offices on such military installations in other locations as      the Secretary determines necessary. In doing so, the      Secretary would be required to consult with the Secretary of      Defense.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 301 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language.                   TIMING OF PRESEPARATION COUNSELING     Current Law       The Departments of Defense, Veterans Affairs, and Labor      assist separating servicemembers with benefits and services      to facilitate a successful transition to civilian life.      Currently, section 1142(a)(1) of title 10, United States      Code, requires that pre-separation counseling begin not less      than 90 days prior to discharge or release.     House Bill       Section 202 of H.R. 801 would change the timing of      preseparation counseling to begin as soon as possible during      the 24-month period preceding an anticipated retirement and      as soon as possible during the 12-month period preceding      other separations, but in no event later than 90 days before      the date of discharge or release. In the case of an      unanticipated retirement or other separation with 90 days or      fewer prior to separation, preseparation counseling shall      begin as soon as possible within the remaining period of      service. Except in the case of a servicemember who is      being retired or separated for a disability, the Secretary      concerned would not be permitted to provide preseparation      counseling to a servicemember who is being discharged or      released before the completion of that servicemember's      first 180 days of active duty service.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 302 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language.IMPROVEMENT IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING OUTREACH SERVICES FOR SEPARATING                       SERVICEMEMBERS AND VETERANS     Current Law       Section 3672(d) of title 38, United States Code, requires      that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs actively promote the      development of programs for purposes of section 3677 (on the      job training) and section 3687 (apprenticeship or other on-     job training).     House Bill       Section 203 of H.R. 801 would require that State Approving      Agencies (SAA), in addition to the Secretary, actively      promote the development of VA programs of training on the job      (including programs of apprenticeship) under chapter 36 of      title 38, United States Code. Section 203 would also require      SAAs, in conjunction with outreach services furnished by the      Secretary for education and training benefits under chapter      77 of title 38, United States Code, to conduct outreach      programs and provide outreach services to eligible persons      and veterans about education and training benefits available      under applicable Federal and State law.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 303 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language.               IMPROVEMENT OF VETERANS OUTREACH PROGRAMS     Current Law       Section 7722(c) of title 38, United States Code requires      the Secretary to distribute full information to eligible      veterans and eligible dependents regarding all benefits and      services to which they may be entitled under laws      administered by the Department and may, to the extent      feasible, distribute information on other governmental      programs (including manpower and training programs) that the      Secretary determines would be beneficial to veterans.     House Bill       Section 205 of H.R. 801 would require VA, whenever a      veteran or dependent first applies for any benefit (including      a request for burial or related benefits or on application      for life insurance proceeds), to provide information      concerning all benefits and health services under programs      administered by the Secretary.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 304 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language with a modification that the Secretary provides the      information within 3 months of the veteran or dependent      making an initial contact with VA.                       TITLE IV--HOUSING MATTERS   INCREASE OF THE VA HOME LOAN GUARANTY AMOUNT FOR CONSTRUCTION AND                            PURCHASE OF HOMES     Current Law       Under section 3703 of title 38, United States Code, VA      currently provides a guaranty of up to $50,750 on home      mortgage loans issued to eligible veterans by private      lenders.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 301 of the Senate bill would increase the maximum      home mortgage loan guaranty amount to $63,175.     Compromise Agreement       Section 401 of the compromise agreement would increase the      maximum home mortgage loan guaranty amount to $60,000.           NATIVE AMERICAN VETERAN HOUSING LOAN PILOT PROGRAM     Current Law       Section 3761 of title 38, United States Code, established a      pilot program whereby the Secretary may make direct housing      loans to Native American veterans to permit such veterans to      purchase, construct, or improve dwellings on trust land.      The pilot program expires on December 31, 2001.       Current law requires a tribe to enter into a Memorandum of      Understanding (MOU) with VA before VA can make home loans to      members of that tribe.     House Bill       Section 404(a) of H.R. 2540 would extend to December 31,      2005, VA's direct loan program for Native American veterans      living on trust lands. Section 404(b) would amend section      3762(a)(1) of title 38, United States Code, to permit VA to      make a direct housing loan to a member of a Native American      tribe that has entered into an MOU with another federal      agency if that MOU generally conforms to the requirements of      VA's program.     Senate Bill       Section 302 of the Senate bill extends the Native American      veterans housing loan program to December 31, 2005. It also      extends the requirement of an annual report under section      3762(j) through 2006.     Compromise Agreement       Section 402 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language with the addition of the reporting requirement until      2006.           MODIFICATION OF LOAN ASSUMPTION NOTICE REQUIREMENT     Current Law       Section 3714(d) of title 38, United States Code, requires      that all VA loans and security instruments contain on the      first page in letters two and one half times the size of the      regular type face used in the document, a statement that the      loan is not assumable without approval of VA or its      authorized agent.     House Bill       Section 405 of H.R. 2540 would modify the requirement in      section 3714(d) of title 38, United States Code, by requiring      that such notice appear conspicuously on at least one      instrument (such as a VA rider) under guidelines established      by VA in regulations.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 403 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language.      INCREASE IN ASSISTANCE AMOUNT FOR SPECIALLY ADAPTED HOUSING     Current Law       The Secretary is authorized in chapter 21 of title 38,      United States Code, to assist eligible veterans in acquiring      suitable housing and adaptations with special fixtures made      necessary by the nature of the veteran's service-connected      disability, and with the necessary land. The assistance      authorized for a severely disabled veteran shall not exceed      $43,000. The amount authorized for less severely disabled      veterans shall not exceed $8,250.     House Bill       Section 305 of H.R. 801 would increase the grant for      specially adapted housing for severely disabled veterans to      $48,000 and for less severely disabled veterans to $9,250.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 404 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language.                 EXTENSION OF OTHER HOUSING AUTHORITIES     Current Law       Subsection 3702(a)(2)(E) of title 38, United States Code,      authorizes VA to provide housing loan guaranties to members      of the Selected Reserve through       September 30, 2007; subsection 3720(h)(2) authorizes VA to      issue guaranties of timely principal and interest payments on      trust-issued securities backed by vendee loans through      December 31, 2008; subsection 3729(b)(2) authorizes VA to      charge a loan fee for VA home loan guaranties through October      1, 2008; and subsection 3732(c)(11) of title 38, United      States Code, authorizes VA to apply specified procedures for      liquidation sales to defaulted home loans guaranteed by VA      through October 1, 2008.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 303(a) of the Senate bill extends VA's authority to      provide housing loan guaranties to members of the Selected      Reserve through September 30, 2011; section 303(b) extends      VA's loan asset sale authority through December 31, 2011;      section 303(c) extends the VA's authority to charge a loan      fee for VA home loan guaranties through October 1, 2011; and      section 303(d) extends VA's authority to apply procedures for      liquidation sales to defaulted home loans guaranteed by VA      through October 1, 2011.     Compromise Agreement       Section 405(a) of the compromise agreement extends the      housing loan guaranties to members of the Selected Reserve      through September 30, 2009; sections 405(b) through (d) of      the compromise agreement follows the Senate language.                         TITLE V--OTHER MATTERS                      INCREASE IN BURIAL BENEFITS     Current Law       Under section 2307 of title 38, United States Code, the      Secretary, upon request of the survivors of a veteran, shall      pay the burial and funeral expenses incurred in connection      with the death of a veteran. In the case of a veteran who      dies as the result of a service-connected disability, the      amount would not exceed the greater of (1) $1,500, or (2) the      amount authorized to be paid under section 8134(a) of title      5, United States Code, in the case of a federal employee      whose death occurs as the result of an injury sustained in      the performance of duty. In the case of nonservice-connected      deaths, section 2302 of title 38, United States Code provides      for a payment in the amount of $300 for veterans in receipt      of compensation or pension. Section 2303(b) of title 38,      United States Code, also authorizes the Secretary to pay a      $150 plot allowance for eligible veterans buried in a state      or private cemetery.     House Bill       Section 301(a) of H.R. 801 would increase the burial and      funeral allowance payable for service-connected deaths from      $1,500 to $2,000, and for nonservice connected deaths from      $300 to $500. Section 301(b) would increase the burial plot      allowance from $150 to $300. Section 301(c) would require      that such amounts payable under sections 2302 (funeral      expenses), 2303 (plot allowance), and 2307 (death from      service-connected disability) would be indexed to cost-of-     living increases in benefits paid under the Social Security      Act, title 42, United States Code.     Senate Bill       Section 401 of the Senate bill would increase the burial      benefits for service-connected deaths from $1,500 to $2,000.     Compromise Agreement       Section 501 of the compromise bill would increase burial      benefits for service-connected deaths from $1,500 to $2,000      effective September 11, 2001, and increase the plot allowance      from $150 to $300 effective December 1, 2001.       GOVERNMENT MARKERS FOR MARKED GRAVES AT PRIVATE CEMETERIES     Current Law       Section 2306 of title 38 limits the provision of headstones      and grave markers by VA to the unmarked graves of veterans,      or to commemorate the grave of an eligible person whose      remains are unavailable. A veteran's family is permitted to      obtain a private marker later. However, if a veteran's family      obtains a private marker first, the VA may not furnish a      headstone or grave marker.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 402 of S. 1088 would allow the Secretary of VA to      furnish bronze markers for already privately marked graves.      This section would permit the marker to be located in an      appropriate place to be determined by the cemetery concerned,      within the grounds of the cemetery. Eligibility for grave      markers would apply to deaths occurring after the date of      enactment of this provision and deaths occurring before its      enactment, but after November 1, 1990, so long as the request      for the marker is made within 4 years after the enactment      date.     Compromise Agreement       Section 502 of the compromise agreement creates a five-year      program requiring the Secretary to furnish a bronze marker to      those families that request a government marker for the      marked grave of a veteran at a private cemetery. The      Secretary is required to furnish the marker directly to the      cemetery and the family is required to place the marker on      the veteran's gravesite. Not later then February 1, 2006, the      Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Veterans' Affairs      of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report on      the use of this five-year authority to include: the rate and      cost of the use of the benefit by fiscal year; an assessment      if the extent to which markers are being delivered to      cemeteries and placed on gravesites; and the Secretary's      recommendation for extension or repeal of the December 31,      2006, expiration date. The Committees note that the Secretary      should implement this provision in a flexible manner in light      of requests for grave markers pre-dating this provision.INCREASE IN AMOUNT OF ASSISTANCE FOR AUTOMOBILE AND ADAPTIVE EQUIPMENT                      FOR CERTAIN DISABLED VETERANS     Current Law       Under section 3902(a) of title 38, United States Code, the      Secretary may pay up to $8,000 (including all state, local,      and other taxes) to an eligible disabled servicemember or      veteran to purchase an automobile.     House Bill       Section 304 of H.R. 801 would increase the amount of      assistance for automobile grants from $8,000 to $9,000.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 503 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language. EXTENSION OF LIMITATION ON PENSION FOR CERTAIN RECIPIENTS OF MEDICAID-                       COVERED NURSING HOME CARE     Current Law       Under section 5503(f) of title 38, United States Code, VA      pension paid to certain veterans receiving Medicaid-covered      nursing home care is reduced to $90 per month. VA's authority      to reduce the pension amount expires on September 30, 2008.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 210 of the Senate bill would extend through      September 30, 2011, the $90 per month cap on VA pensions paid      to certain veterans receiving Medicaid-covered nursing home      care.     Compromise Agreement       Section 504 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate      language.    PROHIBITION OF VETERANS RECEIVING BENEFITS WHILE FUGITIVE FELONS     Current Law       Public Law 104-193 bars fugitive felons from receiving      Supplemental Security Insurance from the Social Security      Administration and food stamps from the Department of      Agriculture. Currently, there is no law barring veterans who      are fugitive felons from receiving VA benefits.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 207 of the Senate bill would prohibit veterans and      eligible dependents from receiving veterans benefits while a      ``fugitive,'' which is defined under this section as fleeing      to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after      conviction, for an offense, or an attempt to commit an      offense, which is a felony under the laws of the place from      which the veteran flees.     Compromise Agreement       Section 505 of the compromise agreement substantially      follows the Senate language.     LIMITATION ON PAYMENT OF COMPENSATION FOR VETERANS REMAINING                    INCARCERATED SINCE OCTOBER 7, 1980     Current Law       Under section 5313(d) of title 38, United States Code,      compensation paid to any veteran incarcerated after October      7, 1980, is reduced to a level equal to the compensation rate      for a 10 percent disability with the balance allowed to be      apportioned to the veteran's dependants, if any.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 208 of the Senate bill would apply the restrictions      listed in section 5313(d) of title 38, United States Code, to      veterans incarcerated before October 7, 1980. This provision      would not affect any payments made prior to the enactment of      this legislation.     Compromise Agreement       Section 506 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate      language. It is the Committees' hope that VA will receive all      necessary cooperation from the state and federal prison      systems in implementing this provision, such as the timely      compiling of data of incarcerated veterans affected by this      change in law.ELIMINATION OF REQUIREMENT FOR PROVIDING A COPY OF NOTICE OF APPEAL TO                    THE SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS     Current Law       Section 7266(b) of title 38, United States Code, requires      an individual appealing a decision of the Board of Veterans'      Appeals to furnish the Secretary of Veterans Affairs with a      copy of his or her notice of appeal to the U.S. Court of      Appeals for Veterans Claims.     House Bill       Section 406 of H.R. 2540 repeals section 7266(b) of title      38, United States Code.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 507 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language.    INCREASE IN FISCAL YEAR LIMITATION ON THE NUMBER OF VETERANS IN          PROGRAMS OF INDEPENDENT LIVING SERVICES AND ASSISTANCE     Current Law       Under section 3120 of title 38, United States Code, VA's      Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment Service maintains an      independent living program designed to assist service-     disabled veterans, who are too disabled to retrain for      employment, in achieving and maintaining defined independent      living outcomes. Subsection 3120(e) of this title limits      participation in this program to no more than 500 veteran      participants per fiscal year. Despite this limitation, VA has      been providing services to approximately 2,400 veterans per      year.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 501 of the Senate bill would eliminate the 500-     veteran cap for participants of the independent living      program, and would retain first priority to veterans for whom      there is a reasonable feasibility of achieving a vocational      goal but for their service-connected condition.     Compromise Agreement       Section 508 of the compromise agreement would increase the      maximum number of veterans allowed to participate in the VA      independent living program to 2,500, and would retain first      priority to veterans for whom there is a reasonable      feasibility of achieving a vocational goal but for their      service-connected condition.       While the Committees acknowledge the value of this program,      the Committees strongly disapprove of VA's apparent decision      to ignore the limitations in current law. When a limitation      contains in current law proves detrimental to veterans, the      Committees expect that the Secretary will not proceed to      ignore the law, but rather to present the Congress with      appropriate corrective legislation. In the event that the      number currently authorized proves to be insufficient to meet      the needs of our Nation's disabled veterans, the Committees      direct the Secretary to propose appropriate legislation to      Congress.          TITLE VI--U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR VETERANS CLAIMS FACILITATION OF STAGGERED TERMS OF JUDGES THROUGH TEMPORARY EXPANSION                               OF THE COURT     Current Law       Section 7253 of title 38, United States Code, requires that      the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) shall be      composed of no more than seven judges and one shall be chief      judge. After the Court's establishment in 1988, the initial      seven judges were appointed within 16 months of one another.      A new judge was appointed in 1997 to fill a vacancy created      by the death of one of the originally appointed judges. The      chief judge retired in 2000, and his seat has not yet been      filled. By 2005, the terms of five of the remaining judges      will have ended. This will likely leave four simultaneously      vacant seats by 2005.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 601 of the Senate bill would temporarily expand the      membership of the CAVC by two seats until August 2005 in      order to bridge the retirement of the original judges.     Compromise Agreement       Section 601 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate      language.  REPEAL OF REQUIREMENT FOR WRITTEN NOTICE REGARDING ACCEPTANCE OF RE-         APPOINTMENT AS CONDITION TO RETIREMENT FROM THE COURT     Current Law       Section 7296(b)(2) of title 38, United States Code,      requires a judge who has not been reappointed following the      expiration of his or her appointed term, before that judge is      65 years old, as a precondition to retirement, to advise the      President, in writing, that the judge is willing to accept      reappointment.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 602 of the Senate bill would repeal the requirement      that a judge provide written notice indicating willingness to      accept reappointment as a precondition to retirement from the      CAVC.     Compromise Agreement       Section 602 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate      language.TERMINATION OF NOTICE OF DISAGREEMENT AS JURISDICTIONAL REQUIREMENT FOR                                THE COURT     Current Law       Under section 402 of the Veterans' Judicial Review Act      (Public Law 100-687; 38 U.S.C. Sec. 7251 note) (VJRA), a      Notice of Disagreement (NOD) must have been filed on or after      November 18, 1988, in order to establish jurisdiction      necessary for the CAVC to review a claimant's case. Section      403 of the VJRA (102 Stat. 4122; 38 U.S.C. Sec. 5904 note)      limits the payment of attorney fees to cases in which a post-     November 17, 1988, NOD has been filed.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 603(a) of the Senate bill would eliminate the post-     November 17, 1988, NOD as a prerequisite to jurisdiction at      the CAVC. It would not affect the requirement of a NOD to      trigger appeal within VA of a decision nor any other      prerequisite to review at the Court. Section 603(b) of the      Senate bill would similarly eliminate the limitation on      payment of attorney fees to those cases in which a post-     November 17, 1988, NOD has been filed.     Compromise Agreement       Section 603 of the compromise agreement follows the Senate      language.                           REGISTRATION FEES     Current Law       Section 7285 of title 38, United States Code, provides that      the CAVC may impose periodic registration fees on persons      admitted to practice before the Court. These fees may be used      for purposes of hiring independent counsel to pursue      disciplinary matters and defraying administrative costs for      the implementation of the standards of proficiency prescribed      for practice before the Court.     House Bill       Section 301(a) of H.R. 2540 would authorize the Court to      collect registration fees for persons participating in a      judicial conference or other Court-sponsored activities where      appropriate.       Section 301(b) of H.R. 2540 would amend section 7285(b) of      title 38, United States Code, to add that registration fees      paid to the Court may also be used generally in connection      with practitioner disciplinary proceedings and in support of      certain bench-and-bar and veterans' law educational      activities.     Senate Bill       Section 604 of the Senate bill contains a comparable      provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 604 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language.                       ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITIES     Current Law       The CAVC, established by Congress under Article I of the      United States Constitution to exercise judicial power, has      unusual status as an independent tribunal that does not have      the same general administrative authority as courts      established under Article III of the Constitution. Because of      its status, the Court does not have available to it certain      general authorities that would normally be available were it      part of the executive branch or another administrative      structure.     House Bill       Section 302 of H.R. 2540 would add a new section 7287 to      title 38, United States Code, to make available to the Court      generally the same management, administrative, and      expenditure authorities that are available to Article III      courts of the United States.     Senate Bill       Section 605 of the Senate bill contains a comparable      provision.     Compromise Agreement       Section 605 of the compromise agreement follows the House      language.                   Legislative Provisions Not Adopted  AUTHORITY FOR ACCELERATED PAYMENTS OF BASIC EDUCATIONAL ASSISTANCE                         UNDER MONTGOMERY GI BILL     Current Law       Section 3014 of title 38 provides that the basic      educational benefit available under the Montgomery GI Bill be      disbursed in up to 36 monthly installments. Benefits are      provided for each month in which the MGIB participant is      certified to be participating in a course of study. If      requested by a veteran, section 3680(d)(2) of title 38 allows      for an advance payment of educational assistance in an amount      equivalent to the allowance for the month, or fraction      thereof, in which pursuit of an education program will      commence, plus the allowance for the succeeding month.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 102 of the Senate bill would allow Montgomery GI      Bill participants to receive their otherwise monthly payment      as an accelerated lump-sum payment for the month in which a      course of study begins, plus up to 4 months worth of      educational assistance allowance. In the case of a term,      quarter, or semester, the accelerated lump-sum payment would      equal the amount of the aggregate monthly educational      assistance allowance for the entire term, quarter, or      semester.              PRESUMPTIVE PERIOD FOR UNDIAGNOSED ILLNESSES     Current Law       Section 1117(b) of title 38 United States Code authorizes      the Secretary to extend the period of presumption of service      connection for Persian Gulf War veterans disabled by      undiagnosed illnesses by regulation. On October 12, 2001, the      Secretary published a regulation extending the presumptive      period through December 31, 2006.     House Bill       Section 204 of H.R. 2540 extends the presumptive period for      undiagnosed illnesses to December 31, 2003.     Senate Bill       Section 202(a) of the Senate bill extended the presumptive      period for undiagnosed illnesses to December 31, 2011, or      such later date as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation.REVISION OF RULES WITH RESPECT TO NET WORTH LIMITATION FOR ELIGIBILITY FOR PENSIONS FOR VETERANS WHO ARE PERMANENTLY AND TOTALLY DISABLED FROM                    A NONSERVICE-CONNECTED DISABILITY     Current Law       The VA Pension Program at chapter 15 of title 38, United      States Code, provides financial assistance based upon need to      veterans who have had at least 90 days of military service,      including at least one day of wartime service, and who are      totally and permanently disabled for employment purposes as a      result of disability not related to their military service.      In determining eligibility for pension benefits, VA is      required to consider not only the family income, but also the      family's ``net worth.'' The value of farm and ranch land is      included in determining net worth unless VA determines that      land can be sold at ``no substantial sacrifice,'' section      3.275 of chapter 38, Code of Federal Regulations.     House Bill       Section 306 of H.R. 801 would revise the rule with respect      to net worth limitation for VA's means-tested pension program      by excluding the value of property used for farming,      ranching, or similar agricultural purposes.     Senate Bill       The Senate bill contains no comparable provision.  MODIFICATION OF THE TIME LIMITATION FOR RECEIPT OF CLAIM INFORMATION     Current Law       Under section 5103(b) of title 38 there exists a one-year      time limit, following notification by the Secretary, on the      receipt of information and evidence necessary to substantiate      a claim for benefits based on an already complete or      substantially complete application. Public Law 106-475      established this time limitation and eliminated an identical      limitation on the receipt of information and evidence      necessary to complete an application for benefits.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 205 of the Senate bill would restore the one-year      time limit on the receipt of information or evidence      necessary to complete an application following notification      by the Secretary. It would also eliminate the existing one-     year time limit on information or evidence necessary to      substantiate a claim based on a completed or substantially      complete application. MODIFICATION OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGE IN RECURRING INCOME FOR                             PENSION PURPOSES     Current Law       Section 5112(b)(4) of title 38, United States Code,      requires VA pensions be reduced or discontinued effective the      first day of the month following the month in which the      pensioner's net income is reported to have increased.     House Bill       The House bills contain no comparable provision.     Senate Bill       Section 206 of the Senate bill would modify the effective      date of reduction or discontinuation of compensation or      pension by reason of a change in recurring income to the      first day of the year following the year in which the      pensioner's net income is reported to have changed. PAYMENT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS TO AN ALTERNATE BENEFICIARY WHEN FIRST                     BENEFICIARY CANNOT BE IDENTIFIED     Current Law       Under chapter 19 of title 38, United States Code, there is      no time limitation for a first-named beneficiary of a      National Service Life Insurance (NSLI) or a United States      Government Life Insurance (USGLI) policy to file a claim for      proceeds. As a result, when the insured dies and the      beneficiary does not file a claim, VA is required to hold the      unclaimed funds indefinitely in order to honor any possible      future claims by that beneficiary. VA is not permitted to pay      the proceeds to an alternate beneficiary unless VA can      determine that the first beneficiary predeceased the      policyholder.     House Bill       Section 401 of H.R. 2540 would grant the Secretary of      Veterans Affairs the authority to authorize payment of NSLI      or USGLI proceeds to an alternate beneficiary when the      proceeds have not been claimed by the first-named beneficiary      within three years following the death of the policyholder.      If no beneficiary has filed a claim within five years of the      veteran's death, benefits could be paid to such person as the      Secretary determines is equitably entitled to the proceeds of      the policy.
