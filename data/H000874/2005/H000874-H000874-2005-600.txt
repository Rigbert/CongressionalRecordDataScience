 I note, Mr. Deputy Whip, that the supplemental is not on the announcement, is apparently not on the calendar for next week. Obviously this is a very important bill. It is a very important bill to our country and our troops. We passed this bill some time ago. Can the gentleman tell us when that bill might be before us?
