Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1152, the IRS Email Transparency Act.  In 2012, the Internal Revenue Service prohibited employees from using personal email accounts for governmental or official purposes. This bill simply makes this commonsense rule a Federal law.  H.R. 1152 responds to the investigation into the processing of tax-exempt applications. This investigation started nearly 2 years ago, in May 2013. To date, the agency has spent more than $20 million to produce more than 1.3 million pages of documents, including 78,000 emails from Ms. Lois Lerner.  Mr. Speaker, to date, there has not been one shred of evidence produced to support the Republican claim that the processing of applications was politically motivated or intended to target the President's political enemies. The inspector general even stated that no one outside of the agency was involved in setting the standards for processing tax-exempt applications. The delays experienced by groups were the result of incompetence at the agency in the Exempt Organizations Division.  I want to thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Marchant) and my Republican colleagues for bringing this bill to the floor today.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
