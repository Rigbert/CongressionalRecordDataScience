 A recent Urban Institute publication reported that job loss for older workers is at a 31-year high. Is it the intent of this legislation that older workers will be a key population targeted for services with these additional resources?  Is it further the understanding of the chairman that funding under the adult formula grants will focus on serving individuals with multiple barriers to employment, particularly those with low skill levels, to obtain the education, skills training and support services they need to obtain jobs in high demand occupations, particularly in green jobs, healthcare, and other viable industries?
