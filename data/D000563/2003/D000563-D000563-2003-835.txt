 Mr. President, this is a curious situation: A person with an extraordinary background, Miguel Estrada, coming to the United States as an immigrant with limited knowledge of English, in a few years rises to the top of the Harvard Law School; he then goes on to work in the Solicitor General's Office dealing with Supreme Court decisions, working in the Department of Justice at the very highest levels.  It is an extraordinary story of personal achievement, academic achievement, and professional achievement. That is why the conduct of Miguel Estrada during this confirmation process has been so puzzling.  I believe he has received bad advice. I think the people at the Department of Justice who said to him, whatever you do do not answer questions directly, they were not fair to Miguel Estrada.  When you consider the questions which he refused to answer, these were not unreasonable questions. My colleague and friend from Alabama, Senator Sessions, regularly asked Democratic nominees the same questions we asked of Miguel Estrada in reference to Supreme Court Justices whom he admired, in reference to Supreme Court decisions with which he agreed or disagreed. No one argued that this was out of bounds or unfair.
