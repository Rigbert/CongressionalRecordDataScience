Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 168) condemning the Democratic People's Republic of Korea for the abductions and continued captivity of citizens of the Republic of Korea and Japan as acts of terrorism and gross violations of human rights, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                            H. Con. Res. 168       Whereas since the end of the Korean War, the Government of      the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has kidnapped      thousands of South Korean citizens and as many as a hundred      Japanese citizens, including Rumiko Masumoto, Megumi Yokota,      and Reverend Kim Dong-shik;       Whereas the forced detention and frequent murder of those      individuals abducted by North Korea have caused untold grief      and suffering to their families;       Whereas on September 17, 2002, after considerable pressure      from the Government of Japan, North Korean leader Kim Jong-il      admitted that agents of his government had abducted thirteen      Japanese citizens in the 1970s and 1980s and assured Japanese      Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi that this would never happen      again;       Whereas despite assurances to the contrary, North Korea      continues to order and carry out abductions, and, as recently      as August 8, 2004, North Korean agents operating along the      Chinese border kidnapped Ms. Jin Kyung-sook, a former North      Korean refugee and South Korean passport-holder;       Whereas the abduction policy of North Korea has been      integral to its espionage and terrorist activities, and      abductees have been kidnapped to work as spies, to train      North Korean agents in language, accents, and culture, and to      steal identities, as in the case of Mr. Tadaaki Hara;       Whereas the Pyongyang regime used abductee Ms. Yaeko      Taguchi as the Japanese language instructor for North Korean      terrorist Kim Hyon-hee, who was caught carrying a Japanese      passport after planting a bomb on Korean Air Lines flight 858      that killed 115 people in 1987;       Whereas many victims of North Korean abduction have been      seized during terrorist attacks, as in the hijacking of South      Korean planes in 1958 and 1969, and, decades later, Pyongyang      continues to hold twelve passengers of a hijacked Korean Air      flight, including passenger Mr. Chang Ji-young and flight      attendant Ms. Song Kyong-hi, who has since been allowed a      brief visit by her South Korean family;       Whereas North Korean agents have hijacked numerous South      Korean ships and kidnapped the seamen and fishermen aboard      the vessels, such as Choi Jong-suk, Kim Soon-keun, and ten      other crewmen of the Dongjin 27, a ship that was seized in      1987, and Seoul estimates that hundreds of these abductees      are still alive in North Korea;       Whereas boat hijackings and the kidnapping of fishermen      have devastated South Korean fishing communities, such as      Nongso village on the southern island of Geoje, a community      of 210 people that lost 14 sons, husbands, and fathers when      North Korea seized three ships in 1971 and 1972;       Whereas the North Korean authorities conspired with members      of the Japanese Red     Army, a group designated as a terrorist organization by the      United States Department of State, to kidnap Keiko Arimoto, a      young Japanese woman studying abroad;       Whereas the Unification Ministry of the Republic of Korea      has confirmed that 486 abduction cases involving South Korean      citizens remain unresolved, and that these cases include      fishermen, seamen, airline passengers, teachers, students,      and pastors, many of whom are still alive and being held in      North Korea;       Whereas North Korean agents have abducted children, causing      unimaginable anguish to parents who live decades with the      uncertainty of what has happened to their child, as in the      cases of Takeshi Terakoshi, a thirteen-year-old boy kidnapped      from a fishing boat with his two uncles, and Lee Min-gyo and      Choi Seung-min, two seventeen-year-old friends abducted off a      beach in South Korea;       Whereas North Korean agents kidnapped thirteen-year-old      Megumi Yokota, as she was walking home from school, and      subsequently reported that she married and had a daughter in      North Korea before committing suicide in 1993, and that      Megumi's daughter remains there separated from her family in      Japan;       Whereas on April 5, 1971, North Korean agents abducted Yu      Song-gun, a South Korean diplomat stationed at the Embassy of      the Republic of Korea in West Germany, his wife, and two      young daughters, ages 7 and 1, while the family was believed      to be in Berlin;       Whereas the Pyongyang regime has abducted a number of South      Korean ministers who were bravely working to rescue North      Koreans escaping on the underground railroad through China,      including Reverend Ahn Seung-woon and Reverend Kim Dong-shik,      the latter of whose welfare is of particular importance to      representatives of the State of Illinois;       Whereas on April 21, 2005, the Seoul Central District Court      convicted Chinese citizen Ryu Young-hwa of assisting North      Korean agents in the abduction of Reverend Kim and, further,      that a Chinese court convicted a North Korean citizen of      masterminding the abduction of Reverend Ahn, and deported the      agent to North Korea in July 1997 following a two-year prison      term;       Whereas some of the abductees have risked their lives in      trying to escape North Korea, as in the case of South Korean      fisherman Im Kuk-jae, who has twice attempted to escape since      his kidnapping in 1987, and is now believed to be imprisoned      in one of North Korea's notorious labor camps;       Whereas the North Korean regime continues to deceive the      international community regarding its ongoing abductions and      has furnished false information concerning eight Japanese      abductees, including suspicious accounts of their supposed      premature deaths;       Whereas the Government of North Korea has never      convincingly accounted for Ms. Rumiko Masumoto and Mr.      Shuichi Ichikawa, kidnapped by Pyongyang agents from a beach      in Japan on August 12, 1978, and claims that Mr. Ichikawa      drowned in the sea, despite his dislike of swimming, and that      the formerly healthy Ms. Masumoto died of a heart attack at      the age of 27;       Whereas North Korea claims abductees Mr. Toru Ishioka and      Ms. Keiko Arimoto, who were kidnapped separately in Europe      and later married, supposedly died together with their small      daughter of gas poisoning in 1988, two months after they were      successful in getting a letter out of North Korea to family      members in Japan;       Whereas although the Pyongyang regime claimed to return the      alleged cremated remains of Mr. Kaoru Matsuki and Ms. Megumi      Yokota to Japanese officials, both remains appear not to be      authentic, and, according to Pyongyang, the bodies of the six      remaining Japanese abductees have conveniently been washed      away during flooding and cannot be recovered to verify the      causes of their untimely deaths;       Whereas despite the efforts of the Japanese Government, the      Pyongyang regime continues to deny any knowledge of the      abductions of Mr. Yutaka Kume, Mr. Minoru Tanaka, and Ms.      Miyoshi Soga, the mother of another acknowledged abductee,      despite overwhelming evidence of North Korean collusion in      their disappearances;       Whereas North Korean abductions have not been limited to      northeast Asia and many documented abductees have been      kidnapped while abroad, such as Mr. Lee Chae-hwan, a young      MIT graduate student traveling in Austria, and Mr. Ko Sang-     moon, a South Korean teacher kidnapped in Norway, making the      issue of serious concern to the international community;       Whereas there have been credible reports that North Korea      may have abducted citizens from many other countries in      addition to South Korea and Japan, including persons from      China, Europe, and the Middle East;       Whereas North Korea routinely engaged in the kidnapping of      South Korean citizens during the Korean War from 1950 to      1953, and, according to a 1956 survey conducted by the Korean      National Red Cross, 7,034 South Korean civilians were      abducted during the conflict;       Whereas Pyongyang has refused to allow the release of a      single wartime abductee despite a provision allowing civilian      abductees to return home in Article III of the Korean War      Armistice Agreement, a document signed by representatives      from the United States, North Korea, and China;       Whereas for more than fifty years, North Korea has held      South Korean prisoners-of-war captured during the Korean War,      in clear violation of Article III of the Korean War Armistice      Agreement signed on July 27, 1953, and the South Korean      Ministry of National Defense estimates that 542 captives are      still alive in North Korea, according to testimony given      before the National Assembly in February 2005;       Whereas according to the testimony of prisoners-of-war who      have successfully escaped from North Korea, South Korean      prisoners-of-war have been forced to perform hard labor for      decades, often in mines, and are harshly treated by the      Pyongyang regime;       Whereas after being forcibly held in North Korea for fifty-     one years, South Korean prisoner-of-war Han Man-taek, age 72,      escaped to China, was detained by Chinese police and forcibly      repatriated to North Korea earlier this year, where he      inevitably faced punitive measures and possible execution;      and       Whereas these South Korean prisoners-of-war served under      the United Nations Command, fighting alongside their American      and Allied fellow soldiers, and therefore are the direct      concern of the Allied nations who contributed forces during      the Korean War: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate      concurring),  That Congress--       (1) condemns the Government of the Democratic People's      Republic of Korea for the abduction and continued captivity      of citizens of the Republic of Korea and Japan as acts of      terrorism and gross violations of human rights;       (2) calls upon the North Korean Government to immediately      cease and desist from carrying out abductions, release all      victims of kidnapping and prisoners-of-war still alive in      North Korea, and provide a full and verifiable accounting of      all other cases;       (3) recognizes that resolution of the nuclear issue with      North Korea is of critical importance, however, this should      not preclude United States Government officials from raising      abduction cases and other critical human rights concerns in      any future negotiations with the North Korean regime;       (4) calls upon the United States Government not to remove      the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from the Department      of State's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism until such      time that North Korea renounces state-sponsored kidnapping      and provides a full accounting of all abduction cases; and       (5) admonishes the Government of the People's Republic of      China for the forced repatriation to North Korea of Han Man-     taek, a South Korean prisoner-of-war and comrade-in-arms of      the United States, and for its failure to exercise sovereign      control over teams of North Korean agents operating freely      within its borders.
