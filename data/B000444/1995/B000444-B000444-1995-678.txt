 BYRD. Not yet. I will shortly. I do all the vacuuming. I do the dusting. I dust the furniture in the family room and dust the furniture in the living room, and so on. My wife does the buying and the cooking and the washing and the ironing and the pressing of suits and taking care of my little dog, Billy. But over this weekend, whenever I get through with doing my chores, which I have sworn on to for a number of years, then I want to study this bill. That is a legitimate reason not to rush pell-mell at this point.  I want to be a reasonable man. Here is an opportunity to vote on something that is positive. I will listen to the Senator's explanation of the amendment. It is my understanding, in talking with the distinguished Senator from North Dakota and the distinguished Senator from Michigan, that this is a good amendment. So I am not going to interpose an objection to setting these committee amendments aside. I have no objection to setting those amendments aside and letting the Senate go forward and dispose of the amendment by Mr. Dorgan. There may be another amendment that would fit into that. All I am asking is that I want this weekend, after I get through with mopping the kitchen and mopping the washroom, and all those things, I want the opportunity to study this bill. That is a reasonable request. I am saving my strength for a filibuster on another day, on another bill. I am not filibustering this bill. Give me a break here.  So I have no objection to that if the leader wants to do that.
