 President, we in Delaware, and especially those of us associated with the University of Delaware, engaged in a very proud celebration this fall, when on November 10, Harold ``Tubby'' Raymond won his 300th game as head coach of the University's Fightin' Blue Hens football team.  The win put Coach Raymond into some very elite company, as he became the ninth ranked college coach in all-time wins, fifth among active coaches, second among division I-AA coaches, and one of only four coaches in the 300-wins club to have won all of his games at one school.  Coach Raymond came to the University of Delaware in 1954; to put that in perspective, it means that he had already been coaching at Delaware, as an assistant in football and head coach in baseball, for six years when I arrived on campus as a college freshman. With apologies to my New England colleagues, we stole Tubby from the University of Maine, where he had coachedwith his fellow University of Michigan alumnus and later College Football Hall of Famer, Dave Nelson. If you've ever seen the University of Delaware football helmets, you know that Coaches Nelson and Raymond never forgot their Michigan roots.  After serving as Dave Nelson's backfield coach for 12 years, Tubby Raymond took over the head coaching job in 1966, leading that first team to a 6-3 record and the first of three Middle Atlantic Conference University Division championships. In his 36-year career as Delaware's head coach, Tubby has gone on to win three national championships, including back-to-back titles in 1971 and '72, and has led Delaware to the national playoffs a total of 16 times, five in Division II and 11 in Division I-AA. His teams have earned 14 Lambert Cup eastern college championships, and have won six Atlantic 10/Yankee Conference titles, five Boardwalk Bowls and nine ECAC ``Team of the Year'' Awards.  Tubby Raymond's career record stands at 300-119-3, a winning percentage of .714. He is one of only two college division coaches ever to win consecutive American Coaches Association Coach of the Year Awards. He was named NCAA Division II Coach of the Year by ABC Sports and Chevrolet in 1979, following his third national championship season. He is all told, a seven-time honoree as AFCA College Division District II, now I-AA Region I, Coach of the Year; and he has been twice named as the New York Writers Association ECAC I-AA Coach of the Year. In 1998, Coach Raymond received the Vince Lombardi Foundation Lifetime Achievement Award, and in 2000, he was recognized by Sports Illustrated as one of Delaware's top 10 sports figures of the 20th Century.  Most incredibly of all, all the records and championships and statistics, as phenomenal as they are, don't tell the full story of Tubby Raymond's stature and influence on his players, the University, his sport or our State as a whole. Coach Raymond is a leader far beyond the walls of Delaware Stadium; he is respected, admired and beloved by his fellow Delawareans, even those who like to call their own plays from the stands, and even by rival coaches and opposing players. He is an institution, in a word, a legend; in fact, I would say that Tubby Raymond defines the standard of ``living legend'' in my State.  To top it off, Tubby is a good golfer, though like most of us not as good as he would like to be, and he is also an artist of considerable renown. One of the many ways Tubby expresses his bond to his players has been by painting a portrait of a senior member of the team each week of the season through most of his career. Other Raymond originals have benefited charity auctions and decorated Delaware football media guides. In fact, Tubby's artistic talents have attracted only slightly less national attention than his coaching skills; his paintings have been featured on Good Morning America, NBC Nightly News, Sports Illustrated, CNN and Fox Sports.  To save the best for last, Tubby Raymond is a family man. He lives with his wife, Diane, and daughter, Michelle, and is also the proud father of three grown children from his first marriage to Sue Raymond, who died in 1990. His son, Chris, is a former coach made good as an officer with J.P. Morgan; his daughter, Debbie, is a psychologist; and his son, David, became well known himself to sports fans as the Phillie Phanatic, mascot of the Philadelphia Phillies, and now owns Raymond Entertainment.  It is my privilege to share Delaware's pride in Harold ``Tubby'' Raymond with the Senate and with the Nation today. He is a legendary coach, an inspiring leader, a good friend and a remarkable human being, and to put it simply, we love him.                          ____________________
