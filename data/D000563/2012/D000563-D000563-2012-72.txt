President, I see my two colleagues from Connecticut on the Senate floor. I know they are here to speak about the horrible tragedy in Newtown last Friday. I will abbreviate my remarks on the floor, and I commend both of them for extraordinary statements last night at a memorial service. I will never forget some of the things they shared with us about this terrible tragedy.  I come to the floor this morning for a few moments to pay tribute to one of my great friends and one of my great colleagues, Danny Inouye, who passed away yesterday.
