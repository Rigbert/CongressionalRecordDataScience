President, I rise today to call attention to the devastating conflict in the Darfur region of Western Sudan. Over the past 14 months more than 1 million people have been displaced by the scorched earth campaign waged by the Sudanese armed forces and `janjaweed' militia. The number of refugees grows daily. The situation is hardly improving, despite recent attention.  I am pleased that earlier this month the Senate was able to agree to S. Con. Res. 99, which condemns the Government of the Republic of Sudan for its participation and complicity in the attacks against innocent civilians in the Darfur region. But I must caution my colleagues that we cannot consider this matter over and dealt with. We must keep abreast of ongoing developments in Darfur and continue to look for ways to bring an end to the conflict.  With that goal in mind, I would like to draw to the attention of my colleagues an enlightening article by Laurie Garrett, published in the May 10 edition of the Los Angeles Times. The op-ed focuses on possible consequences of the Darfur conflict which have largely been overlooked. Ms. Garrett explains that along with the horrid campaign of rape and murder perpetrated by the militia, those rapists and murderers are likely spreading disease among their victims and themselves.  When Ms. Garrett speaks of disease, she does not mean the common cold. She is talking about the most vicious and deadly infections known to man. Darfur is located in a region of Africa believed to be the origin of diseases like HIV, ebola, and West Nile virus, to name only a few. The reason we know the names of these diseases is not because they stayed confined to remote villages and tribes of Africa. These are diseases which grew rampant and spread across deserts and oceans to reach the farthest outposts of our Nation and the rest of the world.  While some may have difficulty imagining the horrors of a conflict far away in a remote part of Sudan, it is much easier to imagine consequences on our home soil. The possibility is very real that the rape campaign in Darfur could take a disease, previously confined to a single remote village, and spread it throughout the militia, their victims, and the rest of the world. This is a possibility which should not be ignored.  Along with many of my colleagues, I have worked very hard to combat the global epidemic of AIDS and will continue to do so until we have conquered that horrible disease. Laurie Garrett's warning is that our AIDS effort is not enough. We must do everything we can to prevent another AIDS or another West Nile from ravaging people around the world. Bringing a swift end to the conflict in Sudan will reduce the chance of a new and devastating infection being introduced into the international population.  I praise Ms. Garrett for bringing attention to the role of disease in the Darfur conflict and I hope that her article serves as yet another reminder that we must continue to push for peace in Sudan.  I ask unanimous consent that Laurie Garrett's op-ed in the May 10 edition of the Los Angeles Times be printed in the Record.  There being no objectin, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 10, 2004]                         The Microbes of Mayhem                          (By Laurie Garrett)       As the horrors of Sudan's ethnic conflict mount,      opportunities for pathogenic microbes--germs that could      threaten people all over the world--rise in tandem. War and      disease are often a matched set in Africa, with terrifying      results: If the fighting doesn't kill you, disease very well      could. And without outside help to stop the cycle, the      devastating results will only spread.       In the Darfur region of western Sudan, an estimated 1      million ethnic-African Sudanese are refugees, the targets of      government troops and horseback janjaweed militia--ethnic      Arabs--who are torching and raping their way across hundreds      of miles of poor farmland.       It is almost impossible to overstate how remote this region      is. Permission to legally visit the area is rarely granted by      the Sudanese government. So scientists know very little about      the area's plants and animals, much less its microbes. But      what they can surmise is frightening.       Darfur is just 500 miles north of N'zara, where scientists      believe the often lethal West Nile virus (which has now      spread to nearly every state in the United States) resides.      In 1976, N'zara also was the site of a major outbreak of the      deadly Ebola virus. And across Sudan's southern border,      Uganda is believed to be ground zero for the global AIDS      epidemic. The circumstances of West Nile's spread remain a      mystery, but the Ebola outbreak and the AIDS epidemic owe a      great deal to the treacherous mixing of war, refugees and      microbes.       In 1976, an international team of scientists was in      Yambuku, Zaire, doing battle with the world's first known      epidemic of Ebola, a virus that causes uncontrollable      bleeding. Ebola was rare, to say the least, so the scientists      were stunned to hear rumors of another outbreak in N'zara.       American disease detective Dr. Joe McCormick drove a Land      Rover across more than 400 miles of unmarked terrain to      confirm the outbreak. To this day, however, scientists have      no idea exactly how Ebola emerged in N'zara, or whether the      virus normally inhabits the area. But they do know that      ethnic warfare was underway in the region.       Most likely, infected animals--bats, perhaps--had taken up      residence inside buildings in the area, probably as a result      of human encroachment into the animals' normal habitat and      changes in local weather patterns. It is believed that      starving local residents hunted and ate infected animals, and      once humans were infected, Ebola spread swiftly, thanks to      the dire conditions in the region's war-torn hospitals and      clinics, where needles were reused and sterile techniques      were virtually unheard of.       As for HIV, it also can be traced to the 1970s and another      ethnic-cleansing campaign in the same region of Africa.      Ugandan strongman Idi Amin set his soldiers against tribes in      the Rakai district, with rape as a primary weapon. When the      conflict spilled over into Tanzania, so did the rape, and      when Tanzania's army repulsed Amin's forces, it carried out      its own campaign of rape in turn. As it happened, however,      another form of revenge spread along with the rape: HIV.       The genetic history of HIV shows that the virus made its      first leap to our species from a primate--probably a      chimpanzee--some seven decades ago. But in traditional      village settings across Africa, the virus did not readily      spread, and less than 1% of any society is thought to have      been infected before the mid-1970s. It took a catastrophic      event, like Amin's brutal campaign, to amplify the rare virus      into a pandemic.       Today, as then, a chief horror of the Darfur campaign is      the militias' raping of women and girls. They brand their      victims' foreheads so that all will know that the women and      their potential offspring are tainted. Nobody knows how      prevalent HIV is in the Darfur region (Khartoum has never      allowed surveys of the area). In the Muslim north, surveys of      pregnant women four years ago revealed that 3% of them were      HIV-positive; a N'zara-area survey found infection rates      twice as high. It isn't unreasonable to suspect that the      current Darfur ``ethnic cleansing'' campaign is spreading the      disease, not only among the people of Darfur and their     janjaweed rapists but also among refugees in camps in      neighboring Chad. It is equally reasonable to posit that some      other previously obscure sexually transmitted disease could      be amplified to epidemic proportions via the bodies of the      women of Darfur.       And there is yet another chapter in the region's disease      history that has a bearing on what's happening in Darfur. Ten      years ago, the world stood by as hundreds of thousands were      murdered in Rwanda and thousands more died in the refugee      camps. Initially, overwhelmed local medical workers believed      that the disease causing many of the deaths was cholera. But      it wasn't chiefly cholera that ravaged the refugee camps; it      was shigella, bacteria that cause dysentery. Amid the ongoing      violence and the chaos of the camps, black market antibiotics      were taken indiscriminately. Instead of curing the bacteria,      the uncontrolled use of antibiotics created a brand new fully      drug-resistant strain that still plagues Africa.       Surely it is in our collective interest, in light of this      sorry history, to pay heed to those who implore us to save      Darfur, to stop the rape, to resettle the refugees, to end      the chaos that breeds disease. Even if we cannot find Sudan      on a map or have no room left in our hearts to bear witness      to another war, we surely understand that deadly microbes are      our problem, as well as theirs.                          ____________________
