 We talk about, well, we ought to operate like a family. Family understands that. They know their electricity bill goes up, and they know they can't get the same kind of heat this year or next year that they got last year because they know their electric bill has gone up, and they need to know what that is.  So what we said, the Congress said, we want a baseline budget. What does it cost to get that $100 of value next year? And so we get that.  The previous speaker I heard speaking--I don't know who it was; I apologize for that--said, you know, we ought to have an honest budget. Well, you can argue it's honest both ways. Either it's honest that that's what we spent last year, 100 bucks, or it's honest that, in order to do next year what we did last year, you need $101.50. Both of those are honest answers. Nobody ought to think that that's a dishonest answer.  The answer is: Do you want to know what you spent last year? Look at the budgets. Do you want to know what it would cost you to do the same thing? Then you get the baseline. So either one is honest. It's just a judgment.  But you're pretending that you're saving money by having that kind of budget. Baloney. Baloney. The only way you're going to save money is to have the courage to vote to do so.  My friend, Paul Ryan, is shaking his head. He and I have some significant disagreements, but very great respect, I hope, for one another. I know I have great respect for him.                              {time}  1820  I think we are advantageous as a country having Mr. Van Hollen and Mr. Ryan, who are both very bright, able, committed people dealing with this. The trick is coming to agreement irrespective of process. It's substance that matters. The American public will be affected by the substantive judgments we make, not about whether we do it with a baseline budget or a static budget or dynamic scoring.
