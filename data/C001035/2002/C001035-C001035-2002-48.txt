President, I was also disturbed by the testimony of the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission before the Senate Commerce Committee. He testified there were a number of examples where the branded and generic drug manufacturer actually conspired to game the system and attempted to restrict competition beyond what the Hatch-Waxman Act intended. One case cited in the chairman's testimony involved the producer of a heart medication which in early 1996 brought a lawsuit for patent and trademark infringement against the generic manufacturer.  This is what happened. Instead of asking the generic company to pay damages, the brand name manufacturer offered a settlement to pay the generic company more than $880 million in return for keeping the generic drug off the market. So the brand name manufacturer essentially conspired with the generic manufacturer and paid off the generic manufacturer to keep the cheaper generic alternative from coming to the market.  The consequences for consumers were considerable. This heart medication, which treats high blood pressure, chest pains, and heart disease, costs about $73 a month but the generic alternative would have cost only $32 a month. The compromise legislation that we will soon consider will make cost-effective generic drugs more available by restoring the original intent of the Hatch-Waxman Act and by closing the loopholes that are delaying competition and slowing the entry of generics into the marketplace.  First, as amended by the Edwards-Collins compromise, the legislation would limit brand name manufacturers to a single 30-month stay for patents listed at the time of the brand product approval. Now, this will eliminate the brand manufacturer's ability to stack multiple and sequential automatic 30-month stays during patent litigation in order to keep generics off the market and extend their market exclusivity indefinitely. That is one of the primary abuses that our proposal would end.  It will help ensure that key patent issues are adjudicated before the generic goes to market, while at the same time ensuring that improper late listed patents are not able to obstruct market competition.  We heard in committee examples of the brand name manufacturer making extremely minor changes, such as in the color or the design of the packaging or the scoring of the pill that really did not indicate a different or improved use for the product but, rather, were devices intended to keep the generic off the market for a while longer.  For subsequent patents for which no automatic 30-month stay is available, a brand name company can still obtain a preliminary injunction based on merit to protect their patent rights and keep the generic product off the market if it is justified, if there truly is a legitimate patent issue. However, in too many cases we found there is not a legitimate patent issue. This is just an abuse and an exploitation of the loopholes in the current patent law.  Moreover, our legislation stipulates that the court is not to consider the possible availability of monetary damages when it is deciding whether or not to grant injunctive relief. This provision is intended to address the concern expressed by the brand name pharmaceutical companies that it is difficult to obtain injunctive relief in patent litigation because it is the court's view the treble monetary damages involved in these suits as an adequate remedy.  Second, the legislation will prevent the current 108-day exclusivity provision of the Hatch-Waxman Act from becoming a bottleneck for subsequent generic competitors. Under Hatch-Waxman, the first generic drug company to file an application with the FDA certifying that the patents on the brand name product are either invalid or will not be infringed is now granted 180 days of market exclusivity, once its application is approved. Entry to the market for other generics is therefore frozen until the 180-day period runs out on the first-to-file.  This provision has made it attractive for the kind of abuse that I mentioned earlier, and that is where a brand name manufacturer pays the first-to-file generic company to stay off the market.  What that results in is nobody else can come to market, under the current law, during that 180-day period. So you can see how that is abused, when the brand name firm pays the generic manufacturer to essentially forfeit that 180 days of exclusive market rights.  Under our legislation, the first generic applicant would forfeit that 180 days of exclusive market rights if it failed to go to market during that time, or entered into an agreement with a brand name company that the FTC determines to be anti-competitive. I think that would help end or eliminate altogether the kinds of deals between the brand name manufacturer and the generic manufacturer that are such a disservice to consumers.  The original Hatch-Waxman act was a carefully constructed compromise that balanced an expedited FDA approval process to speed the entry of lower cost generic drugs into the market with additional patent protections to ensure continuing innovation.  Regrettably, however, the law now needs to be strengthened and reformed so we can eliminate the abuses that we are seeing. This bipartisan compromise bill restores that balance by closing the loopholes that have reduced the original law's effectiveness in bringing lower cost generic drugs to market more quickly. Increasing access to these lower cost alternatives is all the more important as we begin work to provide an affordable and sustainable Medicare prescription drug benefit.  Mr. President, I urge all our colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. It will do a great deal to make prescription drugs more affordable by promoting competition in the marketplace and increasing access to lower price generic drugs.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                       Coalition for a Competitive                                        Pharmaceutical Market,                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2002.     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,     Chairman, Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions          Committee, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: As a broad-based coalition of large      employers, consumer groups, generic drug manufacturers,      insurers, labor unions, and others, we are writing to advise      you of our strong support for the Edwards/Collins amendment      to S. 812, the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals      Act. We believe it is critical that Congress act this year to      pass legislation that would eliminate barriers to generic      drug entry into the marketplace. The legislation you will be      marking up today clearly would accomplish this long-overdue      need.       Prescription drug costs are increasing at double-digit      rates, and clearly are unsustainable. Current pharmaceutical      cost trends are increasing premiums, raising copayments,      pressuring reductions in benefits, and undermining the      ability of businesses to compete in the world marketplace. We      believe that a major contributor to the pharmaceutical cost      crisis is the use of the Drug Price Competition and Patent      Term Restoration Act of 1984 clearly in ways unanticipated by      Congress, which effectively block generic entry into the      marketplace. The repeated use of the 30-month generic drug      marketing prohibition provision and other legal barriers have      resulted in increasingly unpredictable and unaffordable      pharmaceutical cost increases.       Although the compromise amendment being offered today does      not totally eliminate the 30-month marketing prohibition      provisions, as would be our preference, it does make      important process changes that will lead to a more      predictable, rational pharmaceutical marketplace. We      recognize that compromises have been necessary to garner the      support of a majority of the Members of the Committee and      appreciate your leadership and the hard work of your staff.      However, we would strongly oppose any additional amendments      that would undermine the intent of this legislation by      further delaying generic access or reducing competition and      increasing costs to purchasers. We also remain opposed to      legislation that would increase costs to purchasers either      through extended monopolies or unnecessary and costly      litigation.       We are convinced that the legislation you are advocating      will make a major difference in increasing competition in the      marketplace and enhancing access to more affordable, high      quality prescription drugs. We look forward to working with      you and other Members of the HELP Committee to ensure that      this important legislation is enacted this year.       The Coalition for a Competitive Pharmaceutical Market is an      organization of large national employers, consumer groups,      generic drug manufacturers, insurers, labor unions, and      others. CCPM is committed to improving consumer access to      high quality generic drugs and restoring a vigorous,      competitive prescription drug market. CCPM supports      legislation eliminate legal barriers to timely access to less      costly, equally effective generic drugs.

Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: The Business for Affordable Medicine      coalition encourages you to support the Edwards-Collins      amendment to the 1984 Drug Price Competition and Patent Term      Restoration Act (Hatch-Waxman Act).       The Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee      is scheduled to vote today on legislation to close loopholes      in the Hatch-Waxman Act that delay competition and prevent      timely access to lower-priced generic pharmaceuticals. Your      vote for the Edwards-Collins amendment will ensure genuine      reform for all Americans who face barriers to affordable      medicine.       BAM members hope to continue working with the Committee and      the Administration on appropriate enforcement mechanisms that      avoid unnecessary and costly litigation.       Consumers and institutional purchasers (including      employers, and federal and state governments) can no longer      afford the anti-competitive practices that are made possible      by loopholes in the Act. Now is the time for Congress to      restore the original intent of the Hatch-Waxman Act--no more      gaming of the system at the expense of purchasers across      America.       Please take a moment to review the attached information,      including a letter from BAM member governors outlining their      concerns about this costly issue and the need for real      reform.

Thank you for your assistance in making Hatch-Waxman Act      reform a reality during the 107th Congress.           Sincerely,     Jody Hunter,       BAM Co-Chair, Director, Health and Welfare, Georgia-Pacific      Corporation.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Miller). The Senator from Michigan is recognized.
