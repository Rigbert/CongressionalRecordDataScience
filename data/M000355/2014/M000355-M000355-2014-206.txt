 President, the Democratic majority led us to believe the Senate would be discussing jobs this week, but it seemed to be a pretty one-sided discussion.  Republican Senators came to the floor to talk about our innovative ideas to create jobs and grow opportunity for all Americans. As for Senate Democrats though--well, they wouldn't even stand to call for votes on the jobs proposals.  I think this reflects a growing divide in the Senate between a Republican Party focused on the middle class and a Democratic Party that is obsessed with November 4.  That is very disappointing for America.
