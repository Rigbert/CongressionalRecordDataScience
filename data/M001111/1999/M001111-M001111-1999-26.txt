 President, I commend the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, for bringing to the attention of the Senate this extremely important day, October 21. It is the Day of National Concern about Young People and Gun Violence. This is a day that all Members in the Senate have recognized as a day we want young people everywhere to take a pledge to not bring a gun to school and to resolve their conflicts without using a gun. It is a very important message.  This is a bipartisan message. Senator Kempthorne and I began this effort 4 years ago. This year, Senator John Warner and I put this resolution forward in a bipartisan way. It was supported by all Members of the Senate. It is a simple message to young children. Millions of them today took the pledge and joined with others in their community to take the power of reducing violence into their own hands.  As leaders of the United States, we have a responsibility to do all we can to reduce youth violence in this country. We need to stand behind these young kids who are taking violence and the issue of violence in their own hands and say we, as the leaders of this country, stand with you.  I commend Senator Daschle for his statement, for bringing to the attention of the Senate our responsibility as adults to reduce the number of guns to which our young kids have access, and urge our colleagues to move forward on these critical issues that have been left behind in this session of Congress.  I yield the floor.
