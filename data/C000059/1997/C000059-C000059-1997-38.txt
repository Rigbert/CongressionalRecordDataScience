Speaker, I take the floor of the House today to honor and pay tribute to one of the finest institutions of higher learning in my district, La Sierra University. La Sierra, located in Riverside, CA, has been chosen by the John Templeton Foundation for its 1997-98 honor roll of character-building colleges.  La Sierra is one of only eight colleges and universities in California to earn this distinction, which is given to academic institutions that emphasize character building as an integral part of undergraduate education. Selection was based on meeting five criteria established by the John Templeton Foundation: First, inspires students to develop and strengthen their moral reasoning skills; second, encourages spiritual growth and moral values; third, provides community building experiences; fourth, advocates a drug-free lifestyle; and fifth, conducts a critical assessment of character-building projects and activities.  In a society that no longer looks to religion and a sense of community as the foundation for a quality education. La Sierra University is proof that it can be done. Students are expected to strive to their full potential, seek the truth in themselves and everything around them, and to give back to their world. General education courses in religion and ethics lay a basis for understanding the importance of morality. And through the community service requirement, students learn firsthand the need for volunteerism and how important it is to give assistance to those less fortunate.  On behalf of the citizens of California's 43d Congressional District, I want to extend my heartfelt congratulations to the students, faculty, and administration of La Sierra University for being recognized as a character-building college.                          ____________________
