 We are desirous, of course, of passing all 12 appropriation bills out of conference, through both floors, and to the President. We want to do that. We are working towards that end.  I will tell my friend I have talked to Chairman Obey. There are discussions going on between the House and Senate. He is correct, there hasn't been a conference yet. There are still someissues that need to be resolved. But we are hopeful, in answer to your question, that appropriation bills will be on the floor and will be passed and will be sent to the President prior to the 16th of November. And as I have told my friend before, we have no intention of getting to a place where the government is shut down. The best way to do that is passing our 12 appropriation bills and having the President sign them. We hope we can reach that objective, but obviously at this point in time, much work remains to be done. But we hope to be doing it.  The Senate, as you know, was not in session this week and we are here in an abbreviated session because of the untimely and sad death of our colleague Jo Ann Davis. But we hope to move appropriation bills and we hope to have them on the floor, as the gentleman asked, prior to November 16.
