But that doesn't abrogate the argument, that doesn't nullify the argument I offered that the whole State of Kansas is doing very well and has a very close relationship to the Federal Government.  Agriculture achieves a special place in this economy, but that's not true in many other sectors, and particularly where we're talking about aging infrastructure, which belongs to all of us. EDA is really vitally important. It's an important ingredient in helping us to modernize coast-to-coast.  So I just want to say to the gentleman from Maine, thank you so very much for keeping the program level. We're not talking about egregious spending here. We're talking about trying to help to rebuild this country. And we know the most important investment we can make in order to create jobs in this country--after assuring unemployment benefits for those out of work, which gets spent immediately in the economy--is investment in infrastructure.  It's too bad that the Republicans can't seem to move a highway bill, a transportation bill out of this Congress. That would be the best thing we could do to create more jobs in this country in the year of 2012. But in any case, passing the gentleman's amendment to fully fund EDA makes common sense and it certainly makes job sense.  I yield back the balance of my time.
