Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Obey amendment, and if the Obey amendment fails, in opposition to the supplemental.  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this emergency supplemental bill in its current form. I emphatically disagree with the offsets proposed by the committee. Before I address the troubling offsets included in this bill, let me comment on the nature of emergency supplemental appropriations, quote, unquote.  Emergency supplemental appropriations are by definition, and again, Mr. Chairman, I quote: discretionary appropriations that the President designates as emergency requirements and which are similarly designated by Congress in legislation subsequently enacted into law.  We anticipated the situation in which we now find ourselves and made provisions for it. Any spending designated as an emergency bill will result in discretionary spending caps being increased to accommodate the additional spending. That is in our rules.  We now are facing a serious situation which requires immediate action for American farmers who are encountering dire financial straits, and victims of natural disasters in Central America.
