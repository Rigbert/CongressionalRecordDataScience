President, today I introduce a bill by request of the members of the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Creek, and Seminole Nations, historically referred to as the ``Five Civilized Tribes,'' who still own individual Indian restricted land or ``restricted property.''  The proposed bill would repeal aspects of the Stigler Act of 1947--the 1947 Act--and the Act of June 14, 1918--the 1918 Act--which subject the transactions of restricted property to the jurisdiction of Oklahoma's district courts and leave such lands open to adverse possession.  By way of background, the issue of individual restricted Indian lands has had a long legislative history. Between 1906 and 1970, Congress enacted numerous laws dealing specifically with the individually allotted lands of the ``Five Civilized Tribes.'' Collectively, these laws have created a complex system of Indian land tenure in eastern Oklahoma. These laws are unique to eastern Oklahoma and are not applicable either in western Oklahoma or elsewhere in the United States.  Due to these laws, thousands of acres of Indian lands in eastern Oklahoma have gone unprobated for years, causing ownership of these lands to be increasingly fractionated and more difficult to manage for the benefit of the devisees or undetermined heirs. Indian allotments elsewhere in the United States, on the other hand, are generally held in trust under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Interior. The goal of this legislation is to provide the remaining restricted Indian allotments in eastern Oklahoma, to the greatest extent feasible, with the same kind of protections as are afforded trust allotments in western Oklahoma and all other reservations in the United States. The bill would also include these lands in the national efforts to alleviate the growing problem of fractionated ownership.  Notwithstanding these goals, great lengths have been taken to draft the bill so that it would be ``tax neutral'' as to the county tax rolls. The bill is written to help preserve what is left of the individual Indian restricted land base, reducing the rate at which the current inventory of restricted property in eastern Oklahoma passes out of restricted status. The bill would not allow Indian members of the Five Civilized Tribes to simply acquire fee land and have it placed in restricted status.  With time very limited in the remaining days of the 106th Congress, I do not intend to rush this bill through Congress, denying adequate hearings and oversight, but simply to demonstrate to all interested parties that this legislation is a serious effort to reform the 1947 act. This bill has been through many drafts in recent months and much progress has been made to achieve a workable bill. I am hopeful that Congress can enact this reform next year.                          ____________________
