Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 6428 was introduced by the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Melancon) and the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Baker).  This bill simply authorizes the Secretary of the Army to carry out certain elements of a project known as the Morganza to the Gulf of Mexico, which was included in a report by the Chief of Engineers.  This is part of an important hurricane and storm damage reduction project that is sorely needed. I urge support of the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
