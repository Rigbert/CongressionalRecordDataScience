 President, first of all, I thank the Senator very much for coming to the floor to make his remarks. I absolutely believe what the Senator says. I hope that the Senator will have an opportunity, maybe, to study what I said, because, as he said, he had to leave his office to come over here. I will be happy to discuss, either privately or on the floor of the Senate, any of the comments that I made. I did not name any Senator, albeit, the Senator's name could be implied from putting the article in the Record. But I did not accuse any Senator of putting a hold on it. People on this side of the aisle did inquire about whether or not there was a hold by somebody on your side of the aisle on the bill, and we were told there was a hold. We were not told who it was, but that there is a hold on the bill.  So I want to take time to clarify that because the Senator from Arkansas asked me to, and I appreciate how he approaches this issue as well.  I still would leave my comments, though, that we should get this bill passed. It is not going to restore the situation prior to the firing the way it was for Mr. Dale. But I think that this is something which will bring some justice to it and some equity to other situations in this town where people are getting their legal fees paid.  I thank the Senator for yielding.
