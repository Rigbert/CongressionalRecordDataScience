 President, last year we had a long, controversial, debate about health care reform. When the dust had settled, a number of things were clear. The American people want health care cost containment. They want to choose their own physician. They want portable health insurance. They don't want to worry about losing their health insurance if they lose or change their jobs. Finally, they want more equitable treatment under the tax code. Mr. President, today I am introducing a medical savings account [MSA] bill which can help achieve each of these goals.  The basic MSA concept is simple and straightforward, and similar to individual retirement accounts: Reduce premium costs by selecting a catastrophic, high-deductible policy. Use the premium cost savings to establish special medical savings accounts. Pay medical costs below the deductible amount from the medical savings account. And provide favorable tax treatment of these accounts.  Wider use of medical savings accounts would reduce health care costs. It would do so by reducing administrative costs. Those with MSA's would pay most of their low dollar, under $3,000, health care claims from these accounts. The administrative cost of such claims would be negligible.  It would do so also by making consumers more selective in the use of optional health care services.  Most importantly, it would cause them to be more selective in choosing competing providers. This competition among providers for the business of those who hold MSA's should reduce the prices they charge for their services.  It is true, as critics of medical savings accounts have charged, that a relatively small percentage of people spend a majority of the health care dollars. By implication, since MSA's would pay only for relatively low dollar claims, they will not have a major impact on health care costs. However, it is the case that substantial sums are spent for relatively low dollar claims under $3,000. Thus, wider use of MSA's does offer the potential of lower health care costs.  Second, MSA's put the patient back into the health care equation. Patients will make more cost-conscious decisions for routine health care expenses. Those who hold medical savings accounts would be able to chose their own physicians for routine medical expenses under the deductible limit. Since the money they spend for health care up to the deductible would be their own, no one else could tell them what physician they could see, or what services they could pay for. It should also be clearer, in an MSA context, that the money spent for the catastrophic health plan is the individual consumer's money. Organizations providing health care through the catastrophic coverage policy necessarily will have to orient themselves toward satisfying the individuals purchasing those policies.  Third, wider use of medical savings accounts would make health care coverage more dependable. Individuals with MSA's would no longer have to worry about losing insurance when changing jobs or when experiencing temporary unemployment. Their MSA's would follow them to their new jobs, or would continue to protect them when they become unemployed.  Fourth, it follows that medical savings accounts should increase health care coverage. Fully half of the approximately 40 million Americans who are uninsured at any given time are uninsured for 4 months or less. Only 15 percent are uninsured for more than 2 years. For most, these uninsured periods occur between jobs. Widespread use of medical savings accounts would reduce the number of uninsured, since individuals would be able to pay health expenses during periods of unemployment from those accounts.  Fifth, wider use of medical savings accounts would promote personal savings. Since pre-tax moneys are deposited in medical savings accounts, there is a strong tax incentive to use them.  Finally, it would make the tax treatment of health insurance more equitable. Currently, the tax system allows employers who pay for health insurance for their employees to deduct it from the income on which they pay Federal taxes. It permits the employees who receive such an employer-provided benefit to exclude its value from their taxable income. The better paid the employee and the richer the benefit provided by the employer, the bigger the tax benefits to employer and employee. In contrast, smaller employers who do not offer health insurance and their employees, the self-employed, and the unemployed receive no tax benefit. This is manifestly unfair.  This bill, if enacted, would help to correct that situation. Any individual capable of contributing to a medical savings account would receive favorable tax treatment. Amounts contributed by individuals to an MSA could deduct those contributions from income for Federal tax purposes. Or, if their employer contributes to an MSA on their behalf, the employee can exclude the contributed amount from income for Federal tax purposes.  The medical savings account bill I am introducing today is a revision of H.R. 1818, the Family Medical Savings and Investment Act of 1995, introduced by Congressman Archer on June 13 of this year.  This bill would permit individuals to maintain a medical savings account. They could do so if they are covered at the same time by a catastrophic health plan. Contributions to the medical savings account would be excludable from gross income if made by an employer on behalf of an employee. They would be tax deductible if made by the individual. The total amount that could be excluded or deducted from income would be the lesser of the deductible amount under the catastrophic policy, or $2,500 for an individual and $5,000 for a family.  An individual could withdraw from this medical savings account to pay for qualified medical expenses. Such withdrawals would be excludable from gross income for tax purposes.  Mr. President, the medical savings account bill I am introducing today, if enacted, would achieve a number of the most important health care reform goals the American people desire.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that additional material be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         The Grassley Family Medical Savings and Investment Act       How The Grassley Bill Works: It would allow MSAs equal tax      treatment with other types of employer-provided health      insurance, and it would allow individuals and the self-     employed the ability to contribute to a Medical Savings      Account (with certain restrictions) and receive a 100%      deduction for their contribution. The Grassley bill will end      the current tax-code discrimination against MSAs by ending      the taxation on MSA deposits. Interest build-up in MSAs,      however, would be taxed as ordinary income.       How MSAs Work: MSAs are flexible, and could work like this:      an employer would create the option for employees to choose      an MSA by purchasing a high-deductible policy. The employer      would then deposit funds in the MSA. The amount of the      deposit in the MSA under Grassley is limited to the lesser      amount of either the deductible amount of the insurance      policy, or to $2,500 for an individual, or $5,000 for a      family. Below is a chart which explains the changes the      Grassley bill makes in current law.------------------------------------------------------------------------   Insured                                                                 premium                 MSA contribution              High-deductible------------------------------------------------------------------------Employees      Allows deposits of up to $5,000 for      Retains current  with           families and $2,500 for individuals      law: premium    Employer-      and excludes deposits from taxes.        costs are 100%  Provided                                                excluded from   Insurance.                                              taxes.

The      account is portable, and accessible for any medical expense.      The funds in the MSA roll over from year to year for future      medical expenses or for retirement needs.       Long-Term Care: The Grassley bill allows individuals and      families to pay for long-term care premiums from the account.      Over the longer term significant portions of the population      will use funds from the MSAs to purchase private insurance      for long-term care coverage. This coverage will in turn      decrease the demand on the Federal government for such      services, as will the savings that build up in MSA over time      which can be used for health care and other retirement costs.       Cost: The House companion bill, Archer-Jacobs, has been      scored by the Joint Committee on Taxation as costing $1.8      billion over seven years.       Support for the 10% Penalty on Non-Medical Withdrawals: In      addition to taxing these funds as income, the Archer bill      imposes a 10 percent penalty for non-medical withdrawals. The      Business Coalition strongly supports the 10 percent penalty      since we believe it will encourage savings and discourage      frivolous consumption. One of the key indirect effects of      MSAs will be to increase our nation's abysmally low savings      rate, which in turn will help lower interest rates.       MSAs Have a Strong Appeal to Low-Income Wage Earners:      Companies that have MSAs have found MSAs are most popular      among lower income employees. Under conventional insurance      plans, low-income employees would have to meet their $250 or      $500 deductible with after-tax dollars before they could      access their insurance. A single mother earning $14,000 or      $15,000 a year may find it difficult to meet the deductible      when rent, transportation, taxes, grocery bills and other      needs for her children are pressing. An MSA allows these low      income earners first dollar coverage, permitting them to get      medical care when they or their children need it.       MSAs Enhance Portability: Should an employee change jobs or      be laid off or fired, the money in his MSA goes with him.      This feature of MSAs allows the individual to continue to pay      for his health care premium until he finds another job or is      accepted into his new employer's health care plan. Indeed,      according to the above cited article in the Journal of      American Health Policy, ``forty-one percent of persons losing      private health insurance have an uninsured spell that ends      within one to three months, and 71 percent have a spell that      ends within four months.'' MSAs are a perfect tool to help      bridge this gap.       MSAs Allow Total Freedom of Choice of Doctor: MSAs allow      patients to shop around, choose their own doctors, and tailor      their health care expenditures to suit their own needs.       MSAs Encourage Savings for Retirement Care Costs: According      to the U.S. Census Bureau, the number of Americans most      likely to need long term care (85 years and older) will      double in the next 25 years, and the number of Americans over      90 will triple. Allowing individuals in their late thirties      and early forties to have an MSA in which they could build up      two or three decades of savings, would give these individuals      the funds to pay for drug therapies, nursing home care, and      in-home care.       MSAs Will Stimulate Administrative Savings: When paying for      routine health care costs, the MSA patient has no forms to      fill out or claim forms to file. The patient would simply      write a check to the provider from his MSA, or the doctor      would bill the employer or insurance company, depending on      how the MSA patient's plan is administered. In most cases,      the doctor receives payment immediately. The patient's      insurance company would not have to incur the cost of      adjudicating a small, say, $30 claim.                                                                    ____Significant Changes to the Archer-Jacobs Bill as Introduced by Senator                                 Grassley       The Grassley MSA bill incorporates six significant      improvements to the Archer bill.       FEHBP Employees Are Eligible: The Grassley bill allows      federal employees in the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan      (i.e. Hill staff, Senators, and Representatives) to have an      MSA. Legislation is needed to make this possible.       Withdrawal at 59\1/2\ years old: Retirement withdrawal at      59\1/2\ years old is provided for in the Grassley bill, and      the provision for withdrawal is similar to the current rules      for IRAs. This provision was not in the original Archer-     Jabobs bill because of the uncertainty of how MSAs would be      structured for Medicare.       One Family MSA Per Family: $300 million will be knocked off      the official score of the bill by restricting one family to      only one $5,000 MSA. The Archer bill as written could have      allowed one family a $10,000 MSA.       Hundreds of Millions of Dollars in Savings from Changes in      the treatment of Flexible Spending Accounts (FSAs): Several      hundred million dollars will be saved by not allowing the FSA      to rollover into an MSA during the first year of this MSA      legislation.       Total Cost Savings for Grassley Bill: With the restriction      of one MSA per family, and with the change in the treatment      of FSAs in the Grassley bill, the cost of the bill will be      $500 million cheaper than the Archer-Jacobs bill. The      Grassley bill score will be about $1.8 billion over 7 years.       New Minimum Deductibles for High Deductible Policies: The      minimum high-deductible policy in the Grassley bill is $1,500      for individuals, and $3,000 for families, as opposed to      $1,800 for individuals and $3,600 for families in the Archer-     Jacobs bill.       No spending from the MSA for high-deductible health care      premiums: Unless an employee is laid off, MSAs will not be      used to pay for health care premiums for working employees.      The MSA was never designed to operate as a fund for the high-     deductible premium, only as a source of funds for medical      costs below the deductible level of the high-deductible      policy.       Note: The bill Senator Grassley will introduce in the      Senate will include these changes. The above changes to the      Archer-Jacobs bill will likely be made to the Archer-Jacobs      bill in mark-up since Senator Grassley's office worked      closely with the House Ways and Means Committee staff and the      Joint Committee on Taxation in making these changes.                                 ______      By
