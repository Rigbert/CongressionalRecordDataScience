 It was part of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act. The Democratic leadership made it the first bill to be introduced when they took the majority in 2007, taking control of Congress for the first time for a long period of time. This bill passed by unanimous consent.  When rule XLIV was passed, the theory behind it was that we ought to have total transparency on earmarks. It applies to floor amendments such as the pending Reid bill. It requires the sponsor of the amendment to provide a list of earmarks in that amendment.  Earmarks are provisions that provide limited tax benefits. Those words, ``limited tax benefits,'' are words out of the rule. Another substitute language for limited tax benefits is ``congressionally-directed spending items'' or ``earmarks,'' as they are generally referred to by the public at large.  Given what a priority the new rule passed in 2007 was given and the importance of it, one would expect that the majority leader would be making every effort to comply with it. One would think he would be wanting to set a good example in complying with the rule and disclosing these earmarks. In order to assure transparency of these very narrow provisions, such as what Senator Johanns just referred to, to get the votes of specific Members of the majority party who probably would not have voted for this bill, you would think that ought to be made public. That is what rule XLIV is about. Of course, that burden under that rule is on the sponsor to provide the list.  Once again, I am going to ask the Democratic leadership to comply with the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act.
