President, I have some comments to make in response to the very eloquent comments of the Senator from Texas, but first I ask if she would answer one question that I have. I think it is probably the most important question that could be asked, in these terms. We all understand. Although the Senator is not on the Armed Services Committee now as she was last year, she knows the significance of an authorization bill. I think we all agree that this, the defense authorization bill, which the Senator presiding right now was a very important part of, is a very significant bill.  While she gives a compelling case--and I know it comes from the heart--on privatization, on changing what our interpretation of what the BRAC recommendations are, would she be willing, in order to protect the authorization bill, to go ahead, let's take the bill up in the form that it is and offer an amendment to strike that provision that she finds objectionable so we can then isolate that one problem and still have an authorization bill, not hold theentire authorization bill hostage, which I am sure she would agree would not be in the best interests of the country? Would the Senator be willing to do that?
