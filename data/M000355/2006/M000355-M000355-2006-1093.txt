 President, if I may echo the comments of the Senator from Arizona, had we followed a normal procedure in the Senate over the last week or 10 days, we would have probably had way more votes than Senators on this side of the aisle are requesting. A modest number of amendments, as Senator McCain indicated, roughly 20 amendments, is an incredibly small number of amendments when you consider the magnitude of the bill that is before us and the length of time that it has been before us. We could have been to the end of the process if we had had the kind of procedure that is typically followed in this body. I am hoping that we can get to that point. I am optimistic that the meeting between the two leaders may produce an agreement to get started. We have a group of amendments that are the logical place to start. I hope before the evening is over, we will have an opportunity to lock those in and to move forward, as we do on every other piece of legislation that we handle in this body.  I yield the floor.
