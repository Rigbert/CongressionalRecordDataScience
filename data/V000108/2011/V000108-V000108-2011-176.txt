Speaker, it is with great honor and enthusiasm that I congratulate Saint George Serbian Orthodox Church in Schererville, Indiana as its congregation joins together in celebration of its 100th Anniversary. The congregation, along with Parish Priest, Very Reverend Dobrivoje, and Parish President, Mr. Ray Vukas, will be celebrating this momentous milestone with a celebratory reception on Sunday, October 23, 2011, at the Halls of Saint George in Schererville, Indiana.   Saint George Serbian Orthodox Church in Schererville is a sister church of Saint George Serbian Orthodox Church in East Chicago, Indiana. The parish was established on October 30, 1911, when a small group of immigrants from Serbia joined together with the goal of preserving Serbian culture and religious tradition. That same year, they obtained the services of a full-time priest and elected their first executive board. The dedication ceremony took place on Saint George's Day, May 6, 1912. Many of the Serbian families sacrificed and gave of their time to assist in building this tremendous place of worship. The church continued to grow, and in the 1920's, a small hall and the parish house were built on the church property. In 1949, construction began on a new banquet hall/social center which was completed a year later. Saint George Serbian Orthodox Church became the second Serbian Church in Indiana following the church built in South Bend.   During its existence, Saint George Serbian Orthodox Church experienced many changes as its membership grew. These changes were not only physical changes to the church itself but also a religious schism within the Serbian Orthodox church that affected its followers. In 1963, a decision from Belgrade regarding the church structure resulted in years of turmoil that divided Serbian Americans and the Serbian Orthodox Church into two groups. By 1970, some of the parishioners who chose to remain under the mother church in Belgrade, Serbia purchased property in Schererville, Indiana for a new church to be built. Within one year, a hall was completed, and by 1980, the new church and parish home were finished. In 1992, the church reunified and what remained from the division were many churches throughout the area spreading Serbian Orthodoxy. The church in Schererville continued to grow, building a hall, a new church, a parish home and a new banquet hall in Schererville.   Saint George Serbian Orthodox Church continues to touch the lives of countless individuals through its compassionate service, especially to those in need. Over the years, the church has come to the aid of Serbian immigrants by providing food, shelter and assistance in finding employment. The church auxiliary group, Circle of Serbian Sisters, along with three other Circles of Serbian Sisters in Northwest Indiana, hold an annual fundraisercalled Mothers Against Hunger. This event raises tens of thousands of dollars for Serbian orphans in the former Yugoslavia. The St. George parish also supports donations to other charitable organizations such as the Carmelite Home in East Chicago. Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating the Saint George Serbian Orthodox Church in Schererville, Indiana on its 100th Anniversary. Throughout many hardships and trials, the members of Saint George have dedicated themselves to preserving Serbian heritage, tradition, and spiritual beliefs. For their commitment to serving so many in need, the church leaders and congregation are to be admired and are worthy of the highest praise.                          ____________________
