 It is very generous of him. My remarks are very brief and they are very personal.  Trent, I want you to know how much I have enjoyed working with you. I have enjoyed your friendship, I have enjoyed your sense of humor and, yes, I have even enjoyed your singing.  (Laughter.)  I have found you to be both forthright and truthful. I have found that when you give your word, you keep it. I tend to judge people on two bases: how they go through the tough times and whether I would want to be in a bunker with them in a real debate.  I watched you go through the tough times. I remember you showing me a picture of a chair that had gone a mile from the home that blew down in the hurricane. I remember your fight with the insurance company, and I can only say to that insurance company: Give up, you are going to lose.  I want you to know how much I treasure the relationship we have had. You have a great future. For you and your family, you are probably doing the right thing. For us, it is going to be a real loss. I want you to know how much I enjoyed the times we had socially, the seersucker caucus, seeing you turn up here in white bucks, all clean, spotless, a seersucker suit, a pink shirt, and a pink tie. No one in seersucker quite equals you, Trent Lott. For me, a westerner, to see a southerner at his peacock best was incredibly special.  I thank you for your contributions to the Senate. I thank you for your friendship. I wish you well, and may the wind always be at your back.  I yield the floor.
