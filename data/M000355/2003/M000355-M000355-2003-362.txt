 President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I wish to express my admiration to the Senator from Ohio for his passion and leadership on this issue, what is clearly the most important public health issue in the world today.  I listened carefully to his speech. It was quite moving, and I thank him forwhat he is doing in this area. It is extremely important to the world.  Mr. DeWINE. I thank my colleague.
