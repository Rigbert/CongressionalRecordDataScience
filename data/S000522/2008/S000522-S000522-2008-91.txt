Madam Speaker, I submit the following:  Requesting Member: Rep. Christopher H. Smith.   Bill Number: H.R. 2638.   Account: Research, Development, Test and Evaluation, Navy Account.   Legal Name of Requesting Entity: McGee Industries Incorporated.   Address of Requesting Entity: Nine Crozerville Road, PO Box 2425, Aston, PA 19014.   Description of Request: The next generation aircraft carriers will be built using new-technology that replaces the traditional steam catapults with an Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System (EMALS). The environment around aircraft carrier catapults is among the most corrosive (i.e. seawater spray, heat, deck contaminants) with which the Navy must contend. No reliable corrosion or fracture data exists for the new EMALS materials and configuration operating in a catapult-like environment. A T & E program initiated to develop design-specific corrosion data under simulated catapult conditions needs to be continued in order to permit further design refinement, that will: (1) prevent premature component failures (2) minimize costly fleet maintenance and (3) enhance operational readiness.  Corrosion protection is an important element in producing a durable, highly reliable EMALS that will meet or exceed all Navy performance goals. It can be expected that unforeseen corrosion issues will arise as full-scale development, testing, and implementation of the EMALS proceeds. There is a window to generate corrosion data and recommend changes through 2009. Corrosion fatigue and stress corrosion cracking are critical problems that if addressed correctly, would improve performance, extend their life cycle and lower Operation and Maintenance costs for the carriers and their test facilities. Fracture mechanics testing of various corrosion control alternatives in a realistically simulated environment is required to resolve these concerns.   Detailed Finance Plan--McGee Industries: The total cost of this program has been valued at $3,000,000. We will need to design and develop load frames that will replicate the harsh catapult trough environment. Test equipment will need to be built that simulates the heat extremes, vibration effects, various deck contaminate and their effects on corrosion. All of these parameters will need to be monitored on a periodic basis to assure that we are simulating the EMALS operating conditions. At present we plan to evaluate more than 20 different chemicals and coatings.   The research program planned will follow the direction of the testing results and the direction of appropriate NAVAIR personnel. We estimate that we will need man hours for chemists, engineers, technicians and laboratory services as well as clerical and administrative support.   Breakdown of the Requested Funding:   $750,000 for Design and Test Equipment.   $350,000 for Laboratory Supplies and Equipment.   $550,000 for Man Hours for Chemists, Engineers, Technicians.   $150,000 Administrative, Travel,   $200,000 Research Institutes.   Though this program is specifically directed at the EMALS system controlled by NAVAIR, McGee Industries plans to include updates pertinent to NAVSEA. Corrosion issues and improved corrosion protection are a problem throughout all military branches due to the age of existing equipment and the harsh environments which they must operate in successfully. Thus, this program offers conditioned maintenance improvements for the Navy, Army, Air Force, Marines and the Coast Guard.                          ____________________
