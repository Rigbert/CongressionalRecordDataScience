President, that is the problem. This is what it comes down to. This is an easy question to answer: Yes, it is not my intention to diminish any rights under the law given to any person for services or materials provided by the Government of the United States in any language other than English. If the Senator said yes to that question, it would put a lot of people at ease.  But let me tell you what I am afraid is at stake. In the language which the legal staff has prepared, I am afraid there is more to it. It is apparent that at least some believe you are going further than what you have indicated; that you are trying to diminish existing rights of the law. That is troubling because the rights under law that we are talking about are rights that are over 40 years old, dating back to the 1964 Civil Rights Act. And if the Senator from Oklahoma wants to make a statement of policy that English is the language of the United States and it is a common and unifying language, then he will have 100 votes in the Senate. It will be an important statement. But when he goes on and adds this other language, this amendment raises questions.  I just gave the Senator a chance to clarify the rest of his language, and he didn't want to do it. I am afraid that is where we are going to have a parting of the ways.  I think it is valuable for us to establish that the English language is common and unifying in America and that success depends on it, and I believe that. As I have said many times on the Senate floor, I am the son of an immigrant. My mother came to this country; her parents struggled to learn English. She spoke both English and Lithuanian. I speak only English today. My life experience is not much different than most.  We had a recent survey that found an interesting statistic.
