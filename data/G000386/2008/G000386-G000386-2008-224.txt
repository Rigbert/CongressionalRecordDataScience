 President, we are in a situation where a couple hours from now we will have a vote. I am sure people across the country watching this debate might be wondering what is going on, on this Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill. I would like to shed some light on where we are. As I shed some light, I wish to respond to some of the fiction that has taken the guise of debate.  On Wednesday of last week, two Senators, one Republican and one Democrat--Senator Hutchison and Senator Durbin, respectively--offered an amendment to strike a provision in the substitute amendment then before the Senate. The substitute then pending was the product of extensive staff negotiations and Member discussions between two committees with jurisdiction over the Federal Aviation Administration program. The two committees were the Finance Committee, on which I serve, and the Commerce Committee, on which I do not serve.  People who may not understand how the Senate works or does not may wonder what the situation is. I would like to explain there are certain elementary things about the Senate that are fundamental. First, nothing gets done in the Senate that is not somewhat bipartisan because of the benefit of debate for minorities to hold up legislation until things are accommodated--meaning compromise. It is often difficult to get one committee's Republicans and Democrats together to get agreement to bring something to the floor that can get passed. It is difficult to get Republicans and Democrats on one committee together, but then we have the added benefit of the Commerce Committee getting together for a compromise, and then working out compromises between the Finance Committee and the Commerce Committee makes it doubly or, in a triple manner, difficult to get things done on the Senate floor. So we have two committees that reach accommodation bringing a bill to the floor. After it gets here, then it runs into trouble.  The Finance Committee's involvement in this is determining the aviation excise taxes, and it controls the airport and airway trust fund. We have to raise revenue. Without that money, there would not be much the Federal aviation program could ever accomplish. On the other hand, the Commerce Committee develops all the policy and all the programs that involve airports and aviation. So that is how you get two committees working together to get a bill to the floor. The Finance Committee works out its differences between Republicans and Democrats on financing. The Commerce Committee works out its differences between Democrats and Republicans on the policy of airports and aviation. Then you have to get these two committees together to move things to the floor of the Senate.  Last year, the Commerce Committee acted first. The Finance Committee acted a few weeks later. The Finance Committee, as part of its compromises, addressed airline pensions. We have heard many arguments pro and con about the merits of the Finance Committee provision. I addressed the merits myself at length last week so I will not repeat them now. But in a few moments I wish to respond to some of the points made by opponents of the Finance Committee provision.  As I said earlier, the substitute that was before the Senate until last Thursday was a product of a compromise between the Finance Committee and the Commerce Committee. Under that compromise, the Federal Aviation Subcommittee chairman and ranking Republican were managing the bill. They were, however, at a minimum, under the obligation to consult with the Finance Committee chairman who is Senator Baucus of Montana and the ranking member who happens to be this Senator with respect to Finance Committee matters in that substitute. That compromise and understanding was violated when the Democratic floor manager unilaterally modified the substitute. Under the rules of the Senate, he had that right. The modification was directly adverse to the interests of the Finance Committee members' compromise among themselves. So the managers breached that compromise, plain and simple. That compromise was breached.  What matters worse is the Democratic leader backstopped the Democratic floor manager's violation of the Commerce-Finance Committee compromise by filling the amendment tree. Basically, for those watching, that means nothing is going to be brought to the Senate floor as an amendment without the unanimous consent of somebody who has that responsibility on the other side of the aisle. So with tremendous power in one person, what we call the amendment tree is filled.  Now, we all know the proponent of the amendment, the Democratic whip, has a lot of power. That power was displayed when the offending narrow pension provision I have already referred to--the pension provision the Finance Committee was trying to correct--was airdropped into a conference report on Iraq spending last year. There were no hearings. There was no markup. There was no committee process. There was no transparency, just airdropped in a war supplemental conference committee report, something that everybody knew was going to pass and be signed by the President. So airdropped, wam, bam, here it is, take it or leave it, special interest provisions cooked up in the offices of leaders of the Democratic caucus. It is not the way we ought to legislate.  We have been told that by people on the other side of the aisle many times. I wish to make reference to at least one of those times. I seem to recall a lot of outrage when these kinds of narrow provisions were airdropped into a conference report when we Republicans were in the majority. No one was louder than the proponent of the amendment that was last week on the Senate floor than the Democratic whip. If we had a C-SPAN checker, you could roll the tape back a few years. But I will have to settle because I am not going to roll C-SPAN back to demonstrate the inconsistency of what is going on here, for a New York Times article I wish to refer to.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the New York Times, Sept. 11, 1997]           Senate Repeals Tax Break for the Tobacco Industry                          (By Lizette Alvarez)       In another resounding setback for the tobacco industry, the      Senate voted overwhelmingly today to repeal a $50 billion tax      break for the industry that was slipped into the tax cut      legislation just before it was passed in July.       The repeal amendment, sponsored by Senators Susan Collins,      Republican of Maine, and Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of      Illinois, passed by a vote of 95 to 3. It would delete a one-     sentence provision in the tax package that permitted tobacco      producers to subtract $50 billion from the amount they would      pay under a proposed legal settlement with a group of state      attorneys general.       Senator Durbin hailed the vote as a sign that the tobacco      industry's sway was waning on Capitol Hill.       ``The overwhelming vote sends a clear message, first to the      tobacco companies: Don't try this type of backroom deal and      deception in the future,'' Mr. Durbin said. ``It is really an      example of the old school of politics, the old style of      politics.''       As the Senate was dealing a blow to cigarette makers, top      White House officials were engaged in a debate over how to      approach the proposed nationwide tobacco accord. Some of      President Clinton's closest advisers were pushing him to      issue a strong endorsement of the $368.5 billion tobacco      proposal, while others--including Vice President Al Gore and      top officials of the Department of Health and Human      Services--were urging a more moderate approach in which the      President would spell out his goals without embracing a      specific legislative plan for achieving them.       Tension within the Administration over the agreement is not      likely to be resolved until next week, when Mr. Clinton is      expected to decide whether to back the proposed tobacco      agreement, which has powerful critics among public health      experts and Democrats in Congress.       Today's vote on the $50 billion tax provision indicates      that whichever course the President adopts, a sweeping      settlement with the tobacco industry will not be enacted      until it faces months of scrutiny in Congress.       Public health advocates began a last-ditch round of      lobbying to persuade Mr. Clinton to reject the settlement,      which was negotiated by state attorneys general, plaintiffs'      lawyers and tobacco industry representatives.       Dr. David A. Kessler, former Commissioner of Food and      Drugs, met with top White House aides and members of Congress      today to urge them to reject the proposed settlement in favor      of a $1.50-a-pack tax on cigarettes.       Dr. Kessler maintained that substantial price increases      were the only proven means of reducing smoking by teen-agers.      He was preparing to testify before a Senate committee on      Thursday that the proposed settlement amounted to a bailout      of the tobacco industry and would not significantly reduce      minors' use of tobacco.       The tax provision repealed today in the Senate would have      effectively allowed tobacco companies to save $50 billion on      the proposed settlement by claiming a dollar-for-dollar      credit on a 15-cent cigarette tax increase. The tax was      approved in July by Congress to underwrite health care for      children.       Although the Collins-Durbin amendment won near unanimous      support in the Senate today, its survival depends on two      things: passage of the massive appropriations bill, to which      the amendment is attached, and the House's agreement to go      along with the provision.       But the support that the amendment received today, even      among senators from many tobacco-growing states, is likely to      force the issue in the House, Senator Durbin said.       Representative Nita M. Lowey, Democrat of Westchester, has      offered a companion bill in the House. ``We're going to make      sure we prevail in one form or another form,'' she said.       Today's vote is also a sign of the escalating frustration      and impatience with the tobacco industry's tactics at a time      when the industry is working to rehabilitate its image,      lawmakers said today. The provision was inserted in the tax      bill at the last minute, members said, to stave off      discussion and debate.       The three Senators who voted against the amendment were      Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Lauch Faircloth and Jesse      Helms of North Carolina, all Republicans. Both Kentucky and      North Carolina are large tobacco-producing states.       No one has yet stepped forward to claim authorship of the      tax provision that was repealed today.       Senator Durbin, who characterized the tax provision as an      ``orphan,'' added that ``people said it appeared      mysteriously.'' and was still expressing astonishment over      how it materialized at the last minute.       The Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi;      Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia; the White House chief of      staff, Erskine B. Bowles, and the chief White House lobbyist,      John Hilley, all approved its insertion in the tax cut bill.      They were the last ones at the table in the final      negotiations over the balanced budget and tax-cutting      agreement.       Today, Senator Lott voted to repeal the credit.       Mr. Lott's press secretary, Susan Irby, said there was      never a secret conspiracy to keep the $50 billion credit      under wraps, noting that it was present in the tax cut bill      the weekend before it was voted on. ``This garbage about      something being slipped in and it being a one-sided agreement      is poppycock,'' Ms. Irby said.       For the tobacco industry, today's vote was one of several      recent setbacks. Last week the Senate reversed an earlier      decision and agreed to earmark $34 million to pay for a      crackdown on illegal sales of cigarettes to underage youths.       The pressure was also stepped up on Tuesday by Senators Tom      Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, and Connie Mack, Republican of      Florida. The two announced that they planned to introduce      legislation to prevent tobacco companies from writing off      one-third of the billions they would have to pay under the      settlement.       The bill would funnel the money to the National Institutes      of Health to help pay for research on cancer, emphysema and      other diseases linked to smoking.
