I would like to ask the Senator, is it not true that the Democrats, in the minority in the House of Representatives, stood together and argued that the integrity of the House of Representatives was at stake because of these changes in ethics rules to favor one Republican leader, or perhaps two, and that by standing together and appealing to the Nation, that they were successful, and now the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives has announced they are going to restore the original ethics rules?
