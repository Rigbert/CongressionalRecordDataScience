 President, I will vote against this FSC/ETI conference report and I want to explain why.  The original purpose of this legislation was simple and clear--to bring the United States into compliance with a World Trade Organization, WTO, ruling which said that portions of our Federal Tax Code run counter to international trade regulations.  It is critical that we fix this problem, or U.S. companies will face increased European tariffs, costing U.S. jobs.  This conference report, however, goes far beyond the simple legislative fix needed to bring the U.S. into compliance with the WTO ruling.  In fact, the cost of bringing the U.S. into compliance with the WTO is $49 billion, while the cost of the final bill is $145 billion. The difference is $96 billion in benefits to special interests paid for with certain revenue fixes that should be used to balance the budget.  In fact, this bill provides billions of dollars in benefits to special interests at a time of unprecedented budget deficits. Let me give you a few examples cited in Thursday's Washington Post, ``Conferees Agree on Corporate Tax Bill'':       NASCAR racetrack owners get a provision to write off $101      million worth of improvements over ten years.       Foreign gamblers at U.S. horse and dog racing tracks would      no longer have to pay taxes on their winnings upfront. This      is estimated to be worth $27 million.       Home Depot would secure a temporary suspension of tariffs      it owes for imported Chinese ceiling fans. This is estimated      to be worth $44 million.  At a time when we are facing unprecedented Federal deficits and a mounting debt, it is simply unconscionable to approve this giveaway to special interests. Although the 10-year cost is offset, these offsets could well be used to bring down the deficit.  Policymakers should be taking steps to reduce the deficit and improve the economy, not eroding it further by doling out tax breaks to special interests. But one industry was singled out for penalty in this bill. I cannot accept that--and that industry happens to be the film industry.  In fact, this final conference report will cost the motion picture industry $5 billion over the next 10 years--because they will have to make changes in the way they account for revenues.  The film industry employs 750,000 people nationwide, and the major motion picture studios are publicly owned and pay annual dividends to shareholders.  Rather than allowing the industry to account for its activities on a product line-by-product line basis as was done in the Senate bill, this conference report means that the industry will have to adopt unified accounting.  For example, the Disney film called The Alamo was produced in the United States and did not perform as well as expected.  Under the final conference report, the losses from The Alamo are lumped with all other company revenues--TV, DVD sales, theme parks, merchandise, and music. This is known as unified accounting.  In the Senate version of the bill, Disney would have been able to account for this loss within its film division, separate from its other divisions. This is known as product line-by-product line accounting.  If you assume a $50 million loss, requiring unified accounting will cost the studio an additional $2.6 million in additional taxes.  If you assume a $75 million loss, requiring unified accounting will cost the studio an additional $3.9 million in additional taxes.  So the bottom line is that unified accounting will mean that Disney, and other entertainment companies, will have to pay significantly more in taxes as much as $5 billion over the next 10 years.  I cannot believe that we would in effect raise taxes on an industry that does so much to help our economy.  This simple accounting change would have significantly helped reduce the impact from this legislation.  But in the end, this provision was stripped from the final conference report.  What is worse are reports that this was not due to the merits of the provision, but out of base, political concerns.  A story in yesterday's edition of Roll Call, ``Studios Take Hit in Tax Bill'', asserts that lawmakers stripped the Senate film amendment in retribution for the film industry's decision to hire a Democrat--a former Cabinet Secretary in fact--to head its trade association.  Let me quote from the article:  One GOP Lobbyist for the industry said:       The Glickman thing is going to cost them. No Republican      will fight for the movie industry.  Another Republican Lobbyist added:       They were not overly helpful to Republicans, so Republicans      don't want to be overly helpful to them.  Ordinarily, I do not believe much of what I read on many days and so there would be reason perhaps to dismiss this.  But I also know that the word has been put out on K Street that only Republicans are welcome as lobbyists so this article takes on new credibility.  This is especially egregious given the fact that the film industry was not even involved in the unfair trade practices that led the WTO to declare that U.S. international tax rules were unfair.  I have the opinions of two former U.S. Trade Representatives--one Republican and one Democrat--Carla Hills and Mickey Kantor--which make the case.  Carla Hills wrote:       Having previously served as [U.S. Trade Representative], I      would like to share with you my views regarding the      consistency of your amendment with applicable trade law The      [General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade] does not apply to      `audiovisual services' and does not include any general      prohibition against export contingent subsides.  Mickey Kantor wrote:       Audiovisual services are . . . not within the purview of      the WTO FSC/TTI decisions In my view the adoption of [your      amendment] . . . would not violate or contravene the WTO      rulings in the FSC/ETI case.  As one can see, two former U.S. Trade Representatives agree that the entertainment industry was not involved in the unfair trade practices.  However, the entertainment industry is being singled out for a tax increase in this bill in order to pay for tax cuts going to multinational firms that hold their profits overseas in order to avoid paying taxes.  The bill allows many of these companies having profits overseas to repatriate these billion at a 5.25 percent tax rate.  These are the multinational firms which now will be allowed to bring those foreign-earned profits back to the United States at one half the rate that the poorest American's are required to pay on their income under this bill. This is not fair and equal treatment.  I cannot believe that the other House would utilize political vengeance to disadvantage a sector of American business, while so advantaging other sectors.  Another major flaw with this bill is that it removes the Senate language permitting long-sought FDA regulation of tobacco. The Senate voted overwhelmingly--78 to 15--in favor of a carefully crafted amendment to allow FDA regulation of tobacco.  This amendment linked FDA regulation with a 5-year, $12 billion buyout of tobacco growers. Regulatory authority over tobacco would have allowed the FDA to begin to reduce the addictive and carcinogenic elements of these products. It would have made a difference and, over the long run, it, alone, could have saved millions of lives.  Despite the broad, bipartisan support for this provision, the House rejected a proposal by Senator Kennedy to provide an additional $2 billion for tobacco growers as long as it was linked with FDA regulation of tobacco. Even Philip Morris supports FDA regulation of tobacco. Let me quote from two lettersfrom senior executives from Altria, the parent company of Philip Morris.  Steven Parrish, Senior Vice President, Corporate Affairs, Altria Group wrote that the provision on FDA regulation of tobacco ``is the result of many difficult choices and compromises by all those involved, and it reflects a balance of the perspectives of many stakeholders. We believe the bill embraces the core principles that are necessary to provide the Food and Drug Administration with comprehensive, meaningful and effective regulatory authority over tobacco products.  Together with our domestic tobacco operating company, Philip Morris USA, we enthusiastically support passage of your bill in its entirety.''  John Scruggs, vice president, Government Affairs, Altria Group wrote separately that the provision on FDA regulation of tobacco ``address[es] nearly all'' of the ``issues relating to retailers'' and we should ``disregard the strident and unfounded arguments of those who refuse to look to the future and the need for change in the tobacco industry.''  Congress had the opportunity to finally allow the FDA to regulate tobacco--but it failed to do so. This is deeply disappointing and shows the true colors of the House Republicans.  You may ask, what would FDA regulation of tobacco do to help stop smoking and prevent these premature deaths? FDA regulation of tobacco would do two important things.  First, it would control the deceptive and manipulative advertising used by cigarette companies. Young people across the country are bombarded every day with deceptive advertising and misleading claims made by cigarette manufacturers.  The tobacco industry spends $11 billion on marketing their products. Their latest campaign involves cigarettes that come in fruit flavors and bright colors to target adolescents and women. The cigarettes are given names such as California Dreams, Midnight Madness and Kauai Kolada. The cartons are a different shape and size so as to be hidden from unsuspecting parents and teachers.  And the manufacturer describes them by saying: `Each is as enchanting and mysterious as the darkest night. And, live in color with California Dreams `cigarettes in color' for your individual taste and attitude.' This is truly a new low. These slogans, these flavors, and these colored wrappers cannot hide the fact that cigarettes kill more than 400,000 American each year--and that's the second reason that FDA regulation is so important.  FDA regulation, over time, would ratchet down the carcinogenic and addicting ingredients of tobacco products. Just think how many fewer Americans--young people, old people would avoid the addiction.  Today, 42 million Americans today are addicted to cigarettes and other tobacco products. A number of these will end up with lung disease and many of them will die.  Lung cancer is the number one cancer killer--and the number one cause of lung cancer is smoking. Today and every day, 4,000 children under the age of 18 will try smoking for the first time, 2,000 of these children will become regular smokers, and 1,300 will die prematurely because of smoking.  The bottom line is this: Congress had the opportunity to take a major step forward in improving the health of America's children. But the Republican members of the House chose the tobacco industry over our children--and they should be held accountable for that choice.  There is one more item that did not make it into this bill, which I find deeply troubling. The Senate language to protect overtime rights was removed from the bill. This means that millions of American workers may very well lose long-guaranteed job overtime protection. This is a setback for the American worker.  There are a number of items contained within this conference report that I do support. This bill will provide an expansion of the production tax credit for renewable energy including open-loop biomass, geothermal energy, and solar energy; a provision to eliminate the preferential treatment for ethanol-blended gasoline. Without this provision, California would lose $2.7 billion in highway funds over the next 5 years; and a provision that removes a business tax deduction for the purchase of gas-guzzling SUVs.  These provisions do not make up for the rest of the bill. I think we all would have supported a straight fix to the WTO ruling, but this bill goes too far. It fixes the WTO problem, but then it contains all these other giveaways.  So what was a $49 billion problem to solve becomes a $145 billion bill. This is just plain wrong. I hope in the future that we can remedy some of the shortcomings of this bill, but on balance, this is a deeply flawed billed which I simply cannot support.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a ``Roll Call'' article, to which I referred, and three letters dealing with different provisions of the FSC/EIT bill.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   [From the Roll Call, Oct. 7, 2004]                      Studios Take Hit in Tax Bill                           (By Brody Mullins)       Three months after Hollywood slapped the Republican Party      by hiring Democrat Dan Glickman to head its Washington trade      association, Congressional Republicans sliced more than $1      billion in tax credits for movie studios from a far-reaching      international tax bill that the House and Senate plan to take      up today.       Though the tax credits for Hollywood were included in a      version of the bill approved by the Senate this summer, a      Republican-dominated conference committee voted Tuesday      evening to leave the provisions on the cutting-room floor.       Led by Ways and Means Chairman Bill Thomas (Calif.) and      Majority Leader Tom DeLay (Texas), House GOPers on the      conference committee voted as a bloc to oppose the tax      breaks, calling them bad policy and too expensive to be      included in the $140 billion bill.       But other lawmakers, Congressional aides and movie industry      lobbyists said Republicans refused to fight for the Senate      tax credits in order to punish Hollywood for hiring Glickman,      a former House Member from Kansas and secretary of      Agriculture under then-President Bill Clinton, to head the      Motion Picture Association of America.       ``The Glickman thing is going to cost them. No Republican      will fight for the movie industry,'' said one GOP lobbyist      for the industry.       Another Republican lobbyist added: ``They were not overly      helpful to Republicans, so Republicans don't want to be      overly helpful to them.''       Thomas, the chairman of the conference deliberations,      declined to comment on the motivation for removing the tax      credits for the movie industry.       ``I don't deal with rumors and unconfirmed reports,'' he      said.       DeLay said he voted against the provision because ``it just      cost too much.''       When asked whether the MPAA's move influenced his vote,      DeLay said that employment decisions in the private sector      ``don't enter into our consideration. That's the first time I      ever thought of Glickman.''       A spokeswoman for the MPAA declined to comment on the vote.       Despite DeLay's comments, Glickman was on the minds of      other Republican lawmakers in the past few weeks as votes on      the tax bill neared, according to Republicans on the Ways and      Means Committee.       Before the vote, Rep. Mark Foley (R-Fla.), a key Hollywood      advocate, said he worried that GOP resentment about      Glickman's hire could scuttle the tax credits for the      studios.       ``Thomas has said some things. I've heard a lot of      grumblings. They have said that they thought that a      Republican should have gotten'' the job, Foley said. ``Mr.      Thomas has to acquiesce to the Senate language and right now      that doesn't look good with the lingering resentment. That's      probably a tough sell right now.''       Foley added that the movie studios ``may get dealt a bad      hand, but I'm not sure it's based entirely on Mr. Glickman.''       Rep. Jim McCrery (La.), a top Republican on the Ways and      Means Committee and a member of the conference deliberations      on the tax bill, said he did not think Glickman's hire was      ``a deciding factor'' in the decision by Republicans to      exclude the movie studio tax credits.       Still, he acknowledged that Republicans on Capitol Hill      were upset the MPAA tapped a Democrat for the position.       ``It's a fact that the Republicans control the Congress and      the Ways and Means Committee so it's a good idea to have      someone who can communicate with those who are in power,''      McCrery said. ``It's a consideration that any organization      hiring a lobbyist should take into account.''       At issue is an international tax bill being put together on      Capitol Hill to replace $50 billion in U.S. export subsidies      that have been struck down by the World Trade Organization.       Current law provides movie studios such as MGM, Universal      Studios and 20th Century Fox with about $600 million a year      in tax credits to export movies to other countries.       The tax incentive helped transform the U.S. movie industry      into one of the nation's leading exporters, surpassing      exports of Boeing's jets and Detroit's autos, according to      figures provided to Congress by the movie industry.       When the export subsidy was found to be illegal by the WTO,      Hollywood figured to be one of the biggest losers. At issue      was just how much they would lose.       The Senate version of the corporate tax bill would retain      $350 million annually in export subsidies for the studios.      The House bill, authored by Thomas, provided less than $100      million per year for the industry.       In a partisan vote Tuesday evening, Republicans on the      conference committee rejected an effort by Sen. Max Baucus      (D-Mont.) to include the Senate's credits for the industry.       Senators on the conference committee voted 14-8 to add the      credits, but House Members voted along party lines against      the industry.       A majority vote of both chambers is needed to add      amendments to legislation in conference committee.       Some were quick to point out that Republicans had      legitimate policy reasons to vote against the credits.       Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform,      said there were three reasons Republicans voted against the      movie industry provisions: ``One, it's bad tax policy because      it's industry specific. Two, it's bad tax policy because it      subsidizes an industry for signing bad labor contracts and,      three, Hollywood has recently expressed contempt for the      Republican leadership in the House, Senate and White House.''       Well before the Glickman hire, Republicans on Capitol Hill      have been unhappy with Hollywood and its Washington trade      association.       Since 1990, U.S. movie studios and Hollywood executives      have contributed $42 million in political donations to      Democrats, while giving just $6 million to the GOP, according      to figures from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive      Politics.       After controversial documentary filmmaker Michael Moore      began promoting ``Fahrenheit 9/11'' this spring, GOP      bitterness against Hollywood spilled over in a closed-door      Republican meeting.       During the meeting, Manzullo complained that the      international tax bill being crafted by Thomas and the Ways      and Means Committee included expensive tax breaks for the      movie studios while small businesses and manufacturers were      losing thousands of jobs.       ``Why should we vote on an international tax reform bill      that rewards Hollywood while disadvantaging our nation's      manufacturers,'' Rep. Don Manzullo (R-III.) asked in a letter      he sent to his colleagues.       Other Members agreed. Thomas quickly watered down the      industry's tax credits and the situation seemed to go away.       But Hollywood infuriated Congressional Republicans again in      early July when the MPAA announced its hire of Glickman.       Two weeks after Glickman was hired, Sen. Rick Santorum (R-     Pa.) convened a meeting of top Republicans to discuss the      move.       In the weeks leading up to the tax vote, Republicans      continued to whisper about punishing the MPAA. As a result,      Glickman has let it be known that he is looking to hire a      big-name Republican lobbyist to join him at the MPAA after      the November elections.       In the meantime, supporters of the industry on Capitol      Hill, like Foley, hope the whole thing will blow away.      ``There may be a few people's noses out of joint, but people      get over these things pretty quickly,'' Foley said.                                  ____                                              Hills & Company,                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2004.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write with respect to the      amendment (S. AMDT. 2690) that you have offered to the FSC-     ETI legislation (S. 1637) pending in the Senate.       S. AMDT. 2690 provides, in part, that the present-law ETI      rules would remain in place with respect to income from      activities treated as ``audiovisual services'' under the      General Agreement on Trade in Services (``GATS'').       Having previously served as USTR, I would like to share      with you my views regarding the consistency of your amendment      with applicable trade law. The underlying legislation (S.      1637) is intended to bring the United States into compliance      with the World Trade Organization rulings that the ETI regime      violates the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade      (``GATT'') prohibition on export-contingent subsidies. The      GATT does not apply to ``audiovisual services'' governed by      the General Agreement on Trade in Services (``GATS'').      Further, the GATS does not include any general prohibition      against export-contingent subsidies.       Thus, the adoption of S. AMDT. 2690, which would preserve      ETI benefits for audiovisual services covered by the GATS,      would not violate GATT or contravene the WTO rulings.           Sincerely,     Carla A. Hills.                                  ____                                     Mayer, Brown, Rowe & Maw,                                   Washington, DC, March 19, 2004.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Dianne: I am writing with respect to your amendment      (S. AMDT. 2690) to S. 1637, the JOBS Act, that would repeal      the current FSC/ETI tax regime in order to bring the U.S.      into compliance with the WTO rulings in this case.       As a former U.S. Trade Representative, I would like to      share my views regarding the consistency of your amendment      with applicable trade law. Specifically, your amendment would      allow the ETI rules to remain in place for income from      activities defined as ``audiovisual services'' under the      General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). The WTO      decisions in the FSC/ETI cases found that the U.S. FSC/ETI      regimes violated provisions in the Agreement on Subsidies and      Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement), which is a part of      the General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT). The GATT      governs trade in goods, while the GATS covers trade in      services. Audiovisual services are covered by the GATS and      are not subject to the SCM agreement, and thus are not within      the purview of the WTO FSC/ETI decisions. Further the GATS      does not include any general prohibition against export-     contingent subsidies.       It is my view that adoption of the S. AMDT. 2690, which      preserves benefits for audiovisual services covered by the      GATS, would not violate or contravene the WTO rulings in the      FSC/ETI case.           Sincerely,     Mickey Kantor.                                  ____                                           Altria Group, Inc.,                                    Washington, DC, July 15, 2004.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: After many years of debate, the Senate today      is considering comprehensive tobacco legislation that will      address a range of issues important to all Americans, from      the diseases caused by smoking to the plight of our nation's      tobacco farmers. There were some legitimate issues connected      to FDA regulation of concern to retailers; the good news is      that the DeWine/Kennedy bill has already addressed nearly all      of these. The continued opposition of one national retailer      group to this important legislation, notwithstanding all that      has been done to address their concerns, is unfair and      unfounded. This is the same organization that expressly      promised to remain neutral in 1998 when FDA legislation--with      far fewer protections for retailers--was debated in the      Senate.       Below are just a few of the inaccuracies contained in the      attacks on this legislation that would finally empower FDA to      work on reducing the harm caused by smoking:       All Retailers Treated Equally. The bill expressly provides      that any access and advertising restrictions cannot      discriminate against any category of retail outlet, and      cannot favor ``adult-only'' stores over other kinds of      outlets.       Enforcement Will be Fair, and Apply to All. The bill      requies FDA to contract with State officials for enforcement      to the extent feasible.       Responsible Retailers Benefit. In total contrast to some      claims, the legislation explicitly provides a ``good faith''      defense against enforcement actions for any retailer that      takes the necessary steps to train its employees. The great      majority of outlets that take pride in working hard to keep      tobacco products away from kids should have nothing to fear      from enforcement of FDA rules.       New Tools for Retailers. Under the authority granted to FDA      under the legislation, the agency will be authorized to      implement all manner of innovative new tools to assist      retailers with their compliance efforts, including electronic      age verification. Moreover the legislation is adequately      funded, to better ensure that new approaches can be pursued.       Advertising Restrictions Are Subject to Review. Some of the      advertising restrictions FDA issued in 1996 may well be      unconstitutional; that is exactly why the DeWine/Kennedy bill      empowers FDA to re-examine those rules to ensure that they      comport with the First Amendment. And, even if the agency      decides not to change them, interested parties would still be      able to test them in court, where any remaining      Constitutional objections can and will be resolved.       Beyond these specific points, the arguments advanced by one      national retailer association conveniently make no mention of      some key benefits the legislation provides for retailers--     enlisting FDA in the fight against counterfeit tobacco      products, and authorizing the agency to regulate Internet      sales to ensure that kids can't buy tobacco online. Both of      these provisions could result in substantial long-term      benefit for brick-and-mortar retailers for years to come.       I respectfully request that you disregard the strident and      unfounded arguments of those who refuse to look to the future      and the need for change in the tobacco industry, from growers      to manufacturers to retailers. Thank you for your      consideration of the DeWine/Kennedy/McConnell amendment.           Sincerely,                                                  John F. Scruggs,     Vice President, Government Affairs.                                  ____                                           Altria Group, Inc.,                                       New York, NY, May 20, 2004.     Hon. Mike DeWine,     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators DeWine and Kennedy: It has been a pleasure to      work with you on the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco      Control Act. This legislation has the potential to reduce the      harm caused by smoking, and to establish clear rules      applicable to all manufacturers of tobacco products sold in      this country.       The DeWine/Kennedy bill is the result of many difficult      choices and compromises by all those involved, and it      reflects a balance of the perspectives of many stakeholders.      We     believe the bill embraces the core principles that are      necessary to provide the Food and Drug Administration with      comprehensive, meaningful and effective regulatory authority      over tobacco products.       Together with our domestic tobacco operating company,      Philip Morris USA, we enthusiastically support passage of      your bill in its entirety. We hope the Senate will give your      legislation favorable consideration at the earliest      opportunity. We stand ready to work with you and others in      support of your bill.       Among the bill's many important features are:       FDA would be given the authority to impose performance      standards for the design and manufacture of cigarettes in      order to reduce the harm caused by smoking. Under the bill,      FDA would, as part of its effort to reduce or eliminate      harmful ingredients and smoke constituents, consider whether      a new performance standard would significantly increase the      demand for contraband cigarettes. We believe this is an      important consideration in order to prevent the unintended      consequences of black market cigarettes. It is also important      that the bill provides the FDA cannot ban the sale of      cigarettes to adults.       The bill would change the language of the current cigarette      health warnings, substantially enlarge the size and authorize      FDA to require new warnings in the future. The bill would      not, however, change the Supreme Courts rulings regarding the      product liability implications of compliance with warning      requirements.       The bill would authorize FDA, as well as states and      localities, to replace the time, place and manner of      cigarette advertising and promotion, consistent with the      First Amendment's protection of commercial free speech to      adults.       The bill provides that FDA's product standards would be      consistent on a nationwide basis.       FGA would be authority to combat the existence of      counterfeit, contraband and other illicit tobacco products.       The bill contains a number of other provisions that would      benefit the public health and provide important oversight for      all tobacco manufacturers. For example, FDA would be      authorized to: conduct educational efforts regarding the      dangers of tobacco use; take new steps to curb underage      tobacco use; strictly regulate new tobacco products that may      reduce the risk of disease or exposure to harmful compounds      in cigarette smoke; and ensure that tobacco products are not      adulterated.       As noted above, you have attempted to address the views of      a wide range of stakeholders in your FDA bill. We look      forward working with all stakeholders in order to make      progress on the many issues surrounding tobacco use in this      country. In particular, we believe it is imperative that the      plight of the American tobacco grower be addressed. We      believe it is time for a tobacco quota buyout and we hope to      be able to work with you and other stop make that a reality.       Your bill is a truly historic opportunity to establish, for      the first time, a comprehensive and coherent national tobacco      policy. Thank you for your leadership and for the hard work      of your staffs on this extremely important legislation.           Sincerely,                                                Steven C. Parrish.
