Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  With respect to the two appropriation bills that the gentleman has listed, the Homeland Security and the Interior, does the gentleman expect them to come on an open rule to the floor?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield, I would assume, without preempting what the Committee on Rules might do, that both appropriation bills would come under the normal, traditional rules that we have had in the past on appropriations bills, which is pretty open rules.
