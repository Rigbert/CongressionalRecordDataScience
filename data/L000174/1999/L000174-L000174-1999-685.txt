 Mr. President, I have spoken earlier about this. The Craig amendment, as drafted, dismisses pending and future lawsuits against some firearms dealers. And I say ``some,'' because the way it is drafted it is not clear, but it throws out State court cases, Federal court cases, gives blanket immunity. I think that goes to such special interests on gun legislation that we ought to reject it, even in this setting.  I yield the remainder of our time to the Senator from New York.
