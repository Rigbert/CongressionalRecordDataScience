President, together with colleagues in the Senate and the House, I am introducing the Independence at Home, IAH, Act. This legislation will help Medicare and our Nation improve the efficiency and effectiveness of spending on Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions. It will not only improve care for seniors suffering from serious illnesses but also save money.  Roughly 75 percent of the Nation's health care dollars are spent on chronic diseases. Yet spite this enormous investment, today's chronically ill only receive just over half, 56 percent, of the preventive and maintenance services that they need. Our Nation clearly needs to do better.  Recent Medicare demonstrations have shown that a number of key improvements could go a long way to help fix this situation: First, primary care physicians and key health professionals must assume more responsibility for care coordination; second, we need to target efforts at beneficiaries with multiple conditions; third, after-hours care needs to be available so people can access medical help when they need it and avoid calling 911; and finally, there must be better use of health information technology to help manage care.  The optimal way to address the challenges of caring for persons with chronic conditions is to better integrate their care. Medical problems are best managed and coordinated by health care professionals who know their patients, their problems, their medications, and their other health care providers. Using this approach, the IAH provides a better, more cost-effective way for Medicare patients with chronic conditions to get the care they need.  We do all these things in the legislation I am introducing along with colleagues in the Senate and House: Our bill would put in place a demonstration that improves at-home care availability for beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions to help people remain independent in their homes. Physicians would get paid better for managing care while at the same time they would be responsible for demonstrating at least 5 percent savings in the cost of their patients' care. The bill also includes minimum performance standards for patient health outcomes, and would measure patient, caregiver and provider satisfaction.  The Independence at Home Act establishes a three-year Medicare demonstration project that uses a patient-centered health care delivery model to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions can remain independent for as long as possible in a comfortable environment; advances Medicare reform by creating incentives for providers to develop better and lower cost health care for the highest cost beneficiaries; incorporates lessons from past Medicare demonstration projects; provides for physician and nurse practitioner-directed programs that hold providers accountable for quality, patient satisfaction, and mandatory annual minimum savings; and generates savings by providing better care to Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions and reducing duplicative and unnecessary services, hospitalization, and other health care costs.  The demonstration program will take place in the thirteen highest-cost states plus thirteen additional states. Persons eligible for the program include Medicare beneficiaries with functional impairments, two or more chronic health problems, and recent use of other health services. Each IAH patient will receive a comprehensive assessment at least annually. The assessment will inform a plan for care that is directed by an IAH physician or nurse-practitioner and developed in collaboration with the patient. Each patient will also have an IAH plan coordinator. Electronic medical records and health information technology will be employed to improve patient care. The IAH organization will be required to demonstrate savings of at least 5 percent annually compared with the costs of serving non-participating Medicare chronically ill beneficiaries. The IAH organization may keep 80 percent of savings beyond the required 5 percent savings as an incentive to maximize the financial benefits of being an IAH member.  I would like to thank my cosponsors in the House, Representatives Ed Markey, Chris Smith and Rahm Emanuel for their support, along with my fellow Senate cosponsors, Senators Barbara Mikulski, Benjamin Cardin and Sheldon Whitehouse. I would also like to thank all our staff who worked so hard on this legislation, particularly Gregory Hinrichsen in my office. Finally, we would like to thank the following groups for voicing their support for this legislation: the American Academy of Home Care Physicians; the AARP; the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners; the National Family Caregivers Association; the Family Caregiver Alliance/National Center on Caregiving; the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging; the Maryland-National Capital Home Care Association; the Visiting Nurse Associations of America, and Intel Corp.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation to help Medicare patients get better care at lower cost.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 3613       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Independence at Home Act of      2008''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) According to the November 2007 Congressional Budget      Office Long Term Outlook for Health Care Spending, unless      changes are made to the way health care is delivered, growing      demand for resources caused by rising health care costs and      to a lesser extent the nation's expanding elderly population      will confront Americans with increasingly difficult choices      between health care and other priorities. However,      opportunities exist to constrain health care costs without      adverse health care consequences.       (2) Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions      account for a disproportionate share of Medicare spending      compared to their representation in the overall Medicare      population, and evidence suggests that such patients often      receive poorly coordinated care, including conflicting      information from health providers and different diagnoses of      the same symptoms.       (3) People with chronic conditions account for 76 percent      of all hospital admissions, 88 percent of all prescriptions      filled, and 72 percent of physician visits.       (4) More than 60 percent of physicians treating patients      with chronic conditions believe that their training did not      adequately prepare them to coordinate in-home and community      services; educate patients with chronic conditions; manage      the psychological and social aspects of chronic care; provide      effective nutritional guidance; and manage chronic pain.       (5) Recent studies cited by the Congressional Budget Office      found substantial differences among regions of the country in      the cost to Medicare of treating beneficiaries with multiple      chronic conditions with lower cost regions experiencing      better outcomes and lower mortality rates. These studies have      suggested that Medicare spending could be reduced by 30      percent if more conservative practice styles were adopted,      however, the current Medicare fee-for-service program creates      incentives to provide fragmented, high cost health care      services.       (6) Studies show that hospital utilization and emergency      room visits for patients with multiple chronic conditions can      be reduced and significant savings can be achieved through      the use of interdisciplinary teams of health care      professionals caring for patients in their places of      residence.       (7) The Independence at Home program, designed to fund      better health care and improved health care technology      through savings it achieves, uses a patient-centered health      care delivery model to permit the growing number of Medicare      beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions to remain as      independent as possible for as long as possible and to      receive care in a setting that is preferred by the      beneficiary involved and the family of such beneficiary.       (8) The Independence at Home program begins Medicare reform      by creating incentives for practitioners and providers to      develop methods and technologies for providing better and      lower cost health care to the highest cost Medicare      beneficiaries with the greatest incentives provided in the      case of highest cost beneficiaries.       (9) The Independence at Home program incorporates lessons      learned from prior demonstration projects and phase I of the      Voluntary Chronic Care Improvement program under section 1807      of the Social Security Act, enacted in sections 721 and 722      of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and      Modernization Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-173).       (10) The Independence at Home Act provides for a chronic      care coordination demonstration for the highest cost Medicare      beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions that holds      providers accountable for quality outcomes, patient      satisfaction, and mandatory minimum savings on an annual      basis.       (11) The Independence at Home Act generates savings by      providing better, more coordinated care to the highest cost      Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions,      reducing duplicative and unnecessary services, and avoiding      unnecessary hospitalizations and emergency room visits.
