 Con. Res. 13       Whereas article I, section 8 of the United States      Constitution grants Congress the power to ``declare war'', to      ``lay and collect taxes'', to ``provide for the common      defence and general welfare of the United States'', to      ``raise and support armies'', to ``provide and maintain a      navy'', to ``make rules for the government and regulation of      the land and naval forces'', to ``provide for calling forth      the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress      insurrections and repel invasions'', to ``provide for      organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia'', and to      ``make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for      carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other      powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the      United States, or in any department or officer thereof'';       Whereas the Constitution also grants Congress exclusive      power over the purse, stating, ``No money shall be drawn from      the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by      law . . . .'';       Whereas the sole war power granted to the executive branch      through the President can be found in article II, section 2,      which states, ``The President shall be the Commander in Chief      of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia      of the several States, when called into the actual Service of      the United States . . . .'';       Whereas President George W. Bush and his Administration      have argued that this ``Commander in Chief'' clause grants      the President wide latitude to engage United States military      forces abroad without prior authorization from Congress;       Whereas the President further argues that previous      unilateral actions by Presidents of both political parties      add credence to this interpretation of the Constitution;       Whereas, in reality, nothing in the history of the      ``Commander in Chief'' clause suggests that the authors of      the provision intended it to grant the executive branch the      authority to engage United States forces in military action      without any prior authorization from Congress, except to      allow the President to repel sudden attacks and immediate      threats;       Whereas in the Federalist Paper Number 69, while comparing      the lesser war-making power of the President of the United      States with the war-making power of the King of Great      Britain, Alexander Hamilton wrote, ``The President is to be      commander in chief of the army and navy of the United States.      In this respect his authority would be nominally the same      with that of the king of Great Britain, but in substance much      inferior to it. It would amount to nothing more than the      supreme command and direction of the military and naval      forces, as first general and admiral of the confederacy;      while that of the British king extends to the declaring of      war, and to the raising and regulating of fleets and armies;      all which, by the constitution under consideration, would      appertain to the legislature.'';       Whereas James Madison declared that it is necessary to      adhere to the ``fundamental doctrine of the Constitution that      the power to declare war is fully and exclusively vested in      the legislature'';       Whereas, in 1793, President George Washington, when      considering how to protect inhabitants of the frontier of the      United States, instructed his Administration that ``no      offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until      after [Congress] have deliberated upon the subject, and      authorized such a measure'';       Whereas, in 1801, when Thomas Jefferson sent a small      squadron of frigates to the Mediterranean to protect against      possible attacks by the Barbary powers, he told Congress that      he was ``unauthorized by the Constitution, without the      sanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defense'', and      further noted that it was up to Congress to authorize      ``measures of offense also'';       Whereas, according to the most definitive United States      intelligence report, Iran is several years away from      developing a nuclear weapon, and even the most pessimistic      analysis by outside experts predicts that Iran is at least 3      years away from developing a nuclear weapon, assuming Iran      suffers no setbacks during development, which would be      unprecedented;       Whereas diplomatic efforts involving Iran, the United      States, the European Union, Russia, the People's Republic of      China, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the United      Nations Security Council continue; and       Whereas, despite these diplomatic efforts and statements by      President Bush and other members of his Administration that      diplomacy is the preferred route, there are an increasing      number of reports that preparations for war are underway:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That Congress--       (1) strongly affirms that initiating military action      against Iran without congressional approval does not fall      within the President's ``Commander in Chief'' powers under      the Constitution;       (2) rejects any suggestion that the Authorization for Use      of Military Force (Public Law 107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note),      approved in response to the terrorist attacks of September      11, 2001, explicitly or implicitly extends to authorizing      military action against Iran, including over its nuclear      program;       (3) rejects any suggestion that the Authorization for Use      of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (Public Law      107-243; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note) explicitly or implicitly      extends to authorizing military action against Iran,      including over its nuclear program; and       (4) strongly and unequivocally affirms that seeking      congressional authority prior to taking military action      against Iran is not discretionary, but is a legal and      constitutional requirement.
