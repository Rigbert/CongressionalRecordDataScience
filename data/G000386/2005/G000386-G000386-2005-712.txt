 President, I want to respond to the distinguished Chairman of the Budget Committee. Yesterday afternoon, my colleague responded to my defense of the merits of the Finance Committee title in Chairman Inhofe's substitute.  Since Chairman Gregg's response came shortly before the session ended last night, I am responding this morning.  I respect Chairman Gregg's efforts in his initial year as chairman of the Budget Committee. I congratulate him now as I have in the past on his victory in achieving a budget resolution. I was proud to support him in committee, on the floor, and in conference on the resolution.  As a senior member of the Budget Committee, I take its role seriously. I respect the Budget Act and the importance of the tools of fiscal discipline that points of order and other enforcement devices bring to the legislative process. I also respect the key role of the Budget Committee chairman and his staff under the Budget Act.  A careful and fair review of my statement will show that it is consistent with these long-held views. My statement did not claim that there was no valid Budget Act point of order against the Finance title of the Inhofe substitute. My statement did not question the authority of the Budget Committee chairman in raising the point order.  My statement responded to several very specific assertions against the Finance Committee title. One assertion, made quite passionately by Chairman Gregg, was that the Finance Committee amendment was a product of accounting gimmicks. Another assertion was that the amendment was not offset. I responded to the two main assertions ad relied on the Congress' official tax policy scorekeepter, the Joint Committee on Taxation. Chairman Gregg is right that, under the Budget Act, it is the Chairman Budget Committee chairman that the Senate parliamentarian looks to determine whether a point of order is well-founded. The Joint Committee on Taxation, however, determines the scoring of revenue measures.  I will not go into the other points of disagreement in our statements because the statements speak for themselves.  In sum and substance, my statement defended the Finance Committee title on its scoring by the Joint Committee. My statement did not dispute that the amendment spending level was above those contemplated by the Budget Resolution or the spending level agreed to by the administration and congressional Republican leadership. Of course, Finance Committee jurisdiction extends only to the cash flow of the Highway Trust Fund. The Finance Committee title added additional cash inflow, trust fund receipts, and additional cash outflow, trust fund outlays. The Finance Committee title balances additional trust fund receipts and outlays. That was the job we were asked to do and we did it in a fiscally responsible manner.  Mr. McCONNELL.
