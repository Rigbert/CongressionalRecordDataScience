 I appreciate them very much.  Mr. President, last year I supported both these amendments. In the ensuing year, I have come to think a lot about it. It is a long time before ratification, even if a balanced budget amendment is passed. And when people, beginning with 40 million and then 60 million, then 70 million, then 80 million Americans on Social Security understand what the impact of this amendment is, it is my very deep belief that it will not be ratified. I view the use of Social Security surplus revenues as a major flaw in the balanced budget amendment, but it is a flaw that can be corrected by this amendment.  In 1990, this very body, by a vote of 98-2, voted to take it off budget. They said:       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts      and disbursements of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors      Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance      Trust Fund shall not be counted as new budget authority,      outlays, receipts, or deficit or surplus for purposes of       (1) the budget of the United States,       (2) the congressional budget, or,       (3) the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act      of 1985.  This body voted for it 98-2. And in the ensuing days, this body is going to reverse their opinion. One must ask why? Why are we doing this?                               FICA Taxes  Let me talk for a moment about FICA taxes and what they are.  By the year 2017, $3 trillion of FICA tax reserves meant to pay for the retirements of American workers will be used instead to balance the budget. This is unconscionable.  If Congress is going to use FICA taxes that are meant for retirements for another purpose other than retirements, we should cut the FICA tax to eliminate the surplus so people do not see their FICA taxes misused.  FICA taxes were raised in 1977 and 1983 so the Social Security system would run surpluses. It was changed at that point from a pay-as-you-go system to a system that would bank surpluses for the future.  Why was that done? It was done because the actuarial tables showed there was going to be a major baby boomer generation retiring in the not to distant future and the revenues, as projected, would not be adequate to meet their retirements. Therefore, it was thought by this esteemed body that we should increase retirement taxes so that moneys could accrue and there would, therefore, be enough money to meet the retirement needs of the baby boomer generation.  What has changed is we found that even without this amendment, downstream, after the year 2018, the Social Security system will run into trouble. There still will not be enough money. But, if these dollars are used to balance the budget, the system is going to run into trouble much more rapidly. By 2002 nearly $1 trillion will be used and by 2017, nearly $3 trillion if we don't start saving these Social Security surpluses.  There are those who say, ``That's OK, we'll use the revenues. It will force us to make necessary changes in the system.'' I agree we have to make some changes in the system. If you raise FICA tax, if you means test it, whatever you do with it, some changes are going to happen.  But to use the reserves to fund health, to use FICA taxes to fund the Interior Department, the Agriculture Department, defense, and interest on the debt and other Government programs, is just plain wrong.  Over 58 percent of working Americans today pay more in FICA taxes if you put in the employer share than they do in Federal taxes. This is not a small amount. This tax is not adjusted by salary. Everyone pays a flat tax of 6.2 percent up to $61,200 of income and the employer matches it with 6.2 percent. For a worker who makes $25,000, his share is $1,550. Combined with the employer tax, it is $3,100. For a worker who makes $35,000, when you combine it with the employer's share, it is $4,340. Go up another $10,000 to $45,000 and combine it, it is $5,580. Go up another $10,000 to $55,000 and combine it and it begins to grow, it is $6,000 a year. And for every worker who makes more than $61,200, combined it is $7,588.  That is a lot of money at any income level. If it is being saved for retirement, then it is like an annuity: That's fine. You pay in funds and you get them out when you retire. But if it is being spent on Government, then it is just another expensive tax on working Americans, and then we ought to do the right thing and reduce the FICA tax if we are going to do this.                       Social Security Amendment  The debate over this amendment to exclude Social Security from the constitutional balanced budget amendment is not complicated. It is very simple. The issue is: Does Congress want to take the funds generated by the FICA tax for Social Security, meant for a worker's future retirement, and use it to balance the budget? Or does Congress want to balance the budget honestly?  I hope that whatever else our disagreements are, we can all agree that Social Security revenues from the FICA tax should not be misused to balance the budget.  My problem with this constitutional amendment is that by including Social Security in the amendment, it does not only permit the use of the Social Security trust funds to balance the budget, but it mandates it by including those funds in the budget calculations. The amendment before us, in effect, enshrines the use of Social Security to balance the budget in the Constitution of the United States. Do we really want to do that? I think not.  So the debate really is not over who wants to protect Social Security and who does not. It is about who wants to be honest with the American people in our budgeting and our fiscal policy and who does not. Because to be honest, Social Security should remain off budget.  Ninety-eight Members of this very body voted to do that in 1990. Including it in the budget would be an enormous loophole. It is not the Federal Government's money, and it should not be used as if it were.                        [[Page S2364]] Rebuttals  Let me respond to four arguments raised against this Social Security amendment.                               Charge One  Excluding Social Security would make it harder to balance the budget.  That is true. Taking Social Security off budget does require more spending cuts, about $3 trillion of them by the year 2017, because all of this money will be used to balance the budget. But the alternative of leaving it on budget is basically stealing from Social Security to avoid spending cuts.  There is nothing magical, as the distinguished Senator from Florida pointed out, about the year 2002. Somebody just sat down and decided we have to do this by the year 2002. The Sun is not going to refuse to come up in the year 2003 or 2004 or 2005 or 2006 or 2007. If people are really concerned that we need to use Social Security revenues or you cannot balance the budget, then it is simple: Extend the time line out to 2005 or 2007 rather than loot Social Security.  If a man runs short on money one month, the law does not allow him to steal from his neighbor to make ends meet. But this amendment allows the Federal Government to steal from Social Security to meet its obligations. How is that right?                               Charge Two  It is unprecedented to put a statute in the Constitution of the United States.  I have heard that mentioned time and time again on this very floor.  Now, of course, it is true, it is unprecedented. It is also true that it is unprecedented to put the Nation's fiscal policy into the Constitution. And if we decide that this Nation needs the strong medicine of a balanced budget amendment, then we better be sure that the amendment is drawn deeply enough and widely enough to represent some of these concerns.  The legislation before you is narrowly drawn, and it specifies that only those funds used to provide old age and survivors and disabilities benefits are involved. So it is not a loophole.  The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, whom I deeply respect, has said, well, a game will be played if we put the words Social Security in the Constitution. Education moneys will be called Social Security moneys. The amendment is drafted to be specific, to prevent this from happening, and it does.  Now, Chairman Hatch has also said that no one wants to use Social Security revenues to balance the budget, and we could protect them in implementation legislation or by some other resolution.  I initially thought, well, maybe that is a great idea. If we can do it that way, why not do it. And so we asked the Congressional Research Service, if that could be done.  I wish to read the reply I received. This is what it says:       If the proposed amendment was ratified, then Congress would      appear to be without the authority to exclude the Social      Security trust funds from the calculations of total receipts      and outlays under section 1 of the balanced budget amendment.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the communication from the American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service be printed in full in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Congressional Research Service,                                      The Library of Congress,                                 Washington, DC, February 6, 1995.     To: Senator Dianne Feinstein (Attention: Mark Kadesh).     From: American Law Division.     Subject: Whether the Social Security trust funds can be          excluded from the calculations required by the proposed          balanced budget amendment.       This is to respond to your request to evaluate whether      Congress could by statute or resolution provide that certain      outlays or receipts would not be included within the term      ``total outlays and receipts'' as used in the proposed      Balance Budget Amendment. Specifically, you requested an      analysis as to whether the Federal Old-Age and Survivors      Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance      Trust Fund could be exempted from the calculation necessary      to determine compliance with the constitutional amendment      proposed in H.J. Res. 1, which provides that total      expenditures will not exceed total outlays.\1\       Section 1 of H.J. Res. 1, as placed on the Senate Calendar,      provides that total outlays for any fiscal year will not      exceed total receipts for that fiscal year, unless authorized      by three-fifths of the whole number of each House of      Congress. The resolution also states that total receipts      shall include all receipts of the United States Government      except those derived from borrowing, and that total outlays      shall include all outlays of the United States Government      except for those used for repayment of debt principal. These      requirements can be waived during periods of war or serious      threats to national security.       Under the proposed language, it would appear that the      receipts received by the United States which go to the      Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the      Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund would be included in      the calculations of total receipts, and that payments from      those funds would similarly be considered in the calculation      of total outlays. This is confirmed by the House Report      issued with H.J. Res. 1.\2\ Thus, if the proposed amendment      was ratified, then Congress would appear to be without the      authority to exclude the Social Security Trust Funds from the      calculations of total receipts and outlays under section 1 of      the amendment.\3\                                                        Kenneth R. Thomas,                      Legislative Attorney, American Law Division.                               footnotes     \1\H.J. Res. 1, 104th Congress, 1st Sess. (January 27, 1995)      provides the following proposed constitutional amendment--     Section 1. Total outlays for any fiscal year shall not exceed      total receipts for that fiscal year, unless three-fifths of      the whole number of each House of Congress shall provide by      law for a specific excess of outlays over receipts by a      rollcall vote.     Section 2. The limit on the debt of the United States held by      the public shall not be increased, unless three-fifths of the      whole number of each House shall provide by law for such an      increase by a rollcall vote.     Section 3. Prior to each fiscal year, the President shall      transmit to the Congress a proposed budget for the United      States Government for that fiscal year in which total outlays      do not exceed total receipts.     Section 4. No bill to increase revenue shall become law      unless approved by a majority of the whole number of each      House by a rollcall vote.     Section 5. The Congress may waive the provisions of this      article for any fiscal year in which a declaration of war is      in effect. The provisions of this article may be waived for      any fiscal year in which the United States is engaged in      military conflict which causes an imminent and serious      military threat to national security and is so declared by a      joint resolution, adopted by a majority of the whole number      of each House, which becomes law.     Section 6. The Congress shall enforce and implement this      article by appropriate legislation, which may rely on      estimates of outlays and receipts.     Section 7. Total receipts shall include all receipts of the      United States Government except those derived from borrowing.      Total outlays shall include all outlays of the United States      Government except for those for repayment of debt principal.     Section 8. This article shall take effect beginning with      fiscal year 2002 or with the second fiscal year beginning      after its ratification, whichever is later.     \2\House Rept. 104-3, 104th Congress, 1st Session states the      following:     The Committee concluded that exempting Social Security from      computations of receipts and outlays would not be helpful to      Social Security beneficiaries. Although Social Security      accounts are running a surplus at this time, the situation is      expected to change in the future with a Social Security      related deficit developing. If we exclude Social Security      from balanced budget computations, Congress will not have to      make adjustments elsewhere in the budget to compensate for      this projected deficit * * *. Id. at 11.     It should also be noted that an amendment by Representative      Frank to exempt the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance      Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund      from total receipts and total outlays was defeated in      committee by a 16-19 rollcall vote. Id. at 14. A similar      amendment by Representative Conyers was defeated in the      House, 141 Cong. Rec. H741 (daily ed. January 23, 1995), as      was an amendment by Representative Wise. Id. at H731.     \3\Although the Congress is given the authority to implement      this article by appropriate legislation, there is no      indication that the Congress would have the authority to pass      legislation which conflicts with the provisions of the      amendment.
