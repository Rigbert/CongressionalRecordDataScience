I thank Mr. Kelly for his very strong statement.  More people now recognize, especially through ultrasound, that birth is an event, not the beginning of life. Increasingly, because the methods of abortion are so horrific--literal dismemberment of the baby, chemical poisoning--people are waking up. Abortion is violence against children and injurious to women.  Again, I thank the gentleman for his commitment to life.  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).
