Mr. Speaker, as Ghandi once said, ``Noncooperation with evil is as much a moral imperative as is cooperation with good.'' Over the course of the last week, I have stood on this House floor and called repeatedly for the release of the outside counsel report on the ethical violation of Speaker Newt Gingrich.  My colleague, the gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Linder], has stood repeatedly to object to my speaking about this matter. I understand why the gentleman would not want me to discuss this issue; it does such little good for his friend, the Speaker.  Mr. Speaker, sometimes the rules must be confronted in the face of injustice. This was the case when I participated in the sit-ins and the freedom rides of the 1960's, and it is true today regarding the outside counsel report.  Mr. Speaker, today, once again, the Members of this House have a chance to vote for the release of the outside counsel report. I urge Members to support my resolution. To do otherwise is to risk being accused of participating in a Newt Gingrich ethics coverup.                          ____________________
