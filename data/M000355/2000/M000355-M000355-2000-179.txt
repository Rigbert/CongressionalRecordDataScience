 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the late Fred Capps and to offer condolences to his wife, Cathy, and their two young children, John and Lydia.  Commonwealth's Attorney Fred Capps lost his life fighting for the people he represented each day in the courtroom. Kentucky Senate President David Williams, a longtime friend of Mr. Capps, said it best: ``He died a hero, protecting his family. He was defending his home and his children, and he didn't go down easy.'' As a prosecutor for Adair, Casey, Cumberland and Monroe counties, Mr. Capps was devoted to bringing criminals to justice. He gave his time and energy to protect the victims who needed his help and, in the end, he gave his life for their sake as well. I have a tremendous amount of respect for the sacrifices Mr. Capps made, and I am deeply saddened that such a fine Kentuckian has been lost.  Since this tragedy occurred, people across the State of Kentucky have spoken out in fond remembrance of Mr. Capps. Many have spoken about his reputation as a skilled prosecutor, and about his genuine concern for finding justice for innocent victims. But Mr. Capps also is remembered for the many hours he served as a volunteer and coach for the Burkesville Little League, and for his example as a committed family man. He was a devoted husband and father, loyal friend, community leader, and gifted attorney.  At times such as this, I am reminded of the fragility of life and the importance of family. From all accounts, Mr. Capps understood and valued these things while he was alive and has left a legacy of excellence for his children to remember. Hopefully it will be a comfort to the family and friends Mr. Capps leaves behind to know that he was loved and admired by so many in his community and throughout the entire State. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, we offer our deepest condolences to his loved ones, and express our gratitude for all Mr. Capps contributed to the counties he served, the State of Kentucky, and to our great Nation.                          ____________________
