President, I am pleased to introduce today with my respected colleague from Indiana, Senator Lugar, a bill designed to improve the health of our Nation's schoolchildren. I am also pleased to have the support of Senators Bingaman, Dodd and Jeffords, who have worked with me in past Congresses on this bill. I am hopeful that in the coming weeks many more Senators will join us in this important effort.  We have an obesity crisis in America. Too many children are gaining too much weight. Advertisements for soda and candy bombard them from television, vending machines, and grocery store aisles. Schools, however, should be a healthy refuge from the outside world, where kids can learn to make the right choices when it comes to their diets. Nutrition education needs to be a critical component of every child's school day. But with all of the funds that Congress rightly appropriates each year for nutrition education and healthy school lunches and meals, our Nation's efforts are severely undermined when children have to walk through a gauntlet of vending machines offering unhealthy choices on the way to the cafeteria.  Under current regulations, schools may not offer soda, hard candies or other foods of minimal nutritional value in the cafeteria during lunch or breakfast. Unfortunately, some private companies have offered schools signing bonuses to openly flout this restriction, at times lining the halls to the cafeterias with foods that provide absolutely no nutritional value. In February 2001, the Washington Post reported that a school in Maryland had signed a contract with a soda company that contained a clause forbidding the school from enforcing the Federal ban on soda machines in schools. The clause read ``If the Board of Education actively enforces the policy in which vending machines are turned off during the school day, the commission guarantee will be suspended.'' In other words, the schools could only get commissions from the vending machines if they broke the law.  We can not sell our children's health to the highest bidder on a sodas contract. That is why our bill would give the Secretary of Agriculture authority to more effectively restrict the sale of soft drinks and other foods of minimal nutritional value in schools that participate in the Federal school lunch program. We would give the Secretary authority to regulate these foods throughout the school grounds, until the end of the school lunch period. Our bill also mandates that the Secretary use the best science available to determine which foods provide no nutritional value. My bill will ensure that students are not substituting empty calorie sodas and snacks for their nutritious federally subsidized school meals.  According to a report issued by the Center for Science and the Public Interest, 20 years ago boys consumed more than twice as much milk as soda; now boys and girls drink twice as much soda as milk. This is a huge problem, particularly for girls--the teenage years are critical for building up a woman's lifetime supply of calcium. Girls who substitute soda for milk are at a greater risk for developing osteoporosis later in life. We must provide our kids with better options. I have no problem with vending machines themselves, but let's get vending machines that sell fresh milk, fruits and vegetables into our schools.  Senator Lugar and I have successfully worked together on many important issues relating to child nutrition and agriculture in the past. I am extremely pleased that we can work together again to create healthier schools and healthier children.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Better Nutrition for Schoolchildren Act of 2003 be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1007       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Better Nutrition for School      Children Act of 2003''.     SEC. 2. FOODS OF MINIMAL NUTRITIONAL VALUE.

Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.).       (3) Procedure.--The promulgation of the regulations and the      administration of the amendments made by this section shall      be made without regard to chapter 35 of title 44, United      States Code (commonly known as the ``Paperwork Reduction      Act'').
