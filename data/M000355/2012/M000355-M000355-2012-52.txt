 President, I believe I have the floor.  That is the point. What the majority leader is saying is he will break the rules of the Senate in order to change the rules of the Senate. It has been the case in the past that it took a supermajority of 67, which of course meant most rules changes occurred because the two leaders agreed to them and were proposing them jointly. Instead, what the majority leader is saying is he will propose to change the rules with 51 votes, meaning his side gets to decide what the rules are.
