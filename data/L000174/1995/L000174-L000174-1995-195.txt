President, this week representatives of over 50 governments began meeting in Vienna, Austria to discuss proposals to amend the Conventional Weapons Convention, which contains the first laws of war limitations on the use of landmines.  Fifteen years ago, the United States played a leading role in negotiations on the Convention. However, despite lofty rhetoric at the time, the Convention is so riddled with loopholes and exceptions, as well as lacking any verification procedures, that the numbers of civilian casualties from landmines has soared. This is because the focus of the negotiations then was on reducing the dangers to military personnel, rather than on the problems landmines cause for civilians.  Today, there are 80 to 110 million landmines in over 60 countries, each one waiting to explode from the pressure of a footstep.  These hidden killers have turned vast areas of land, in countries struggling to rebuild after years of war, into death traps. According to the State Department every 22 minutes someone is maimed or killed by a landmine. That is 26,000 people each year, most of whom are innocent civilians.  It would cost tens of billions of dollars to locate and remove the mines. It is an incredibly arduous, dangerous, and prohibitively expensive task. There is no way they will be cleared. The world's arsenals are overflowing with new mines that are only compounding the problem in every armed conflict today.  Mr. President, the meetings in Vienna began yesterday with dramatic announcements by two of our NATO allies, France and Austria. The French Government announced that it would halt all production of antipersonnel landmines, and begin destroying their stockpiles of these weapons. The Austrian Government declared that its military would renounce their use, and destroy their stockpiles.  Earlier this year, Belgium outlawed all production, use and exports of antipersonnel mines.  I mention this because just a month ago, my amendment to impose a 1-year moratorium on the use of these weapons passed the Senate 67 to 27.  Yesterday's announcements by our NATO allies go even further, and the United States should seize this opportunity to support them. These NATO countries defy the Pentagon's assertion that modern militaries like ours require antipersonnel landmines. Landmines are a coward's weapon, that are overwhelmingly used against civilians. If the United States were to join France, Belgium and Austria it would give an enormous push toward the goal of ridding the world of these weapons.  Mr. President, I am going to put my full statement in the Record, but I do want to say this. This conference in Vienna presents the United States with a tremendous opportunity, an opportunity that must not be missed.  Fifteen years ago the Conventional Weapons Convention was signed with much fanfare, but it has turned out to be worth little more than the paper it was printed on. Today, there are hundreds of thousands of people dead or maimed by landmines, the very weapon that Convention was intended to control.  We have seen the immense devastation landmines cause, and continue to cause, around the world. Each day, another 70 people are killed or horribly mutilated. The undeniable truth is that antipersonnel landmines cannot be controlled. They are too cheap to make, too easy to transport and conceal. They are the ``Saturday night specials'' of civil wars, and they have become one of the world's greatest scourges.  Last September at the United Nations, President Clinton took a courageous step, when he called for the eventual elimination of antipersonnel mines. My amendment was a small step toward that goal.  Its purpose was not unilateral disarmament, as some in the Pentagon would have one believe, but leadership. Leadership by the world's only superpower with a military arsenal that dwarfs that of any other nation, to stop the senseless slaughter of tens of thousands of innocent people. By setting an example, we can lead others to take similar action, just as our European allies announced steps yesterday that we should imitate.  The amendment that won the bipartisan support of two thirds of the Senate should be a model for our negotiators in Vienna. I only wish these negotiations were being held in Cambodia, or Angola, where the one-legged victims of landmines can be seen on every street corner.  I wish the negotiators could experience the constant fear of losing a leg, or an arm, or a child, simply from stepping in the wrong place. Instead of weeks of lofty speeches in air conditioned room quibbling over an elaborate set of unenforceable rules, I think we would see dramatic progress toward a ban on these weapons.  Let us not repeat the mistake of a decade and a half ago. Let us finally recognize that there are some weapons that are so indiscriminate, so inhumane, and so impossible to control, that they should be banned altogether. Let us finally do what we say, and stop this when we have the chance.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a New York Times article about the French Government's announcement.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows;                [From the New York Times Sept. 27, 1995      Paris to Scrap Some Land Mines In Face of Growing Sentiment       Vienna, Sept. 26.--France announced today that it would      stop production and export of all antipersonnel mines and      begin to destroy its stocks.       Xavier Emmanuelli, the French secretary of state for      emergency humanitarian actions, said at a conference in      Vienna that France was determined to carry on its struggle      against mines, which caused a ``humanitarian catastrophe.''       ``To further this end, France has decided to adopt a      moratorium on the production of all types of antipersonnel      mines,'' Mr. Emmanuelli told delegates. ``We shall also halt      the production of these weapons.''       Furthermore, he added, ``France will as of now begin to      reduce its stocks of antipersonnel mines by destroying      them.''       The Vienna conference is reviewing a 1980 convention on      weapons that are deemed to be indiscriminate or excessively      injurious. It will also be discussing laser weapons that      blind people exposed to them.       The United Nations Secretary General, Boutros Boutros-     Ghali, called for a total ban on land mines, which he said      killed or maimed thousands of civilians each year.       He acknowledged that the conference was unlikely to outlaw      land mines completely but urged participating countries to at      least establish an export moratorium.       In a videotaped message, the United Nations chief said      1,600 people would be killed or wounded in mine blasts around      the world during the time the conference was being held. It      ends Oct. 13.       Mr. Boutros-Ghali said several countries had already heeded      a call by the General Assembly to establish an export      moratorium and he urged the conference to back an export ban      to states that had not yet ratified the 1980 convention.       France's move, which does not cover antitank mines, is      likely to increase pressure on countries that are still      exporting mines.       The United States banned mine exports three years ago.       Belgium, Denmark, Norway and Sweden backed Mr. Boutros-     Ghali's call for a total ban.
