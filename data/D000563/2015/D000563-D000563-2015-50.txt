President, for those who are keeping score, this is the 17th time that the Senate will be asked by the Republicans to vote to end ObamaCare, and they have added to this to defund Planned Parenthood. As one individual said the other day, here is a breakthrough press release: President Barack Obama is not going to end ObamaCare. That seems pretty obvious. So this is a political exercise. It doesn't solve the problems of America. It doesn't even address the problems of America.  The Affordable Care Act finds health insurance for 17 million Americans. We have reduced the number of uninsured Americans by 45 percent with this bill. The Republicans have opposed it from the start, never providing a single vote in support, never willing to sit down after it was passed to talk about changes that would make it even stronger or better. They want to end it. It is ObamaCare. It has the President's name on it--enough said for many of them. They want it to go away.  The reality is if it goes away, so does health insurance protection for millions of Americans. So you would expect that the Grand Old Party, the Republican Party, would have an alternative for us, right? Wrong. They have never come forward with any alternative that would provide coverage for these millions of Americans and the others who should have health insurance coverage as well. It just tells you that they are prepared to go back to the bad old days before ObamaCare and the Affordable Care Act.  Remember those days? Remember when a health insurance company could say to you: Sorry, you happen to have a sick child in your family, and we are not going to give you health insurance. Preexisting conditions were enough to say no, and if they said yes, it was at a premium that an average family couldn't even consider. We ended that discrimination against families and sick children. We ended it.  The Republicans today want to go back to those good old days when health insurance companies could turn you down in a New York minute and say: There will be no health insurance for you or your kids. They want to go back to those good old days. They are wrong.  They want to go back to the days when a family's health insurance plan wouldn't cover the graduate from college until he reached the age of 26. That is what the Affordable Care Actdoes. It says that a family can keep that youngster--young man or woman--on their health insurance plan for their family while they are looking for a job, serving an internship or have a part-time opportunity.  I will tell you, as a father who has raised three children, I can remember those days after college when those kids didn't have coverage, and I used to ask them about that. I asked my daughter, Jennifer: Do you have health insurance now? She said: Dad, I don't need it; I feel just fine. That is not what a father wants to hear. The Republicans want to return to those good old days when those young men and women, after just having graduated from college, had to buy their own health insurance and couldn't stay on the family plan.  What about senior citizens with prescription drugs? The Affordable Care Act, which they want to repeal, helped seniors pay for their prescription drugs. They want to go back to the bad old days when seniors had a gap in coverage and had to go to their lifesavings to buy lifesaving prescription drugs. Those are the good old days that the Republicans want to return to. Well, those days weren't so good, and they certainly shouldn't return.  We have seen for the last 5 years the slowest rate of increase in health care costs in the last several decades. We have slowed down that rate of growth. We can do better. We should work together to do better on a bipartisan basis.  But instead, we are faced with a 17th vote by Republicans in the Senate to eliminate ObamaCare, to return to the old days of discrimination because of preexisting conditions and to take your kids who have graduated from college off your family health insurance plan. That is what they want to go back to.  America is not going to let that happen. Thank goodness this President won't let that happen. But we are going to waste several days on the floor of the Senate while they go through speeches that have been carefully rehearsed and delivered 17 different times with the same ultimate result, and nothing is going to happen. Instead, they should join us in a bipartisan effort to make the Affordable Care Act even stronger, fairer, and to help people have affordability and access to health insurance.                       Shooting in San Bernardino  Mr. President, earlier today there was a mass shooting in San Bernardino, CA. News reports are saying that up to three heavily armed gunmen attacked a social services center that helps developmentally disabled people and their families in the community.  Preliminary reports say that there have been 14 people killed and 14 wounded, although we don't know the exact number yet. There are videos of wounded people actually lying in the streets. The suspects apparently fled the scene in a black SUV, and a manhunt is underway.  This story is horrific, but it is also horribly familiar. There have been over 350 mass shootings in America this year. On average, 297 Americans are shot every single day, 89 fatally. Listen to this grim and sad statistic: There have been over 50 school shootings this year in America.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and first responders in San Bernardino. But they and all the victims across our country deserve more than our thoughts and prayers. They deserve action. It is time for Congress--in a level-headed, commonsense moment--to vote on and pass legislation to protect innocent people across America from this horrific gun violence.                            Syrian Refugees  Mr. President, I don't know if it was George Washington who said--although I think he is given the credit--when describing this institution of the Senate: It is the saucer that cools the tea.  I served in the House for 14 years and was proud to do it. We were elected every 2 years. It was a more volatile atmosphere because we were constantly running for reelection. The Senate is a different institution, with 6-year terms and a little more reflection, I hope, in what we do. I hope that we take the time that is necessary to exercise our constitutional opportunity here and think things over clearly and not react emotionally.  Well, it was about 2 weeks ago when the House of Representatives took action on the Syrian refugees and passed a measure that would give what they called a pause to receiving Syrian refugees in the United States. It was a heated moment. It was after the terrible tragedies that occurred in Paris and Beirut, and there were concerns about ISIL and the spread of their terrorist ways around the world. It was an emotional moment that really needs some reflection.  The simple fact of the matter is this. Over the last 4 years, during the course of the Syrian war, the United States has received about 2,000 refugees from Syria into our country. It is an elaborate, lengthy process.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an article from last weekend's New York Times, which outlines all of the steps that need to be taken in order for a Syrian refugee to enter the United States, printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Nov. 20, 2015]      Why It Takes Two Years for Syrian Refugees To Enter the U.S.                  (By Haeyoun Park and Larry Buchanan)       Syrians must pass many layers of security checks before      being admitted to the United States, a process that can take      two years or longer. In most cases, the refugees do not enter      the United States until the very end. They are also subject      to an additional layer of checks beyond those for refugees of      other nationalities; after the Paris attacks, the House voted      to further tighten screening procedures. Since 2011, the      United States has admitted fewer than 2,000 Syrian refugees.       1. Registration with the United Nations.       2. Interview with the United Nations.       3. Refugee status granted by the United Nations.       4. Referral for resettlement in the United States. The      United Nations decides if the person fits the definition of a      refugee and whether to refer the person to a country for      resettlement. Only the most vulnerable are referred,      accounting for fewer than 1 percent of refugees worldwide.      Some people spend years waiting in refugee camps.       5. Interview with State Department contractors.       6. First background check.       7. Higher-level background check for some.       8. Another background check. The refugee's name is run      through law enforcement and intelligence databases for      terrorist or criminal history. Some go through a higher-level      clearance before they can continue. A third background check      was introduced in 2008 for Iraqis but has since been expanded      to all refugees ages 14 to 65.       9. First fingerprint screening; photo taken.       10. Second fingerprint screening.       11. Third fingerprint screening. The refugee's fingerprints      are screened against F.B.I. and Homeland Security databases,      which contain watch list information and past immigration      encounters, including if the refugee previously applied for a      visa at a United States embassy. Fingerprints are also      checked against those collected by the Defense Department      during operations in Iraq.       12. Case reviewed at United States immigration      headquarters.       13. Some cases referred for additional review. Syrian      applicants must undergo these two additional steps. Each is      reviewed by a United States Citizenship and Immigration      Services refugee specialist. Cases with ``national security      indicators'' are given to the Homeland Security Department's      fraud detection unit.       14. Extensive, in-person interview with Homeland Security      officer. Most of the interviews with Syrian refugees have      been done in Amman, Jordan and in Istanbul.       15. Homeland Security approval is required. If the House      bill becomes law, the director of the F.B.I., the Homeland      Security secretary and the director of national intelligence      would be required to confirm that the applicant poses no      threat.       16. Screening for contagious diseases.       17. Cultural orientation class.       18. Matched with an American resettlement agency.       19. Multi-agency security check before leaving for the      United States. Because of the long amount of time between the      initial screening and departure, officials conduct a final      check before the refugee leaves for the United States.       20. Final security check at an American airport.       Sources: State Department; Department of Homeland Security;      Center for American Progress; U.S. Committee for Refugees and      Immigrants.
