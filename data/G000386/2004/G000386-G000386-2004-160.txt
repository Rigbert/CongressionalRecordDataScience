 The IRS Free File Program is a direct result of the goal that Congress set for the IRS to have 80 percent of returns filed electronically by 2007. The partnership agreement calls for the Free File Alliance to provide free tax preparation and filing to at least 60 percent of all taxpayers or approximately 78 million individuals who file an individual tax return. Each participating software company has its own eligibility requirements. The eligibility requirements ensure that lower income, disadvantaged and under-served taxpayers benefit from the free file program with the Free File Alliance, LLC. The provision in the bill was intended to ensure that the taxpayers participating in the Free File Program were affirmatively consenting to solicitation for other products or services. I look forward to working with him to ensure that we continue to promote such public-private partnerships.
