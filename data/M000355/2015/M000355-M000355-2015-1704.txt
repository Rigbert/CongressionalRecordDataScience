 President, I rise today to mourn the passing of a great Kentuckian and an American hero, Col. Dewey Lee Smith. Colonel Smith of Fairdale, KY, was a U.S. Air Force veteran. He passed away on February 9, 2015, and was 85 years old.  Colonel Smith bravely served his country during the Vietnam war and was taken prisoner on June 2, 1967, as an F-105 pilot who was forced to eject over North Vietnam. He was held as a POW and not released until March 4, 1973, near the end of the Vietnam war. He spent 2,103 days in captivity and was released during Operation Homecoming.  Colonel Smith was not reluctant to talk about his POW experience, and often spoke about it on Veterans Day at area churches. He also frequently spoke to newly commissioned military officers at Fort Knox.  Among Colonel Smith's many various medals, awards, and decorations, he received the Silver Star, the Distinguished Flying Cross, and the Purple Heart. He later received a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster, in lieu of a second Silver Star, for gallantry while a POW.  Colonel Smith was born, fittingly, on Veterans Day in 1929 in Louisville. He played football at Fairdale High School and was a linebacker and a fullback on the football team at Western Kentucky University.  He was commissioned as a second lieutenant through the Air Force ROTC program at Western Kentucky in 1953. He was awarded his pilot wings at Vance AFB, OK, in June 1954. He served in South Korea, and at the time of his capture he was stationed in Thailand.  In his retirement, Colonel Smith could frequently be seen playing golf at South Park Country Club, and he served at least once as the grand marshal of the Fairdale Fair parade. He will be greatly missed by his wife Elaine, his sons Dewey Smith Jr., Jonathan Smith, and Joshua Russell Smith, and his daughters Vicki Boyd and Sandra Smith. I know my U.S. Senate colleagues join me in expressing condolences to Colonel Smith's family.  The Louisville Courier-Journal published an obituary for Colonel Smith. I ask unanimous consent that said obituary be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the obituary was ordered to appear as follows:                        Colonel Dewey Lee Smith                                Obituary       Smith, Colonel Dewey Lee, 85, passed while in the nursing      home in Luverne, AL, on February 9, 2015. A highly decorated      veteran of the Cold War and the Vietnam War and a POW of the      Vietnam War, he was awarded numerous medals for valor and      citations for achievement including but not limited to the      Silver Star (2), Legion of Merit, Distinguished Flying Cross      for Valor (2), Bronze Star for Valor, Purple Heart (2), and      Prisoner of War Medal.       Colonel Smith was a courageous, honorable and loyal airman,      as well as a patient and loving father, a humble family man,      and a faithful servant of God. He married Elaine Hall in      Glenwood, Alabama in 1974. As a natural at the game of      football, he coached little league, played his senior year at      Fairdale High School in Fairdale, Kentucky and received a      scholarship to play at Western Kentucky, where he played from      1948 to 1953, and served as a student coach in 1953.       Colonel Smith was born on November 11, 1929 in Louisville,      KY, to John and Edna Smith.       He is survived by his wife of 40 years, Elaine Hall Smith;      his daughters, Vicki Boyd of Chattanooga and Sandy Smith of      Louisville; his sons, Lieutenant Colonel Dewey L. Smith, Jr.      ``Chip'' of Missoula, MT, Captain Jonathan Smith (April) and      Sergeant Joshua Smith (Samlong) of Louisville; his      grandchildren, Mike, Halle, Mahalia, Kaden, Kellan, Samara,      and Serena; his sister, Mildred Davis of Shepherdsville; and      many nieces and nephews who adored their Uncle Dewey. Colonel      Dewey was preceded in death by his parents, John and Edna;      his brothers, Homer Smith and Johnny Ray Smith (Louisville),      Cedar Smith of Charlestown, IN; his sisters, Alice Oney of      Louisville, Elizabeth Trotter of Chattanooga, and Mary      Stewart of Evarts, KY; daughter, Donna.       A viewing will take place at Fairdale-McDaniel Funeral      Home, Friday 3-8 p.m. and Saturday 11 a.m.--1 p.m., with the      burial immediately following at Bethany Cemetery at 2 p.m.      The service will be officiated by Brother David Brading and      Jack Davis.                          ____________________
