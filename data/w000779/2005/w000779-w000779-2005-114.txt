President, I would like to take a moment to recognize and give thanks to the Jewish community's tremendous relief efforts in the aftermath of the Hurricane Katrina disaster. Countless Jewish individuals and organizations have stepped up to combat this national crisis, providing the victims of Hurricane Katrina with money, supplies and volunteers, while opening the doors of their homes, schools and synagogues.  I would like to highlight a few of these efforts.  Millions of dollars haven been raised in the name of the Katrina victims. The United Jewish Communities, local federations throughout the United States and Canada, and their partners have raised at least $14 million, including a $500,000 donation given by the Baltimore-based Harry and Jeanette Weinberg Foundation Inc. The Weinberg Foundation gave another $500,000 to Catholic Relief Charities. A smaller, but no less inspiring, fund was raised by students of the Sacramento, CA Shalom School, which donated proceeds from sales of their Rosh Hashanah honey pots.  Educational aid for displaced students has come from Jewish organizations such as the Avi Chai Foundation, a group sending emergency grant money to the dozens of Jewish day schools that are admitting evacuees into their classrooms. And the Jewish Agency for Israel, MASA--the Gateway to Long-Term Israel Programs and Hillel are coordinating efforts to allow displaced students to take classes at Israeli universities.  I would also like to recognize the synagogues that are contributing their resources to the effort by providing housing, schooling and free synagogue memberships--even adopting other synagogues in impacted states damaged by the storm.  But the Jewish assistance provided to the victims of Hurricane Katrina does not stop at our borders. The State of Israel has been incredibly generous as well, donating 80 tons of supplies including 15 tons of bottled water, 4 tons of rations, 4 tons of diapers, 1 ton of baby food, Medical supplies including adult and children's wheelchairs andcrutches, thousands of first-aid kits and thousands of blankets and cots. They have also sent teams of professionals trained in disaster relief to assist victims of this terrible disaster, including doctors, paramedics, mental health professionals, search and rescue teams and disaster relief planning and operations specialists.  In times such as these, it is critical that people of all faiths come together to help those in need and I am proud to see that the Jewish community has stepped up and met the challenge head on.                          ____________________[Pages S10820-S10821]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    JEWISH COMMUNITY RELIEF EFFORTS
