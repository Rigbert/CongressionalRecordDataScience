  Mr. DeFAZIO. There is a lot of lip service paid in this Congress and downtown at the White House about family values and small business. Who better represents family values and small business than the fishermen and women on the Oregon and California coast.  This administration has told them we are going to restrict the fishing season to a point where you cannot afford to go out; you can only catch 75 fish in one trip. Nobody can afford to go far out to catch 75 fish, so no one is fishing.  But they won't declare a disaster because they said someone might fish. They admitted no one is fishing. No one can afford to fish. Well, maybe something will happen. The price of fish will go up, go up to what, $100 a pound? Then maybe they could afford to go out for 75 fish.  This administration is refusing to put its money where its mouth is and deliver and help keep families together, support communities and support small business with a modest amount of disaster assistance. We need a disaster declaration from the White House, and we need it now.                          ____________________[Page H4688]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                    STOP RESTRICTING SALMON FISHING  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute.)
