President, on March 22, countries around the world will celebrate World Water Day--a day to mark the progress we have made protecting this most important resource and to reflect on the many challenges we still face in providing clean, safe water to the world's poor.  In 2005, Congress in a bipartisan effort, passed the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act to establish American leadership on this issue. The bill had the support of then-Majority Leader Bill Frist and then-Congressman Henry Hyde in the House. President George W. Bush signed the bill into law.  The bill was appropriately named after my predecessor in the Senate, Paul Simon, who was years ahead of many others recognizing the importance of water.  This act has already done a great deal to help bring clean water and sanitation to the world's poor. But we can do more.  That is why today Senators Corker, Reid, Roberts, Cardin, Isakson, Leahy, and I are reintroducing the Senator Paul Simon Water for the World Act. This bill would improve the original Water for the Poor Act--by strengthening America's ability to provide clean water and sanitation to 100 million of the world's poor within six years of enactment.  Tragically, today nearly 1 billion people still lack access to safe drinking water, and more than 2 billion still lack basic sanitation. Lack of access to stable supplies of water is reaching critical proportions, particularly for agricultural purposes. And the problem will only worsen with rapid urbanization worldwide. Experts suggest that another 1.2 billion people will lack access to clean water and sanitation within 20 years.  The overall economic loss in Africa alone due to lack of access to safe water and basic sanitation is estimated at $28.4 billion a year. In many poor nations, women and girls walk 2 or 3 hours or more each way, every day, to collect water that is often dirty and unsafe.  The United Nations estimates that women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa spend a total of 40 billion working hours each year collecting water. That is equivalent to all of the hours worked in France in a year. Clearly, the world needs to do more to help with such a basic human need.  Last year, the Senate passed the Water for the World Act with 33 cosponsors representing the broad political spectrum of the Senate. You see, American leadership in providing the world's poor with this most basic of human needs has always been bipartisan in the past--and it should be today.  As we celebrate World Water Day next week, let's renew our commitment to making sure the world's poor have access to water and sanitation need by sending this critical piece of legislation to the President's desk.  The Water for the World Act is not an effort to create vast new programs, but rather to focus our foreign assistance on a comprehensive, strategic series of investments related to water and sanitation. These are simple, common-sense steps that will make a real difference in people's lives.  Our legislation would make the United States a leader in trying to meet Millennium Development Goals for drinking water and sanitation, which is to reduce by half the proportion of people without safe water and sanitation by 2015. The bill targets aid to areas with the greatest need and helps build the capacity of poor nations to meet their own water and sanitation challenges.  The Water for the World Act also supports research of clean water technologies and regional partnerships to find solutions to shared water challenges. The bill provides technical assistance--best practices, credit authorities, and training--to help countries expand access to clean water and sanitation. Our development experts will design the assistance based on local needs.  The bill also would strengthen the capacity of USAID and the State Department to implement development assistance efforts related to water and ramp up U.S. developmental and diplomatic leadership.  And lastly, the bill includes a 25 percent cost share for these water and sanitation programs--requiring USAID to partner with universities, philanthropies, and other donors in meeting the key goals.  USAID's sustained commitment to addressing water and sanitation issues has been invaluable in combating poverty and disease worldwide. In fact, USAID recently announced the position of a Senior Water Coordinator, Chris Holmes, whom I had the pleasure of meeting this week. I applaud USAID Administrator Shah for taking this important step that will save lives.  Not only is helping people access clean water and sanitation the right thing to do, it is the smart thing to do. For example, research shows that for every dollar put into clean water and sanitation, $8 in returns are gained in health, education and economic productivity.  Water scarcity can also be a source of conflict and economic calamity. Without reliable supplies of water, farmers struggle to grow crops, and areas once abundant with water are slowly becoming barren. Quite simply, no other issue is more important to human health, peace and security than access to sustainable supplies of water.  Helping other nations is in our national interest. Some say that now is not the time to invest in poor nations half a world away, when our economy is in crisis and so many Americans are hurting. That view is understandable. Recovering from this recession and rebuilding our economy for the long term must be, and is, our government's top priority.  But investing in clean water for the world is a smart strategy that will make our foreign assistance dollars achieve more--something we need in these hard economic times.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 641       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Water for      the World Act of 2011''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005      (Public Law 109-121)--       (A) makes access to safe water and sanitation for      developing countries a specific policy objective of United      States foreign assistance programs;       (B) requires the Secretary of State to--       (i) develop a strategy to elevate the role of water and      sanitation policy; and       (ii) improve the effectiveness of United States assistance      programs undertaken in support of that strategy;       (C) codifies Target 10 of the United Nations Millennium      Development Goals; and       (D) seeks to reduce by half between 1990 (the baseline      year) and 2015--       (i) the proportion of people who are unable to reach or      afford safe drinking water; and       (ii) the proportion of people without access to basic      sanitation.       (2) On December 20, 2006, the United Nations General      Assembly, in GA Resolution 61/192, declared 2008 as the      International Year of Sanitation, in recognition of the      impact of sanitation on public health, poverty reduction,      economic and social development, and the environment.       (3) On August 1, 2008, Congress passed H. Con. Res. 318,      which--       (A) supports the goals and ideals of the International Year      of Sanitation; and       (B) recognizes the importance of sanitation on public      health, poverty reduction, economic and social development,      and the environment.       (4) While progress is being made on safe water and      sanitation efforts--       (A) more than 884,000,000 people throughout the world lack      access to safe drinking water; and       (B) 2 of every 5 people in the world do not have access to      basic sanitation services.       (5) The health consequences of unsafe drinking water and      poor sanitation are significant, accounting for--       (A) nearly 10 percent of the global burden of disease; and       (B) more than 2,000,000 deaths each year.       (6) Water scarcity has negative consequences for      agricultural productivity and food security for the      1,200,000,000 people who, as of 2010, suffer from chronic      hunger and seriously threatens the ability of the world to      more than double food production to meet the demands of a      projected population of 9,000,000,000 people by 2050.       (7) According to the November 2008 report entitled,      ``Global Trends 2025: A Transformed World'', the National      Intelligence Council expects rapid urbanization and future      population growth to exacerbate already limited access to      water, particularly in agriculture-based economies.       (8) According to the 2005 Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,      commissioned by the United Nations, more than \1/5\ of the      world population relies on freshwater that is either polluted      or excessively withdrawn.       (9) The impact of water scarcity on conflict and      instability is evident in many parts of the world, including      the Darfur region of Sudan, where demand for water resources      has contributed to armed conflict between nomadic ethnic      groups and local farming communities.       (10) In order to further the United States contribution to      safe water and sanitation efforts, it is necessary to--       (A) expand foreign assistance capacity to address the      challenges described in this section; and       (B) represent issues related to water and sanitation at the      highest levels of United States foreign assistance and      diplomatic deliberations, including those related to issues      of global health, food security, the environment, global      warming, and maternal and child mortality.     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.       It is the sense of Congress that the United States should      help undertake a global effort to bring sustainable access to      clean water and sanitation to poor people throughout the      world.     SEC. 4. PURPOSE.

Section 6 of the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act      of 2005 (22 U.S.C. 2152h note) is amended--       (1) in subsection (b), by adding at the end the following:      ``The Special Coordinator for International Water established      under section 135(f) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961      (22 U.S.C. 2152h(f)) shall take actions to ensure that the      safe water and sanitation strategy is integrated into any      review or development of a Federal strategy for global      development, global health, or global food security that sets      forth or establishes the United States mission for global      development, guidelines for assistance programs, and how      development policy will be coordinated with policies      governing trade, immigration, and other relevant      international issues.'';       (2) in subsection (c), by adding at the end the following:      ``In developing the program activities needed to implement      the strategy, the Secretary shall consider the results of the      assessment described in subsection (e)(9).''; and       (3) in subsection (e)--       (A) in paragraph (5), by striking ``and'' at the end;       (B) in paragraph (6), by striking the period at the end and      inserting a semicolon; and       (C) by adding at the end the following:       ``(7) an assessment of all United States Government foreign      assistance allocated to the drinking water and sanitation      sector during the 3 previous fiscal years, across all United      States Government agencies and programs, including an      assessment of the extent to which the United States      Government's efforts are reaching and supporting the goal of      enabling first-time access to safe water and sanitation on a      sustainable basis for 100,000,000 people in high priority      countries;       ``(8) recommendations on what the United States Government      would need to do to achieve and support the goals referred to      in     paragraph (7), in support of the United Nation's Millennium      Development Goal on access to safe drinking water; and       ``(9) an assessment of best practices for mobilizing and      leveraging the financial and technical capacity of business,      governments, nongovernmental organizations, and civil society      in forming public-private partnerships that measurably      increase access to safe, affordable, drinking water and      sanitation.''.     SEC. 7. DEVELOPING LOCAL CAPACITY.       The Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005      (Public Law 109-121) is amended--       (1) by redesignating sections 9, 10, and 11 as sections 10,      11, and 12, respectively; and       (2) by inserting after section 8 the following:     ``SEC. 9.

SEC. 9. MONITORING AND EVALUATION.       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress      that--       (1) achieving United States foreign policy objectives      requires the consistent and systematic evaluation of the      impact of United States foreign assistance programs and      analysis on what programs work and why, when, and where they      work;       (2) the design of assistance programs and projects should      include the collection of relevant baseline data required to      measure outcomes and impacts;       (3) the design of assistance programs and projects should      reflect the knowledge gained from evaluation and analysis;       (4) a culture and practice of high quality evaluation      should be revitalized at agencies managing foreign assistance      programs, which requires that the concepts of evaluation and      analysis are used to inform policy and programmatic      decisions, including the training of aid professionals in      evaluation design and implementation;       (5) the effective and efficient use of funds cannot be      achieved without an understanding of how lessons learned are      applicable in various environments and under similar or      different conditions; and       (6) project evaluations should be used as sources of data      when running broader analyses of development outcomes and      impacts.       (b) Coordination and Integration.--To the extent possible,      the Administrator shall coordinate and integrate evaluation      of United States water programs with the learning,      evaluation, and analysis efforts of the United States Agency      for International Development aimed at measuring development      impact.     SEC. 10. UPDATED REPORT REGARDING WATER FOR PEACE AND                    SECURITY.       Section 11(b) of the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor      Act of 2005, as redesignated by section 7, is amended by      adding at the end the following: ``The report submitted under      this subsection shall include an assessment of current and      likely future political tensions over water sources and      multidisciplinary assessment of the expected impacts of      changes to water supplies and agricultural productivity in      10, 25, and 50 years.''.
