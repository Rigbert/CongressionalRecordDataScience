 President, that is the first part. Read the second part. It says, a little phrase says exceptions:       Exceptions--Otherwise lawful bets or wagers that are      placed, received or otherwise made wholly interstate for      State lotteries, racing or parimutuel activity.  Exceptions.  Let me point out one other thing. Under current Federal law, it is illegal to take a bet using a telephone wire, which means that under current law, basically all Internet gambling is illegal because you use a wire.  Under the Kyl amendment, it would become legal to take a bet on the Internet if the States where the bettor placed and received authorized the bet and the bettor is a subscriber of a gambling company's network. This is an expansion. Expansion.  If you want to do something about the Internet, strike exceptions, and I promise you, the sponsors will vote against this. Strike exceptions. If you don't want any betting using the wire, strike ``exceptions.''
