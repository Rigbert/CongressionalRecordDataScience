 Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  I rise in support of this legislation because it contains some amendments which I think make the reauthorization palatable. But I should be very clear that if the amendments are taken out in conference, I will do everything that I can to defeat this reauthorization.  Mr. Chairman, one of the great economic crises of our time is the decline in real wages of American workers and the loss of millions of good manufacturing jobs. In my view, we are not going to rebuild the middle class and create good paying jobs unless we rebuild our manufacturing sector. Given that reality, Mr. Chairman, it is unacceptable that the taxpayers of this country continue to provide financial support for large multinational corporations who are laying off hundreds of thousands of American workers,they are taking our jobs to China, to Mexico, to countries where workers are paid 20 or 30 cents an hour. But then they come into this building and they say, help us, we need some money to participate in the export-import program.  Mr. Chairman, I have introduced an amendment which was accepted by the Committee on Banking and Financial Services which has a very simple goal. It demands that the Export-Import Bank implement procedures to ensure that in selecting among firms to which to provide financial assistance, preference is given to a firm which has shown commitment to reinvest in America and create jobs in America.  I do not think that is too much to ask. If the American taxpayers are going to help out in this process, they have a right to know that the companies who receive that help have a commitment to reinvest in America and create jobs in America and not to run to Mexico, not to run to China.
