Chair, the spirit of John Dingell was so present in that remark.  Now, John Dingell apparently was not always right. He wanted to repeal the Senate, but then he wanted to replace it.  Mr. Chair, John Dingell, I will tell you, I was with him Wednesday from approximately 4 p.m. on Wednesday until 6:30 p.m., and Debbie was there. Your dad was there, Andy, our dear colleague. Sandy Levin was there and John Orlando, who served with John on the Energy and Commerce Committee for such a great time. He remembered all of you. He asked me to give each of you his best, to wish you well, and to say that our country needs each of us to work together.  Would that we could leave just some of the legacy that John Dingell has left behind. We are so blessed that we have the opportunity to serve with his wife, his beloved wife, his lovely Deborah. What an extraordinary relationship, what an extraordinary man. How lucky we were and are to serve with them.  The Speaker will be shortly notifying us of when the funeral will be, opportunities to go to the funeral. There will be a memorial service as well, here, and probably a service in the Capitol as well. So there will be opportunities for each of us to stand and testify to the greatness and goodness of John David Dingell, Jr.  Mr. Chair, I ask all the Members of Congress and all the ladies and gentlemen in the gallery to join us in a moment of silence in remembrance of our friend John Dingell.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Pallone). All present will rise and observe a moment of silence in honor of our beloved John Dingell.                Amendment No. 19 Offered by Ms. Sherrill  The Acting CHAIR.
