President, we are soon going to a rollcall vote on Edgardo Ramos, of Connecticut, to be U.S. district judge for the Southern District of New York. We also have three others on here: Andrew L. Carter, Jr., of New York, to be U.S. district judge for the Southern District of New York; James Rodney Gilstrap, of Texas, to be U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of Texas; and Dana L. Christensen, of Montana, to be U.S. district judge for the District of Montana.  I ask unanimous consent that following the rollcall vote for Edgardo Ramos, Andrew L. Carter, Jr., James Rodney Gilstrap, and Dana L. Christensen be considered by voice vote.
