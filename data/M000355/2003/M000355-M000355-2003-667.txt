 11, I took exception with several findings included in the Weiss Report on Medical Malpractice Caps that I believed misinterpreted the data of the Medical Liability Monitor and the National Practicioner Data Bank. Following the vote on the motion to invoke cloture, I received a report supporting my conclusions from the Physicians Insurance Association of America as well as a statement from the Division of Practicioner Data Banks. I ask unanimous consent that these documents be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: The Weiss Ratings Report on Medical Malpractice Caps--Propagating the              Myth That Non-Economic Damage Caps Don't Work       On June 3, 2003, Weiss Ratings, Inc. published a report      regarding the performance of the medical malpractice      insurance industry entitled Medical Malpractice Caps The      Impact of Non-Economic Damage Caps on Physician Premiums,      Claims Payout Levels, and Availability of Coverage. The major      recommendation of the report is that ``Legislators should put      proposals involving non-economic damage caps on hold until      convincing evidence can be produced to demonstrate a true      benefit to doctors in the form of reduced med mal costs.''      Unfortunately, the Weiss report is ill conceived, and      misleads the reader by falsely demonstrating that non-     economic damage caps have not worked. Both of the data      sources used by Weiss have gone on record disagreeing with      the report's methodology, as described herein.       The conclusions drawn by Weiss are opposite of those      previously published by reputable entities, such as the      Congressional Budget Office, US Department of Health and      Human Services, Joint Economic Committee of the United States      Congress, Standard & Poors, American Academy of Actuaries,      Tillinghast, and Milliman, USA, to name a few (see Appendix      A). Unlike Weiss, all of these highly respected organizations      have considerable experience and acceptance by government and      industry for their knowledge and analytical product.       The purpose of this document is to evaluate Weiss' use of      the data and analytical process. In short, Weiss misuses      published industry data in an effort to demonstrate that non-     economic damage caps enacted by several states have not been      effective in reducing medical malpractice premiums in those      states as compared to states without caps. Weiss      underestimates the ``average'' claim costs for the two groups      of states by employing inappropriate analytical technique to      represent the burden on insurers. This is an error that is      readily obvious to those who work with medical malpractice      claims data, and it misleads the reader to an inappropriate      conclusion.                        WHAT DID WEISS DO WRONG?     Grouping the States       Weiss has grouped 19 states as having caps on non-economic      damages, and 32 others (including the District of Columbia)      as not having caps. Unfortunately, states with effective      caps, such as California with a $250 thousand cap, are      considered the same as states having various levels of caps      up to and including $1 million. In fact, only 5 of the 19      states have a $250 thousand dollar cap similar to that being      proposed under current legislation. Eleven of the states have      caps of $500 thousand or greater. No attempt has been made to      evaluate the effectiveness of caps at various levels, they      have simply been lumped together. The American Academy of      Actuaries has testified that caps are a key element of tort      reform, and must be set at a level low enough, such as      $250,000, to have an effect. Any comparison chosen to      demonstrate the effectiveness of non-economic damage caps      should be sensitive to the level of caps in the various      states and to their individual effectiveness.       In addition, as clearly shown on Appendix 1 of the Weiss      report, more than half of the states enacting non-economic      damage caps had not done so prior to the baseline date of      1991. Weiss compares premiums and claims costs for only two      years, 1991 and 2002. The caps enacted in 10 states were not      in place in 1991, and thus, these states should not be      included in the ``cap states'' category for this analysis.      Two other states had only adopted their caps in 1990, and the      beneficial effects of these laws may not have been recognized      in the data by 1991 due to constitutional challenge and      uncertainty about the ultimate effects of the caps.     Measuring the Premiums       Weiss uses the annual insurance rate surveys published by      Medical Liability Monitor (MLM) for three medical specialties      as the source of insurance premium data. He calculates median      average premiums by state and then calculates a median      premium for 1991 and 2002 for the two groups of states.       For example, Alabama had two insurers listed in the 2002      study, each with a premium for the three specialties. Weiss      simply ranks the premiums from least to most, and then      selects the middle value (or mean average of the two middle      values when there is an even number of rates) as the median      average value, as shown below.

Alabama was selected for this discussion simply because it      is alphabetically the first state. However, these data      demonstrates many reasons why the use of the median is      improper:       Data for different insurers are used for the two comparison      years.       The median value is representative of only general surgery      rates because general surgery rates are always higher than      internal medicine and lower than OB/GYN.       Because two carriers are represented in 2002 and only one      in 1991, the median value chosen by Weiss (the average of the      two general surgery rates) is actually lower than the 1991      rate. However, the actual general surgery rates for the only      carrier shown for both years increased--the opposite of      Weiss' result.       The premiums shown are not adjusted for various discounts      or surcharges, and do not reflect any dividends which may      have been paid back to policyholders, thus reducing their      total outlay. Medical malpractice insurers paid substantial      dividends in the 1991 era, which had been largely reduced by      2002 due to industry losses.       Using the product of this calculation to represent      insurance industry revenues is flawed for many additional      reasons. First, there is no certainty that any of the table      rates listed in MLM are actually charged. Carriers may have a      premium filed in a given state (or in multiple territories in      states), but may not write much business there. Weiss'      analysis gives no weight to the actual amount of insurance      sold by the various companies in any state, nor does it      reflect discounts or surcharges which are routinely applied      to standard premiums. In addition, many insurers pay      policyholder dividends, which in effect reduce the annual      premiums paid.       MLM has objected to Weiss' misuse of its data. In a July 7,      2003 email to Senate Majority Leader Frist, MLM Editor      Barbara Dillard states ``We believe it is misleading to use      median annual premiums compiled with data from Medical      Liability Monitor to demonstrate the effect of non-economic      damage limits on liability rates.''       The Weiss analysis only includes premium data for three      medical specialties, thus ignoring the experience for all of      the rest. Even more glaring is the fact that the MLM data      does not exist for seven of the capped states and five of the      non-capped states for 1991. But, this did not stop Weiss from      irresponsibly including these states in the analysis (see      Weiss's Appendix 1 and 2).       An analysis using actual premiums as reported to the      National Association of Insurance Commissioners (not medians)      is helpful in evaluating differences between states having      effective damage caps throughout the period of Weiss'      analysis and those without. Such premiums include surcharges      and discounts which may have been applied to standard rates.       The four states having a $250,000 cap prior to 1991 (CA,      CO, IN, KS) saw their total premiums increase by 28.0 percent      between 1991 and 2001 (2002 data not available yet). States      not having the $250,000 non-economic damage cap experienced a      collective 47.7 percent increase in premiums, over 70 percent      greater. See Appendix B for details. This wide gap in      premiums actually collected compares inversely to Weiss'      faulty conclusion that annual premiums in states with caps      increased by 48.2 percent as compared to 35.9 percent in      states without caps.     Measuring Claim Costs       In order to evaluate the difference in claim costs between      the two groups of states, Weiss analyzes median claim      payments by state for 1991 and 2002 as reported to the      National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). The NPDB provides the      only readily available source of medical malpractice      insurance indemnity payments by state. However, in order to      use these data effectively, one must understand the nature of      the claim payment values reported, and the shortcomings from      that which might be normally expected (see Appendix C for      a discussion of the NPDB claim payment data).       The use of the median claim payment value greatly      compromises the accuracy of Weiss' analysis. While the median      (or middle value of the claim payment distribution) might be      an effective descriptor of what a plaintiff might receive as      payment (before paying almost half to his/her lawyer), it      cannot be used to measure the claim payment burden on      insurers. The use of total claim payments reported by state      shows a much larger differential result than Weiss' reported      payout increase of 83.3 percent for capped states as compared      to 127.9 percent for non-capped states.       The increase in total claim payments for the four states      having a $250,000 non-economic damage cap during the period      of the Weiss analysis is 52.8 percent, compared to 100.1      percent for all other states--an 89.6 percent difference (See      Appendix D). Thus the experience in the capped states is      almost twice as good as that for states without effective      non-economic damage caps prior to 1991. Using his faulty      median calculation, Weiss would have us believe that the      difference is only 53.5 percent (127.9/83.3).       The NPDB has gone on record opposing Mr. Weiss'      methodology, saying that ``Although the statistical median is      usually the best measure of the `average' malpractice payment      received by claimants, it does not show the `burden on      insurers.' The `burden on insurers' is the total amount of      dollars paid, not the `average' or median payment.'' (see      Appendix E for NPDB statement).     Investment Performance       In addition to inappropriate analysis of premium and claims      data, the Weiss report comments on the investment performance      of     medical malpractice insurers. Being a long tail line of      insurance, medical malpractice insurers routinely utilize the      investment income generated by the premiums they collect and      hold for the payment of claims in the future. It is no secret      that bond yields have declined over the past decade, and are      now at historically low levels.       In spite of the fact that medical malpractice insurers are      80 percent invested in bonds and have less than 10% invested      in the stock market, Weiss still concludes that stock market      losses are responsible for insurers' poor performance. While      the fall in interest rates has reduced the interest income      available to offset premiums, Weiss fails to mention that      when rates go down, bond values go up, and insurers have been      able to book capital gains to bolster their investment      income.       The total return on investments for the industry has      remained fairly stable, and does not explain why rates are      rising. Rates are rising because of increasing claim costs.                               CONCLUSION       The Weiss report recommends that ``. . . legislators must      immediately put on hold all proposals involving non-economic      damage caps until convincing evidence can be produced to      demonstrate a true benefit to doctors in the form of reduced      med mal cost.'' This information exists, as reported herein      and by many other reputable sources, and now is the time for      the enactment of effective federal health care liability      reform. Appendix A--Reputable Sources Know That MICRA's Cap Reins in Premiums       Congressional Budget Office--``CBO's analysis indicated      that certain tort limitations, primarily caps on awards and      rules governing offsets from collateral-source benefits,      effectively reduce average premiums for medical malpractice      insurance. Consequently, CBO estimates that, in states that      currently do not have controls on malpractice torts, H.R. 5      would significantly lower premiums for medical malpractice      insurance from what they would otherwise be under current      law. . . . premiums for medical malpractice insurance      ultimately would be an average of 25 percent to 30 percent      below what they would be under current law.''

Without the inclusion of a cap on potential awards of      non-economic damages in a legislative package, no legislative      reform plan can be successful in achieving the goal of      controlling increases in healthcare costs, and thereby      promoting improved access to healthcare. Although the Task      Force was offered other solutions, there is no other      alternative remedy that will immediately alleviate Florida's      crisis of availability and affordability of healthcare. The      evidence before the Task Force indicates that a cap of      $250,000 per incident will lead to significantly lower      malpractice premiums.''       American Academy of Actuaries--``Before MICRA's adoption in      1975, California's percentage of loss payments was      significantly higher than its proportion of physicians. By      1981, California's loss payments had dropped and were about      even with its percentage of physicians. Since that date,      California has continued to benefit from MICRA: Costs      continue to drop as a percentage of the U.S. total, even as      the percentage of physicians remains stable. Although other      factors affect these . . . However, the California data show      that premiums declined as losses declined . . . Although      year-to-year fluctuations do occur, premiums have fallen in      proportion to the decline in losses.''       [Federal Budget Savings Through Medical Liability Reform,      Physician Insurers Association of America)       Tillinghast-Towers Perrin--``We would expect that a      $250,000 cap on non-economic damages will produce some      savings, perhaps in the 5 percent to 7 percent range for      physicians. If the number of large malpractice claims is      trending upward rapidly, a $250,000 non-economic cap may also      help to flatten out the rate of increase in the number of      claims.''       [Letter to Mr. Ray Cantor from James Hurley Tillinghast-     Towers Perrin, January 7, 2003]       Milliman, USA--``California law prescribes a $250,00 cap on      non-economic damages and malpractice losses per physician are      much lower than the countrywide average (i.e., about 50      percent of the countrywide average from 1991 to 2000). Thus,      there appears to be clear evidence that a cap would be      effective in reducing the cost of medical malpractice      claims.''

Appendix C--General Comments About NPDB Payment Values       The National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) was designed to      collect information on health care providers which would      allow credentialling entities to identify individuals who had      accumulated a ``bad track record'' and who may move to a new      geographic location to start anew. While some of the data      fields in the data base are useful, it was not designed as a      medical malpractice research data base. The data are not well      suited for measuring the actual payment values of verdicts or      settlements in a malpractice case, as described below.       The Health Care Quality Improvement Act requires insurers      to report the first indemnity payment (check written) made on      behalf of any provider within 30 days of the date of payment.      It is this value which appears in the numeric field in the      NPDB data base, and which appears in the NPDB public use      file. This payment value must be analyzed in light of the      following:       A. The data reported to the NPDB is on a provider (doctor)      basis, and represents payments made on behalf of only one      provider. The Data Bank has no way of linking payments made      on behalf of multiple individual providers to aggregate the      total amount of the settlement or jury award. Thus, the total      value of settlements or jury awards made for the plaintiff      against multiple providers cannot be determined.       B. Insurers may make more than one indemnity payment on      behalf of a provider. Only the first payment is required to      be reported, and reporting entities are directed to explain      any anticipated future payments in a non-machinable paragraph      of description.       C. In cases involving continuing care (such as long term      medication), the provider may     have been insured by more than one primary insurance carrier,      each of which may have made a payment for any individual      claim.       D. In cases where excess carriers or state-run compensation      funds make an excess payment (usually amounts over $1mil) in      addition to the primary insurer payment, two reports are sent      to the Data Bank, which then look like two smaller payments      for two separate claims instead of one larger payment.       E. In many cases, insurers do not apportion payments made      on behalf of multiple defendants, such as in a case where      $300,000 is paid on behalf of three doctors. In this      instance, the Data Bank instructs the reporting entity to      file a report for each doctor, each of which will have      $300,000 in the payment field. There is a separate field      which should indicate that a payment was made on behalf of      three practitioners. For these data records, the $300,000      must be divided by 3 to get an accurate average payment      amount for each of the three data records.       F. The Data Bank estimates that they are only getting 50%      compliance with reporting entities. They have done quite a      bit of work looking at insurers reports, and have uncovered      little non-compliance. Thus, the problem may lie in self-     insured plans, etc., if the non-compliance does in fact      exist. In any event, the total amounts reported may not be      complete.

Appendix E--Statement of the Division of Practitioner Data Banks, Health Resources and Services Administration, U.S. Department of Health  and Human Services, Concerning Use of Medians of Malpractice Payments   Reported to the National Practitioner Data Bank for Analysis of the           Impact of Caps on Malpractice Payments, July 2, 2003       The Weiss Ratings, Inc. report ``Medical Malpractice Caps:      The Impact of Non-Economic Damage Caps on Physician Premiums,      Claims Payout Levels, and Availability of Coverage'' mentions      data from the National Practitioner Data Bank in its      discussion of the relationship between caps on medical      malpractice payments and medical malpractice insurance      premiums. The report states on page 7:       Caps do reduce the burden on insurers--Using data provided      by the National Practitioner Data Bank, we compared the      median payouts in the 19 states with caps to those in the 32      states without caps for the period between 1991 and 2002,      with the following results:       Payments reduced. In states without caps, the median payout      for the entire 12-year period was $116,297, ranging from      $75,000 on the low end to $220,000 on the high end. In states      with caps, the median was 15.7 percent lower, or $98,079,      ranging from $50,000 to $190,000. Since caps in many states      were not imposed until late in the 12-year period, this      represents a significant reduction.       Growth in payouts slowed substantially. The median payout      in the 32 states without caps increased by 127.9 percent,      from $65,831 in 1991 to $150,000 in 2002. In contrast,      payouts in the 19 states with caps increased at a far slower      pace--by 83.3 percent, from $60,000 in 1991 to $110,000 in      2002.       In short, it's clear that caps do accomplish their intended      purpose of lowering the average amount insurance companies      must pay out to satisfy med mal claims.       Although the statistical median is usually the best measure      of the ``average'' malpractice payment received by claimants,      it does not show the ``burden on insurers.'' The ``burden on      insurers'' is the total amount of dollars paid, not the      ``average'' or median payment.       Statistically, the median is the payment amount in the      middle of a rank-ordered list of all payments. Thus in a set      of 101 payments, 50 of which were for $1,000, 1 of which was      for $25,000, 49 of which were for $100,000, and 1 of which      was for $1,000,000, the median payment would be $25,000.      Arguing that the burden of payments on insurers is low      because the median payment is $25,000 is misleading. The      total amount paid cannot be determined through use of the      median. The burden on insurers would be better measured by      examining the total of all payments by insurers.                          ____________________
