 I think the American people are a bit confused as to what is really going on here. And, you know, it's a lot like the Humphrey Bogart movie: What's going on here is gambling, plain and simple.  It would be one thing if these so-called investment banks like Goldman Sachs were lending into the productive sector of the U.S. economy, if they were lending to people who had good ideas to produce products and goods, employ Americans and help us compete in the world economy. But they are not doing that. In this case, they weren't even helping to package and move mortgages off of people's portfolios and someplace else. They were merely mimicking with what are called synthetic collateralized debt obligations, packages of bad or potentially bad mortgages to bet on, for this one hedge fund to bet against and make a billion dollars.  But then, of course, unfortunately, other parts of Goldman Sachs, apparently unbeknownst to them, I mean, in totally good faith, went to clients of Goldman Sachs and said, Hey, we've got a good product here we'd like to sell you. Unfortunately, other parts of Goldman Sachs had assembled this product with the intention that it would fail, and these other people were not informed of that fact and purchasing them, although Goldman would say they didn't have an obligation to tell people that they had designed it to fail, working with someone who was betting it to fail, and that Goldman itself was betting on it to fail.  But the bottom line of all is it's a huge amount of churning on things that don't help the economy, help the American people, help us compete in the world.                              {time}  1730  Goldman has gone to the point in 2007, their gambling income--excuse me--their financial services, investment, self-proprietary, et cetera stuff, whatever you want to call it, was actually five times larger than their investment banking activities. So 20 cents of every dollar at Goldman was going into productive investment. The other 80 cents was going into gambling on imaginary products. It's a lot like fantasy football. A lot of Americans can understand that. Imagine if they took out and created synthetic products that related to fantasy football. Maybe some Americans can understand that.  Recently, one firm actually proposed, a Cantor Fitzgerald subsidiary, proposed to do futures on movies. In L.A. they would produce a movie and then the people on Wall Street would bet on what the opening weekend was going to return, and they would bet on how much money it might make. This became of such concern to producers in L.A. because they thought, My God, if they start out shorting us right away, that's going to depress our investment potential for the movie, et cetera, et cetera. So in the Senate bill they're actually banning this sort of derivative.  So they have banned two kinds of derivatives. One has been historically banned for some reason lost in the mist of time. Onions, you can't do them on onions. And the second would be movies from Hollywood. Otherwise, you can bet on anything. You can bet on the weather tomorrow as a derivative product. You can market it on Wall Street, et cetera, et cetera.  This is not a productive activity. I would suggest a simple way to deal with it. One thing that's good is the Senate has actually, for once, proposed something useful, which is to say that if Goldman wants to have a proprietary trading section and trade in these gambling products, that they couldn't be insured by the FDIC or draw money through special windows at the Treasury. We should not subsidize their addiction to gambling. The taxpayers should not subsidize it. That would be a good step.  But the other thing we could do would be to put a very modest tax on this gambling and to say, Look, for legitimate hedgers, airlines who want tohedge against fuel price increases, farmers who are worried about failure of the corn crop, those people. We already distinguish between hedgers and speculators over at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.  Let's just say hedgers would be exempt from the tax. But speculators, those who have no skin in the game, aren't producers, or even worse, are not even actually involved in any way as a counterparty but just merely creating synthetic things to bet for or against, they would pay a very modest tax. If the tax was approximately two-tenths of 1 percent--that's .0002--on each of these, we could raise somewhere between $30 billion to $50 billion a year to help pay for some of the damage they have caused to our economy.  It might not raise that much because it might rein in some of this speculative activity, which I think would be a desirable impact; but I would suggest that would be one way to deal with this very, very reckless activity.  I congratulate the gentlelady for having this hour to highlight these concerns and the contradictions that we see in the business principles versus what we all saw going on.  With that, I'd yield back.
