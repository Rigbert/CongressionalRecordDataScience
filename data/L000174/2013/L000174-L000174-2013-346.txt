 The Old Round Church earned a national historic landmark distinction from the National Park Service in 1996. Because of the church's history and its long-held status as meeting place and community center, it has come to be recognized as a symbol of the rich history woven through so many Vermont towns.  This year the Richmond Round Church, known to many as the Old Round Church, will celebrate its bicentennial with a series of concerts and community events. The sense of community boasted by the Old Round Church is rooted partially in the history of the church's establishment. Initially conceived by settlers seeking a local meeting place, their plan to erect the Round Church faltered with reluctance from the town of Richmond to supply the land need to construct the building. Two local men, however, volunteered the land, and in 1813 construction of the church was completed. It has since grown to become a renowned symbol for its historical significance but also for its representation of the community values that are so cherished across Vermont.  Over the past two centuries, it has served as a meeting place, a venue for local activities, and even a popular location for weddings. Generations of Vermonters have visited the Old Round Church, and as a young boy growing up in Montpelier, I remember visiting the church with my parents, and brother and sister. Today, volunteers routinely help preserve the church's history by volunteering to help clean, maintain, and repair its structure. It remains as central to the community as it ever has in its 200 year history.  In honor of the 200th anniversary of the Richmond Round Church, I ask that an article published in the Burlington Free Press on May 26, 2013, ``Richmond Round Church Turns 200, Celebrations Abound,'' be printed into the Congressional Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From The Burlington Free Press, May 26, 2013]          Richmond Round Church Turns 200, Celebrations Abound       Richmond--It started with an argument.       In 1796 settlers of this small town in the foothills of the      Green Mountains wanted to build a local meeting house, or at      least some of them did. Then as now, democracy did not always      come easily. The committees tasked with finding a location      found it difficult to agree and fickle townspeople voted down      the whole idea in 1811.       Absent the good will of two local men who offered to donate      land to the cause, free and clear, the foundation for      Richmond's iconic Round Church might never have been laid.       But donate they did, and this year the white clapboard      building that sits serenely in the heart of Richmond turns      200. The birthday is being celebrated all summer with      concerts and special events culminating the weekend of Aug.      9, 10 and 11.       Fans of the church say it symbolizes the spirit of the      town.       ``Well, I think this represents what's best about      Richmond,'' said Fran Thomas, president of the Richmond      Historical Society. ``It was built as a community church and      meeting house. To me it's what's best about Richmond, that      community aspect.''       The shape of the 16-sided church and meeting house is      believed to be unique in the United States. It has survived      floods, blizzards and other onslaughts--attacks by powder      post beetles, dry rot and restless youths who carved their      initials into the wooden box pews as early as 1912.                             Built to last       According to ``The Richmond Round Church, 1813-2013,'' a      history written by Harriet W. Riggs and Martha Turner and      published by the Richmond Historical Society, the box pews      were designed to help retain heat. Families brought heated      soap stones or small metal boxes of burning coals to help      stay warm inside. A stone and box are on display at the back      of the church, along with other artifacts.       Miraculously, the church never burned down despite      considerable threat from wood stoves that were added to the      building at some point and according to local lore stuffed      full starting several days before gatherings and then left      unattended as the structure heated up. Pipes from the stoves      snaked     precariously aloft the pews, posing another hazard.       The stoves are idle now and the piping was pulled down      decades ago. These days the Richmond Historical Society      manages and maintains the town-owned structure under a 40-     year agreement that expires in 2016.       Town meeting ceased to be held at the church in 1974 on the      advice of the fire marshal and structural engineers who      advised the roof could cave under a heavy snow storm. (Town      meeting now takes place at Camels Hump Middle School.) The      five Protestant denominations that sold pew space to fund the      construction 200 years ago no longer hold Sunday services at      the church.       But the structure and its surrounding green continue to      serve as a visual centerpiece and active venue for weddings,      tours, concerts and other events.                          Maintaining history       Volunteers do everything from washing the 12-over-12      mullioned windows to writing grants to booking weddings to      monitoring the steady stream of repairs needed to keep the      church upright. Major structural work took place in the late      1970s and early 1980s, with the historical society leading      the charge. More recently, workers have restored the      foundation and replaced rotting beams and clapboard at the      back of the church. Some day friends of the church would like      to build in a bathroom, but for now a lilac-landscaped port-     o-let out back serves the purpose.       Repairing broken panes of glass is a regular task and in      this as in other work, effort is made to stay historically      accurate. Glass from old windows donated to the church is      used whenever possible.       ``We have a stockpile of wavy glass to repair the broken      windows,'' Thomas explained.       All the effort to maintain the church is well worth it,      said Thomas as she showed a reporter around the space      recently.       The building today is unheated and there are no plans to      add a modern heat source. That means use of the Round Church      is seasonal, with events taking place from April to October,      with a few exceptions such as an annual December carol sing.       Occasionally a wedding is scheduled in November or      December. ``But we have to make sure the bride and groom      realize how cold it's going to be,'' said Thomas.       One couple literally got cold feet and moved their wedding      on a few days notice after visiting the church and realizing      how chilly their vows would be.       The shape of the church has long been a subject of      speculation. Some say the circular shape was chosen to ward      off the devil because he could not hide in the corners of the      church.       Thomas doubts the devil drove the architectural plans. The      more likely story is that head carpenter William Rhodes      appreciated the circular design of an addition to the meeting      house in his hometown of Claremont, N.H. and wanted to copy      the idea.       ``To me, that makes the most sense,'' Thomas said. ``It's      not the most interesting, but it makes the most sense.''       Snatches of the surrounding scenery can be viewed from      inside the church--green mountainside, sloping lawn, flood      plain field and the red metal truss bridge spanning the      Winooski River. The church sits slightly uphill, which saved      it from the great flood of 1927 and Tropical Storm Irene,      although the latter turned the lower green into a lake.       Taking care of the building is much more involved than some      people might guess, said Thomas. But Richmond would not be      Richmond without it, she said.       ``It's our claim to fame, I guess.''                          ____________________
