President, if the Senator will yield, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his comments. I think each one of us who served with Sid Yates on either side of the aisle will never forget him. When his retirement came about, Congressman Ralph Regula, a Republican from Ohio, never missed a retirement event for Sid Yates. I think it showed that he reached across the aisle and established friendships and alliances that were not just good for Congress but were good for America. He was a wonderful man. I am blessed to have known him, to have served with him, and perhaps to have learned a few lessons at his side.  I think his legacy will be his efforts for education, for defense of the arts, for defense of the environment, and for the rights of Americans.  Our condolences go to Addie and his family. We wish them strength in this time of loss and tell them we stand by their side.                          ____________________
