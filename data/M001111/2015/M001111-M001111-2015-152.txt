 President, the amendment I am offering today would simply expand access to paid sick days and give our families some much needed economic stability.  Working families should not have to sacrifice a day's pay or sacrifice their job altogether just to take care of themselves or a sick child, but today in this country, 43 million of our Nation's workers do not have access to paid sick days. This amendment would allow workers to earn up to 7 paid sick days over the course of a year.  It will not only help our families, it will be good for business. Paid sick days boost productivity, and in cities and States that already have paid sick leave laws, many employers state that this policy has not affected their revenue.  Allowing workers to earn paid sick days would take us a step closer to having an economy that works for all of our families, and I urge its support.
