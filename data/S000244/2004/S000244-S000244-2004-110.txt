Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, the issue raised by the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake) was one of the most vexatious issues in the negotiations that are leading up to the manager's amendment, which I will offer shortly. And the most difficult of the issues that the manager's amendment deals with relates to the time limit for seeking post-conviction DNA testing.  On one side there were a group of people who wanted to have no time limit at all, and a motion could be made at any time as long as the defendant was still alive and in jail. On the other side, there were people who wanted to have a hard and fast limit, and the shorter the limitation possible they were in favor of. Those people said that defendants would simply game the system waiting until the witnesses had died and the DNA had evaporated and, consequently, there would not be enough evidence to conduct a retrial.  The compromise that was worked out, I think, is a fair one. For the first 5 years after conviction, there is a rebuttable presumption in favor of the test. After 5 years, there is a rebuttable presumption against the test, but the defendant can get a motion granted if the court finds that the applicant was incompetent at trial, there is newly discovered DNA evidence, or that denial of the motion to retest would result in manifest injustice or for good cause shown.  So, for the first 5 years, the burden is on the prosecution to show that the test should not be granted. After 5 years, the burden effectively is on the defendant to show that the test should be granted for the reasons that I have enumerated.  I believe that takes care of the concerns that the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Flake) has expressed, and I wouldurge adoption of the manager's amendment and overwhelming support of the bill.  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from the National District Attorneys Association expressing support for the manager's amendment to H.R. 5107 be included in the Record.                                       National District Attorneys                                                  Association,                                  Alexandria, VA, October 6, 2004.     Hon. Jim Sensenbrenner,     Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.     Hon. John Conyers Jr.,     Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Sensenbrenner and Congressman Conyers: As      President of the National District Attorneys Association I      want to express my support for the Managers Amendment that I      understand has been offered to H.R. 5107 the ``Justice For      All Act.''       The Amendment has addressed our major concerns with the      ``Advancing Justice Through DNA Technology Act.'' The clear      indication that Capital Resource Centers are not to be funded      through federal funds is important as is the stipulation that      the funding is to be used for training counsel in capital      cases.       While the compromise standard for new trials does not reach      our criteria of a ``preponderance'' it is a marked      improvement over prior efforts.       The importance of DNA to our system of criminal justice      cannot be over emphasized and the problems that our      laboratories and courts are encountering are in our daily      headlines. ``The Justice For All Act'' provides the resources      desperately needed by the states to overcome serious      impediments to the effective use of DNA to seek justice and      truth in our criminal justice system.           Sincerely,                                            Paul F. Walsh Jr.,                            District Attorney, Bristol County, MA,               President, National District Attorneys Association.
