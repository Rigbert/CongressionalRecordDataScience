 President, I rise today in strong opposition to the 1995 base closure list and to urge the President to reject the Base Closure Commission's recommended hit list.  In this base closure round, the Commission voted to close or realign 9 out of the 12 military bases in California that were reviewed, many against the recommendation and advice of the Secretary of Defense.  In addition to the adverse national security impact of the Commission's action, the economic impact on California--particularly the cumulative economic impact--will be enormous.                    Economic Impact of Base Closures  California is being hit disproportionately hard by base closures. In three previous rounds, 22 major bases in California have been slated for closure or realignment--more than double any other State.  California is home to only 15 percent of all Defense Department personnel. Yet, California has lost more than 82,000 of the nearly 120,000 net direct jobs--military and civilian--lost nationwide since 1988 as a result of base closures alone.  All total, these actions have resulted in the loss of more than 200,000 direct and indirect jobs and $7 billion in annual economic activity in California.  I do not believe it is appropriate to proceed with another base closure round when the full impact of previous base closures has not yet been felt. In California, bases slated for closure in 1988 are just now starting to close their gates, and few are having success in reuse and redevelopment efforts.  If the current base closure round goes forward, 58,000 additional direct and indirect California jobs will be impacted--7,900 direct military and 19,000 direct civilian personnel. Major bases in California which the Commission has targeted include:  McClellan Air Force Base in Sacramento;  Long Beach Naval Shipyard in Los Angeles County;  Onizuka Air Station in Sunnyvale;  Oakland Army Base in Alameda County;  Sierra Army Depot in Lassen County; and  Fort Hunter Liggett in Monterey County.  With the addition of defense industry layoffs in California--which have claimed 250,000 jobs in just the past few years--California stands to lose more than half-a-million jobs as a result of base closures and defense downsizing.  And, defense industry downsizing is expected to continue through the end of the decade with the loss of another 250,000 jobs. Enough is enough.  By law, economic impact must be considered by the Commission when determining what bases to recommend for closure or realignment. The inclusion of economic impact as a criteria is for good reason: to prevent the piling on of base closures on one single community or State.  Yet, it is clear to me that the Commission disregarded the economic impact of currently proposed and previously announced base closures on California when it made its final recommendation to close or realign nine California bases.                      California's Fragile Economy  The California economy cannot take additional base closures at this time. California was once the land of golden opportunity, where good paying jobs were available and investments in real estate resulted in high-paying dividends. Today, that dream of golden opportunities has disappeared.  California's unemployment rate is nearly 3 percent higher than the national average. More than 1.28 million Californians are out of work. In fact, California has 17 percent of all the unemployed workers in America.  As cuts in jobs, both military and civilian, loom on the horizon, consumer confidence has dwindled. Consumers are unwilling to move into homes and purchase durable goods as long as the State's economic prospects remain dim.  ``Disappointing, disturbing, and traumatic''--those are the words used by the president of the California Association of Realtors to describe the current challenge of being a real estate agent in California.  The facts about the current real estate market in California are startling. Home sales dropped 21 percent in California during the first quarter of 1995. In Los Angeles County alone, home prices dropped 23 percent from January 1991 to January 1995. Prices fell another 3 percent in March of this year.  The crisis of confidence in California's economy extends well beyond the real estate market and the sheer number of unemployed residents. People are simply unsettled about the State's economic future.  Orange County filed bankruptcy, and just this week, while hoping to earn $30 million in a real estate auction, had to settle for $15 million. Bill Lange, who conducted the auction, remarked, ``On a scale of one to 10, it's about a five. It'd be an eight or nine if the real estate market wasn't in the tank.'' In any case, it is still a small fraction of the county's $1.7 billion in investment loses.  Los Angeles County, the largest in the Nation, is faced with the prospect of eliminating a $1.2 billion deficit. Laying off more than 18,000 employees--one out of five county workers--seems inevitable. Closing the County-U.S.C. Medical Center is another likely budget-cutting measure that will be implemented.  Twelve months ago, California's leading indicators were running slightly above the national trend. Six months ago, California dropped to next to last among all States. In a 3-month moving average of leading indicators--as compiled by the WEFA Group of Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania--California comes in dead last.  If California continues to suffer blow after blow, not only will this slow our economic recovery, but could set it back. I cannot predict the total consequences of further devastating cuts.  This is the Nation's largest State, and a weakened and uncertain economy here can lash like a chain reaction through our national economy and our balance of trade. Closing California's military bases can only make matters worse. Our economy, simply put, will continue its steep downward spiral with no end in sight.                Base Closures Cost More Than Anticipated  Base closures have turned out to be a lot more expensive than originally estimated, primarily because environmental costs are not included in closure estimates. As history indicates, costs for closing military bases in California have sky-rocketed:  BRAC 88 clean-up costs were originally estimated at $126 million in 1990. By 1994, the costs had quadrupled to $598 million;  The costs to clean up bases from BRAC 91 were originally estimated at $389 million. Now, these costs have risen to $1.3 billion.  Clean-up costs for BRAC 93 bases were originally estimated at $230 million in 1990. By 1994, these costs had risen more than five-fold, to $1.4 billion.  The costs to clean up and close California's bases for the first three rounds alone is nearly $3.5 billion, up from the $745 million that was originally estimated and budgeted. California bases alone could absorb all of the funds appropriated for clean-up in all the BRAC accounts from fiscal year 1990 through 1995.  And the total costs to clean up BRAC 95 bases that were originally recommended for closure or realignment is estimated at more than $1 billion--and these are just initial estimates. If history is any indication, then these costs will increase two-, three-, four-, or even five-fold. McClellan Air Force Base's environmental costs alone will more than double the original estimated clean-up costs for BRAC 95.  Mr. President, I would like to discuss some specific details on the two largest bases in California that were targeted by the Commission: McClellan Air Force Base and Long Beach Naval Shipyard.                       Mc Clellan Air Force Base  McClellan Air Force Base was targeted for closure by the Commission, against the recommendation of the Secretary of Defense and despite protests by the Air Force's military and civilian leadership. McClellan is northern California's largest industrial employer, with nearly 15,000 mostly civilian workers.  I believe that the Commission's action to target McClellan for closure will adversely impact U.S. national security and drain needed fiscal resources from higher priority programs and initiatives in the Pentagon budget.  The Air Force has stated that the cost to close one Air Logistics Center is estimated at $500 million, excluding environmental clean-up costs. These prohibitively high closure costs would be greater than the total cost the Air Force has budgeted over the next 6 year for all of its base closures and realignments nationwide.  According to a recent letter from Air Force Chief of Staff General Fogelman and Secretary of the Air Force Sheila Widnall, the Commission's action will:       Cost the Air Force hundreds of millions of additional      dollars (in excess of $1 billion in environmental and      military construction costs) during the next five years;      disrupt military readiness because of the total restructuring      of the Air Force logistics and depot system; preclude the Air      Force from carrying through on vital readiness and      modernization programs; and have a devastating impact on as      many as 25,000 DoD employees in Texas and California who      would lose their jobs or have to relocate to other Air Force      installations at great personal and public expense.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter, as well as a letter from General Moorman, the Air Force Vice Chief of Staff, be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.
