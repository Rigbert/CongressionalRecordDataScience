President, the Flake amendment--and Senator Flake is my friend--strikes the project labor agreement option.  What is a project labor agreement? It is only awarded to a company after they win the competitive bid. So they have to come in with a low competitive bill.  What does a project labor agreement contain? How much it is going to cost, what wages will be paid, and how disputes will be settled. The net result is that projects cost less and they are done on time.  Why would we want to eliminate the possibility of saving taxpayers money with project labor agreements? I hope my colleagues will vote no so we can put the money we are going to save from the Flake amendment into some important investments in America.
