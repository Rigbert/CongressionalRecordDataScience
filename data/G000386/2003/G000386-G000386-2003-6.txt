 President, I yield myself such time as I might consume.  First, I very much appreciate the passion of the opposition. Hopefully, they will look back on this day and come to the conclusion that we have not only provided prescription drugs for seniors as the first improvement in Medicare in 38 years and the strengthening of Medicare that follows it, but that we are also in the process of giving baby boomers an alternative Medicare Program, if they would so choose.
