President, today is a very special day for all Americans, but it is especially near and dear to the hearts of many residents of my home State of Illinois, because today has been designated as National Cheesecake Day.  Some may be tempted to dismiss National Cheesecake Day as another meaningless holiday. To those unenlightened few, I extend my sympathies. For you have truly missed out on one of life's sweetest pleasures. You see, in Illinois, especially in the greater Chicago area, National Cheesecake Day can only mean one thing, Eli's Cheesecake.  When long-time restaurateur and Chicagoan Eli Schulman founded Eli's: The Place for Steak Restaurant, one of his marquee offerings was a superb cheesecake. It quickly became one of Chicago's favorite desserts. So popular, in fact, that Eli's began producing it for other restaurants and retail outlets across the country. Eli's Cheesecake Company has now been a Chicago icon in its own right for more than 20 years.  Since its 1980 debut at the first Taste of Chicago, Eli's Cheesecake has grown to become the largest specialty cheesecake company in the country. In both 1993 and 1997, Eli's Cheesecake was selected to participate in the presidential inaugural festivities, they have supplied desserts on Air Force One for Presidents Reagan to Clinton, and Eli's Cheesecake provided the cake for the First Lady's birthday bash in 1997.  How does a humble homemade Chicago dessert go from after-dinner obscurity to gracing the plates of Presidents and First Ladies?  Actually, there are two answers. The first is the taste. If you've ever had a bite of an Eli's cheesecake, you'd know that there is nothing like it anywhere in the world. Eli's has taken great care to continue making each cheesecake by hand--the same way the very first one was made. This ensures each bite will have the rich, creamy Eli's taste so many have come to love.  The second is the spirit of Eli Schulman himself.  In 1910, a young man named Eli Schulman was born on Chicago's WestSide. Although Eli's father owned a bakery on Roosevelt Road, times were hard for the Schulmans.  Eli was forced to leave school and embark on a series of jobs to support his family, doing everything from selling newspapers, to peddling seat cushions at ballparks, to managing a shoe store and selling women's dresses.  In 1940, Eli decided to open his own restaurant called the Ogden Huddle. Soon after World War II breaks out, two signs appear in the restaurant's window. The first offers a 25 percent discount to men in uniform. The second simply states ``If you are hungry and don't have any money, come in and we'll feed you free.'' This spirit of generosity was carried throughout Eli Schulman's life.  Following the war, in the 1940s and 50s Eli's business expands and his new restaurants become ``hot spots'' for both the Rush Street and Lake Shore Drive set. When in town, entertainers such as Barbara Streisand, pianist Bobby Short and comedian Sheky Green often can be found frequenting Eli's.  In 1966, Eli and his Wife Esther realized their dream of opening a white-tablecloth establishment, Eli's The Place for Steak, in what was then the luxury hotel The Carriage House. Eli's soon became the spot for celebrities and dignitaries to dine. Everyone from Frank Sinatra and Sammy Davis Jr. to Gayle Sayers of the Chicago Bears and comedian Henny Youngman, all began to make Eli's their place for steak.  In the late 1970s, following up on a suggestion from a customer about his dessert, Eli spent several weeks coming up with a recipe that pleases everyone. Eli's Cheesecake quickly became a marquee offering at Eli's the Place for Steak. In the next few years, this rich and creamy dessert became such a hit that Eli's began producing cheesecakes for other restaurants and retail outlets.  Although Eli Schulman passed away in 1988, a playground in Seneca Park, located across the street from Eli's the Place for Steak, has been dedicated to his memory. And Eli Schulman's spirit lives on in the company he started. His son, Marc Schulman and Marc's wife Maureen, are dedicated to providing their customers with products and services that live up to the name ``Chicago's Finest.''  Eli's Cheesecake now employs more than 200 associates, the company's growth has been dramatic, and its headquarters, Eli's Cheesecake World, is a 62,000 square-foot state-of-the-art bakery, visitor center, and cafe.  Today, the company makes more than 15,000 cheesecakes every day for sale to restaurants, supermarkets, and airlines. Eli's Cheesecakes are also available to the public via the company's thriving mail-order business and Web site.  In honor of this great day, I have brought a taste of Chicago to the U.S. Senate. Earlier today, I delivered a sample of Eli's Cheesecakes to both the Democratic and Republican Cloakrooms for my colleagues to enjoy.  As we go about the Nation's business today, I hope that each of my colleagues will take a moment to enjoy the treats in the cloakrooms and ponder the words of a respected American writer who once proclaimed that cheesecake was the truest democratic dessert, it is a mix of different ingredients that did not care much for the presence of an upper crust.                          ____________________
