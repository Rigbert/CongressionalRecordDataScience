President, I withhold that for a moment.  While we are waiting on that matter--I am surely going to make the request again--we have my amendment with the yeas and nays on it. And I understand that the leader would prefer that votes begin in the morning. I have no objection to the leader stacking that with other votes to occur in the morning. We have the yeas and nays on it.  I urge, however, that those who have germane amendments on our side come to the floor and offer them, seek the yeas and nays, if they wish, and speak on them tonight. There is no reason why we cannot finish this bill sometime during the day tomorrow.  Mr. President, there appears to be some difficulty. I was of the understanding that Senator Hatch wanted this modified. I was going to offer that modification as a courtesy to Senator Hatch. I will not offer the modification and am perfectly happy to have them go ahead and vote on my original amendment.  I yield the floor.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify amendment No. 20 on behalf of myself and Mr. Hatch. I send the modification to the desk.
