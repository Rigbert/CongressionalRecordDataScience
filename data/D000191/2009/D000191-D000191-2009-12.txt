But the fact is that, you know, when you controlled everything, it died. The program died. And we were so desperate that at the end of the Congress Greg and I came and sat here on the floor till 2 o'clock in the morning, so at the end of that Congress we could offer a unanimous consent request to move that program forward and fund it, and the objection came from your side of the aisle again.  So, unfortunately, you know, there are some hard facts here. You are right. The original legislation was passed when the Republicans controlled the House. Bill Clinton was President. We had a bipartisan agreement to help the counties, but when there was a later opportunity, nothing happened.
