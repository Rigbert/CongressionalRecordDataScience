 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the accomplishments of the North Laurel Middle and High School cheerleading squads from the city of London in my home State of Kentucky. Recently, both teams won national championships in the Universal Cheerleaders Association, at competitions held in Orlando, FL.  Both teams overcame setbacks and injuries but still triumphed. Through hard work and dedication, they were able to clinch the national titles for Kentucky. Recently, the Sentinel-Echo newspaper in London, KY, published an article detailing the victories of both teams.  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the cheerleaders and coaches from North Laurel Middle and High Schools for their performances in the national competition. I further ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record, as well as the names of the participants and coaches.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Sentinel-Echo, Feb. 13, 2009]                        Laurels for North Laurel                           (By Tara Kaprowy)       With full police and fire truck escort, marching band      fanfare and thousands of students waiting to greet them,      North Laurel middle and high school cheerleaders came home      wreathed in victory Tuesday. The teams both clinched first      place last weekend at the Universal Cheerleaders Association      National High School Cheerleading Championship, the be-all      end-all of cheerleading competitions.       North Laurel Middle School coach Christy Jones was      thrilled.       ``It's all the buzz down here,'' she said of the North      Laurel wins. ``They loved the girls, they loved the      routine.''       North Laurel High School coach Kim Wood was likewise      pleased.       ``We're celebrating like we've never celebrated before,''      she said.       Wood's team has had a heart-stopping couple of days. The      team arrived in Orlando, Fla., a few days before the weekend      competition to have time to practice their highly technical      routine.       But on the first day, tragedy struck.       ``We had one of our strongest bases get injured,'' Wood      said. ``She blew her knee out.''       With Lindsey Lewis now forced to the sidelines, it was up      to Laura Robinson--who had never even competed before--to      step in.       ``She was so nervous,'' Wood said.       To incorporate Robinson into the performance, the girls had      to adjust their formations and rework the routine, practicing      six hours a day to get things right.       ``Each girl had to work even harder,'' Wood said.       By the end of the second round of competition, the girls      were in seventh place; one of the girls had fallen, which      cost the team points. Nevertheless, they advanced to finals.      This time, their 2\1/2\-minute routine was flawless.       ``It was perfect,'' Wood said. ``They were awesome.''       When the winners were being announced, the judges asked the      girls to maintain their composure out of respect for the      other teams. But Wood said when the runner-up was named--and      it wasn't North Laurel--her girls were ecstatic.       ``They were bawling and crying and jumping for joy,'' Wood      said.       Over in the middle-school competition, the girls were up      against the fearsome Mount Pisgah and Houston girls,      cheerleaders from two middle schools who finish first and      second year after year.       This year, Jones said she was ready for the Tennessee      teams, with North Laurel's choreographer crafting a routine      that was at the highest level of difficulty. The performance      incorporates 13 full-ups, a move in which the girls complete      a 360-degree turn before they hit the top of their stunt.       ``We do them to one leg, which is even more difficult,''      Jones said.       The girls pulled off the stunts, even though they were also      plagued by injuries.       Dani Flannery, who tore the ligaments in her ankle last      year, reinjured her leg while in Florida.       She chose to compete anyway.       ``She battled back,'' Jones said. ``And she did it with a      smile on her face.'       In the end, the NLMS girls pulled off their routine and, by      12 points, were named the champions.       Jones said the win was sweet.       ``It's been very difficult to gain respect,'' she said.      ``It's kind of the (Tennessee team) club, but we broke into      it this year. And they didn't like it.''       Jones said she and her girls are thankful for the support      they received throughout the year.       ``We are just so appreciative of our principal (David      Hensley),'' she said. ``He is so supportive of our program.      And our parents, listen, our parents raised the money so      every child could come to Florida for free. And the      community. Every time they buy a T-shirt or a box of donuts,      it lets these girls achieve their dream. I'm so thankful.''
