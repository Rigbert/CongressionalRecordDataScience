  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, we have all heard about drive-by-shootings. How about drive-through deliveries? This latest threat to the health of newborns and their moms comes from insurance companies and managed health programs. They are requiring physicians and hospitals to put mothers and newborns out of the hospital in as little as 12 hours. Not to meet the wishes of the new mother, not to foster the health of the newborns, not because it is best in the professional medical opinion of the attending physicians. These arbitrary limits have been imposed, possibly jeopardizing the health of the newborns and their new moms, only to increase the profits of the insurance companies and these for-profit managed health care plans.  Today the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller] and I have introduced legislation to restrict this growing threat to the public health and to our most vulnerable newborns and their mothers. I urge my colleagues to join us in stopping this outrageous practice.                          ____________________
