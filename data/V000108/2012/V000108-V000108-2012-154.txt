Speaker, it is with profound respect and sincere appreciation that I rise once again to recognize two of Northwest Indiana's most charitable citizens, and two dear friends, Dr. Howard Cohen and his wife, Patricia. Throughout the years, Howard and Patti have been recognized many times for their contributions to the Northwest Indiana community. On Tuesday, May 15, 2012, Dr. and Mrs. Cohen will be honored by the Rotary Club of Hammond, Indiana as the 2012 recipients of the Heinze Vocational Service Award, a recognition bestowed annually upon individuals exhibiting outstanding leadership qualities and a commitment to community service.  It would be impossible to speak of the great contributions of Patti and Howard to Northwest Indiana without boasting of the immense impact both have had at Purdue University Calumet (PUC) in Hammond. Fittingly, the event at which they will be lauded for their outstanding leadership will take place at the university, where Howard served as Chancellor from 2001 until his retirement in 2011. Under Howard's leadership, PUC's expansion was remarkable, and his commitment to the university continues today. During his tenure, students at PUC witnessed the construction of the Academic Learning Center, as well as the establishment of nine centers and institutes focused on applied research. Student housing, which had previously not existed at PUC, was also added to the campus during that time. While these visible additions to the school are quite impressive, it is Howard's commitment to raising academic standards, expanding the educational curriculum, and exposing students to a system of instruction that translates far beyond the walls of a classroom that are the true testament to his leadership.  Without question, Patti Cohen shares responsibility for these achievements and the progress that was made over the last decade. Patti has represented PUC on trips to universities in countries throughout the world including: China, Poland, Spain, Oman, and Costa Rica. She was also instrumental in promoting the university and creating a welcoming atmosphere for students, parents, and visitors. Patti also served on numerous committees and was active in the planning and hosting of many campus and community events.  In addition to their outstanding contributions to Purdue University Calumet, Patti and Howard Cohen are also to be commended for their dedication to the entire Northwest Indiana community. With the same dedication, they have served the people of Northwest Indiana through their involvement in local organizations and their service on various boards. Although their efforts encompass many different aspects of society, all contribute to one central goal: the improvement of the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and beyond.  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Howard and Patti Cohen on being named the 2012 recipients of the Heinze Vocational Service Award by the Rotary Club of Hammond, Indiana. Leaders in the truest sense of the word, their selfless commitment to their community is to be commended, and they are most deserving of this prestigious honor.                          ____________________
