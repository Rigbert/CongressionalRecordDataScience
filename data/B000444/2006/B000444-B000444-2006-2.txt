 President, as the people of Serbia approach a critical national election on January 21, 2007, I pay tribute to the journalists and broadcasters who have worked to provide an antidote to forces of extremism in the country. I especially congratulate the Voice of America's Serbian Service and recognize the 10-year anniversary of its first television broadcast. VOA's long-running work in Serbia has played a valuable role in the country's evolution and provided an important source of information during the darkest periods of Serb history. This contribution has been particularly evident as Serbia has undergone profound changes in the last 10 years.  Open Studio, VOA's first daily television newscast, was launched on December 11, 1996, in the wake of massive demonstrations to protest the invalidation of election victories by opponents of Slobodan Milosevic. In the face of public outcry, the Milosevic regime worked quickly to silence independent media outlets in Serbia, including a small, vibrant radio station called B92. The student-run station had distinguished itself by broadcasting hard news about the wars in the former Yugoslavia and engaging in relentless criticism of the Government. VOA's Serbian Service responded to the Milosevic regime's attacks on media freedom by expanding its broadcast and providing extensive reports on the international reaction to the protests in Serbia. On the day Serb authorities finally shut down B92, VOA requested permission to help the station reach its audience via VOA radio waves. As a result, VOA Serbian launched a media solidarity project and began broadcasting reports prepared by B92 stringers. The solidarity project received widespread international attention, including press coverage by the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN, and many other respected media outlets.  After VOA began providing assistance to B92, the Milosevic Government relented and permitted the station's radio service to resume broadcasting. B92's chief editor, Veran Matic, credited VOA's assistance and international pressure on the Milosevic Government with getting his station back on the air. B92 quickly became a symbol of freedom and resistance to ultranationalism during the balance of the Milosevic era. Today, the station is one of the most respected radio and television broadcasters in Serbia.  VOA's Open Studio program has built on its early success and is now carried by 53 television stations in the region; 45 in Serbia and Montenegro, 6 in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and 1 each in Kosovo and Macedonia. VOA is the leading international broadcaster in Serbia and Montenegro today, reaching 16 percent of the country's population each week through its radio and television programming.  By presenting American values to an audience that was predominantly anti-American, the Voice of America Serbian Service has been an important public diplomacy tool and helped promote United States foreign policy objectives in Southeast Europe. In keeping with the best traditions of the service's 60-year history, VOA has helped guide Serbs toward greater freedom and openness, and encouraged the country to come to terms with the difficult legacy of the Yugoslav wars. VOA's objective, comprehensive reporting and analysis has provided reliable, often indispensable information to the region's Serbian population.  Events in Serbia during the last decade provide compelling evidence of how courageous journalism can serve as a catalyst for democratic change. As the region prepares to deal with new challenges, including potential political changes in Belgrade and Kosovo, there is an ongoing need to provide Southeast Europe with reliable information. Along with the important work of B92 and other brave Serb partners, I applaud the efforts of the Voice of America to convey the facts and represent the United States to the people of Serbia. I look forward to the VOA's continued success in its next decade of service.                          ____________________[Page S11689]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)
