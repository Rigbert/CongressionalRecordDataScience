Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2831, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2007.  The recent Supreme Court ruling in the Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire case turns the clock back on decades of progress. As a result of this ruling it is now even more difficult for employees to exercise their rights for equal pay and equal treatment as determined under the law.  This decision was based on a questionable technicality, not on the fact that Ms. Ledbetter was paid 20 percent less than even the least qualified of her male counterparts. Ms. Ledbetter did nothing wrong throughout the process. She toiled for 19 years and deserved equal pay and treatment by her employers.  For centuries, women, minorities, and many others have fought for equal rights and consideration under the law. Congress is being forced to invoke its constitutional powers to restore balance and justice for the sake of equality. Today we send a strong message that discrimination and injustice on the basis of gender is intolerable.  Simply said Madam Speaker, H.R. 2831 is not about turning back the clock on civil rights law; this legislation protects these hard-fought and hard-earned guarantees. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, women who work full time, earn, on average, only 77 cents for every dollar men earn. The figures are even worse for women of color. Clearly, discrimination is not a relic of the past.  I know that many, many Members of Congress recognize the importance of this legislation. I ask all of my colleagues to vote yes. Ihope that the President will stand for equality and justice by signing this important bill.
