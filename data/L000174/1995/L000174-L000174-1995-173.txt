President, today I join in introducing the Medical Records Confidentiality Act of 1995, with Senator Bennett, our distinguished colleague from Utah.  For the past several years, I have been engaged in efforts to make sure that Americans' expectations of privacy for their medical records are fulfilled. That is the purpose of this bill.  I do not want advancing technology to lead to a loss of personal privacy and do not want the fear that confidentiality is being compromised to stifle technological or scientific development.  The distinguished Republican majority leader put his finger on this problem last year when he remarked that a compromise of privacy that sends information about health and treatment to a national data bank without a person's approval would be something that none of us would accept. We should proceed without further delay to enact meaningful protection for our medical records and personal and confidential health care information.  I have long felt that health care reform will only be supported by the American people if they are assured that the personal privacy of their health care information is protected. Indeed, without confidence that one's personal privacy will be protected, many will be discouraged from seeking help from our health care system or taking advantage of the accessibility that we are working so hard to protect.  The American public cares deeply about protecting their privacy. This has been demonstrated recently in the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation's benchmark survey on privacy entitled ``Live and Let Live'' wherein three out of four people expressed particular concern about computerized medical records held in databases used without the individual's consent. A public opinion poll sponsored by Equifax and conducted by Louis Harris indicated that 85 percent of those surveyed agreed that protecting the confidentiality of medical records is extremely important in national health care reform. I can assure you that if that poll had been taken in Vermont, it would have come in at 100 percent or close to it.  Two years ago, I began a series of hearings before the Technology and the Law Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee. I explored the emerging smart card technology and opportunities being presented to deliver better and more efficient health care services, especially in rural areas. Technology can expedite care in medical emergencies and eliminate paperwork burdens. But it will only be accepted if it is used in a secure system protecting confidentiality of sensitive medical conditions and personal privacy. Fortunately, improved technology offers the promise of security and confidentiality and can allow levels of access limited to information necessary to the function of the person in the health care treatment and payment system.  In January 1994, we continued our hearings before that Judiciary Subcommittee and heard testimony from the Clinton administration, health care providers and privacy advocates about the need to improve upon privacy protections for medical records and personal health care information.  In testimony I found among the most moving I have experienced in more than 20 years in the Senate, the subcommittee heard first hand from Representative Nydia Velazquez, our House colleague who had sensitive medical information leaked about her. She and her parents woke up to find disclosure of her attempted suicide smeared across the front pages of the New York tabloids. If any of us have reason to doubt how hurtful a loss of medical privacy can be, we need only talk to our House colleague.  Unfortunately, this is not the only horrific story of a loss of personal privacy. I have talked with the widow of Arthur Ashe about her family's trauma when her husband was forced to confirm publicly that he carried the AIDS virus and how the family had to live its ordeal in the glare of the media spotlight.  We have also heard testimony from Jeffrey Rothfeder who described in his book ``Privacy for Sale'' how a freelance artist was denied health coverage by a number of insurance companies because someone had erroneously written in his health records that he was HIV-positive.  The unauthorized disclosure and misuse of personal medical information have affected insurance coverage, employment opportunities, credit, reputation, and a host of services for thousands of Americans. Let us not miss this opportunity to set the matter right through comprehensive Federal privacy protection legislation.  As I began focusing on privacy and security needs, I was shocked to learn how catch-as-catch-can is the patchwork of State laws protecting privacy of personally identifiable medical records. A few years ago we passed legislation protecting records of our videotape rentals, but we have yet to provide even that level of privacy protection for our personal and sensitive health care data.  Just yesterday the Commerce Department released a report on Privacy and the NII. In addition to financial and other information discussed in that report, there is nothing more personal than our health care information. We must act to apply the principles of notice and consent to this sensitive, personal information.  Now is the time to accept the challenge and legislate so that the American people can have some assurance that their medical histories will not be the subject of public curiosity, commercial advantage or harmful disclosure. There can be no doubt that the increased computerization of medical information has raised the stakes in privacy protection, but my concern is not limited to electronic files.  As policymakers, we must remember that the right to privacy is one of our most cherished freedoms--it is the right to be left alone and to choose what we will reveal of ourselves and what we will keep from others. Privacy is not a partisan issue and should not be made a political issue. It is too important.  I am encouraged by the fact that the Clinton administration clearly understands that health security must include assurances that personal health information will be kept private, confidential and secure from unauthorized disclosure. Early on the administration's health care reform proposals provided that privacy and security guidelines would be required for computerized medical records. The administration's Privacy Working Group of its NII task force has been concerned with the formulation of principles to protect our privacy. In these regards, the President is to be commended.  The difficulties I had with the initial provisions of the Health Security Act, were the delay in Congress' consideration of comprehensive privacy legislation for several more years and the lack of a criminal penalty for unauthorized disclosure of someone's medical records.  Accordingly, back in May 1994, I introduced a bill to provide a comprehensive framework for protecting the privacy of our medical records from the outset rather than on a delayed basis. That bill was the Health Care Privacy Protection Act of 1994, S. 2129. I was delighted to receive support from a number of diverse quarters. We were able to incorporate provisions drawn from last year's Health Care Privacy Protection bill into those reported by the Labor and Human Resources Committee and the Finance Committee. These provisions were, likewise, incorporated in Senator Dole's bill and Senator Mitchell's bills, indicating that the leadership in both parties acknowledges the fundamental importance of privacy.  Although Congress failed in its attempt to enact meaningful health care reform last Congress, we can and should proceed with privacy protection--whether or not a comprehensive health care reform package is resurrected this year. I am proud to say that the Medical Records Confidentiality Act that Senator Bennett and I are introducing today, derives from the work we have been doing over the last several years. I am delighted to have contributed to this measure and look forward to our bipartisan coalition working for enactment of these important privacy protections.  Our bill establishes in law the principle that a person's health information is to be protected and to be kept confidential. It creates both criminal and civil remedies for invasions of privacy for a person's health care information and medical records and administrative remedies, such as debarment for health care providers who abuse others' privacy.  This legislation would provide patients with a comprehensive set of rights of inspection and an opportunity to correct their own records, as well as information accounting for disclosures of those records.  The bill creates a set of rules and norms to govern the disclosure of personal health information and narrows the sharing of personal details within the health care system to the minimum necessary to provide care, allow for payment and to facilitate effective oversight. Special attention is paid to emergency medical situations, public health requirements, and research.  We have sought to accommodate legitimate oversight concerns so that we do not create unnecessary impediments to health care fraud investigations. Effective health care oversight is essential if our health care system is to function and fulfill its intended goals. Otherwise, we risk establishing a publicly sanctioned playground for the unscrupulous. Health care is too important a public investment to be the subject of undetected fraud or abuse.  I look forward to working with my colleagues both here in the Senate and in the House as we continue to refine this legislation. I want to thank all of those who have been working with us on the issue of health information privacy and, in particular, wish to commend the Vermont Health Information Consortium, the Center for Democracy and Technology, the American Health Information Management Association, the American Association of Retired Persons, the AIDS Action Council, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the Legal Action Center, IBM Corp. and the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association for their tireless efforts in working to achieve a significant consensus on this important matter.  With Senator Bennett's leadership and the longstanding commitment to personal privacy shared by Chairman Kassebaum and Senator Kennedy, I have every confidence that the Senate will proceed to pass strong privacy protection for medical records. With continuing help from the administration, health care providers and privacy advocates we can enact provisions to protect the privacy of the medical records of the American people and make this part of health care security a reality for all Americans.                                 ______      By
