Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Solomon) for those kind remarks. My sentiments are the same for him. He has always been a champion for human rights in China and in other captive nations. I applaud and deeply respect him for that work. I also want to thank the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Hall) for his support for the rule and the bill, H.R. 1757, and for pointing out that there are a large number of very important human rights provisions in this bill that Members should be aware of, that will advance the goals that we care about so deeply with regard to human rights around the globe.                              {time}  1415  First, let me just make this point to all of my colleagues that this is not, per se, a foreign aid bill. It is a State Department bill. It contains important restrictions on foreign aid but authorizes no appropriations for these purposes except for a $38 million package of humanitarian assistance for the anti-Saddam Hussein, pro-democracy movement in Iraq.  The bill contains a compromise version of the pro-life Mexico City, cutting off funds to foreign organizations that promote abortion--lobby for abortion or attempt to influence legislation or policy as it relates to abortion. The compromise would allow the President to waive the prohibition on assistance to abortion providers. This was very hard for our side to concede, but in the legislative tug of war this is half a loaf, and our hope is that the administration will take note of that. There needs to be some give and take.  This bill also conditions funding to the U.N. Population Fund on an end to the UNFPA activities in cooperation with the coercive population control program in China.  Wei Jing Sheng testified before our subcommittee a few weeks ago and was absolutely aghast and appalled and outraged that the UNFPA worked side by side with the oppressors of women in the People's Republic of China, and said so in very, very clear and unambiguous language at the subcommittee. Wei asked how the U.N. could join and support the oppressors of women, babies--the family.  H.R. 1757 also contains U.N. reform and arrearages packages which, unlike some proposals, is not a blank check to the U.N. The U.N. arrearage money is delivered, in 3 tranches. Each payment is contingent on U.N. implementation of specific reforms, including reduction of U.S. dues from its current 25 percent to ultimately 20 percent but 22 percent on the near term, and a reduction of U.S. peacekeeping assessments from 31 percent down to 25 percent.  The bill reduces the number of Federal agencies by two. It merges the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency and USIA, U.S. Information Agency, into the State Department to achieve savings through efficiency and resource sharing. But it structures this merger very carefully to preserve the integrity of arms control process and especially of the pro-freedom and pro-democracy functions of USIA's public diplomacy programs like the radios.  This legislation enhances Radio Free Asia to provide a 24-hour pro-freedom broadcasting to China.  It also contains provisions designed to force deadbeat diplomats at the U.N.to pay child support judgments and to ensure that diplomats who commit crimes in the U.S. will be prosecuted for those crimes.  It reforms the State Department personnel law to restore the Secretary's power to fire convicted felons from the Foreign Service and to eliminate duplicative pension and salary provisions that allow double dipping at taxpayers' expense.  It contains provisions that will ensure vigorous enforcements of the Helms-Burton law which is designed to bring freedom and democracy to the Cuban people.  It sets aside $100 million of the State Department budget for implementation of the congressional directive that the U.S. Embassy in Israel be moved to Jerusalem, and it incorporates the McBride principles designed to end employment discrimination against Catholics in northern Ireland as a condition of U.S. foreign aid.  H.R. 1757 also includes a number of important provisions relating to human rights and refugees from Tibet, Burma, Vietnam, Cuba, Africa and elsewhere. These provisions have been endorsed by leading organizations, including the U.S. Catholic Conference, the Council of Jewish Federations, the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, and the U.S. Committee for Refugees.  Mr. Chairman, I urge a yes on the rule, and I hope the Members will also vote yes on the conference report.
