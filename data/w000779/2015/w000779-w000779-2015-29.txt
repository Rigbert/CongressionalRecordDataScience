President, today we are kicking off a debate on major bipartisan legislation. Chairman Hatch and I are also involved in an important Senate Finance Committee hearing. He will be here a little bit later today.  I ask unanimous consent that our colleague, Senator Durbin from Illinois, be allowed to speak after I do. I believe that his remarks will also be completed before Chairman Hatch arrives.
