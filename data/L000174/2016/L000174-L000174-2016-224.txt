President, I realize our time has expired, but I ask unanimous consent that I be able to yield the floor for my colloquy but that I be followed for 5 minutes by the distinguished senior Senator from Connecticut and that he be followed by the distinguished senior Senator from Minnesota for 5 minutes.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Grassley). I am in the Chair and probably can't participate, but I want to make it clear that I want the manager of the bill to speak so----
