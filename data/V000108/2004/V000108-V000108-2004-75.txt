Speaker, it is with a great sense of honor that I rise to celebrateBlack History Month and its 2004 theme--Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education. On May 17th of this year, we will celebrate the anniversary of the Supreme Court's decision to desegregate public schools in America. Because of this ruling, many significant pathways have been opened within our country that focus on justice, equality, and the importance of education.  As we reflect on the importance of the Brown v. Board of Education ruling, I would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to an individual from the First Congressional District that has represented the epitome of leadership in education within the African-American community, Dr. YJean Chambers. YJean passed away on Wednesday, November 12th, 2003, but her legacy of courage and dedication continues to inspire us all each day.  YJean and her family moved to Gary, Indiana from Kentucky when she was a young girl, seeking a better life for themselves. In 1939, she graduated from Gary Roosevelt High School ranking second in her class, and then went on to earn her Bachelor of Education degree from Illinois State University. She also went on to earn her Master of Arts degree from Purdue University, where she received Purdue University's highest award, Doctor of Humane Letters in 1993.  YJean knew how important education was to all members of her community and therefore shared her gift of knowledge and enthusiasm for learning by becoming a teacher in Madison, Illinois. After two years she began teaching speech and drama at her alma mater, Gary Roosevelt High School. In 1971, YJean became a full time professor at Purdue Calumet in Hammond, Indiana where she taught communications and was appointed Assistant Professor of Communications in 1973.  YJean gave selflessly to her community in so many ways, including being a member of several important educational organizations. She served as President of the Steel City Hall of Fame, sat on the Service Academies Nomination Board, was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Gary Community Schools, and was also a member of the Board of Directors of the Indiana School Board Association. YJean made history in Northwest Indiana by becoming the first African American woman elected to the Northwest Indiana Crime Commission and the first woman to serve on the Advisory Board of the Bank of Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate the anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education throughout Black History Month, let us pay tribute to our country's educational leaders such as Dr. YJean Chambers, who have taught us the true values of equality and determination. I respectfully ask that you and my other colleagues join me in commending Dr. Chambers, as well as all other outstanding African-American leaders in education for their efforts to build a better society for our country and the citizens of Northwest Indiana.                          ____________________
