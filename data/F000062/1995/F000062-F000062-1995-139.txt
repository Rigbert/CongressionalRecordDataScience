S. Catholic Conference, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, as well as several other organizations.  I believe that we are essentially a nation of immigrants. I sit as a new member of the Immigration Subcommittee and I know there is a legitimate reason that the Government should try to dissuade, in any way we can, people from becoming naturalized simply to gain welfare. There is no question about it. I believe the immigration bill that we have marked up in the Immigration Subcommittee deals with that.  What this bill does is it says that if you are a naturalized citizen--and let me give some specific examples. Take my mother's case and put it in the present day. My mother came to this country at the age of 3. Supposing her mother was naturalized, that would make her a naturalized citizen. Then supposing my mother did want to go to college, which she never had an opportunity to do, she would be eligible for a loan program. Under this bill, as drafted, my mother would never be eligible as a naturalized citizen for a program. Even Medicaid, she would not be eligible for it.  Taking my mother again, say my mother came to this country as a spouse, never worked, was naturalized, was a naturalized citizen for 20 years. Say my father left her and she was destitute. She would not have access to any aid program, cash or noncash, the way the bill is presently drafted. The language before the Senate simply deletes this language and keeps a class of ``American citizen'' as one class. If you are naturalized, you are as good as someone who is born anywhere in this great country.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                                       U.S. Department of Justice,                                Office of Legislative Affairs,                                    Washington, DC, July 18, 1995.     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Kennedy: This letter follows your question to      Attorney General Janet Reno regarding the constitutionality      of the deeming provisions in pending immigration legislation      at the Senate Judiciary Committee's oversight hearing on June      27.       You have asked for our views regarding the ``deeming''      provisions of section 204 of S. 269, Senator Simpson's      proposed immigration legislation. Our comment here is limited      to the questions raised by application of section 204 to      naturalized citizens.       We have serious concerns about section 204's      constitutionality as applied to naturalized citizens. So      applied, the deeming provisions would operate to deny, or      reduce eligibility for, a variety of benefits including      student financial assistance and welfare benefits to certain      United States citizens because they were born outside the      country. This appears to be an unprecedented result. Current      federal deeming provisions under various benefits programs      operate only as against aliens, (see e.g., 42 U.S.C. Sec. 615      (AFDC); 7 U.S.C. 2014(i) (Food Stamps) and we are not aware      of any comparable restrictions on citizen eligibility for      federal assistance. As a matter of policy, we think it would      be a mistake to begin now to relegate naturalized citizens--     who have demonstrated their commitment to our country by      undergoing the naturalization process--to a kind of second-     class status.       The provision might be defended legally on the grounds that      it is an exercise of Congress' plenary authority to regulate      immigration and naturalization, or, more specifically, to set      the terms under which persons may enter the United States and      become citizens. See Mathews v. Diaz, 426 U.S. 67 (1976);      Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1, 10-11 (1982). We are not      convinced that this defense would prove persuasive. Though      Congress undoubtedly has power to impose conditions precedent      on entry and naturalization, the provision at issue here      would function as a condition subsequent, applying to      entrants even after they become citizens. It is not at all      clear that Congress' immigration and      naturalization power extends this far.       While the rights of citizenship of the native born derive      from Sec. 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment and the rights of the      naturalized citizen derive from satisfying, free of fraud,      the requirements set by Congress, the latter, apart from the      exception noted [constitutional eligibility for President],      becomes a member of the society, possessing all the      rights of a native citizen, and standing, in the view of the      constitution, on the footing of a native. The constitution      does not authorize Congress to enlarge or abridge those      rights. The simply power of the national Legislature, is to      prescribe a uniform rule of naturalization, and the exercise      of this power exhausts it, so far as respects the individual.       Schneider v. Rusk, 377 U.S. 163, 166 (1964) (internal      quotations omitted) (statutory restriction on length foreign      residence applied to naturalized but not native born citizens      violates Fifth Amendment equal protection component).       Alternatively, it might be argued in defense of the      provision that it classifies not by reference to citizenship      at all, but rather on the basis of sponsorship; only those      naturalized citizens with sponsors will be affected. Again,      we have doubts about whether this characterization of the      provision would be accepted. State courts have rejected an      analogous position with respect to state deeming provisions,      finding that the provisions constitute impermissible      discrimination based on alienage despite the fact that they      reach only sponsored aliens. See Barannikov v. Town of      Greenwich, 643 A.2d 251, 263-64 (Conn. 1994); El Souri v.      Dep't of Social Services, 414 N.W. 2d 679, 682-83 (Mich.      1987). Because the deeming provision in question here, as      applied to citizens, is directed at and reaches only      naturalized citizens, the same reasoning would compel the      conclusion that it constitutes discrimination against      naturalized citizens. Cf. Nyquist v. Mauclet, 432 U.S. 1, 9      (1977) (``The important points are that [the law] is directed      at aliens and that only aliens are harmed by it. The fact      that the statute is not an absolute bar does not mean that it      does not discriminate against the class.'') Invalidating      state law denying some, but not all, resident aliens      financial assistance for higher education.       So understood, the deeming provision, as applied to      citizens, would contravene the basic equal protection tenet      that ``the rights of citizenship of the native born and of      the naturalized person are of the same dignity and are      coextensive.'' Schneider, 377 U.S. at 165. To the same      effect, the provision might be viewed as a classification      based on national origin; among citizens otherwise eligible      for government assistance, the class excluded by operation of      the deeming provision is limited to those born outside the      United States. A classification based on national origin, of      course, is subject to strict scrutiny under equal protection      review, see Korematsu v. United States, 323 U.S. 214 (1944),      and it is unlikely that the deeming provision could be      justified under this standard. See Barannikova 643 A.2d at      265 (invalidating state deeming provision under strict      scrutiny); El Souri, 414 N.W.2d at 683 (same).       The Office of Management and Budget has advised that there      is no objection to the submission of this letter from the      standpoint of the Administration's program.           Sincerely,                                                      Andrew Fois,                                       Assistant Attorney General.                               Exhibit 2                                                 City of New York,                                          Office of the Mayor,                                 New York, NY, September 12, 1995.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: As the Senate moves to      consideration of welfare reform legislation, I want to share      my serious concerns with you about the legal immigrant      provisions included in this bill. As the Mayor of New York      City, a city that has benefited immensely from the economic,      cultural, and social contributions of immigrants, I am      particularly troubled by unprecedented efforts to limit      benefits to legal immigrants and unfairly target them.       The Senate welfare reform package, for the first time,      would impose extraordinary restrictions on qualified      immigrants' access to many federal benefit programs. The      Senate proposal would also extend sponsor deeming to a broad      range of programs not presently covered by deeming      restrictions. This proposal is likely to restrict benefits to      some legal immigrants even after they become naturalized      citizens, thereby creating a second class of U.S.      citizenship. Like yourself, I believe that extending deeming      beyond citizenship is unwise public policy and may prove      unconstitutional, and I support your efforts to end deeming      upon citizenship. In addition, I also support your attempts      to limit deeming to cash assistance programs only and not to      Medicaid or other non-cash assistance programs.       While the denial of benefits to legal immigrants is      patently unfair to taxpaying residents, it will also result      in considerable cost-shifting to local and state governments.      Because the federal government has sole responsibility over      immigration policy, it must bear the concomitant      responsibility of serving the legal immigrants it permits to      enter states and localities. I am deeply concerned that      denying benefits to legal immigrants or extending deeming      beyond citizenship will not eliminate needs and,      subsequently, force state and local governments to bear the      financial consequences of unwise policy decisions. The Senate      welfare reform package fails to provide states and localities      with funding for expected high administrative costs      associated with implementing this proposal, and is an      unfunded mandate that New York and other cities should not      have to bear.       Finally, I am concerned about potential efforts to amend      the Senate bill and federalize many of the harshest      provisions from California's Proposition 187. Such an      approach would deny services to illegal immigrants without      regard to the dangers it would create for American cities.      The problems of illegal immigration in our country is the      result of the federal government's inability to patrol its      borders and implement an effective deportation strategy.      Adoption of a federal Proposition 187 will do nothing to      address the overall problem of illegal immigration, but      instead will further highlight the federal government's      failure to enforce adequately our nation's immigration laws      and policies.       If California's Proposition 187 becomes the law of the      land, the results for cities heavily impacted by illegal      immigration, such as New York, would be catastrophic. I urge      you to consider these possible scenarios. Faced with the      threat of deportation, many families would forego needed      medical care, keep their children out of school, and refuse      to report crime, or act as a witness in criminal cases.      Immigrant children kept out of school would be denied their      only chance at assimilation and productive futures, and, as a      result, many turn to the streets, and illegal activities.      Communicable diseases might well would go untreated if      immigrants are denied access to treatment. In addition, many      crimes would go unreported by illegal immigrants desperate to      avoid contact with the police.       As the Senate debates welfare reform legislation over the      coming days, I am hopeful that the Senate will approve your      amendments and remove the bill's burdensome restrictions      placed on legal immigrants, and oppose any efforts to      federalize Proposition 187. Thank you for your good work on      this bill and for your consideration of New York City's views      on this important legislation.           Sincerely,                                              Rudolph W. Giuliani,     Mayor.                                                                    ____         National Conference of State Legislatures, National            Governors' Association, National Association of            Counties, National League of Cities,                                                September 6, 1995.       Dear Senator: The National Conference of State Legislatures      (NCSL), the National Governors' Association (NGA), the      National Association of Counties (NACo) and the National      League of Cities (NLC) firmly believe that the federal      government is responsible for providing funds to pay for the      consequences of its immigration policy decisions. As you      consider welfare reform legislation on the Senate floor this      week, we urge you to support amendments which will protect      states and localities from immigration cost-shifts and      unfunded mandates. State and local governments cannot and      should not be the safety net for federal policy decisions.      The federal government has sole jurisdiction over immigration      policy and must bear the responsibility to serve the legal      immigrants it allows to enter states and localities.       Eliminating benefits to legal immigrants or deeming for      unreasonably long periods will not eliminate needs. State and      local budgets and taxpayers will bear the burden under either      of these options. Denial of services to legal immigrants by      states and localities appears to violate both state and      federal constitutional provisions. As a result of the 1971      Supreme Court decisions Graham v. Richardson, states and      localities may not exclude persons from participating in      their welfare programs on the basis of lawful alienage.      Although the federal government has the option to drop legal      immigrants from its welfare rolls, states and localities may      not. We continue to support making affidavits of support      legally binding and imposing a limited deeming period.       We understand that welfare reform proposals are likely to      extend sponsor deeming over a broad range of programs not      presently covered by deeming restrictions. These proposals      are also likely to restrict benefits to some legal immigrants      even after they become naturalized citizens. We believe that      sponsor deeming should be used in a more targeted fashion to      limit the financial and administrative burdens states and      localities will face in implementing an extended deeming      policy. First, deeming should end when an immigrant becomes a      naturalized citizen. Second, deeming should cover cash      assistance programs only and not be extended to Medicaid,      child protective services, or other non-cash assistance      programs. Lastly, certain groups of immigrants should not      face deeming under any circumstances, specifically legal      immigrants over the age of 75 and those who are victims of      domestic violence.
