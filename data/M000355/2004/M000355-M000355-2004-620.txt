 President, on Monday, the Senate will begin consideration of the budget resolution. Senator Nickles and Senator Conrad will be here on Monday morning to kick off the debate on that important matter and receive any amendments that may be offered on Monday.  It is the intention of the managers to have a full day of debate on the resolution during Monday's session. At this time, I will say that rollcall votes are possible Monday evening. A vote or votes may occur in relation to amendments on the budget resolution or judicial nominations. We will alert Members when a vote becomes locked in for a certain time.  I remind my colleagues that under budget procedures, there will be up to 50 hours of debate on the resolution, and we will complete action on the budget prior to adjourning for the March recess. Therefore, our colleagues should expect a very busy week next week with late night sessions and votes throughout the week. I encourage all Members to arrange their schedules accordingly.                          ____________________
