 President: I rise today with my colleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, to introduce legislation to expand the federal loan forgiveness program to include Head Start teachers.  Head Start is one of the most important federal programs because it has the potential to reach children early in their formative years when their cognitive skills are just developing. We know that poor children disproportionately start school behind their peers--they are less likely to count to 10 or to recite the alphabet.  Providing low-income children with access to programs that encourage cognitive learning and prepare them to enter school ready to learn is important. Head Start is one example of a Federal program that has the potential to reach every low-income child; to help every eligible child learn to count to ten and begin to recite the alphabet.  Many of our Nation's youngsters, however, enter elementary school without the basic skills necessary to succeed. Often these children lag behind their peers throughout their academic career.  As taxpayers, we will spend millions on efforts to help these children catch up. Many of these children will never catch up.  Several studies confirm the importance of providing low-income children with the opportunity early on to gain basic cognitive skills:  A study conducted on a preschool program in Chicago showed that for every dollar invested, $8 was saved by society in projected costs. Additionally, 26 percent more children were likely to finish high school and 40 percent were less likely to repeat a grade.  The National Head Start Association found that for every dollar invested in Head Start, at least $2.50 is saved because these children need less remedial education and are less likely to be on welfare programs or involved with the juvenile justice system than non-Head Start peers.  The Rand Corporation found that for every dollar invested in early childhood learning programs, taxpayers save between $4 and $7 later by reducing the need for alcohol and drug treatment programs, special education programs, mental health services, and the likelihood of incarceration.  We can save millions by providing low-income children with access to quality preschool where they will gain the necessary cognitive skills to succeed in school and life.  In order to give every child a head start in life, we must continue to recruit qualified teachers to the Head Start field who have demonstrated knowledge and teaching skills in reading, writing, early childhood development, and other areas of the preschool curriculum with a particular focus on cognitive learning. Obtaining and maintaining teachers with such qualifications is the only way to jump-start cognitive learning and to ensure that our youngsters start elementary school ready to learn.  Several recent studies confirm the importance of investing in the education and training of those who work with preschoolers.  A study conducted by the National Research Council at the request of the U.S. Department of Education recommends that:       Each group of children in an early childhood education and      care program should be assigned a teacher who has a      bachelor's degree with specialized education related to      early childhood. . . . Progress toward a high-quality      teaching force will require substantial public and private      support and incentive programs, including innovative      education programs, scholarship and loan programs, and      compensation commensurate with the expectations of college      graduates.  The Head Start 2010 National Advisory Panel presided over fifteen national hearings and open forums. The panel found:       There was a tremendous amount of testimony about the fact      that, despite increases resulting from Federal quality set-     aside funding, relatively low salaries and poor or non-     existent benefits make it difficult to attract and retain      qualified staff over the long term. Witnesses stated that      many staff positions remain vacant and turnover is likely to      worsen if compensation does not improve significantly . . .      comments included passionate exhortations for greater      investment in staff, observing that, in Head Start . . . the      quality of the program is tied directly to the quality of the      staff.  Many Head Start programs are losing qualified teachers to local school districts because the pay is better, and working in an elementary or secondary school assists these teachers in qualifying to receive up to $5,000 of their federal loans forgiven. Every teacher Head Start loses impacts access to services for our nation's most vulnerable youngsters.  I believe that leveling the playing field by offering Head Start teachers the same loan forgiveness benefit currently afforded to elementary and secondary school teachers could encourage more college graduates to enter the field.  Following the recommendations of the Head Start 2010 National Advisory Panel and the National Research Council, I believe we must create programs to encourage highly educated and trained individuals to commit to long-term careers in the Head Start arena.  To encourage recent graduates, current Head Start teachers without a degree, and college students to enter and remain in the Head Start field, I am introducing legislation that will expand the federal loan forgiveness program to include Head Start teachers. In exchange for 5 years of service, a Head Start teacher could receive up to $5,000 of their federal Stafford loan forgiven.  I believe we must continue to improve the Head Start program such that children leave the program able to count to ten, to recognize sizes and colors, and can begin to recite the alphabet, to name a few indicators of cognitive learning. To ensure cognitive learning, we must also continue to raise the standards for Head Start teachers. Offering Head Start teachers similar compensation for their educational achievements and expenses afforded to other teachers should be a priority of this Congress.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill now appear in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 123       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
