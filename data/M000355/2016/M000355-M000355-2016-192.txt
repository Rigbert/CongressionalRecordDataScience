 President, I wish to pay tribute to a distinguished Kentuckian and beloved member of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park family who I regret has recently passed away: Berlin Forest Howard III. Mr. Howard was lost while performing his job in service to our national parks. He was 27 years old.  On August 22 of this year, a tragic accident befell him as he was mowing the lawn in the park, and he was pronounced dead shortly after being rushed to the Middlesboro Appalachian Regional Hospital.  Mr. Howard's loss has been felt by many and has inspired those who were close to him to reflect on what joy he brought to all those around him. Mr. Howard had a happy, bright aura about him. He was someone who would always be caught smiling and bringing light to others with his positive attitude. He was dedicated to the national park and proud of his Appalachian heritage. His memory will continue on through his two children, Reid and Xander.  My thoughts go out to the Howard family during this time of grief. I want to thank Mr. Howard for his many years of dedication to preserving a park that is a treasure, not just for the Commonwealth of Kentucky, but also the Nation. I am sure my Senate colleagues join me in expressing gratitude and admiration for Mr. Howard's life and legacy of service as well.  An area publication, the Mountain News WYMT, published an article on this sad incident. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       [From WYMT, Aug. 23, 2016]        Friends Mourn the Loss of Man Killed While Mowing Grass                             (By Caleb Noe)       Bell County, Ky.--Across the country, park rangers wear a      black band across their badges, mourning the loss of one of      their own.       ``The Cumberland Gap staff is a family in itself. Knowing      that one of our own is no longer with us is definitely having      its toll,'' said Supervisory Park Ranger Carol Borneman.       Berlin Forest Howard III, 27, a maintenance worker at      Cumberland Gap National Historical Park, was killed on the      job while mowing the grass.       We're told the incident happened just off of Pinnacle View      Road, at the national park Monday morning, when a van      collided with Howard, who was on a riding lawn mower at the      time.       ``It's just hard to understand. It just makes us all think      about telling our children every day how much we love them,      because you don't know when you're going to have that chance      again,'' said Bruce Thompson, a family friend.       Bruce Thompson watched Howard grow up in Middlesboro and      says it's hard to find another young man as compassionate,      caring, and hard-working.       ``[He] just absolutely loved life. He'd do anything to help      you. It didn't matter what time of day it was. If he could      help you, he'd help you. It's hard to find that caliber of a      person,'' said Thompson.       Recently, Howard took an interest in golf and actually won      a ``closest to the pin'' contest at Middlesboro Country Club,      just last Tuesday.       ``He was very dedicated to trying to master the game,''      said Thompson.       Friends and family members will try to come to terms with      the loss of a son, brother, and father.                          ____________________
