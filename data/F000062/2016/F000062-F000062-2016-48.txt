 President, today I wish to speak about the urgent need for Congress to approve emergency funds to fight the Zika virus.  The Zika virus is a rapidly growing public health threat, and the stakes for women are particularly high. The virus is carried by two species of mosquito. They are found in 40 States in this country.  There have been 388 travel-related cases in the United States--meaning an individual was infected during a trip to Latin America, South America, or the Caribbean, where the virus is widespread. There have not yet been any reported cases of local transmission in the continental United States, although more than 500 cases have been reported in Puerto Rico. It is a matter of when, not if, that happens--particularly as we approach the summer season when mosquitos are most active.  Scientists are still working to understand the effects of the Zika virus, but we do know that Zika causes severe, brain-related birth defects in babies when women are infected during pregnancy.  Microcephaly, one of the most serious effects of Zika, causes babies' heads to be much smaller than normal. In severe cases, you will also see seizures, developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, feeding problems, hearing loss, and vision problems.  The CDC continues to research the virus, and it could be several years before the full-range of health effects is known.  One of the most concerning gaps in our scientific knowledge is how the disease is transmitted from person to person. The most common way people contract the disease is through mosquito bites, but there have been documented cases of the virus being spread from men to women through sexual contact.  Zika symptoms are mild--fever, rash, and joint pain--meaning that many people may become infected and spread with disease without knowing they have it. Unless we act now, we could end up with a significant number of Zika carriers who don't know they are infected.  The administration has asked Congress for $1.9 billion in emergency funding to stop the spread of the Zika virus. I fully support this funding request. The Federal Government needs this money for a number of reasons, including controlling mosquito populations, researching the virus, educating the public, and developing a vaccine.  As the weather warms, Zika will spread faster, particularly in States with persistent mosquito issues. We simply can't ignore public health threats of this magnitude, hoping they will go away.  In closing, Congress cannot afford to delay. I strongly urge the Senate to approve the administration's sensible request to fight this growing public health threat.                          ____________________
