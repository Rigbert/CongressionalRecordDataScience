 President, I thank the distinguished junior Senator from Wyoming for his very articulate, knowledgeable speech in support of the first amendment. He has made an important contribution to this debate, and I am very much appreciative, as are my colleagues who feel this is a step in the wrong direction. I very much appreciate his contribution.
