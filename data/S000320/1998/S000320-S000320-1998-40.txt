 President, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend Bertie Sweeney Gammell Parish, a lifelong resident of Clayton, Alabama, hardworking wife and mother, dedicated member of the community, newspaper professional, and an inspiration to all who knew her. Bertie passed away at her home on Wednesday, August 26, 1998.  Born on June 4, 1915 in Dothan, Alabama, Bertie was the daughter of William Lee and Pearle Ennis Gammell. From her earliest beginnings, Bertie was an active member of the Clayton United Methodist Church where she combined her love of music with her service to God as organist and choir director for almost 50 years. Bertie held a bachelor's degree in music from Alabama College, teaching music briefly at Montgomery County High School and later in Clayton.  A former member of the Eufaula Music Guild, Bertie was a Paul Harris fellow of the Rotary Foundation of Rotary International---an award presented by the Clayton Rotary Club, a lifetime member of the Alabama Federation of Garden Clubs and a member of the Clayton Garden Club.  In addition to the many awards and community service position she held, Bertie is probably best known as the editor and publisher of The Clayton Record---a post she assumed in 1960 after the deaths of her father and later her mother---both held the position in consecutive terms before her. She passed this torch to her daughter Rebecca Parish Beasley who holds the position today. The Clayton Record is one of only a few remaining family-owned and operated newspapers.  Bertie's column ``One Comment,'' which appeared on the front page of The Clayton Record, was a favorite of subscribers. From her astute observations on everything from politics to gardening, Bertie thrilled, inspired and delighted her readers, including local gardeners who hoped to receive mention in one of her columns.  Bertie was well known not only in Clayton, but across Alabama. She received many awards and kudos from colleagues in the news business including a listing in Who's Who of American Women, and the News Media Service to Education Award. She was also a staunch preservationist who worked diligently to preserve history and local historic structures in and around Clayton.  Despite a demanding schedule, Bertie never forgot what matters most: family and friends. She is survived by her husband Thomas William Parish, Sr.---to whom she would have been married for 59 years on August 30, 1998; three children: Dr. Thomas William Parish, Jr., of Geneva, Joseph Edward Parish, Sr., of Clayton; and Rebecca Parish Beasley of Clayton; six grandchildren: Joseph Edward Parish, Jr. of Montgomery; Lucile Martin Parish of Columbus, Georgia; Edna Elane Parish Gulledge of Virginia Beach, Virginia; Thomas Frank Kelly, Jr., of Montgomery; Rebecca Parish Kelly of Clayton; and Thomas William Parish, III, of Geneva; three great-grandchildren; other relatives and friends too numerous to mention.  I will miss Bertie. She was a good friend for many years. My heart goes out to her family as they remember her love, her many accomplishments, and the important role she set for them and for others in and around Clayton, Alabama. My prayers are with you.                          ____________________
