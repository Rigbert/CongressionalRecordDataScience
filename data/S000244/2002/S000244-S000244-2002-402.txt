Chairman, I am happy to inform the gentleman and Members of Congress thatthis issue was addressed in the bill H.R. 3525, which requires the INS to implement a student visa tracking system. That bill was passed unanimously on a voice vote by the House of Representatives on December 19. The other body passed this bill with amendments on April 18. We will be having a vote on concurring with those amendments some time shortly, and the student visa tracking legislation, together with an entry-exit system tracking, will be on its way to the President for his expected signature.  We are going to be across the finish line with this before the current bill goes before the President.
