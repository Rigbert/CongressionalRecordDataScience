Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for so effectively raising that issue this evening because I do not think the public fully understands who can take whom to court and how our basic legal rights are undermined through the NAFTA agreement and the CAFTA agreement. We basically abdicate that to these bodies that have no transparency. They have no regular right for an individual citizen, for example, to take a claim. We end up with big corporations taking the laws of the State of New York to court or the United States of America to court.  I mentioned the instance where a Canadian company, a company, challenged California as a State their right to ban MTBE from their gasoline because it was polluting their water, of which they have a limited amount.
