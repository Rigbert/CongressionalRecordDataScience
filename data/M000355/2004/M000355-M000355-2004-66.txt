 The conference report provides financial assistance for producers in return for the termination of tobacco marketing quotas and related price support. For kinds of tobacco other than fluecured and burely tobacco, the payments to producers will reflect ``the basic tobacco farm acreage allotment for the 2002 marketing year established by the secretary for quota tobacco produced on the farm.''  My understanding is that for this calculation, the secretary will take into account non-disaster transfer of allotments that were made for the 2002 marketing year. As the Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, is that correct?
