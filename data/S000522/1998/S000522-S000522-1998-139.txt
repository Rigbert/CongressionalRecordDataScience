Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of the amendment to HR 4101 offered today by my friend and colleague from New Jersey, Mr. LoBiondo, and Mr. Sanders of Vermont. The amendment will provide an additional $10 million for Senior Nutrition Programs, which support state and local efforts, offset with a minor reduction in overhead and salaries at the Food and Drug Administration. This amendment will restore funding for this vital senior program to its FY 1996 level of $150 million.  As we make the tough choices needed to keep our budget balanced, we cannot forget the needs of our senior citizens, most of whom live on fixed incomes and have limited means.  For many of these senior-citizens, the meals provided by these programs represent their main meal for the day. In 1996, the Mercer County, New Jersey Office on Aging reported that 1,483 persons received almost 119,839 nutritious meals provided in part under the Older Americans Act. In Ocean County, Phil Rubenstein, Executive Director of the Ocean County Office of Senior Services, has stated that approximately 600 individuals a day will eat a meal and enjoy the company of others at a congregate nutrition site. The situation in Burlington County and Monmouth County are very similar.  Senior Nutrition Programs are cost effective. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, for every $1 spent, nearly $3 is saved in other health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid, Mr. Speaker, this amendment should be a ``no brainer,'' and I urge all of my colleagues to support the LoBiondo/Sanders amendment to HR 4101.
