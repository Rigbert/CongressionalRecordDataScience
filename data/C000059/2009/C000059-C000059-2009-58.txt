Sillers, the founder of St. Margaret's Episcopal School and two other Episcopal schools in Orange County. Orange County, California has been blessed by dynamic and dedicated leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Reverend Sillers dedicated his life and purpose to both God and education; he will be dearly missed.  Ernest Sillers was born October 2, 1910, in River John, Nova Scotia. When he was 18 years old, he answered his personal calling and decided to attend Gordon College in Wenham, Massachusetts. It was there he met the love of his life, Aldine, and they were married. Rev. Sillers graduated with a degree in theology and entered the ministry at First Baptist Church in Seabrook, New Hampshire. He studied for a master's degree and attended the Episcopal Seminary at Cambridge Seminary as a part-time student. His efforts led him to become an ordained Episcopal Priest. After serving in New England, Rev. Sillers moved to Pico Rivera where he was Vicar of the mission parish of St. Bartholomew. Because of his long time interest in education, Rev. Sillers obtained a teaching credential. In 1960, Rev. Sillers was called to be Rector of St. Mark's Episcopal Church in Downey, California. There, he was inspired to start his first school.  Fifteen years later, Ernest Sillers and Aldine were retired and living in Laguna Beach. The Bishop of the Diocese of Los Angeles had heard that people in the growing community of San Juan Capistrano would be served by an Episcopal church. He asked Rev. Sillers if he would be a temporary priest-in-chart to start the church and Sillers accepted. In October 1979, St. Margaret's Episcopal School was founded with 79 students and was located in temporary structures. The following year, the student population doubled and by 1986, a 12th grade class had graduated. Aldine, served as the school's founding librarian.  After the successful founding and growth of St. Margaret's, Rev. Sillers was ready for a new challenge. He went on to found St. John's Episcopal Church and School in Rancho Santa Margarita and, a few years later, St. Mary and All Angels Episcopal School in Aliso Viejo.  On October 15, 2009, Reverend Canon Ernest D. Sillers passed away. On behalf of all those who knew him, it is my honor to offer these remarks as a tribute to the life and legacy of Reverend Sillers. His life and presence will be sorely missed and I extend my condolences to his dear family and friends. His legacy of service and his vision of education live on.                          ____________________
