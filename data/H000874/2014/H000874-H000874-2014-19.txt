Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  While I support this measure, I do so believing that America deserves better, wants better, hopes to get better. That is what each and every one of us was sent here to deliver: responsible policy for our country. This is not that policy. It is, however, as I said, better than the alternative in that it would at least give those in 2014 who have operated on the expectation of getting the credit the assurance that they will get it.  My hope, Mr. Speaker, is that, come next December, we won't be here again considering another tax extender bill to keep the economy from collapsing. It is my hope, Mr. Speaker, that the Republican majority and the Democratic minority can work together to effect responsible, fiscally sound tax reform which will help grow our economy and give the business community and our people the confidence they need to have to grow our economy and to participate effectively in making America better.  Mr. Speaker, again, in closing, I want to congratulate Mr. Camp, because I think he did bring forth a bill that could have engendered that responsible debate that we needed, a fiscally sound proposal making tough tradeoffs that we ought to have the courage to make. He had that courage, and I congratulate him for it.
