Speaker, it is with great pleasure and admiration that I congratulate Sister Kathleen Quinn upon her retirement as chairperson of the Ancilla Systems Board of Directors. I can truly say Sister Kathleen is one of the most dedicated, distinguished, and committed citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District. Northwest Indiana and Ancilla Systems, Inc., has certainly been rewarded by the true service and uncompromising loyalty she has displayed to her community.  Sister Kathleen entered the religious community and made her First Profession in June of 1949. She graduated from St. Joseph's School of Nursing in 1952, and received a BSN in Nursing from Loyola University and a MSN in Nursing Service Administration from the Catholic University of America, located in Washington, DC. She began her nursing career in the Obstetrics Department at St. Anne's Hospital in Chicago and later served as the hospital's Director of Nursing Services from 1960 to 1965. For the next 2 years, Sister Kathleen served as the Assistant Administrator of Nursing at St. Mary's Hospital in East St. Louis. She then became the Assistant Provincial of the PHJC Community from July of 1967 to July of 1973. For the next twelve years, Sister Kathleen held hospital administrator positions at St. Joseph's Hospital in Fort Wayne, Indiana and St. Mary's Hospital in East St. Louis, IL. From 1985 to 1991 Sister Kathleen served as Provincial of the PHJC congregation. Most recently, Sister Kathleen served as chairperson of Ancilla, Inc., from July 1991 to April 2002. While serving as chairperson, she has served on a number of boards and committees, including: American Hospital Association, Catholic Health Association, Illinois Catholic Health Association, Gary Community Health Foundation, Edgewater Systems for Balanced Living, Legacy Foundation, Inc., St. Joseph Community Health Foundation, Health Visions Midwest, St. Joseph Hospital Advisory Board, St. Joseph Hospital Ethics Committee and Mission Effectiveness Committee, Sagamore Health Network and Advantage Health Plan Mission Effectiveness Committee, Community Foundation of Northwest Indiana, Inc., St. Joseph Regional Medical Center Board, The Discovery Alliance Board, YWCA of Gary, and Linden House of Gary.  Among her many contributions to the care of all God's people, Sister Kathleen founded the Nazareth Home in East Chicago, IN, in 1993. Nazareth Home is a foster home for children born of mothers who are addicted to various substances or who have AIDS. She was also a leader in founding the Sojourner Truth House, which is a daytime ministry for needy women and children in Gary, IN. Sister Kathleen is currently active in parish life at Holy Angels Cathedral in Gary.  Mr. Speaker, America is made a better place because of the tireless and unselfish service of its citizens. Sister Kathleen Quinn is a woman who has dedicated her entire life to helping those around her, resolutely working to aid the needy, and serving as an upright pillar of morality and conscience. In so doing, she has strengthened her community and the whole of our country and society. I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in commending Sister Kathleen Quinn for her lifetime of remarkable accomplishments, enduring service, and the unforgettable effect she has had on the people of northwest Indiana. The staff at Ancilla Systems, Inc., will surely miss her enthusiasm, but we thank her for her years of service and wish her happiness in her well-deserved retirement.                          ____________________
