Unless Senator Kennedy's amendment is allowed to be voted upon, there is no prohibition against looking at the person's picture on the FBI's Most Wanted list, looking at the person and saying: Have a nice day. Take the gun.  Again, one could argue that if that person actually uses the weapon, it might be negligence, but if he or she is a straw purchaser or buying lots of weapons to pass out, they would escape liability.
