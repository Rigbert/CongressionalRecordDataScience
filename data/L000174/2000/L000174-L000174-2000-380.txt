President, I thank my dear friend from Illinois for the questions he has asked. He has worked so hard on this. He has spoken, as I said, brilliantly on this matter and I appreciate him coming here.  Earlier this week, I was honored to join in a Dear Colleague letter with the senior Senator from West Virginia. I have referred to Senator Byrd as the Senate's constitutional sage. Senator Byrd has played a leading role in protecting our Constitution over the last several years as it has weathered assault after assault. He counseled the Senate on the so-called balanced budget amendment, which would have beena travesty. He was right. He has preserved the protection of our separation of powers against the line-item veto. Again, he was right. He showed great courage and wisdom with his vote and statement on the flag amendment on March 29. As I said, I was fortunate enough to join with the distinguished Senator from West Virginia on a Dear Colleague letter. We sent it out on April 24.  I ask unanimous consent that this Dear Colleague letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, April 24, 2000.       Dear Colleague: On Tuesday, April 25, 2000, the Senate will      begin its consideration of S.J. Res. 3, the proposed victims'      rights amendment to the United States Constitution. We are      writing to urge you to consider this matter carefully and      protect the Constitution by voting against this unnecessary      amendment.       Article V of the Constitution establishes the process for      constitutional amendment. The process is cumbersome because      the Framers intended it to be. Under Article V, Congress      shall only propose an amendment to the States if two-thirds      of both Houses deem it ``necessary.'' James Madison, one of      the principal architects of the Constitution, cautioned that      constitutional amendment should be reserved for ``certain      great and extraordinary occasions,'' when no other      alternative is available.       Of the more than 11,000 constitutional amendments      introduced in Congress, only 27 have been adopted. The first      10 were ratified as our Bill of Rights in 1791, 209 years      ago. There have been just 17 additional amendments. Despite      all of the political, economic, and social changes this      country has experienced over the course of more than two      centuries; despite the advent of electricity and the advent      of the internal combustion engine; despite one civil war and      two world wars and several smaller wars; despite the      discovery of modes of communication and transportation beyond      the wildest fancies of the most visionary framers, this      document, the Constitution of the United States, has been      amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights.       No ``great and extraordinary'' occasion calls for passage      of this proposed amendment, S.J. Res. 3. Tremendous strides      have been made in the past 20 years toward ensuring better      and more comprehensive rights and services for victims of      crime. Today, there are over 30,000 laws nationwide that      define and protect victims' rights, as well as over 10,000      national, State, and local organizations that provide      assistance to people who have been hurt by crime. There is no      evidence that these laws and organizations are failing to      protect victims.       The Constitution creates no impediment to the enactment of      State and Federal laws to protect crime victims. Indeed, the      proponents of this constitutional amendment cannot cite a      single judicial decision that was not eventually reversed in      which a victims' rights statute or State constitutional      amendment was not given effect because of a right guaranteed      to the accused in the Federal Constitution. Moreover, given      the extraordinary political popularity of the victims'      movement, there is every reason to believe that the      legislative process will continue to be responsive to      enhancing victims' interests.       Tinkering with the careful system of Federalism established      by the Constitution can have far reaching and unexpected      consequences. When it comes to our founding charter, history      demands our utmost prudence.           Sincerely,                                                   Robert C. Byrd,                                                     U.S. Senator.                                                    Patrick Leahy,                                                     U.S. Senator.
