 President, I rise today to speak once again about the California energy crisis. Today is the first day of May and in many parts of California, it is the start of a 5-month summer and the start of a five-month period of the highest electricity demand. The day also marks the 12th consecutive month we have been in an energy crisis--I add to that the Pacific Northwest--meaning for an entire year we have experienced energy prices that are about 10 times higher than they were in the previous 12 month period. And it also marks the 12th consecutive month that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has failed to take decisive action.  It took the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission until November to declare what people in San Diego, California discovered last May, electricity rates are ``unjust and unreasonable'' and the market is broken.  Last week, FERC attempted to modify the broken market with so-called ``price mitigation.'' In its April 26th order, the FERC outlined its proposal ``to mitigate the dysfunctional market.'' Unfortunately, what FERC offered as a solution will not do nearly enough to solve the problems in California and the Northwest.  First, the order for the most part, ignored the Northwest--offering only a limited investigation of the broken market in Oregon and Washington without any promise of even the feeble price mitigation offered to California.  Second, the order will last only one year, not nearly enough to get enough supply on line to meet our energy needs.  Third, the order only applies to stage 1, 2, and 3 energy emergencies, practically ensuring that prices for the rest of the time can remain exorbitantly high.  Fourth, the FERC order decreed that the cost based rate of the price for the least efficient megawatt of power needed at any given hour would go to everyone who bid into the market. With natural gas prices still averaging three times higher in California than elsewhere, it is almost a guarantee that this would mean at many hours, the average price of electricity will be $400-$500 per megawatt.  Which brings up the most glaring problem with the FERC order: It does not address natural gas, which is the major cost in electricity production and a problem in itself for heating, cooking, food and manufacturing production, etc. I would like to take this opportunity to read from some letters I have received about the energy crisis.  Let me speak about a letter from the California Steel Industries, and I quote:       Our company is a relatively large consumer of both      electricity and natural gas. Our historical gas bill was      about $12 million annually. With the price gouging going on      in California, that bill will rise to $40 million or even $50      million this year. For electricity, we historically paid      about $15 million per year. That number will double this year      due to increased retail rates, which became necessary as a      result of skyrocketing wholesale prices.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                            California Steel Industries, Inc.,                                      Fontana, CA, April 16, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: This is to ask for your help in      immediately seeking emergency action by the Federal Energy      Regulatory Commission, to stop the relentless profiteering      and price gouging by energy providers to the state of      California.       The problem in the wholesale price of electricity is well      documented. Power prices have gone from about $30 per      megawatt hour in 1999 winter months to more than $1400 per      megawatt hour at times during the winter of 2000-01. This was      not due to a rise in demand or a supply shortage--the winter      months for both years saw demand at about half of the summer      peak period.       High prices have continued through the moderate spring      weather and could hit astronomical levels this summer.       Natural gas, a key component of electricity generation and      of industrial production in its own right, has followed suit.      While the price of natural gas is up across the nation--about      double the historical average in Chicago, New York and Texas,      for example--in California, it is about six times the      historical average. In recent weeks, natural gas has been a      little over $5 per MMBTU in most areas of the country, and      nearly $15 in South California.       Our company is a relatively large consumer of both      electricity and natural gas. Our historical gas bill was      about $12 million annually. With the price gouging going on      in California, that bill will rise to $40 million or even $50      million this year. For electricity, we historically paid      about $15 million per year. That number will double this year      due to increased retail rates, which became necessary as a      result of skyrocketing wholesale prices.       For California Steel Industries and its 1,000 direct      employees, those numbers are not only mind-boggling, they      spell disaster. No business can absorb that kind of a hit for      long and continue to survive. We are the largest producer of      flat-rolled steel in Southern California, and we serve nearly      400 customers, most of whom are in California. We cannot pass      along these increased costs to our customers because they can      easily purchase competing steel from the Midwest, the East,      and from offshore, produced with far less expensive energy.       Unfortunately, our story is just one of many in California      these days.       The President of the California Public Utilities      Commission, Ms. Loretta Lynch, has requested the help of the      FERC in this crisis. Thus far, she has been rebuked by the      regulators, on the basis that this is simply a supply and      demand issue that will straighten our as soon as more power      plants are built and more gas pipelines constructed.      Unfortunately, we fear the problem will go away even sooner--     by a huge drop-off in demand as businesses shut down and lay      people off. This is not the solution the FERC wants, we are      sure. However, we cannot wait for the FERC's theoretical      approach to solve everything 50 months from now. We cannot      even wait 50 days.       It is our belief that there is no fair market for gas or      electricity in California, and there will not be fair pricing      without federal intervention at the wholesale price level. We      are committed to doing our part for conservation. We would      also welcome the chance to talk with you personally about      this subject.       In the meantime, on behalf of all Californians who value a      good job with a secure future, and who helped create the      world's 6th largest economy through hard work and      perseverance, we urge you to get directly involved in this      matter and demand that the FERC do its job. We must ensure      that electricity and natural gas--two unique commodities,      which in most cases have no short-term substitute--are priced      fairly. Otherwise, you can turn out the lights in California,      because the party will be over.           Very truly yours,                                            C. Lourenco Goncalves,                                                President and CEO.
