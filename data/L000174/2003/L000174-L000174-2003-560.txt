President, today I am joined by Senator DeWine, by our minority leader, Senator Daschle, andby Senator Smith in introducing legislation that will boost the readiness of our Nation's military Reserve.  Never has our Nation relied more heavily on the Selected Reserve--more than 875,000 men and women, who stand ready for deployments at home or abroad, at a moment's notice. More than 54 percent of the U.S. Army's and 34 percent of the U.S. Air Force's end strength resides in the Selected Reserve. Both the Army and the Marine Corps rely on these Reserve forces for almost 20 percent of their manpower strength. The skill, experience and professionalism of these dedicated citizens often meet and exceed those of their brave counterparts in the active force.  It is no wonder that more than 200,000 reservists have been called to duty for service that is related to the war in Iraq. Many States have thousands of their citizens who have temporarily dropped their civilian jobs and left their families for deployments halfway across the globe. More than 300 citizen-soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in my home State of Vermont are serving proudly at the moment, here and abroad. When you include the call-ups since the September 11 attacks, the number of activated reservists across the country far exceeds those in the first gulf war.  These deployments have spotlighted some specific and solvable problems that have affected the readiness of the reserves and, in turn, our entire military. Some of the troops who have been called up have not been as healthy as possible. Others have faced the stress of leaving their families behind while looking back in concern as their families try to navigate the sometimes arcane military health care system. While often experiencing a loss of income, reserve family members also have had to leave their civilian doctors and join the military's TRICARE program.  More troubling, many of the members of the Guard and Reserve who might be activated any day do not currently have access to affordable health insurance. A recent General Accounting Office report underscores the fact that most of these uninsured Guard and Reservists reside in the lower enlisted ranks, where the reserve soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines oftentimes are unemployed or switch jobs frequently. It is unfair to them and their families, and it is unwise for the preparedness of our military, to expect someone to deploy anywhere at the drop of a hat, but then to disregard whether they will be as healthy as possible when we need to call them to active duty.  These men and women are ready to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country, and so are their families. But they are performing as full-time soldiers with part-time benefits.  This situation is preventing the National Guard and the Reserve from being as ready as possible for action. At the same time, the stress and strain that activations place on families has hurt recruiting and retention. To ensure the strongest and most effective reserve and the strongest and most effective military capability, it is critical that we address these issues and provide comprehensive health insurance coverage.  The National Guard and Reserve Comprehensive Health Benefits Act of 2003 will provide seamless health coverage to our reserve forces at all phases of their service. Under our plan, if one of 876,000 members of the Selected is in a drill status, that reservist and his or her family will become eligible to join the TRICARE military health insurance program. The reservist will pay an annual premium, around 30 percent of the annual cost of providing care. For a single reservist, the premium would be about $420 per year, while for a family the annual payment would be about $1,450. This is not rock-bottom-cheap health care, but our aim is to ensure affordable health insurance for hard-working families that may not otherwise have access to coverage.  If a reservist is activated, he or she will continue to have free health care through the military health system. But under our legislation, the reservist's family will be able to avoid the considerable difficulties of switching doctors and health insurance. They also can apply to have their civilian health insurance reimbursed. The program will not cost any more to the Federal Government than the current arrangement because the per capita costs are capped to ensure that they are no more than the cost of TRICARE. And when a reservist comes off active duty, he or she will be able to enter the new premium-based TRICARE program, just as before deployment.  Because reservists will be able to have access to affordable insurance whatever their deployment status, this legislation is being supported by several leading organizations, including the National Guard Association of the United States, NGAUS, the Enlisted National Guard Association of the United States, EANGUS, the Reserve Officers Association, ROA, the Naval Reserve Association, NRA, the National Military Family Association, NMFA, Marine Corps Reserve Officers Association, the National Association for Uniformed Services, the National Military/Veterans Association, and the Military Officers Association, MOA. This legislation is the top priority of The Military Coalition's Guard/Reserve Committee.  We have worked hard to fully understand the existing problems and to construct this efficient and effective solution. I would particularly like to thank former Undersecretary of Defense Fred Pang and former House Armed Services Committee Professional Staff Member Karen Heath for their sage counsel and guidance in developing this legislation. We are part of a strong, bipartisan coalition that will push for enactment of this long-overdue legislation. In the coming weeks we plan to welcome additional cosponsors for this comprehensive bill as we begin the process of moving it without delay through the legislative process and to the President's desk.                                 ______                                       By
