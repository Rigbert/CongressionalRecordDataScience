Speaker, I rise today to recognize and congratulate the Prince George's County School System as one of our Nation's most innovative and successful school violence prevention programs. In the wake of the tragedies at Columbine and Conyers High School, it is important to highlight those schools which serve as a model for other school districts to follow.  As the 18th largest school district in the nation, the faculty and staff of the Prince George's County Public School system educates one of the most diverse student populations of any district in the Nation. This week, as we continue our dialogue and focus on solutions to making our schools a safer place to learn, perhaps we can look to many of the programs already in place in Prince George's County and across the State of Maryland.  Under the direction of retiring Superintendent Dr. Jerome Clark and Dr. Patricia Green, Chief, Divisional Administrator for Pupil Services, Prince George's County has implemented a regimen of programs including peer mediation, early intervention, and placement of probation specialists within schools.  The Peer Mediation program has been one of the most successful. By placing a peer mediation teacher on staff at each of the 20 high schools and 26 middle schools, students are learning now to intervene and peacefully resolve conflicts. The program has recently been instituted on the elementary school level where teachers and guidance counselors at more than 100 of the district's elementary schools are trained on the importance of creating a healthy learning environment.  Another program, called the ``Justice in Cluster Program'' has been so successful that the State of Maryland used the program as the model to create the statewide ``Spotlight on Schools.'' By teaming up with the Maryland Department of Juvenile Justice, each cluster of schools is able to provide two probation specialists who work with the local high school, middle school, and elementary schools to assist guidance counselors, peer mediation teachers, school psychologists, and administrators in working with troubled students and ensuring that they remain out of the juvenile justice system.  Early intervention programs are also proving to be successful. ``Second Step,'' a program featured in a 1997 study by the University of Washington, teaches children to change attitudes which may lead to violent behavior. Through learning empathy, impulse control and anger management, students in kindergarten through grade six are learning how to react nonviolently to various situations. The program is currently in place in 67 elementary schools and the Prince George's County School System has been asked by the Maryland State Department of Education to become the regional training center so that other school districts can replicate this successful program.  These are just three of the many positive programs being implemented just beyond theborders of our Nation's Capitol. With a number of successful federal programs in place like D.A.R.E., G.R.E.A.T., and the COPS program, we are in a position to provide a comprehensive plan for reducing school violence. I salute the Prince George's County Public School System for its dedication to safety and encourage my colleagues to look to this school system as one which may have solutions to the many problems facing our education system.                          ____________________
