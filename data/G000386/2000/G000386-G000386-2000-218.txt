 President, I rise in support of the cloture motion. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this motion. I spoke yesterday, at length, about why this bill is such an important piece of legislation.  I guess the best proof of it is that it enjoys such bipartisan support, which does not happen too often on Capitol Hill. But I summed up, in yesterday's remarks, that this conference agreement is about opportunity--opportunity for 48 struggling nations of sub-Saharan Africa; and opportunity for the people of the Caribbean, many of whom are struggling to rebuild their lives following the devastation of their countries by natural disaster.  Most importantly, we in the Congress must be concerned about American jobs--our working men and women. This bill does much for the American economy and for America's consumers, as well. The enhanced Caribbean Basin Initiative textile provisions in this conference agreement may create up to $8 billion in new sales and 120,000 new jobs over the next 5 years. Those are not my estimates. Those are not Senator Moynihan's estimates. Those are the textile industry's own estimates.  In addition to the textile industry, this bill enjoys the support of many other industries as well. This is because American exports follow American investment when that investment moves abroad, especially exports of capital equipment.  This conference agreement enjoys broad support among distinguished Members of both the majority and minority, who have worked together long and hard to fashion this agreement.  It also enjoys the support of a vast majority of political, civic, and religious leaders around the United States, and the support of each of the nations that would benefit from its passage.  I urge my colleagues to take a look at an advertisement in the Hill newspaper that was put out yesterday. It has a long list of prominent business leaders and organizations. It has a long list of American civic leaders who support this, including even organizations such as Empower America, which is headed by Republican Jack Kemp, and is supported by conservative leaders such as Bill Bennett.  Since it enjoys this broad, bipartisan support--both within and outside the political environment--I hope that it gets the support of our colleagues as well.  A vote for cloture is also a reaffirmation of America's historic leadership role in international trade. We have much to do in the international trade arena in the next year or two:  Restore confidence in American trade policy, and leadership in trade; rebuild confidence in the World Trade Organization; win the fight for permanent normal trade relations status for China; and show our trading partners in Geneva, where negotiations are underway right now, that we in the Senate are engaged with the world, and the world can look to us for that leadership.  I ask my colleagues to vote in support of the opportunity to continue America's leadership in the effort to reduce trade barriers. I ask my colleagues to vote in favor of this motion.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that advertisement I mentioned in the Hill newspaper printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From the Hill, May 10, 2000]                      To The United States Senate      conference report on the african growth and opportunity act     We Endorse Legislation That Provides Social and Economic          Opportunity in Africa And We, the Undersigned, are          Working Together to Achieve this Goal                         All 48 African Nations     Angola     Benin     Botswana     Burkina Faso     Burundi     Cameroon     Cape Verde     Central Africa Republic     Chad     Comoros     Congo (Brazzaville)     Congo, Democratic Republic     Cote d'Ivoire     Djibouti     Equitorial Guinea     Eritrea     Ethiopia     Gabon     The Gambia     Ghana     Guinea     Guinea-Bissau     Kenya     Lesotho     Liberia     Madagascar     Malawi     Mali     Mauritania     Mauritius     Mozambique     Namibia     Niger     Nigeria     Reunion     Rwanda     Sao Tome and Principe     Senegal     Seychelles     Sierra Leone     South Africa     Swaziland     Tanzania     Togo     Uganda     Zambia     Zimbabwe                            Business Leaders     The Limited, Inc.
