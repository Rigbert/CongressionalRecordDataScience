 Mr. Speaker, last week we passed a resolution which would update the book which includes African Americans; or actually, 2 weeks ago. This week we will appropriately recognize the women who have served.  As the father of three daughters, all adults, and a grandfather of two young women as well as two young men, those who have said that the women who serve are role models I think are absolutely correct, not only for young women who may want to go into public service, but for young women who aspire to reach the heights that their talents will allow them to. It is important that we nurture in these extraordinary American women the ability to succeed; the ability to make a very significant contribution; the ability to be equal, as Jefferson surely would have said today.  So I am pleased to rise in support of this resolution. It is appropriate, it is timely, and it is important for all Americans.
