Mr. Chairman, my amendment prevents funds from this act from being used to finalize, implement, or enforce the new Arctic regulations the Department of the Interior rushed to last week.  In addition to the billions of dollars already spent--$7 billion--to develop these sales, these regulations would cost an additional $2 billion for the oil and gas industry.  This regulation is nothing more than a tactic to lock safe Arctic energy development up in red tape because exploration would become full of unnecessary operational burdens.  The National Petroleum Council Arctic report found that Arctic resourcescan be safely developed today using existing, field-proven technology. Locking up Arctic resources only hurts our Nation by preventing responsible energy development.  I ask my colleagues to support the State of Alaska, stand up for the Alaskan Natives of the North Slope who support this production in energy exploration, and vote ``yes'' on my amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  2000  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Byrne). The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 minutes.  Ms. McCOLLUM. This amendment would block the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management from finalizing regulations that deal with exploratory drilling on the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf that has conducted mobile oil offshore drilling units. Oil and gas exploration on the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf is expensive and requires industry to make significant investments. Blocking this rule creates uncertainty for industry and other stakeholders. Delaying or inhibiting implementation of this rule will likely defer, rather than encourage, future Arctic exploration and development.  The amendment would also undermine efforts to protect Alaska Natives' health, livelihood, and cultural traditions. As we know, there are Alaska Natives that do have grave concerns about what is going on with oil drilling and exploration in Alaska.  The impact of a catastrophic oil spill would have extremely high cultural and societal costs to these Native Alaskans. The amendment would derail efforts to set specialized safety requirements and environmental precautions to account for the extreme environmental conditions, geography, and remoteness, like to fix infrastructure in existing operations in the Arctic Outer Continental Shelf.  The amendment stands in the way of efforts to reduce the risk of oil spill in an extreme sensitive environment where responding to any spill may be beyond current oil spill response capabilities. We need to protect our precious Arctic resources and ensure that they are managed responsibly.  Therefore, I must oppose this amendment.  I reserve the balance of my time.
