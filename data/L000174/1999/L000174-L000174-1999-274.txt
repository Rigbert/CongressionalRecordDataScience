President, I am about to propound a unanimous consent request on the juvenile justice conference. I notified the distinguished majority leader that I would be doing this earlier, and a day ago I also notified the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee. I do it not in expectation the unanimous consent request will be agreed to but to, I hope, move this ball down the field.  So my request is this: I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the consideration of H.R. 1501, the House juvenile justice bill; that all after the enacting clause be stricken, and that the text of S. 254, as passed by the Senate, minus the provision added by Senator Feinstein's amendment No. 343, as modified, be inserted in lieu thereof; the bill be passed, as amended; the Senate insist on its amendment and request a conference with the House; that the conferees be instructed to include in the conference report the provision added by Senator Feinstein's amendment No. 343 to S. 254; and that the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees.
