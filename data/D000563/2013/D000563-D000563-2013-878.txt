President, let me first, on a personal note, thank the Senator from Kentucky. He and I have agreed on many things and worked together on many more, and there is much common agreement on what we hope to achieve with this issue, as important as it is, and I thank him for his spirited defense of his position today in these 12 hours. I want to excuse him from the floor whenever he wishes.                          ____________________
