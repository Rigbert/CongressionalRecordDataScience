Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  This is Dubai Ports all over again. Vociferous people are aware of this change in policy, and they will not say what their position is on it. This will undermine national security.  Any country with an open skies agreement will be able to buy and control a U.S. airline for all practical intents and purposes, including Indonesia. Imagine when we deploy our military on the civilian reserve air fleet flown by Indonesian pilots. Oh, there is a little terrorism problem in Indonesia, isn't there? That will be really good. I think they will feel really secure on those planes.  It is also in pursuit of lame free trade agreements, so-called ``open skies,'' yet another loser for America. The outsourcing of pilot jobs, flight attendant jobs, mechanics jobs, and other executive jobs. And I am not so concerned about the execs.  But we are essentially ceding control of the United States of America in violation of statutory provisions if we do not stop the Bush administration.  This must be adopted. Mr. Mica could not be more wrong. This will undermine security and air service in this country.
