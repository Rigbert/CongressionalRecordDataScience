Speaker, I scheduled this time to come to the floor tonight and talk about the issue of trade, trade policy in the United States, and our record trade deficits, the impact on the economy, and in the future.  Before I engage in that, I could not resist. I had to sit through a good part of the previous hour, and I would like to comment upon a number of the points made by the gentlemen before me on the issue of prescription drug coverage.  First off, they said it has a fiscally huge cost, the Democratic alternative. It would cost $800 billion. Guess what: That is the cost of the estate tax which they tried to permanently repeal last week over 10 years, $800 billion. So we could have a trade-off. We could have a very meaningful, substantial prescription drug benefit for every American eligible for Medicare, or we could give back $800 billion to the wealthiest of the wealthy in this country.  Even if we adopted the alternative, which I supported, which would have given a $6 million exemption, I think $6 million is quite enough tax free, we could have saved half that money, $400 billion. So if we matched it to the $350 billion, we could again have had a more generous plan.  Mr. Speaker, also, there is a glaring deficiency. In fact, I am a bit critical of the Democrat proposal, also, because neither bill takes on the immensely powerful and wealthy pharmaceutical industry head on. Americans are paying 40 to 80 percent more than citizens of other highly industrialized, developed nations. Our neighbors in Canada pay about half what we do for drugs manufactured in the U.S. by U.S. firms; Mexico even less. The European countries all pay less.                              {time}  1815  The Republican bill would do nothing to control these outrageous costs, which means we are not going to get much of a benefit. If we do not crank down the obvious costs of pharmaceuticals, we are not going to get much of a benefit. We could spend the entire Federal budget within a few years, and we would not get much of a benefit. We have got to do something about the runaway pharmaceutical costs, but I do not think there is a lot of will on that side. Tomorrow night's $25 million Washington, D.C. fundraiser for the Republicans in the House and the Senate, the lead fundraiser is the head of GlaxoSmithKline, a large pharmaceutical company, one of the largest in the world, J.P. Garnier would not want to upset him too much when he is out raising money.  Now they say, well, the rising costs are because of advances in new drugs. Actually, if one lifts up the covers and looks underneath where they are spending their money, the pharmaceutical companies are spending more money on their CEO salaries, administration, and advertising than they are on research. In fact, all their blockbuster drugs for profits are makeovers of drugs they invented 20 years ago. Clarinex, that is Claritin with a tiny molecular change so they can continue it under patent, so they can continue to charge 10 times as much per dose as the one that finally, after fighting in court, after trying to buy up other pharmaceutical companies that are going to provide a generic, after trying to get legislation through Congress, knock through a number of bills to continue their monopoly on Claritin,they finally developed another dodge which is get the doctors to prescribe this new drug which is not any different but has a different name and they can charge ten times as much for it. So if we do not deal with the costs, we cannot have a meaningful prescription drug benefit. But I see no will on that side of the aisle to deal with that issue.  Back to trade, let us talk a bit about trade. Later this week perhaps or next week, the House will take up at least perhaps an extraordinary proposal by the gentleman from California (Mr. Thomas) of the Committee on Ways and Means to adopt an arcane procedure called a self-executing rule on a motion to go to conference. Why is that? Because they are trying to help push through this fast track bill for President Bush. I opposed fast track authority for President Bush the First. I opposed fast track authority for President Clinton, and I oppose fast track authority for President Bush today. This is a bad idea. The United States Congress gives up all of its authority to amend, modify, or meaningfully review these trade agreements and instead says they will be adopted with an up or down vote only, no amendments allowed. Why would we do that? We would do that because these are really bad deals for the American people. That is why we would do that.  The WTO, which I opposed, the GATT, that was a really bad deal for the American people, done through a fast track process. The NAFTA, total disaster. We are running over a $40 billion trade deficit with Mexico. That was done on one of these fast track deals. But what they said was, oh, Congressman, you cannot mean you want to vote to amend that. Well, in fact, first of all, you cannot vote to amend it, and, why, if you voted to amend it, the other countries who are agreeing to this might get upset.  Come on. They want access to our markets. Reasonable amendments to deal with labor and the environment, consumers, those things would not be a problem in these trade agreements, but they want to keep those things out because the real people who dictate the trade agreements are multinational corporations who have had a direct pipeline to the last four Presidents of the United States, Reagan, Bush I, Clinton, and Bush II. They are virtually identical in their position on trade.  Is our trade policy working so well that we should rubber-stamp it yet one more time? That is what this House of Representatives will be asked to do, rubber-stamp one more round of fast track for the free trade of the Americas. Let us bring in all of the nations into the western hemisphere, into this wonderful construct that we have under NAFTA. Would that not be peachy? Maybe we can get cheaper labor in Bolivia than we can in Mexico because some people are demanding as much as a dollar an hour down there in Mexico now, Bolivia and Argentina. They might be more desperate. Maybe they could take more American jobs at a lower price than the Mexicans.  I am about to be interrupted again, but I will certainly be happy to yield or suspend for the purposes of a unanimous consent request on the part of the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Tauzin).
