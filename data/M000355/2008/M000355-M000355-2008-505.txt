 President, based on the majority leader's representations that we are going to move forward and make our best effort to finish FISA, I agreed to the 15-day extension last night. He is a man of his word, and I know we will do everything we can to wrap up that important legislation.  It is a rare opportunity for a bipartisan accomplishment. It came out of the Intelligence Committee 13 to 2. It is the Rockefeller-Bond proposal. It is very important to our country, and I know the majority leader shares my view that we need to act in order to protect the homeland. I commend him for his decision to try to move it forward as rapidly as possible.                          ____________________
