 President, I wish to share with my colleagues the very sad news that Mary D. Ferguson, a legendary Kentucky journalist and a good friend of mine, has passed away. She departed this life last Thursday, June 9, in the town of Hopkinsville, KY, at the age of 82. She will be remembered and greatly missed by her family, many friends, and journalists throughout the Commonwealth.  Mary was a pioneer as a female journalist in an era when women were not expected to enter that profession, but she did not let that deter her from doing what she had dreamed of since childhood. She got her first job in journalism when she was a freshman in college, working as the society editor at the Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle.  She also served as the news director for a Hopkinsville radio station, WHOP, before being hired as a reporter by the Kentucky New Era in 1962. There she remained for more than 50 years--as a reporter, columnist, and eventually as an unofficial historian for the region and fount of institutional knowledge for the newspaper. By the time she passed away, of course, she had been working there since before most of her coworkers were born.  Mary touched the lives of thousands in Kentucky and beyond with her work for the New Era. Her stories gave voice to the people of her community, and she brought events of the world home for her readers. In covering events at Fort Campbell, KY, she wrote about Presidents spanning from Lyndon Johnson to George W. Bush. She covered gubernatorial inaugurations, crime, the courts, elections, and the arts.  I got to know Mary back when I was first elected to statewide office. She interviewed me and was a part of editorial board meetings, which I frequently held with the New Era. Mary was a rarity in the fact that she was one of the few journalists who leaned Republican, although she always kept her reporting balanced. I certainly appreciated her support and encouragement throughout the years and grew to have great admiration and respect for this woman who was not afraid to chart her own path.  Mary was the heart of the New Era newspaper and will be deeply missed by her colleagues and the hundreds of journalists who passed through that publication's offices over the five decades of her tenure. The paper established in 2005 the Mary D. Ferguson Award, given annually to the employee most committed to the quality of the newspaper. That tradition will continue after her death.  Kentucky has lost one of its leading lights in journalism, and I have lost a friend. Elaine and I want to express our deepest condolences to Mary's family. She is survived by her husband, retired Kentucky State Police Trooper Russell Ferguson, her daughter Lee Ellen Ferguson Fish, and two grandchildren. Along with the Hopkinsville community, we stand by the Ferguson family and support them in their time of grief.  The newspaper Mary Ferguson wrote for for 54 years, the New Era, published a remarkable article detailing her life and career. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Kentucky New Era, June 10, 2016]         Trailblazing Journalist, Mary D. Ferguson, Dies at 82                         (By Jennifer P. Brown)       Hopkinsville, KY.--Mary D. Ferguson, a Kentucky New Era      staff writer and columnist who covered stories about farmers,      housewives, Army generals, American presidents and much more      in a career lasting more than 50 years, died Thursday morning      at a Hopkinsville nursing home. She was 82.       A native of Trenton and longtime resident of Pembroke Road,      she lived just a few miles from the newspaper. She is      survived by her husband, retired Kentucky State Police      Trooper Russell Ferguson, and their daughter, Lee Ellen      Ferguson Fish.       Ferguson was a trailblazer for women in news reporting.       A 1952 graduate of Trenton High School in Todd County, she      moved to Clarksville when she started college at Austin Peay      State University. In the spring of her freshman year, she      applied for the society editor's job at the Clarksville Leaf-     Chronicle newspaper     and was hired on the spot. Years later, she said she was      shocked to get the job, but she stayed with the newspaper      until a year after she graduated.       She then became the news director for WHOP. Walking from      store to store in downtown Hopkinsville, she delivered the      radio station's daily Shell-O-Gram, a promotional flyer for      Shell Oil that featured news headlines of the day. The radio      station, which was on South Virginia Street, had a mobile      unit set up in a station wagon, and Ferguson also broadcast      live stories from the field.       The New Era hired her on February 5, 1962, to cover crime,      courts and Fort Campbell. She was the first female reporter      in the newsroom.       Although the paper's owners had recruited her, it took a      while for the men in the newsroom to accept Ferguson.      Reminiscing last fall about her start at the New Era, she      remembered how her news judgment and writing style were      frequently criticized early on. Things began to shift in her      favor one day when a local judge publicly praised one of her      stories.       Ferguson was on a first-name basis with several commanding      generals, and their family members, at Fort Campbell. She      also covered Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson, Jimmy Carter,      Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W.      Bush at Fort Campbell or nearby communities. She filed      stories from the inaugurations of two Kentucky governors,      Edward T. ``Ned'' Breathitt and Louie B. Nunn.       She loved the arts and was granted a back-stage interview      with the opera singer Marian Anderson at Fish University in      Nashville. Ferguson was so overcome with appreciation that      she broke down and cried as she approached the celebrity.       As a general assignment reporter, Ferguson wrote a wide      range of stories, including murder investigations, businesses      opening and closing, fatal crashes, hospital expansions,      lawsuits, tobacco auctions, elections, floods, fires, high      school graduations, concerts and the deaths of many friends.       Ferguson was among the New Era reporting team that covered      the aftermath of the Gander, Newfoundland, crash in December      1985 that killed 248 soldiers headed back to Fort Campbell      after a six-month deployment to the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt.      She was at Fort Campbell the day President Ronald Reagan and      first lady Nancy Reagan came to the post to console the      families.       She rejected the idea of ever retiring, although she did      eventually scale back her hours and devoted her time mainly      to writing daily obituaries and a popular human-interest      column that ran on Saturdays. Even when cancer treatments      made it difficult for her to type, she continued to dictate a      weekly column to another staff member.       She was rare among journalists with a career spanning more      than 60 years at two newspapers and the radio station.       No one working in the New Era's newsroom today had been      born when Ferguson started working for the paper at its old      offices in downtown Hopkinsville. She experienced numerous      changes in the newspaper industry. She gave up her typewriter      for computers but never really accepted the internet as a      useful tool.       New Era Publisher Taylor Hayes said he thought of Ferguson      as the newspaper's ``matriarch.'' Employees counted on her      frank opinion and advice.       ``This classy lady provided such a footing to our company,      particularly in the newsroom, and her absence cannot be      easily grasped,'' Hayes said. ``She was a rock.''       Ferguson drove a red Cadillac, voted Republican, loved big      friendly dogs, fed bread to fat squirrels in her yard,      laughed often, cooked like a pro and remembered names and old      tales that others forgot. She missed restaurants like      Charlie's Steakhouse and Bartholomew's when they closed. She      was partial to the Whistle Stop's chocolate glazed doughnuts.      Sushi and egg rolls were not her thing.       She wore tailored dresses, cardigan sweaters, high heels      and pearls to work. When the newsroom eventually went smoke-     free, she took her cigarette breaks wearing a mink coat on      the newspaper's loading dock, where she was likely to collect      a few story ideas from the pressmen or a truck driver.       While the newsroom became younger and increasingly reliant      on the internet, she packed her desk drawers with old city      directories, history books and paper files. She could put her      hands on a photograph of an old general before a young editor      could even begin the search on Google.       No one covering news in Hopkinsville today--not at the      newspaper and not at any of the radio stations--could match      her institutional knowledge of people and events that shaped      southern Pennyrile communities over the past 80 years.       ``There are a rare class of people who, when they come into      your life, however it may be, you just feel lucky to have      known them,'' Editor Eli Pace said. ``Mary D. was tough as      nails, classy beyond description and just wonderful--and I      was lucky.''       She was opinionated too. Once, when a new editor announced      that the New Era would begin re-running obituaries every time      the newspaper or a funeral home made a mistake because      readers liked to clip them out for family records, Ferguson      snapped, ``What are we, a newspaper or a scrapbook company?''       Ferguson, who sometimes prayed for friends and co-workers      from her front porch swing in the evening, believed that her      best writing at the New Era came in a Christmas Eve column      she wrote about her father's dairy barn.       The column included this: ``My memories were born in a      stable located on a hill just north of Trenton near the Todd-     Christian county line. The wide front door opened to the      southwestern sky, and at night there was a star spectacle      that outshone the blinking of multi-colored Christmas lights      wrapped around a tree and bushes . . . The warmth, the      smells, the sound of a soft wind and stars in the sky--no      greater peace could be enjoyed.''       Ferguson's last column was about the arrival of the first      hummingbird to her house at 2:30 p.m. April 16. Ever the      reporter, she had recorded the exact time and day.                          ____________________
