I thank the distinguished chairman of the full committee for yielding me this time and for his courage in offering this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, the sole purpose of the seemingly benign title of this language that we are seeking to strike, the Global Democracy Promotion Act of 2001, is to provide Federal funds to organizations that perform and/or promote abortions overseas as part of this legislation, as part of our population account.  The Lee language has nothing whatsoever to do with building democracy and the rule of law. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the protection of human rights, all causes to which I have devoted and many others have devoted their entire lives to. The Lee language is not about protecting people. Indeed, the absolute contrary is true.  I am sure many others like myself find it highly offensive when a legislative proposal that seeks to abolish the most fundamental, the most elemental of all human rights on the face of the Earth, the right to life, is euphemistically cloaked as a democracy builder, which it is not. The Lee language is designed to repeal the pro-life, pro-child Mexico City policy which as Members know was recently reinstated by President Bush to ensure that we do not fund the killing of unborn babies, either directly or indirectly.  Mr. Chairman, it is high time we came to the recognition that abortion is violence against children. Abortion methods are cruel. Abortion procedures, referred to in the language as medical services, rip and dismember the innocent child or they chemically poison the baby with some toxic substance. Today, Mr. Chairman, the pro-life laws and policies of about 100 countries around the world are under continuous siege. Regrettably, the forces, the engine behind the pro-abortion push are nongovernmental organizations, pro-abortion groups that we fund and we are the primary provider of subsidies to those groups.  The Bush executive order, like the original Reagan-Bush executive order, permits funding only to those organizations that provide family planning. Abortion is not family planning, and by funding only family planning, innocent children are not put at risk. As one of my previous colleagues pointed out so well, an overwhelming number of organizations, including some Planned Parenthood affiliates, accepted the Mexico City policy. For several years, there was a wall of separation between abortion and family planning. And the Bush policy ensures that as well. Who we subsidize, not just what, but who we give millions upon millions of dollars to has profound consequences.  The simple fact of the matter is, Mr. Chairman, that as far back as 1984, we recognized that the longstanding law that said no funds could be used directly to pay for abortion was very infirm, it was incomplete and it was not working.                              {time}  1115  Money is fungible. The millions of dollars we gave to a family planning group to perform abortions immediately freed up millions more that were used for the performance and promotion of abortion.  It should matter to us, not just what an organization does with our specific subsidy, but what else they do. It is a package deal. Many groups, regrettably, use family planning as a Trojan horse to conceal their real agenda, which is abortion on demand.  Mr. Chairman, I know that Members of Congress are getting blitzed by Planned Parenthood and other abortionists who oppose the Hyde-Barcia-Oberstar-Smith amendment. I appeal to you to resist. I ask you to stand with the victims, both mother and child, and against the victimizers. When we subsidize and lavish Federal funds on abortion organizations, we empower the child abusers; and Planned Parenthood, make no mistake about it, both here and overseas, is ``Child Abuse, Incorporated.''  Here in the United States, for example, and I would say parenthetically, this is not a domestic amendment, but the example gives you an insight as to what is happening overseas, Planned Parenthood has been given $2 billion and performed 2.6 million abortions since 1977. That is 2.6 million girls and boys who will never know the joys and challenges of living or the thrill of learning or marrying or playing soccer or raising their own families some day. That is 2.6 million individual dreams and talents and creativity the world will never see.  The loss of children's lives directly attributable to Planned Parenthood is staggering; 2.6 million dead babies and counting. And if that is not enough, Planned Parenthood both lobbies and litigates against virtually every child protection initiative, including parental notification, women's right to know laws, abortion funding bans, partial-birth abortion, and, again, most recently, the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.  Sadly, they do exactly the same thing overseas; and these non-governmental organizations will be affected by this legislation we pass today. Members should be aware that the International Planned Parenthood Federation, which is based in London, is leaving no stone unturned in its misguided, obsessive campaign to legalize abortion on demand. If they succeed, millions of babies will die from the violence of abortion. I urge Members, please, let us not add to the body count.  Mr. Chairman, Planned Parenthood's Vision 2000 strategic plan makes it very clear that they want family planning organizations to bring pressures on governments to campaign for abortion on demand. They do not cloak it; they do not disguise it. They wanted to undermine Central and South American countries that protect their babies, as well as Ireland and many other countries.  Mr. Chairman, I urge a strong vote in favor of the Hyde amendment, in favor of family planning and against abortion promotion.  Mr. Chairman, Title I Subtitle C of the pending Foreign relations Act, inserted by amendment over the Prime Sponsor's objection during committee markup, is breathtakingly misleading.  Subtitle C hides its sole purpose--providing federal funds to organizations that perform and/or promote abortion overseas, under the seemingly benign title of ``Global Democracy Promotion Act of 2001.''  Don't be fooled, I say to my colleagues.  Subtitle C has nothing whatsoever to do with building democracy and the rule of law. It has nothing whatsoever to do with protection of human rights--all causes to which I have devoted my entire life.  The Lee language is not about protecting people. The absolute contrary is true.  As Chairman of the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, former Chairman of the International Operations and Human Rights Subcommittee, and today as Vice Chairman of the International Relations Committee--I not only have traveled on numerous human rights trips and chaired over 160 hearings on human rights and democracy building in the People's Republic of China, Russia, Vietnam, France, Sudan, Rwanda, Indonesia, Cuba, Peru, Turkey, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, and the Ukraine (to name a few)--I am also the prime sponsor of:  Public Law 106-386--the ``Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000,''  Public Law 105-320--the ``Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998,''  Public Law 106-87--the ``Torture Victims Relief Authorization Act of 1999,'  Public Law 104-319--the ``Human Rights, Refugee, and Other Foreign Relations Provisions Act of 1996,'' as well as  Public Law 106-113, Division B--the ``Admiral James W. Nance and Meg Donovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 2000 and 2001,'' which is filled, like the other bills I have listed, with human rights and democracy provisions.  In addition to authoring human rights legislation, I have offered scores of amendments to boost the Child Survival Fund, Refugee Protection, and Freedom Broadcasting, like Radio Free Asia.  I and, I'm sure, many others find it highly offensive when a legislative proposal that seeks to abolish the most fundamental human right on the face of the earth--the right to life--is euphemistically cloaked as a democracy builder.  It is not.  Amazingly, no specific mention is made of abortion in either the findings or operative clause of the amendment. Why the unwillingness to be candid and transparent?  Abortion is referred to as ``a particular issue'' or ``medical service.''  But I guess one would have to be blind to not understand the precise nature of this section. It is designed to repeal the pro-life, pro-child Mexico City Policy--recently reinstated by President Bush to ensure that we do not fund the killing of unborn babies, either directly or indirectly.  Mr. Chairman, abortion is violence against children.  Abortion methods are cruel. Abortion procedures--referred to this section as ``medical services''--rip and dismember the innocent child, or chemically poison the baby with some toxic substance.  This--and only this--is the ``particular issue'' referred to in the section we seek to strike.  Today, Mr. Chairman, the pro-life laws and policies of approximately one hundred countries that restrict abortion are under continuous siege and the forces behind the pro-abortion push are non governmental organizations funded by the US Government.  The Bush executive order--like the original Reagan-Bush executive order--permits the funding of only those organizations that provide family planning--and abortion isn't family planning. Innocent children, therefore, are not put at risk.  Who we subsidize--not just what--but who, we give millions of dollars to has profound consequences.  The simple fact of the matter is that as far back as 1984, the longstanding law stipulating that no U.S. funds can directly be used for abortion was found to be infirm and incomplete. Money is fungible. The millions of dollars we give to a group immeditely frees up other non-U.S. funds that can be used--and have been used--for performing and aggressively promoting abortion. It should matter greatly to each of us not just what an organization does with our specific subsidy, but the rest of its agenda as well. It is a package deal. Many groups use family planning as the Trojan horse to conceal their real agenda--abortion on demand.  I know Members of Congress have been getting blitzed by Planned Parenthood and other abortionists to oppose the Hyde-Barcia-Smith-Oberstar Amendment.  I appeal to you to resist.  I ask you to stand with the victims--both mother and child--and against the victimizers.  Whe we subsidize and lavish federal funds on abortion organizations, we empower the child abusers.  And Planned Parenthood, make no mistake about, it, both here and overseas is Child Abuse Incorporated!  Here in the United States for example, and of course it's not affected by this amendment, Planned Parenthood has been paid $1.997 billion in taxpayer dollars and has performed 2,608,362 abortions since 1977.  That's 2.6 million girls and boys who will never know the joys and challenges of living, or the thrill of learning, or marrying, or playing soccer, or raising their own family someday.  That's 2.6 million individual dreams, talents and creativity the world will never see.  The loss of children's lives directly attributed to Planned Parenthood is staggering--2.6 million dead babies and counting.  And if that wasn't enough, Planned Parenthood both lobbies and litigates against virtually every child protection initiative including parental notification, women's right to know laws, abortion funding bans, partial birth abortion bans and the Unborn Victim of Violence Act. Sadly--they do the same overseas, and those non governmental organizations would be affected by what we do today.  Members should be aware that the International Planned Parenthood Federation is leaving no stone unturned in its misguided, obsessive campaign to legalize abortion on demand around the world. If they succeed, millions of babies will die from the violence of abortion on demand. Please, let's not add to the body count.  Planned Parenthood's Vision 2000 strategic plan says that family planning organizations should ``bring pressure on governments and campaign for policy and legislative change to remove restrictions against abortion.'' Can anything be more clear? ``Pressure'' governments to nullify their pro-life policies. ``Campaign'' for abortion on demand. And Subtitle C of this bill would compel us to provide millions of dollars to these abortionists.  A headline in the Philippine Daily Inquirer a few years ago succinctly underscores our concern, ``Flavier Hits U.S. Pressure on Abortion.'' The article quotes Senator Juan Flavier:       We had just celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence      from America, but we can still see insidious methods of      imperialism trying to subvert our self-determination by using      [population control] funds as subtle leverage . . . I      strongly opposed abortion. It is prohibited by our laws and      the Philippine Constitution. Hence, we should be prepared to      lose foreign funding rather than     be pressured into causing the death of unborn children.  The abortion promotion by Planned Parenthood is so extreme in the Philippines, for example, that the President of IPPF's affiliate--the Family Planning Organization of the Philippines (FPOP)--resigned over what he called International Planned Parenthood Federation's ``hidden agenda'' and misuse of his family planning affiliate to legalize abortion.  The use of family planning to cloak its real agenda--the use of family planning as a cover for permissive abortion laws--is now commonplace, and must be stopped. The Bush executive order will help.  Let me remind Members that the pro-life safeguards included in the Bush executive order are nothing new; they were in effect for almost a decade. And they worked!  The pro-life safeguards--the Mexico City Policy--were in effect during the Reagan and Bush years as a principled way to fund family planning without promoting abortion.  We should have no part in empowering the abortion industry to succeed in performing or promoting violence against children.
