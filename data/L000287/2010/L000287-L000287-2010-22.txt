I want to thank my friend and colleague from Colorado and my friend and colleague from Wisconsin for bringing this resolution before us.  Madam Speaker, I want to thank the chairman and the ranking member of the Education and Labor Committee for their support of this bill, and the Majority Leader for his support and for bringing this resolution to the floor.  Madam Speaker, this year marks the 10th anniversary of an outstanding organization called Sojourn to the Past, the longest-running civil rights program in the United States. Sojourn to the Past was founded by Jeff Steinberg, an inspired American history high school teacher from northern California. He started by taking his students on a 10-day field trip to the South to see where the most important moments of the civil rights movement actually happened. He took them to places like Atlanta, Tuskegee, Montgomery, Birmingham, and Selma. He took them to Jackson, Little Rock, and Memphis.  While on these journeys, young people meet the leaders of the movement. They get out of the classroom and visit historic places that marked the time.  Through this program, I believe young people grow more informed about the movement. They learn how it changed our country and our society, and they are changed. They become better human beings and better citizens not just of the United States but of the world.  Since it began, Sojourn to the Past has taken over 5,000 high school students on these journeys, teaching them about the importance of social justice and the philosophy and the discipline of nonviolence. Like the civil rights movement itself, it challenges people to think about their own values and about what kind of country they want America to be.  Madam Speaker, I invite all of my colleagues to join with all of us in honor of this important organization.
