Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me.  Mr. Chairman, I want to say to all colleagues in the House, I do not think there is anybody in the House who has spent more time on making sure that the Internal Revenue Service is an effective agency efficiently collecting the revenues that are due to the government that can be used for the benefit of the American public and to do so in a manner that is consistent with the best interests of the taxpayer and his focus on giving it the proper resources to do the job we expect of it I think has been untiring and unwavering, and I congratulate him for his efforts.
