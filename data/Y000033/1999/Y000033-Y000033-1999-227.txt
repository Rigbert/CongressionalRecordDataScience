Mr. Speaker, I am introducing legislation today to assist in the resettlement and relocation of the people of Bikini Atoll by amending the terms of the trust fund established during the United States administration of the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. This will permit the people of Bikini to use a portion of their fund for resettlement activities for the remaining 90 seniors who were affected by United States nuclear testing in the Marshall Islands without any additional federal expenditure and consistent with the intent of Congress. These individuals are still waiting to resettle after over five decades since the U.S. program began in their islands which resulted in their removal from their home atoll.  At the Committee on Resources' May 11th hearing on the status of nuclear claims, relocation and resettlement efforts in the Marshall Islands, and as part of the May 10th Congressional pre-hearing briefing, the people of Bikini asked Congress to support a one-time 3 percent distribution from the Resettlement Trust Fund, which is used both for the cleanup of Bikini and for the ongoing needs of the Bikini people. Congress established this trust fund in 1982 pursuant to P.L. 97-257 and appropriated additional funds in 1988 pursuant to P.L. 100-446.  The Bikini people have explained that Dr. John Mauro and his team are preparing a report on the potential radiation doses and health risks to the people of Bikini and costs associated with various remediation options, which should be completed within three months. The exact cost has not yet been established, but it is estimated that the entire cleanup and resettlement process, from planning through execution, will take approximately ten years. As a result, it is certain that the Bikini elders, many of whom have not been back on their home islands for more than 53 years, will probably die on Kili without returning home.  The Bikinians, for their part, have ensured the fiscal integrity of the Resettlement Trust Fund. They have selected reputable U.S. banks as trustees, hired well-respected and talented investment advisors and money managers, and provided for routine monthly financial statements and annual audits. Thanks to the money managers and the Bikini Council's voluntary restraint on the use of these funds, the corpus remains intact, the trust fund has earned almost 14 percent annually, every dollar has been accounted for, annual audits are prepared, and monthly financial statements are sent to the Interior Department's Office of Insular Affairs.  In light of the strength of the trust, its fiscal integrity, the lengthy time a cleanup and restoration will take, and the special circumstances of the elders, the Bikinians wish to make a one-time 3 percent distribution from the Resettlement Trust Fund, with the understanding that the primary beneficiaries of the distribution will be the 90 surviving Bikini elders. Because of the excellent management of the trust fund, such a distribution will not require an appropriation of funds by Congress, nor will it diminish the original corpus of the trust. The Bikini people would also agree that the amount of such distribution be deducted from any further additional ex gratia appropriations made by the Congress into the Resettlement Trust Fund.  The corpus will remain intact with a 3 percent distribution. The original corpus of the trust was $110 million, based on the $20 million appropriated in 1982 and the additional $90 million in 1988. The market value of the trust today is approximately $126 million, so a 3 percent distribution, or approximately $3,780,000, will reduce the market value to $122.2 million, which remains well above the original corpus.  This authorization to the people of Bikini is appropriate as it is what the community of Bikini desires and it is consistent with congressional intent for the resettlement of the people whose lives and homes were disrupted by U.S. testing. Without any additional cost to the U.S. taxpayer, Congress can help the remaining senior Bikini elders' resettlement and relocation.  Following is a copy of the Kili/Bikini/Ejit Local Government Council's May 12, 1999 Resolution on this matter, reflecting the full support of the Bikini community.   Kili/Bikini/Ejit Local Government Council: Kili/Bikini/Ejit Local                     Government Resolution No. 2-1999                              A Resolution       This Resolution requests a one-time three percent (3%)      distribution from the existing corpus of the Resettlement      Trust Fund for the People of Bikini to benefit primarily the      Bikini elders and to request appropriate U.S. Senate and      House committees to hold hearings to determine the      appropriateness of such request, the status of cleanup      efforts at Bikini, current estimates of cleanup and      restoration costs, questions concerning the guarantee of      Bikini Atoll's safety and other appropriate issues.       Whereas, the Resettlement Trust Fund for the People of      Bikini (``Resettlement Trust Fund'') was established by the      U.S. Congress in 1982 pursuant to the terms of Public Law No.      97-257, for ``the relocation and resettlement of the Bikini      people in the Marshall Islands, principally on Kili and Ejit      Islands;'' and       Whereas, Public Law No. 97-257 also instructed that      $3,000,000 of the Resettlement Trust Fund was to be made      available ex gratia to the people of Bikini over a three-year      period; and       Whereas, the U.S. Congress appropriated additional funds      for the Resettlement Trust Fund in 1988 and modified its      terms to provide that funds could also be ``expended for      rehabilitation and resettlement of Bikini Atoll;'' and       Whereas, the people of Bikini have ensured the fiscal      integrity of the Resettlement Trust Fund by (1) selecting      reputable banks as trustees (American Security Bank and now      FMB Trust), (2) hiring well-respected investment advisors      (such as Alex, Brown and PaineWebber) and money managers      (such as MFS, Gabelli, Fiduciary Trust, etc.), and (3)      directing that every dollar of Resettlement Trust Fund      expenditures be audited and that monthly financial statements      and annual audits be routinely provided to the Department of      the Interior's Office of Insular Affairs, which oversees the      Resettlement Trust Fund; and       Whereas, the Resettlement Trust Fund has averaged a 14%      annual return since inception; and       Whereas, the Resettlement Trust Fund has paid out millions      of dollars since inception for scholarships, health care,      food programs, housing and electrical power construction,      maintenance and repairs on Kili and Ejit, and infrastructure,      cleanup and resettlement activities on Bikini Atoll; and       Whereas, through prudent management and voluntary      restrictions on the use of Resettlement Trust Fund monies,      the market value of the Resettlement Trust Fund today is      approximately $126,000,000; and       Whereas, recently disclosed information previously withheld      by the U.S. government reveals that the physical and      radiological damage to Bikini Atoll caused by the U.S.      nuclear testing program was more extensive than was or could      have been known by the people of Bikini until the disclosure      of such information; and       Whereas, the people of Bikini have recently learned from      well-respected scientists who have conducted extensive      radiological cleanup cost estimates for the U.S.      Environmental Protection Agency that the restoration costs      for cleanup and resettlement of Bikini Atoll will exceed      several hundred million dollars; and       Whereas, this means that many Bikini elders, who have not      been back on their home islands for 53 years, will probably      die without returning home; and       Whereas, of the 167 of our elders who were moved off our      islands in 1946, fewer than 90 are still alive; and       Whereas, most of these elders live on Kili, an island one-     ninth the size of Bikini Atoll which must support six times      the number of people who lived on Bikini; and       Whereas, we wish to compensate these elders with a one-time      3% distribution from the corpus of the Resettlement Trust      Fund; and       Whereas, unlike people living on other atolls in the      Marshall Islands, our people on Kili cannot fish because Kili      has no lagoon and no reef, thus requiring our community to      supplement our U.S.D.A. food by purchasing other canned goods      at great expense; and       Whereas, a one-time 3% distribution from the Resettlement      Trust Fund will not require an appropriation of any funds by      the U.S. Congress; and       Whereas, given the good management of the Resettlement      Trust Fund a 3% distribution would not diminish the original      corpus of the trust fund; and       Whereas, Congress has previously authorized ex gratia per      capita payments from the Resettlement Trust Fund; and       Whereas, the House Resources Committee (formerly the House      Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs) has held many      oversight hearings on Bikini-related issues during the past      25 years, covering such issues as health care, education,      agricultural and food programs, establishment and oversight      of ex gratia trust funds for the Bikini people, Bikini Atoll      cleanup, Compact of Free Association Section 177 Agreement      cover-up of the 1954 Bravo shot, and vaporization of islands      at Bikini;       Now, therefore, be it resolved, that: (1) The Council      requests a one-time only 3% distribution from the existing      corpus of the Resettlement Trust Fund, with the understanding      that the primary beneficiaries of this distribution will be      the Bikini elders.       (2) The Council agrees that the amount of such distribution      shall be deducted from any future additional ex gratia      payments made by the U.S. Congress into the Resettlement      Trust Fund.       (3) Legal counsel Jonathan M. Weisgall is instructed to      forward a copy of this Resolution to Allen P. Stayman,      Director, Office of Insular Affairs, U.S. Department of the      Interior; Senator Frank Murkowski, Chairman, Senate Energy      and Natural Resources Committee; and Representative Don      Young, Chairman, House Resources Committee, and to urge these      Senate and House Committees to hold hearings, as necessary,      to determine the appropriateness of the above request and to      obtain information concerning the status of cleanup efforts      at Bikini Atoll, current estimates of cleanup and restoration      costs, questions concerning the guarantee of Bikini Atoll's      safety, and other appropriate issues.       Final and passed by the KILI/BIKINI/EJIT LOCAL GOVERNMENT      COUNCIL on the 12th day of March, 1999, at a meeting on Kili      Island.           APPROVED:     Tomaki Juda,       Mayor     Witness: Nathn Note, Clerk                               ____________________
