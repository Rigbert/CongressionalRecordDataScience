Speaker, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of our committee today and also with my colleague, the gentleman from Michigan from my neighboring district (Mr. Hoekstra).  Mr. Speaker, section 970 of title IX of the conference report includes a demonstration project that is designed to address the effect of ozone transport in southwest Michigan where projected nonattainment is the result of transported ozone across Lake Michigan. This project will assess the difficulties due to transported ozone across the lake to determine the extent of ozone transport and develop alternatives to achieve compliance apart from local controls.  I just want to be sure that the purpose and intent of the committee in this legislation is clear. Am I correct in saying that the counties in particularly our two districts in southwest Michigan, Cass County, Berrien, Van Buren, Kalamazoo, Allegan, that are not in attainment for the ozone standards due to ozone transport are included in the provision and will be eligible for the demonstration project?
