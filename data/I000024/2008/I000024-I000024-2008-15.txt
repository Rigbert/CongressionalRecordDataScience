 Another thing I would observe is that things don't happen in a vacuum. The Senator from North Dakota mentioned it could result in a devaluation of the dollar. If that happens, one of the major reasons we have high gas prices at the pumps--the major reason is supply and demand, but the other reason is the devaluation of the dollar. So that would be affected also.  We need to consider all these things and we need to be deliberate. I know a lot of smart people are in rooms now trying to figure out some solutions, and I hope they come up with a good one and something I can support.                          ____________________
