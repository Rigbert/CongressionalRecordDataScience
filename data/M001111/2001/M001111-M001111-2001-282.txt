 President, in a minute we are going to be voting on avery important amendment which reduces class size in first, second, and third grades and continue the commitment this Congress has made in the last three years.  Frankly, I cannot believe the Senate just spent 2 hours debating whether or not smaller class size makes a difference. We know it makes a difference. Any teacher, parent, or student will tell you that, and we have the research that proves it.  This vote is our opportunity to support the progress being made in schools across the country and to show that we are willing to invest in the things that work. If our colleagues vote against this amendment, in September when parents find their kids back in overcrowded classrooms, they are going to be upset. They are going to want to know why you voted against smaller classes. You can tell them about flexibility, choice, and funding pools, but the truth is, none of those buzzwords will help their kids learn to read when they are fighting just to get a teacher's attention. The choice we make today will demonstrate whether ``no child left behind'' is just a catchy campaign slogan or a national commitment. I hope it is the latter. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I yield back the remaining time on our side.
