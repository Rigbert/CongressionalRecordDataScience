Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I have listened attentively to the arguments made by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt) in support of his amendment, and he said that his amendment is redundant. It is redundant, but it also is a gutting amendment to the base text of the constitutional amendment that we are debating today.  This substitute amendment should be rejected because it would constitutionally ratify the Supreme Court's decision in Texas v. Johnson and United States v. Eichman, rather than empower Congress to pass legislation to protect the flag from physical desecration.  In Johnson and Eichman, the Supreme Court held that flag desecration is expressive conduct protected by the first amendment. These decisions effectively invalidated the laws of 48 States and the Federal Government. In addition, based on these precedents, any law that prohibits the physical desecration of the flag will be struck down as an unconstitutional suppression of free expression, thus defeating the goal of our efforts to provide protection for the flag.  A constitutional amendment must be passed if the flag is to receive legal protection. Under the Watt substitute, the flag would not receive such protection because the Court would simply strike down as inconsistent to the first amendment any implementing legislation enacted into law.  Adoption of the substitute would not only render H.J. Res. 10 ineffective, but it would also constitutionally codify the Supreme Court decisions that a vast majority of the American public were erroneously decided, and which did not exist for the first 200 years of the Constitution's existence.  In other words, if the Watt amendment is passed and then a constitutional amendment is passed and ratified by the States, the Supreme Court can, in the future, recognize that it made a mistake, and that is why this amendment should be rejected.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
