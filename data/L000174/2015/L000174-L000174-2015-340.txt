President, I thank my colleague from Vermont for what he has said. I would note that there are many in our State who agree wholeheartedly. We are not a wealthy State. We are a proud State. We are not a State that believes in such a huge disparity of income. So I thank the Senator for what he said, not only here but when he has made similar remarks around the country.  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy pertaining to the introduction of S. 356 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')
