Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I am in complete agreement with this amendment. It is long overdue. It was a portion of the bill that was very controversial, behind closed doors. I think the gentleman has made the right decision. It greatly improves the bill, and I support the amendment.
