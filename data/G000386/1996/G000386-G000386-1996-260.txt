''  Mr. President, the Government should not be in the business of deciding how much to pay corporate executives in the defense industry.  Grassley-Boxer will not get the Government out of that business entirely, but it is a step in the right direction.  Mr. President, earlier in the debate, I said that we need to get Government bureaucrats out of the business of deciding how much to pay defense executives.  Grassley-Boxer wouldn't get us out of that business entirely, but it would be a step in the right direction.  Grassley-Boxer would put a governor on executive pay flowing through the DOD money pipe.  The Grassley-Boxer amendment would limit the size of executive salaries that could be charged directly to the Government under a specific contract.  Under existing rules, the sky is the limit.  For the bills coming due today, DOD pay what is fair and reasonable.  Reasonableness is defined in Federal regulation, FAR 31-205-6.  The rule is broad and general, as I suspected.  It gives the bureaucrats wide latitude for maneuver.  The guidance on how to make the determination is spelled out in defense contract audit agency [DCAA] documents.  DCAA bureaucrats make the final decision.  The main guide is a market consensus survey to see what everybody else is getting paid.  Above all, the DCAA documents say: ``Be fair--not arbitrary.''  At the Pentagon, being fair and reasonable usually means the taxpayers get shafted.  Pentagon bureaucrats like to bend over backward to keep the defense contractors happy.  And shoveling money at corporate executives is a great way to do it.  The Pentagon has proven over and over again that it is incapable of keeping lid on executive pay dished out on contracts.  The pay package coming out of the recent Martin Marietta-Lockeed merger is a prime example of what I'm talking about.  Some 460 executives and directors are slated to receive a total of $92.2 million: $8.2 million in cash and stock options is supposed to go to Mr. Norman Augustine, chairman of the Martin Marietta Corp. before the merger.  Now this very generous plan is in the process of being blessed by the Pentagon bureaucrats.  The deal isn't final, yet.  Since this pay package is based on longstanding contractual commitments, some dating back to the early 1980's, United Same has to pay.  The old rules apply.  The sky is the limit.  This is what the DCAA bureaucrats have to do to make it happen.  They take the salary of each corporate executive and break it down into many parts and spread it around on thousands of contracts.  They use a mathematical formula to determine how much to put on each contract.  Mr. President, this is what we must not forget. This is the key point:  There is no ceiling on what DOD can pay the Lockheed-Martin executives.  But from what I am hearing, industry's demand for money is being scaled back, somewhat.  But exactly how much will each executive get under the merger deal?  I don't think the Pentagon wants us to kown how much the taxpayers are paying Mr. Augustine.  They don't want us to know how much is about to be taken out of the pockets of hard-working American taxpayers to bankroll these outrageous payments.  These top industry executives are on the Government payroll, and we can't even find out how much they make.  DCAA says that's sensitive proprietary information.  If they are on the public payroll, the people have a right to know how much each one gets.  Over a year ago, Senator Boxer and I asked the DOD Inspector General, Ms. Eleanor Hill, for this information.  That was on April 28, 1995.  We received her response on May 26, 1995.  But it was unsatisfactory, and we went back to her on June 20 for more specific answers to our questions.  When no satisfactory response was given, the request was renewed again on February 16, 1996.  On June 17, 1996, she finally provided a partial answer to the question.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place our correspondence with the DOD IG in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 1995.     Ms. Eleanor Hill,     Inspector General, Department of Defense, Army Navy Drive,          Arlington, VA.       Dear Ms. Hill: We are writing to ask you to examine the      merger of the Lockheed and Martin Marietta Corporations and      to determine its cost to the taxpayers.       We think this merger needs scrutiny by your office.       The ``payout benefit plan'' being given to executives and      managers at Martin is truly beyond comprehension for most      ordinary American citizens. Martin Marietta Chairman Norman      Augustine, for example, will receive $8.2 million in cash and      stock options as a result of the merger. Other top executives      are set to receive huge sums. A total of $92.2 million will      be dished out to about 460 managers and executives under      various plans. We understand that some of this money will be      taken out of the pockets of hard working American taxpayers.       Since mid-1992, there have been at least nine or ten major      mergers or acquisitions in the U.S. defense industry. Under      current policy, the amounts charged to current or future      defense contracts to cover the ``restructuring'' or merger      costs could be building up to unacceptable levels. What are      the government's total potential liabilities from all recent      mergers? What is the rationale for giving defense companies      tax money to cover the costs of their mergers? To us, mergers      mean less competition, and less competition usually means      higher prices.       Furthermore, we understand that there is a lack of clear      guidance in regulation and law governing mergers as to what      is allowable and what is not allowable. This situation could      leave the door wide open for waste, abuse and excessive cash      payments to industry executives.       In line with our more general concerns, we have eleven more      specific questions on the Martin/Lockheed merger:       Is there any evidence--based on recent experience--to      suggest that the merger will generate real savings to the      taxpayers?       If so, what are the total expected savings to the taxpayers      from the merger?       What is the total projected cost of the merger to the      taxpayers, including potential reimbursements for closing      unneeded facilities?       How exactly would tax dollars be used to compensate the two      firms for the cost of the merger?       To what extent are tax dollars being used to support the      executive compensation plan resulting from the merger--     particularly the one contained in a joint proxy statement for      the meeting held on March 15, 1995?       If tax money is used to finance the executive ``payout''      operation, please provide the name of each person receiving      tax money and the total amount each person is to receive.       What is the legal basis for using tax money to make such      payments?       Will projected costs and savings be subjected to adequate      audit verification?       Does the merger plan comply with Section 818 of Public Law      103-337 and Section 8117 of Public Law 103-335?       Does the April 15, 1995 deadline specified in Section 8117      mean that the Martin/Lockheed merger is not covered by this      provision?       Have anti-trust issues been adequately addressed?       Ms. Hill, as far as we are concerned, the salaries paid to      top executives in industry should be determined in the market      place--not by some obscure act of Congress. But if money is      taken out of the pockets of hard working American taxpayers      to pay defense industry executive outrageous and unreasonable      salaries and bonuses, then we feel like we have an obligation      to ask questions.       We look forward to your independent assessment of the      facts.       Your continued support is always appreciated.           Sincerely,     Charles E. Grassley.     Barbara Boxer.                                                                    ____                                                Inspector General,                                        Department of Defense,                                      Arlington, VA, May 26, 1995.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: This is in reply to a letter of      April 28, 1995, signed jointly by you and Senator Barbara      Boxer, that requested our assessment of the facts surrounding      the merger of the Lockheed and Martin Marietta Corporations.      Our response to each of your concerns and questions is      presented in the enclosure.       Under Section 818, Public Law 337, and implementing      regulations, restructuring costs associated with a business      combination of defense contractors may not be paid, absent a      review of projected costs and savings resulting for the      Department from that business combination. We understand that      Lockheed Martin Corporation plans to submit a proposal      containing such information by late June 1995. That proposal      will be audited by the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the      results assessed by the Defense Contract Management Command      to determine the amount of restructuring costs that properly      may be reimbursed by the Government. In the interim, those      agencies will review the companies' requests for payments to      assure that the Government is not being improperly billed.       Because the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the General      Accounting Officer will be examining the costs associated      with the business combination, we do not plan to initiate a      review of the matter. We will, however, closely monitor the      audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency and actions by the      Defense Contract Management Command. Let me assure you that I      share your concern that the Lockheed and Martin Marietta      business combination not result in the payment of unallowable      or excessive costs by the Government.       A similar reply is being provided to Senator Boxer. If we      may be of further assistance, please contact me or Mr. John      R. Crane, Office of Congressional Liaison, at 604-8324.           Sincerely,                                                     Eleanor Hill,     Inspector General.                                                                    ____Response to Comments and Questions Regarding the Merger of Lockheed and                       Martin Marietta Corportions       General Comments: A total of $92.2 million will be dished      out to about 460 managers and executives under various plans.       Of the $92.2 million, the Lockheed Martin Corporation      believes that $31 million are allowable costs that can be      charged to Government contracts. The Defense Contract Audit      Agency is currently auditing the $31 million. The audit is      scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1995.       What are the Government's total potential liabilities from      all recent mergers?       The Department of Defense (DoD) may pay allowable and      allocable restructuring costs resulting from a business      combination provided under that audited proposals indicate      that overall savings to the Government will result. As only a      few contractors have presented restructuring proposals, the      total potential costs and overall savings to the Government      cannot be predicted at this time.       What is the rationale for giving defense companies tax      money to cover the costs of their mergers? To us, merger      means less competition, and less competition means higher      prices.       The DoD may pay restructuring costs, i.e., the cost to      streamline operations, including the elimination of unneeded      or redundant facilities and reductions in the work force      subsequent to a merger or acquisition, provided they are      offset by related savings. We share your concern, however,      that competition is being reduced and may lead to higher      prices.       We understand that there is a lack of clear guidelines in      regulation and law governing mergers as to what is allowable      and what is not allowable.       Clearly, those costs, such as reorganization costs, that      were previously unallowable are still not allowable. A July      1993 policy memorandum on restructuring costs by the Under      Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology      specifically makes that point. What is unclear is the law and      regulations addressing the allowability of restructuring      costs that result in increased costs on contracts novated      from the selling company to the buyer.       Under the provisions in the present Federal Acquisition      Regulation (FAR), the DoD is under no obligation to pay      increased costs of novated contracts even if they are offset      by decreases. The July 1993 memorandum was intended to      clarify that DoD contracting officers have the latitude to      recognize cost increases on novated contracts due to      restructuring provided they are offset with related      savings.       The problem we see is that the Congress initially believed      that restructuring costs actually represented merger and      acquisition costs. Section 818 of Public Law 103-337,      therefore, addresses restructuring costs in general rather      than those situations specifically related to increased costs      on novated contracts.       Restructuring costs are generally allowable since      contractors must have the ability to change and improve their      operations. However, the interim regulations written by the      DoD in response to the broad requirements of Section 818,      require contractors to demonstrate that all restructuring      costs, whether related to a merger or acquisition or not, are      offset by savings. It is possible that the law and new      regulations will make previously allowable costs unallowable.      The net effect is that few contractors have come forward with      restructuring proposals. We believe, therefore, that the law      and the DoD interim regulations should be clarified to      address restructuring related to novated contracts only.       Specific Concerns: Is there any evidence--based on recent      experience--to suggest that the merge will generate real      savings to the taxpayers?       Yes. In those very few cases where companies involved in      business combination have submitted restructuring proposals,      cost reductions are forecast. However, we cannot predict      whether anticipated savings are offset by diminished      competition.       If so, what are the total expected savings to the taxpayer      from the merger?       The company has not submitted a proposal of forecasted      savings.       What is the total projected cost of the merger to the      taxpayer, including potential reimbursements for closing      unneeded facilities?       Again, that information is not yet available because the      company has not submitted a proposal of forecasted savings.       How exactly would tax dollars be used to compensate the two      firms for the cost of the merger?       As previously stated, the costs of the merger are not      compensated. Restructuring costs are reimbursed once the      contractor satisfactorily demonstrates to the Contracting      Officer at the Defense Contract Management Command and      auditor at the Defense Contract Audit Agency that there      will be overall savings to the Government. An advance      agreement will then be executed specifying the type and      limits for restructuring costs that can be charged to      contracts each year. That agreement is forwarded to a      senior DoD official who certifies that savings will be      achieved. The costs are then allocated among all the      contractor's business and the Government pays its share.       To what extent are tax dollars being used to support the      executive compensation plan resulting from the merger      particularly the one contained in a joint proxy statement for      the meeting held on March 15, 1995?       Tax money, in the form of contract payments, will be used      to pay some of the executive compensation costs. The Lockheed      Martin Corporation has indicated that the costs will be      claimed on its Government contracts based on its past      practices and would not exceed the amount DoD would have paid      had the merger not occurred. Each of the elements of      compensation included in the proxy statement resulting from      the merger are being reviewed by the Defense Contract Audit      Agency to determine the reasonableness of the compensation      paid and to ensure the long-term compensation plans are in      accordance with the procurement regulations. The DoD and      other Federal agencies pay the allowable portion of executive      compensation based on their share of the contractor's      business.       If tax money is used to finance the executive ``payout''      operation, please provide the name of each person receiving      tax money and the amount each person is to receive.       Although the proxy statement does identify some individuals      and amounts paid, it does not identify the amount that will      be claimed on Government contracts. We will not know all the      names of the people receiving the money or the final amount      being claimed on Government contracts until the audit by the      Defense Contract Audit Agency is complete. The audit is      scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1995.       What is the legal basis for using tax money to make such      payments?       The FAR provides for a fair share of contractor costs,      including executive compensation, to be charged to Government      contracts. The regulation prohibits paying costs such as      ``golden parachutes.'' The audit by the Defense Contract      Audit Agency will determine if the amounts claimed by the      Lockheed Martin Corporation are allowable.       Will projected costs and savings be subjected to adequate      audit verification?       The Public Law and procurement regulations require audit      verification by the Defense Contract Audit Agency. We plan to      monitor the audit.       Does the merger plan comply with Section 818 of Public Law      103-337 and Section 8117 of Public Law 103-335?       We will not know whether the plan complies with either law      until the restructuring proposal is submitted and examined by      the contracting officer and auditor.       Does the April 15, 1995 deadline specified in Section 8117      mean that the Martin/Lockheed merger is not covered by this      provision?       The April 15, 1995 deadline applies to payments from funds      appropriated in fiscal year 1995 for contracts awarded after      April 15, 1995. Section 8117 will limit, to some extent, the      DoD reimbursement to the Lockheed Martin Corporation after      April 15, 1995. The audit by the Defense Contract Audit      Agency will evaluate the compensation costs proposed to be      claimed after April 15, 1995, to determine compliance with      the public law.       Have anti-trust issues been adequately addressed?       Compliance with antitrust laws is the responsibility of the      Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. We      are not aware of any problems in that area.                                                                    ____                                                Inspector General,                                        Department of Defense,                                     Arlington, VA, June 14, 1996.     Hon. Charles Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: This is in further response to a      letter of April 28, 1995, signed jointly by you and Senator      Barbara Boxer that requested information regarding long-term      incentive compensation payouts to Martin Marietta executives.      These payouts have been claimed for government reimbursement      by Lockheed Martin Corporation as a result of the merger of      Lockheed and Martin Marietta Corporations.       Enclosed are aggregate totals of the long-term incentive      compensation for four categories of Lockheed Martin      executives that are allocable to Government contracts through      indirect expense pools, excluding commercial and foreign      military sales. It should be noted the long-term incentive      compensation was earned over a period of years and paid in      1995 after the merger. The categories of former Martin      Marietta executives include the top five executives, other      top executives, all other executives and the outside Board of      Directors.       The Lockheed Martin Corporation has agreed, on an exception      basis, to a release of the aggregate totals without a company      proprietary stamp. Lockheed Martin Corporation considers      individual names and associated financial information to be      confidential proprietary and management sensitive data and      has not made an exception as to that information.       We agree that such information is proprietary and is exempt      from release under the Freedom of Information Act, Sections      552(b)(4) and 552(b)(6), Title 5, United States Code. It has      been designated ``For Official Use Only'' (FOUO), and can be      released pursuant to a request from a chairman of a committee      or subcommittee with jurisdiction over the subject matter.       We hope that the above information is helpful to you. If we      may be of further assistance, please contact me or Mr. John      R. Crane, Office of Congressional Liaison, at (703) 604-8324.
