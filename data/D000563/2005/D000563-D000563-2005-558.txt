Have we turned the page now? Are we not thinking about what happened down there? I hope we haven't.  Let me ask the Senator from Montana, is it a fact, No. 1, that the reliefthat he is proposing is temporary and short term? It is 5 months of Medicaid relief for these people who are in the worst circumstances. And, second, it would help States like mine and many others that have brought in evacuees. In our case, we brought 5,000 evacuees into our State to help them out. We have incurred more expenses in Medicaid expenditures to help these families so that these caring people in States around the gulf coast area who are really trying to help will not be ignored by the Federal Government.  Is that the intent of the amendment?
