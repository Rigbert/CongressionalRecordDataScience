 I wish to ask the Senator from North Dakota, I have heard this concept, talking about pay as you go, that the Democrats, when they came to control the Congress, would pay for any tax cuts or any spending increases so it would not add to the national debt. So I wish to ask the Senator from North Dakota, I know he believes in it very passionately: Is this a pay-as-you-go proposal from the Republican side so that there is no net loss to future generations? Is this being taken care of by the Senator from Arizona offsetting it, for example, with an increase in taxes on maybe working people of this country or some other group or cutting spending in some other area?
