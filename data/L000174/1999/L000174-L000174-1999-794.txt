President, every Senator supports our men and women in uniform, and we all have heard the troubling retention and recruiting reports coming from the military. The Administration and Congress need to address these problems. Many items in this bill build on the President's initiative to improve compensation for our military personnel. The Armed Services Committee has added other provisions that will enhance our Nation's ability to attract and retain high-quality personnel.  However, it should concern us, just as it should concern our personnel in uniform, that this bill has not yet been provided for in the budget. The plain fact is that this bill is being considered at the wrong time. We should have waited until the Senate completed its annual work on a comprehensive budget framework. Social Security, Medicare, retirement of the national debt, discretionary spending and tax cuts are all issues that need to be considered at the time that we decide to commit billions to defense or any other spending program. This bill should have been considered in conjunction with the rest of the defense authorization bill, because under the currently structured budget caps, the new spending in this bill will have to be offset by other cuts in defense to pay for it, and this is an enormously expensive bill.  Much of this bill is warranted. I will vote for it because the effectiveness of our military depends on the quality of its personnel. This bill will improve the quality of our military, but with little regard for fiscal concerns. I hope that this does not become a trend in the 106th Congress and I expect the final concerns to be addressed in conference.
