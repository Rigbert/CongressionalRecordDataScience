I am not suggesting experts are in opposition. I merely wanted, for purposes of debate, to have that.  He speaks of these Orwellian, bizarre people. I suspect it is giving the North Korean leadership the benefit of the doubt to call them Orwellian and bizarre. They are worse than that. We can't ignore what has happened there. But we are not dealing with rationale people.  Had I been the one to write the agreement we have with them, I would like to think that I would have written it a lot differently than it is. But I also understand the concerns that countries like South Korea, Japan, and others have put a lot more money and a lot more effort into this agreement than the United States has.  I do not want to give the North Korean Government an excuse to make the situation we now have a lot worse.  We have done some things with this agreement. The North Korean nuclear facility at Yongbyon and Taechom have been frozen under the IAEA inspection. Virtually all of the spent fuel in the Yongbyon reactor has been safely canned under IAEA seals. Those are spelled forth.  At the same time, this is a country which I think both the Senator from Arizona and I would agree has the ability to make inspections. The ability to determine what they are doing is probably as difficult as any country in the world. What makes it worse, unlike some other countries where it is difficult to find out what they are doing, they are not countries with the potential nuclear power and potential nuclear weapons power.  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.  I withhold the suggestion of the absence of a quorum. I see the Senator from Arizona on the floor.  Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.
