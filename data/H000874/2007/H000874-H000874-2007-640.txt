Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Ladies and gentlemen of the House, we entered today and we will be, for the next 4 days, involved in the most serious of discussions.  It is a heavy responsibility for any Member of Congress to determine whether or not to send our people in harm's way for the purposes of defending freedom. We should consider that with great solemnity and with great care. The reason for the extensive period of debate is because we believe that all Members of Congress ought to have the opportunity to express their view.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the distinguished Speaker of this House, Nancy Pelosi of California.
