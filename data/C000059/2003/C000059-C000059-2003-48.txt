Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Southern California are exceptional. Southern California has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders whowillingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Ray Becker is one of these individuals. Ray will be stepping down as President of the Building Industry Association of Southern California (BIA) and I would like to thank him for his service.  Ray originally came to the Inland Empire in the early 1980s as Vice President and Division Manager with the Lusk Company. During 20 years in Southern California real estate development, Ray has managed the construction of more than 3,000 homes and 16,000 home sites. For eight years Ray taught Light Construction and Development Management at the University of California, Riverside.  Ray is also Senior Vice President of Lennar Communities Inland, a division of Lunar Homes of California. Lunar is a national real estate company listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is one of the largest public homebuilders in the United States. Under his leadership, Lunar acquires, plans, entitles, develops, markets, sells, and manages medium and large scale communities.  Ray has been an excellent President of BIA and continually promotes the building profession. He is also involved in California BIA and the National Association of Homebuilders. He is past President of the Inland Chapter of HomeAid, an industry charitable foundation, and has held the Presidency of the Youth Service Center and Parkview Community Hospital Foundation. Ray's commitment to the community and to Southern California is exemplary.  Ray's tireless passion for the building industry has contributed immensely to the betterment of the community of Southern California. I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many BIA members and homebuilders are grateful for his service and salute him as he steps down from his position.                          ____________________
