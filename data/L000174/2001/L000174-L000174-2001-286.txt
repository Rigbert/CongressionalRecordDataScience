President, I have spoken many times over the past two years of the problems caused by the so-called McDade law, 28 U.S.C. 530B, which was slipped into the omnibus appropriations bill at the end of the 105th Congress. The McDade law has delayed important criminal investigations, prevented the use of effective and traditionally-accepted investigative techniques, and served as the basis of litigation to interfere with legitimate Federal prosecutions. At a time when we need Federal law enforcement authorities to move quickly to catch those responsible for last week's terrorist attacks, and to prevent further attacks on our country, we can no longer tolerate the drag on Federal investigations and prosecutions caused by this ill-considered legislation.  The bill that I am introducing today, along with Senators Hatch and Wyden, will modify the McDade law by establishing a set of rules that clarify the professional standards applicable to government attorneys. I introduced similar legislation in the last Congress, but was unable to get it before the Judiciary Committee for consideration. Since then, I have continued to work closely with the Justice Department and the FBI to monitor the problems caused by the McDade law and to refine this corrective legislation. I hope Congress will make it a top priority as it considers ways to improve Federal law enforcement and combat terrorism.  By way of background, controversy surrounding the application of State ethics rules to Federal prosecutors began over a decade ago, when a Federal appellate court held in United States v. Hammad, that a disciplinary rule prohibiting lawyers from communicating with persons they knew to be represented applied in the investigatory stages of a Federal criminal prosecution. The court also noted that suppression of evidence was an appropriate remedy for a prosecutor's breach of an ethical rule.  The Department of Justice responded to the Hammad opinion with what became known as the Thornburgh Memorandum. Issued on June 8, 1989, the Memorandum asserted that ``contact with a represented individual in the course of authorized law enforcement activity does not violate'' the ABA's model ``no contact'' rule. The Memorandum concluded, ``The Department will resist, on Supremacy Clause grounds, local attempts to curb legitimate Federal law enforcement techniques.''  The Federal courts responded negatively to the Department's position. In general, the Department was unable to persuade the courts of the efficacy of the Attorney General's policy statement.  Amid mounting criticism of the Thornburgh Memorandum, Attorney General Reno issued regulations in 1994 governing all Justice Department litigators in their communications with persons represented by counsel. These regulations allowed contacts with represented persons in certain circumstances, even if such contacts were at odds with State or local Federal court ethics rules. State disciplinary authorities could sanction a government attorney for willful violation of the regulations, but only upon a finding by the Attorney General that a willful violation had occurred.  The Department's new regulations shared the fundamental defect of the Thornburgh Memorandum, regulation of Federal prosecutors by the Justice Department instead of by the courts, without valid statutory authority. Not surprisingly, the only court to consider these regulations found them to be invalid.  On May 1, 1996, Representative Joseph McDade introduced legislation that sought to resolve the controversy over the Justice Department's claimed authority to write its own ethics rules. In essence, H.R. 3386 provided that Federal prosecutors were governed by the ethics rules that apply to lawyers generally. A hearing on the bill was held on September 12, 1996, before the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, but no further action was taken.  On March 5, 1998, Representative McDade introduced H.R. 3396, a modified version of H.R. 3386. Although the House Judiciary Committee did not hold hearings or act on the bill, language similar to H.R. 3396 was included in the House-passed Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill for FY1999. Thereafter, without the benefit of any hearings or debate in the Senate, and over the objection of a bipartisan majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the same language was enacted as Title VIII of the final omnibus bill, with a six-month delayed effective date.  At a hearing before a Judiciary Subcommittee on March 24, 1999, a number of law enforcement officials lined up to criticize the new law. In particular, they argued that its vague directive to comply with rules in each State where the attorney engages in his or her duties leaves prosecutors unsure about what rule applies to particular conduct. The one certain result of this confusion: Attorneys would refrain from taking critically important investigative steps or would leave law enforcement officers to make their own decisions about whom and how to investigate.  The McDade law went into effect on April 19, 1999. Since then, all of law enforcement's concerns about the McDade law have come to pass.  In floor statements on May 25 and September 14, 2000, I described some of the devastating effects that the McDade law is having on Federal law enforcement efforts across the country. You will recall some of the disturbing facts I described:  In Oregon, Federal prosecutors will no longer authorize undercover operations, and the FBI was forced to shut down its Innocent Images initiative, which targets child pornography and exploitation.  In California, a grand jury investigation into an airline's safety and maintenance practices was stalled for many months because of the McDade law's interplay with that State's ethics rules. After about a year of investigation, one of the airline's planes crashed, after experiencing mechanical problems on the first leg of its trip.  In another State, the FBI was stymied in a child murder investigation because of a State Bar ethics rule that went far beyond what is required by established Supreme Court and Federal appellate case law.  There are other recent examples. In one case, the FBI has had to close an investigation into allegations of fraud committed by the officials of a city with regard to FEMA disaster funds after the city's attorney invoked the McDade law to prohibit FBI agents from interviewing any city employees. In another case, counsel for an aviation company has used the McDade law to prevent the FBI from working with company employees who are willing to provide information and evidence concerning allegations that the company has been selling defective aircraft engine parts to military and civilian airlines.  Of more immediate urgency, the McDade law seriously threatens to impede the terrorism investigation into the events of September 11, 2001. In this widespread, international investigation, the McDade law will subject Justice Department attorneys to multiple and different attorney conduct rules, either because the attorneys working on or supervising the investigation are admitted to practice in more than one state, or because they are seeking assistance through court processes, search warrants; material witness warrants; criminal complaints; and grand jury subpoenas, in more than one Federal district court, each of which adopts its own set of attorney conduct rules. How are Justice Department attorneys meant to resolve conflicts in those rules in a manner that is reliable without unduly delaying this critical investigation?  There can no longer be any serious doubt about the need for corrective legislation. We cannot afford to wait until the McDade law impedes the investigation into last Tuesday's attacks before taking action.  Supporters of the McDade law have argued that Federal prosecutors are no worse off than their State counterparts, who have long been subject to State ethics rules. This is simply not the case. State prosecutors practice almost entirely before the courts of the State in which they are licensed: they do not practice in Federal court. Thus, they are subject to only one set of ethics rules, the rules applied by the courts before which they appear and the rules of the State in which they are licensed are one and the same. This is not true for Federal prosecutors, who are licensed by a State but practice in Federal courts and must comport with local Federal court ethics rules. Thus, Federal prosecutors are generally subject to at least two sets of potentially conflicting ethics rules.  Additionally, Federal prosecutors frequently work across State lines. This is not true of State prosecutors, whose work is generally confined to a single State. Under the McDade law, Federal prosecutors must comport with the State ethics rules of each State where they engage in their duties, which may be different than the rules of either the licensing State or the local Federal court. This means that Federal prosecutors may be subject to three or more sets of ethics rules with respect to the same conduct, including two or more sets of State ethics rules that do not take into consideration the special needs and interests of the United States in investigating and prosecuting violations of Federal law.  In any event, even assuming that State Bar rules are causing serious problems for State prosecutors as well as Federal prosecutors, that is a matter for the States, not for Congress. Our responsibility is to ensure the effective enforcement of the Federal criminal laws, and that is what my legislation seeks to accomplish.  The Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act adheres to the basic premise of the McDade law: The Department of Justice does not have the authority it has long claimed to write its own ethics rules. This legislation establishes that the Department may not unilaterally exempt Federal trial lawyers from the standards of professional responsibility adopted by the Federal courts. Federal courts are the more appropriate body to establish such standards for Federal prosecutors, not only because Federal courts have traditional authority to establish such standards for lawyers generally, but because the Department lacks the requisite objectivity.  The first part of this bill embodies the traditional understanding that when lawyers handle cases before a Federal court, they should be subject to the Federal court's standards of professional responsibility, and not to the possibly inconsistent standards of other jurisdictions. By incorporating this ordinary choice-of-law principle, the bill preserves the Federal courts' traditional authority to oversee the professional conduct of Federal trial lawyers, including Federal prosecutors. It thus avoids the uncertainties presented by the McDade law, which potentially subjects Federal prosecutors to State laws, rules of criminal procedure, and judicial decisions which differ from existing Federal law.  Another part of the bill specifically addresses the situation in Oregon, where a state court ruling has seriously impeded the ability of Federal agents to engage in undercover operations and other covert activities. Such activities are legitimate and essential crimefighting tools. The Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act ensures that these tools will be available to combat terrorism.  Finally, the bill addresses the most pressing contemporary question of government attorney ethics, namely, the question of which rule should govern government attorneys' communications with represented persons. It asks the Judicial Conference of the United States to submit to the Supreme Court a proposed uniform national rule to govern this area of professional conduct, and to study the need for additional national rules to govern other areas in which the proliferation of local rules may interfere with effective Federal law enforcement. The Rules Enabling Act process is the ideal one for developing such rules, both because the Federal judiciary traditionally is responsible for overseeing the conduct of lawyers in Federal court proceedings, and because this process would best provide the Supreme Court an opportunity fully to consider and objectively to weigh all relevant considerations.  The problems posed to Federal law enforcement investigations and prosecutions by the McDade law are real and urgent. The Professional Standards for Government Attorneys Act provides a reasonable and measured alternative: It preserves the traditional role of the State courts in regulating the conduct of attorneys licensed to practice before them, while ensuring that Federal prosecutors and law enforcement agents will be able to use traditional Federal investigative techniques. I urge Congress to move quickly to pass this corrective legislation before more cases are compromised.  I ask unanimous consent that the bill and a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the additional material ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1437       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Professional Standards for      Government Attorneys Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS FOR GOVERNMENT ATTORNEYS.       (a) Section 530B of title 28, United States Code, is      amended to read as follows:     ``SEC. 530B.

Amendments to 28 U.S.C. Sec. 530B       The first part of the bill supersedes the McDade law with a      new 28 U.S.C. Sec. 530B, consisting of six subsections:       Subsection (a) codifies the definition of ``government      attorney,'' by reference to the current Department of Justice      regulations.       Subsection (b) establishes clear choice-of-law rules for      government attorneys with respect to standards of      professional responsibility, modeled on Rule 8.5(b) of the      ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct. These choice-of-     law rules apply only with respect to government attorney      conduct that is related to the attorney's work for the      government. Under these rules, an attorney who is handling a      case in court would be subject to the professional standards      established by the rules and decisions of that court; an      attorney who is engaged in conduct reasonably intended to      lead to a proceeding in court, such as conduct in connection      with a grand jury or civil investigation, would be subject to      the professional standards of the court in which the      proceeding is intended to be brought; in other circumstances,      where no court has clear supervisory authority over      particular conduct, an attorney would be subject to the      professional standards established by rules and decisions of      the United States District Court for the judicial district in      which the attorney principally performs his official duties.      In the event that the Supreme Court promulgates one or more      uniform national rules governing the professional conduct of      government attorneys practicing before the Federal courts,      the terms of the uniform national rule would apply.       Subsection (c) clarifies the law regarding the licensing of      government attorneys, an issue that is currently addressed      through the appropriations process. Since 1979,      appropriations bills for the Department of Justice have      incorporated by reference section 3(a) of Pub. L. 96-132,      which states: ``None of the sums authorized to be      appropriated by this Act may be used to pay the compensation      of any person employed after the date of the enactment of      this Act as an attorney (except foreign counsel employed in      special cases) unless such person shall be duly licensed and      authorized to practice as an attorney under the laws of a      State, territory, or the District of Columbia.'' Subsection      (c) codifies this longstanding requirement, and also makes      clear that government attorneys need not be licensed under      the laws of any state in particular. The clarification is      necessary to ensure that local rules regarding state      licensure are not applied to federal prosecutors. Cf. United      States v. Straub, No. 5:99 Cr. 10 (N.D. W. Va. June 14, 1999)      (granting defense motion to disqualify the Assistant United      States Attorney because he was not licensed to practice in      West Virginia).       Subsection (d) specifically addresses the situation in      Oregon, where a state court ruling has seriously impeded the      ability of Federal agents to engage in undercover operations      and other covert activities. See In re Gatti, 330 Or. 517      (2000). This subsection ensures that these traditional law      enforcement tools will be available to federal prosecutors      and agents.       Subsection (e) makes clear that violations of professional      conduct rules by government attorneys shall not be construed      to permit the exclusion of otherwise admissible evidence in      any Federal criminal proceeding.       Subsection (f), like the McDade law, authorizes the      Attorney General to make and amend rules to assure compliance      with section 530B.           II. Judicial Conference Report and Recommendations       The second part of the bill directs the Judicial Conference      of the United States to prepare two reports regarding the      regulation of government attorney conduct. Both reports would      contain recommendations with respect to the advisability of      uniform national rules.       The first report would address the issue of contacts with      represented persons, which has generated the most serious      controversy regarding the professional conduct of government      attorneys. See, e.g., State v. Miller, 600 N.W.2d 457 (Minn.      1999); United States v. McDonnell Douglas Corp., 132 F.3d      1252 (8th Cir. 1998); United States v. Lopez, 4 F.3d 1455      (9th Cir. 1993); United States v. Hammad, 858 F.2d 834 (2d      Cir. 1988).       Rule 4.2 of the ABA's Model Rules of Professional Conduct      and analogous rules adopted by state courts and bar      associations place strict limits on when a lawyer may      communicate with a person he knows to be represented by      another lawyer. These ``no contact'' rules preserve fairness      in the adversarial system and the integrity of the attorney-     client relationship by protecting parties, potential parties      and witnesses from lawyers who would exploit the disparity in      legal skill between attorneys and lay people and damage the      position of the represented person. Courts have given a wide      variety of interpretations to these rules, however, creating      uncertainty and confusion as to how they apply in criminal      cases and to government attorneys. For example, courts have      disagreed about whether these rules apply to Federal      prosecutor contacts with represented persons in non-custodial      pre-indictment situations, in custodial pre-indictment      situations, and in post-indictment situations involving the      same or different matters underlying the charges.       Lawyers who practice in federal court--and federal      prosecutors in particular--have a legitimate interest in      being governed by a single set of professional standards      relating to     frequently recurring questions of professional conduct.      Further, any rule governing federal prosecutors'      communications with represented persons should be respectful      of legitimate law enforcement interest as well as the      legitimate interests of the represented individuals. Absent      clear authority to engage in communications with represented      persons, when necessary and under limited circumstances      carefully circumscribed by law, the government is      significantly hampered in its ability to detect and prosecute      Federal offenses.       The proposed legislation charges the Judicial Conference      with developing a uniform national rule governing government      attorney contacts with represented persons. Given the      advanced stage of dialogue among the interested parties, the      Department of Justice, the ABA, the Federal and State courts,      and others, the Committee is confident that a satisfactory      rule can be developed within the one-year time frame      established by the bill.       While the ``no contact'' rule poses the most serious      challenge to effective law enforcement, other rules of      professional responsibility may also threaten to interfere      with legitimate investigations. The proposed legislation      therefore directs the Judicial Conference to prepare a second      report addressing broader questions regarding the regulation      of government attorney conduct. This report, to be completed      within two years, would review any areas of conflict or      potential conflict between federal law enforcement techniques      and existing standards of professional responsibility, and      make recommendations concerning the need for additional      national rules.
