President, I ask unanimous consent that the attached documentation from the Office of Compliance be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    U.S. Congress,                                         Office of Compliance,                                Washington, DC, September 9, 2014.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     President Pro Tempore of the Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: Section 210(e) of the Congressional      Accountability Act (``CAA''), 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e), requires      the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance (``the      Board'') to issue regulations implementing Section 210 of the      CAA relating to provisions of Titles II and III of the      Americans with Disabilities Act (``ADA''), 42 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183 and 12198, made      applicable     to the legislative branch by the CAA. 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1331(b)(1).       Section 304(b)(1) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384(b)(1),      requires that the Board issue a general notice of proposed      rulemaking by transmitting ``such notice to the Speaker of      the House of Representatives and the President pro tempore of      the Senate for publication in the Congressional Record on the      first day on which both Houses are in session following such      transmittal.''       On behalf of the Board, I am hereby transmitting the      attached notice of proposed rulemaking to the President Pro      Tempore of the Senate. I request that this notice be      published in the Senate section of the Congressional Record      on the first day on which both Houses are in session      following receipt of this transmittal. In compliance with      Section 304(b)(2) of the CAA, a comment period of 30 days      after the publication of this notice of proposed rulemaking      is being provided before adoption of the rules.       All inquiries regarding this notice should be addressed to      Barbara J. Sapin, Executive Director of the Office of      Compliance, Room LA-200, 110 2nd Street, S.E., Washington, DC      20540; (202) 724-9250.           Sincerely,                                            Barbara L. Camens,                                  Chair of the Board of Directors,                                             Office of Compliance.  From the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance: Notice of      Proposed Rulemaking (``NPRM''), and Request for Comments From                           Interested Parties. REGULATIONS EXTENDING RIGHTS AND PROTECTIONS UNDER THE AMERICANS WITH       DISABILITIES ACT (``ADA'') RELATING TO PUBLIC SERVICES AND ACCOMMODATIONS, NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING, AS REQUIRED BY 2 U.S.C.   Sec. 1331, THE CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995, AS AMENDED                                (``CAA'').     Background:       The purpose of this Notice is to propose substantive      regulations that will implement Section 210 of the CAA, which      provides that the rights and protections against      discrimination in the provision of public services and      accommodation under Titles II and III of the ADA shall apply      to entities covered by the CAA.       What is the authority under the CAA for these proposed      substantive regulations?       Section 210(b) of the CAA provides that the rights and      protections against discrimination in the provision of public      services and accommodations established by the provisions of      Titles II and III (sections 201 through 230, 302, 303, and      309) of the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42      U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189      (``ADA'') shall apply to the following entities:       (1) each office of the Senate, including each office of a      Senator and each committee;       (2) each office of the House of Representatives, including      each office of a Member of the House of Representatives and      each committee;       (3) each joint committee of the Congress;       (4) the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services;       (5) the Capitol Police;       (6) the Congressional Budget Office;       (7) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including      the Botanic Garden);       (8) the Office of the Attending Physician; and       (9) the Office of Compliance.     2 U.S.C. 1331(b).       Title II of the ADA generally prohibits discrimination on      the basis of disability in the provision of services,      programs, or activities by any ``public entity''. Section      210(b)(2) of the CAA defines the term ''public entity'' for      Title II purposes as any entity listed above that provides      public services, programs, or activities. 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1331(b)(2).       Title III of the ADA generally prohibits discrimination on      the basis of disability by public accommodations and requires      places of public accommodation and commercial facilities to      be designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with      accessibility standards. Section 225(f) of the CAA provides      that, ``[e]xcept where inconsistent with definitions and      exemptions provided in this Act, the definitions and      exemptions of the [ADA] shall apply under this Act.'' 2      U.S.C. Sec. 1361(f)(1).       Section 210(f) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel      of the Office of Compliance on a regular basis, and at least      once each Congress, conduct periodic inspections of all      covered facilities and report to Congress on compliance with      disability access standards under section 210. 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1331(f).       Section 210(e) of the CAA requires the Board of Directors      of the Office of Compliance (``the Board'') established under      the CAA to issue regulations implementing the section. 2      U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e). Section 210(e) further states that such      regulations ``shall be the same as substantive regulations      promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of      Transportation to implement the statutory provisions referred      to in subsection (b) except to the extent that the Board may      determine, for good cause shown and stated together with the      regulation, that a modification of such regulations would be      more effective for the implementation of the rights and      protections under this section.'' Id. Section 210(e) further      provides that the regulations shall include a method of      identifying, for purposes of this section and for different      categories of violations of subsection (b), the entity      responsible for correction of a particular violation. 2      U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e).       Additional authority for proposing these regulations is      found in CAA Section 304, which sets forth the procedure to      be followed for the rulemaking process in general, including      notice and comment; Board consideration of comments and      adoption of regulations; transmittal to the Speaker and      President Pro Tempore for publication in the Congressional      Record; and approval by the Congress.       Are there ADA public access regulations already in force      under the CAA?       Yes. The CAA was enacted on January 23, 1995. It applied to      the legislative branch of the federal government the      protections of 12 (now 13) statutes that previously had      applied to the executive branch and/or the private sector,      including laws providing for family and medical leave,      prohibiting discrimination against eligible veterans, and      affording labor-management rights and responsibilities, among      others. The CAA established the Office of Compliance as an      independent agency to administer and enforce the CAA. The OOC      administers an administrative dispute resolution system to      resolve certain disputes arising under the Act. The General      Counsel of the OOC has independent investigatory and      enforcement authority for other violations of the Act,      including certain portions of the ADA, 42 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, & 12189.       As set forth in the previous answer, the CAA requires the      Board to issue regulations implementing the statutory      protections provided by the CAA. See, e.g., CAA Sections      202(d) (Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993), 206(c)      (Veterans' Employment and Reemployment), 212 (d) (Federal      Service Labor Management Relations Act). 2 U.S.C. sections      1312(d), 1316(c), 1351(d). The Board's regulations ``shall be      the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the      Attorney General and Secretary of Transportation . . . except      insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause shown and      stated together with the regulation, that a modification of      such regulations would be more effective for the      implementation of the rights and protections under this      section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e)(2).       The CAA does not simply apply to the legislative branch the      substantive protections of these laws, and direct that the      implementing regulations essentially mirror those of the      executive branch. The statute further provides that, while      the CAA rulemaking procedure is underway, the corresponding      executive branch regulations are to be applied. Section 411      of the Act provides:       ``Effect of failure to issue regulations.       In any proceeding under section 1405, 1406, 1407, or 1408      of this title . . . if the Board has not issued a regulation      on a matter for which this chapter requires a regulation to      be issued, the hearing officer, Board, or court, as the case      may be, shall apply, to the extent necessary and appropriate,      the most relevant substantive executive agency regulation      promulgated to implement the statutory provision at issue in      the proceeding.''       This statutory scheme makes plain that ADA public access      regulations are presently in force. First, regulations      virtually identical to these were adopted by the Board,      presented to the House of Representatives and the Senate on      September 19, 1996, and published on January 7, 1997. 142      Cong. Rec. S10984-11018 and 143 Cong. Rec. S30-66. No action      was taken and thus the regulations were not issued. As set      forth above, in these circumstances the CAA applies ``the      most relevant substantive executive agency regulations,''      i.e., the Departments of Justice (``DOJ'') and Department of      Transportation (``DOT'') ADA public access regulations. 2      U.S.C Sec. 1411.       A contrary interpretation would render meaningless several      sections of the CAA. For example, Congress directed the AOC      and other employing offices to conduct an initial study of      legislative branch facilities from January 23, 1995 through      December 31, 1996, ``to identify any violations of subsection      (b) of [section 210], to determine the costs of compliance,      and to take any necessary corrective action to abate any      violations.'' 2 U.S.C. section 1331(f)(3). Congress      instructed the OOC to assist the employing offices by      ``arranging for inspections and other technical assistance at      their request.'' Id. The CAA was enacted on January 23, 1995.      No implementing regulations could have taken effect as of      that date. Plainly, Congress intended the employing offices      and the OOC to look to the DOJ and DOT ADA public access      regulations, with which the CAA explicitly required employing      offices to comply, when conducting the initial study and      abatement actions.       Other sections of the CAA support this reading. For      example, the CAA requires the Board to exclude from labor      relations regulations employees of Member offices, Senate and      House Legislative Counsel, the Congressional Budget Office      and several other employing offices if the Board finds a      conflict of interest or appearance thereof. 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1351(e)(1)(B). Where, as here, a statute explicitly      provides for certain regulatory exemptions, it would be      illogical to interpret language that expressly provides      for regulatory compliance to mean anything else. When      Congress intended to exempt employing offices from      regulations, the CAA did so explicitly.       Why are these regulations being proposed at this time?       As set forth in the previous answer, the CAA requires      employing offices to comply with ADA public access      regulations issued by the DOJ and DOT pursuant to the ADA.      The CAA also requires the Board to issue its own regulations      implementing the ADA public     access provisions of the CAA. The statute obligates the      Board's regulations to be the same as the DOJ and DOT      regulations except to the extent that the Board may determine      that a modification would be more effective in implementing      ADA public access protections. CAA section 210(e)(2). These      proposed regulations will clarify that covered entities must      comply with the ADA public access provisions applied to      public entities and accommodations to implement Titles II and      III of the ADA. Congressional approval and Board issuance of      ADA public access under the CAA will also eliminate any      question as to the ADA public access protections that are      applicable in the legislative branch.       The Board adopted proposed regulations and presented them      to the House of Representatives and the Senate in 1996. The      regulations were published on January 7, 1997, during the      105th Congress. 142 Cong. Rec. S10984-11018 and 143 Cong.      Rec. S30-66. No Congressional action was taken and therefore      the regulations were not issued. The Board adopted the      present proposal, with updated proposed regulations, to      facilitate Congressional consideration of the ADA      regulations.       Which ADA public access regulations are applied to covered      entities in 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e)?        Section 210(e) of the CAA requires the Board to issue      regulations that are ``the same as substantive regulations      promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of      Transportation to implement the statutory provisions . . .      except to the extent that the Board may determine, for good      cause shown and stated together with the regulation, that a      modification of such regulations would be more effective for      the implementation of the rights and protections under this      section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e).       Consistent with its prior decisions on this issue, the      Board has determined that all regulations promulgated after a      notice and comment by the DOJ and/or the DOT to implement the      provisions of Title II and Title III of the ADA applied by      section 210(b) of the CAA are ``substantive regulations''      within the meaning of section 210(e). See, e.g., 142 Cong.      Rec. S5070, S5071-72 (daily ed. May 15, 1996) (NPRM      implementing section 220(d) regulations); 141 Cong. Rec.      S17605 (daily ed. Nov. 28, 1995) (NPRM implementing section      203 regulations).       See also Reves v. Ernst & Young, 494 U.S. 56, 64 (1993)      (where same phrase or term is used in two different places in      the same statute, it is reasonable for court to give each use      a similar construction); Sorenson v. Secretary of the      Treasury, 475 U.S. 851, 860 (1986) (normal rule of statutory      construction assumes that identical words in different parts      of the same act are intended to have the same meaning).       In this regard, the Board has reviewed the provisions of      section 210 of the CAA, the sections of the ADA applied by      that section, and the regulations of the DOJ and DOT, to      determine whether and to what extent those regulations are      substantive regulations which implement the provisions of      Title II and Title III of the ADA applied by section 210(b)      of the CAA. As explained more fully below, the Board proposes      to adopt the following otherwise applicable regulations of      the DOJ published at Parts 35 and 36 of Title 28 of the Code      of Federal Regulations (``CFR'') and those of the DOT      published at Parts 37 and 38 of Title 49 of the CFR:       1. DOJ's regulations at Part 35 of Title 28 of the CFR: The      DOJ's regulations at Part 35 implement subtitle A of Title II      of the ADA (sections 201 through 205), the rights and      protections of which are applied to covered entities under      section 210(b) of the CAA. See 28 CFR Sec. 35.101 (Purpose).      Therefore, the Board determines that these regulations will      be adopted in the proposed regulations under section 210(e).       2. DOJ's regulations at Part 36 of Title 28 of the CFR: The      DOJ's regulations at Part 36 implement Title III of the ADA      (sections 301 through 309). See 28 CFR Sec. 36.101 (Purpose).      Section 210(b) only applies the rights and protections of      three sections of Title III with respect to public      accommodations: prohibitions against discrimination (section      302), provisions regarding new construction and alterations      (section 303), and provisions regarding examinations and      courses (section 309). Therefore, only those regulations in      Part 36 that are reasonably necessary to implement the      statutory provisions of sections 302, 303, and 309 will be      adopted by the Board under section 210(e) of the CAA.       3. DOT's regulations at Parts 37 and 38 of Title 49 of the      CFR: The DOT's regulations at Parts 37 and 38 implement the      transportation provisions of Title II and Title III of the      ADA. See 49 CFR Sec. Sec. 37.101 (Purpose) and 38.1      (Purpose). The provisions of Title II and Title III of the      ADA relating to transportation and applied to covered      entities by section 210(b) of the CAA are subtitle B of Title      II (sections 221 through 230) and certain portions of section      302 of Title III. Thus, those regulations of the Secretary      that are reasonably necessary to implement the statutory      provisions of sections 221 through 230, 302, and 303 of the      ADA will be adopted by the Board under section 210(e) of the      CAA.       The Board proposes not to adopt those regulatory provisions      of the regulations of the DOJ or DOT that have no conceivable      applicability to operations of entities within the      Legislative Branch or are unlikely to be invoked. See 141      Cong. Rec. at S17604 (daily ed. Nov. 28, 1995) (NPRM      implementing section 203 regulations). Unless public comments      demonstrate otherwise, the Board intends to include in the      adopted regulations a provision stating that the Board has      issued substantive regulations on all matters for which      section 210(e) requires a regulation. See section 411 of the      CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1411.       In addition, the Board has proposed to make technical      changes in definitions and nomenclature so that the      regulations comport with the CAA and the organizational      structure of the Office of Compliance. In the Board's      judgment, making such changes satisfies the CAA's ``good      cause'' requirement. With the exception of these technical      and nomenclature changes and additional proposed regulations      relating to the investigation and inspection authority      granted to the General Counsel under the CAA, the Board does      not propose substantial departure from otherwise applicable      regulations.       The Board notes that the General Counsel applied the above-     referenced standards of Parts 35 and 36 of the DOJ's      regulations and Parts 37 and 38 of the DOT's regulations      during the past inspections of Legislative Branch facilities      pursuant to section 210(f) of the CAA. In contrast to other      sections of the CAA, which generally give the Office of      Compliance only adjudicatory and regulatory responsibilities,      the General Counsel has the authority to investigate and      prosecute alleged violations of disability standards under      section 210, as well as the responsibility for inspecting      covered facilities to ensure compliance. According to the      General Counsel's final inspection reports, the Title II and      Title III regulations encompass the following requirements:       1. Program accessibility: This standard is applied to      ensure physical access to public programs, services, or      activities. Under this standard, covered entities must modify      policies, practices, and procedures to ensure an equal      opportunity for individuals with disabilities. If policy and      procedural modifications are ineffective, then structural      modifications may be required.       2. Effective communication: This standard requires covered      entities to make sure that their communications with      individuals with disabilities (such as in the context of      constituent meetings and committee hearings) are as effective      as their communications with others. Covered entities are      required to make information available in alternate formats      such as large print, Braille, or audio tape, or use methods      that provide individuals with disabilities the opportunity to      effectively communicate, such as sign language interpreters      or the use of pen and paper. Primary consideration must be      given to the method preferred by the individual.       3. ADA Standards for Accessible Design: These standards are      applied to architectural barriers, including structural      barriers to communication, such as telephone booths, to      ensure that existing facilities, new construction, and new      alterations, are accessible to individuals with disabilities.       The Board recognizes that, as with other obligations under      the CAA, covered entities will need information and guidance      regarding compliance with these ADA standards as adopted in      these proposed regulations, which the Office will provide as      part of its education and information activities.       How do these regulations differ from those proposed by the      Board on January 7, 1997?       These regulations are very similar to those proposed by the      Board in 1997; however, there are three significant      differences:       1. These regulations have been updated to incorporate the      changes made in the DOJ and DOT regulations since 1997. One      of the most significant changes made by the DOJ occurred on      September 15, 2010 when the DOJ published regulations      adopting the 2010 Standards for Accessible Design (``2010      Standards''). The 2010 Standards became fully effective on      March 15, 2012 and replaced the 1991 Standards for Accessible      Design (``1991 Standards'') that were referenced in the      regulations proposed by the Board in 1997. These regulations      incorporate by reference the pertinent DOJ and DOT      regulations that are in effect as of the date of the      publication of this notice, which means that the 2010      Standards will be applied. The Board has also changed the      format of the incorporated regulations. Rather than      reprinting each of the regulations with minor changes to      reflect different nomenclature used in the CAA (i.e.,      changing references to ``Assistant Attorney General,''      ``Department of Justice,'' ``FTA Administrator,'' ``FTA      regional office,'' ``Administrator,'' and ``Secretary'' to      ``General Counsel''), these regulations contain a      definitional section in Sec. 1.105(a) which make these      changes and incorporates the DOJ and DOT regulations by      reference.       2. Unlike the Board in 1997, the current Board has decided      not to propose adoption of the DOJ Title II regulation      relating to employment discrimination, 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.140.      The Board notes that since 1997 most courts considering this      issue have decided that employees of public entities must use      the procedures in Title I of the ADA to pursue employment      discrimination claims and that these claims cannot be pursued      under Title II. See, e.g., Brumfield v. City of Chicago, 735      F.3d 619 (7th Cir. 2013); Elwell v. Okla. ex rel. Bd. of      Regents of the Univ. of Okla., 693 F.3d 1303 (10th Cir.      2012); Zimmerman v. Or. Dep't of Justice, 170 F.3d 1169 (9th      Cir. 1999). The prohibition against employment discrimination      because of disability in Title I of the ADA is incorporated      into section 201(a)(3) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1311(a)(3).      Under section 210(c) of the CAA, ``with respect to any claim      of employment discrimination asserted by any covered      employee, the exclusive remedy shall be under section 1311 of      this title.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(c). Similarly, under section      225(e) of the CAA, ``[o]nly a covered entity     who has undertaken and completed the procedures in sections      1402 and 1403 of this title may be granted a remedy under      part A of this subchapter.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1361(e). When      taken together, these sections of the CAA make it clear that      the exclusive method for obtaining relief for employment      discrimination because of disability is under section 201,      which involves using the counseling and mediation procedures      contained in sections 402 and 403 of the CAA. For these      reasons, the Board has found good cause not to incorporate      the DOJ Title II regulation relating to employment      discrimination, 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.140, into these      regulations.       3. In Parts 2 and 3 of these regulations, the Board has      proposed regulations relating to the two unique statutory      duties imposed by the CAA upon the General Counsel of the      Office of Compliance that are not imposed upon the DOJ and      DOT: (1) the investigation and prosecution of charges of      discrimination using the Office's mediation and hearing      processes (section 210(d) of the CAA) and (2) the biennial      inspection and reporting obligations (section 210(f) of the      CAA). Parts 2 and 3 of these regulations were not contained      in the regulations proposed in 1997; however, the Board has      determined that there is good cause to propose these      regulations to fully implement section 210 of the CAA. See, 2      U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e)(1). In formulating the substance of these      regulations, the Board has directed the Office's statutory      employees to consult with stakeholders and has considered      their comments and suggestions.       The Board has also reviewed the biennial ADA reports from      the General Counsel and considered what the General Counsel      has learned since 1995 while investigating charges of      discrimination and conducting and reporting upon ADA      inspections. Of particular note is the regulation proposed as      Sec. 3.103(d) which addresses concerns raised by oversight      and appropriations staff over finding a cost-efficient      process that would allow better identification and      elimination of potential ADA compliance issues during the      pre-construction phases of new construction and alteration      projects.     Procedural Summary:       How are substantive regulations proposed and approved under      the CAA?        Pursuant to Section 304 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384, the      procedure for proposing and approving such substantive      regulations provides that:       (1) the Board of Directors propose substantive regulations      and publish a general notice of proposed rulemaking in the      Congressional Record;       (2) there be a comment period of at least 30 days after the      date of publication of the general notice of proposed      rulemaking;       (3) after consideration of comments by the Board of      Directors, the Board adopt regulations and transmit notice of      such action (together with the regulations and a      recommendation regarding the method for Congressional      approval of the regulations) to the Speaker of the House and      President [P]ro [T]empore of the Senate for publication in      the Congressional Record;       (4) there be committee referral and action on the proposed      regulations by resolution in each House, concurrent      resolution, or by joint resolution; and       (5) final publication of the approved regulations in the      Congressional Record, with an effective date prescribed in      the final publication.       For more detail, please reference the text of 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1384. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is step (1) of      the outline set forth above.       Are these proposed regulations also recommended by the      Office of Compliance's Executive Director, the Deputy      Executive Director for the Senate, and the Deputy Executive      Director for the House of Representatives?        As required by Section 304(b)(1) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1384(b)(1), the substance of these regulations is also      recommended by the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive      Director for the Senate and the Deputy Executive Director for      the House of Representatives.       Has the Board of Directors previously proposed substantive      regulations implementing the ADA public access provisions      pursuant to 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331?       Yes. Proposed regulations were previously adopted by the      Board and presented to the House of Representatives and the      Senate on September 19, 1996. The regulations were published      on January 7, 1997. 142 Cong. Rec. S10984-11018 and 143 Cong.      Rec. S30-66. No Congressional action was taken on these      regulations.       What is the approach taken by these proposed substantive      regulations?       The Board will follow the procedure as enumerated above and      as required by statute. The Board will review any comments      received under step (2) of the outline above, and respond to      the comments and make any changes necessary to ensure that      the regulations fully implement section 210 of the CAA and      reflect the practices and policies particular to the      legislative branch.       What responsibilities would covered entities have in      effectively implementing these regulations?       The CAA charges covered entities with the responsibility to      comply with these regulations. CAA Sec. 210, 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1331.       Are there substantive differences in the proposed      regulations for the House of Representatives, the Senate, and      the other employing offices?       No. The Board of Directors has identified no ``good cause''      for proposing different regulations for these entities and      accordingly has not done so. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e)(2).       Are these proposed substantive regulations available to      persons with disabilities in an alternate format?       This Notice of Proposed Regulations is available on the      OOC's web site, www.compliance.gov, which is compliant with      Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 as amended, 29      U.S.C.

Copies of submitted comments will be available for      review on the Office's web site at www.compliance.gov, and at      the Office of Compliance, 110 Second Street, S.E.,      Washington, D.C. 20540-1999, on Monday through Friday (non-     Federal holidays) between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 4:30      p.m.     Summary:       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, PL 104-1, was      enacted into law on January 23, 1995. The CAA, as amended,      applies the rights and protections of thirteen federal labor      and employment statutes to covered employees and employing      offices within the legislative branch of the federal      government. Section 210 of the CAA applies that the rights      and protections against discrimination in the provision of      public services and accommodations established by of Titles      II and III (sections 201 through 230, 302, 303, and 309) of      the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.      Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189 (``ADA'') shall      apply to Legislative Branch entities covered by the CAA. The      above provisions of section 210 became effective on January      1, 1997. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(h).       The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance is now      publishing proposed regulations to implement Section 210 of      the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (``CAA''), 2      U.S.C. Sec. 1301-1438, as applied to covered entities of the      House of Representatives, the Senate, and certain      Congressional instrumentalities listed below.       In addition to inviting comment in this Notice, the Board,      through the statutory appointees of the Office, sought      consultation with the stakeholders regarding the development      of these regulations. The Board also notes that the General      Counsel of the Office of Compliance has completed inspections      of covered facilities for compliance with disability access      standards under section 210 of the CAA during each Congress      since the CAA was enacted and has submitted reports to      Congress after each of these inspections. Based on      information gleaned from these consultations and the      experience gained from the General Counsel's inspections, the      Board is publishing these proposed regulations, pursuant to      section 210(e) of the CAA, 2 Sec. 1331(e).       The purpose of these regulations is to implement section      210 of the CAA. In this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking      (``NPRM'' or ``Notice'') the Board proposes that virtually      identical regulations be adopted for the Senate, the House of      Representatives, and the seven Congressional      instrumentalities. Accordingly:       (1) Senate. It is proposed that regulations as described in      this Notice be included in the body of regulations that shall      apply to entities within the Senate, and this proposal      regarding the Senate entities is recommended by the Office of      Compliance's Deputy Executive Director for the Senate.       (2) House of Representatives. It is further proposed that      regulations as described in this Notice be included in the      body of regulations that shall apply to entities within the      House of Representatives, and this proposal regarding the      House of Representatives entities is recommended by the      Office of Compliance's Deputy Executive Director for the      House of Representatives.       (3) Certain Congressional instrumentalities. It is further      proposed that regulations as described in this Notice be      included in the body of regulations that shall apply to the      Office of Congressional Accessibility Services, the Capitol      Police, the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of the      Architect of the Capitol (including the Botanic Garden), the      Office of the Attending Physician, and the Office of      Compliance; and this proposal regarding these six      Congressional instrumentalities is recommended by the Office      of Compliance's Executive Director.       Dates: Comments are due within 30 days after the date of      publication of this Notice in the Congressional Record.     Supplementary Information:       The regulations set forth below (Parts 1, 2, and 3) are the      substantive regulations that the Board of Directors of the      Office of Compliance are proposing pursuant to section 210(e)      of the CAA. Part 1 contains the general provisions applicable      to all regulations under section 210, the method of      identifying entities responsible for correcting a violation      of section 210, and the list of executive branch regulations      incorporated by reference which define and clarify the      prohibition against discrimination on the basis of disability      in the provision of public services and accommodations. Part      2 contains the provisions pertaining to investigation and      prosecution of charges of discrimination. Part 3 contains the      provisions regarding the periodic inspections and reports to      Congress on compliance with the disability access standards.      These three parts correspond to the three general duties      imposed upon the Office of Compliance by section 210 which      are as follows:       1. Under section 210(e) of the CAA, the Board of Directors      of the Office of Compliance must promulgate substantive      regulations which implement the rights and protections      provided by section 210. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e)(1).       2. Under Section 210(d) of the CAA, the General Counsel of      the Office of Compliance must receive and investigate charges      of discrimination alleging violations of the rights and      protections provided by Titles II and III of the ADA, may      request mediation of such charges upon believing that a      violation may have occurred, and, if mediation has not      succeeded in resolving the dispute, may file a complaint and      prosecute the complaint through the Office of Compliance's      hearing and review process 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d).       3. Under section 210(f) of the CAA, the General Counsel of      the Office of Compliance on a regular basis, and at least      once each Congress, must conduct periodic inspections of all      covered facilities and report to Congress on compliance with      disability access standards under section 210. 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1331(f).       Regulations proposed in Part 1.       Sec. 1.101 Purpose and scope. This section references and      cites the sections of Title II and III of the ADA      incorporated by reference into the CAA, follows the statutory      language of the CAA to identify the covered entities and the      statutory duties of the General Counsel of the Office of      Compliance and describes how the regulations are organized.       Sec. 1.102 Definitions. This section describes the      abbreviations that are used throughout the regulations.       Sec. 1.103 Authority of the Board. This section describes      the authority of the Board of Directors of the Office of      Compliance to issue regulations under section 210 of the CAA      and the intended effect of the technical and nomenclature      changes made to the regulations promulgated by the Attorney      General and Secretary of Transportation.       Sec. 1.104 Method for identifying the entity responsible      for correcting violations of section 210. The regulation in      this section is required by section 210(e)(3) of the CAA.      This regulation hues very closely to the DOJ Title III      regulation set forth in 28 C.F.R. Sec. 36.201 which in turn      is based on the statutory language in 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12182(a)      (one of the ADA statutory sections incorporated by reference      in section 210(b) of the CAA). Under section 302 of the ADA,      owners, operators, lessors and lessees are all jointly and      severally liable for ADA violations. See, e.g., Botosan v.      McNally Realty, 216 F.3d 827, 832 (9th Cir. 2000). The      proposed regulation allows consideration of relevant      statutes, contracts, orders, and other enforceable      arrangements or relationships to allocate responsibility. The      term ``enforceable arrangement'' is used intentionally since      certain indemnification and contribution contracts allocating      liability under the ADA have been found to be unenforceable.      See, e.g., Equal Rights Center v. Archstone-Smith Trust, 602      F.3d 597 (4th Cir. 2010, cert denied, 131 S. Ct. 504 (2010).      Although the concepts of ``ownership'' or ``leasing'' do not      appear to apply to Legislative Branch facilities on Capitol      Hill, the Architect of the Capitol does have statutory      superintendence responsibility for certain legislative branch      buildings and facilities, including the Capitol Building,      which includes duties and responsibilities analogous to those      of a ``landlord''. See 40 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 163-166 (Capitol      Building), 167-175 and 185a (House and Senate office      buildings), 193a (Capitol grounds), 216b (Botanical Garden)      and 2 U.S.C. Sec. 141(a)(1) (Library of Congress buildings).      The Board believes that, where two or more entities may have      compliance obligations under section 210(b) as ``responsible      entities'' under the proposed regulations, those entities      should have the ability to allocate responsibility by      agreement similar to the case of landlords and tenants with      respect to public accommodations under Title III of the ADA.      Thus, the proposed regulations adopt such provisions modeled      after section 36.201(b) of the DOJ regulations. However, by      promulgating this provision, the Board does not intend any      substantive change in the statutory responsibility of      entities under section 210(b) or the applicable substantive      rights and protections of the ADA applied thereunder. See 142      Cong. Rec. at S270 (final rule under section 205 of the CAA      substitutes the term ``privatization'' for ``sale of      business'' in the Secretary of Labor's regulations under the      Worker Adjustment Retraining and Notification Act).       Sec. 1.105 Regulations incorporated by reference. As      explained above, consistent with its prior decisions on this      issue, the Board has determined that all regulations      promulgated after a notice and comment by the DOJ and/or the      DOT to implement the provisions of Title II and Title III of      the ADA applied by section 210(b) of the CAA are      ``substantive regulations'' within the meaning of section      210(e). See, e.g., 142 Cong. Rec. S5070, S5071-72 (daily ed.      May 15, 1996) (NPRM implementing section 220(d) regulations);      141 Cong. Rec. S17605 (daily ed. Nov. 28, 1995) (NPRM      implementing section 203 regulations). In this regard, the      Board has reviewed the provisions of section 210 of the CAA,      the sections of the ADA applied by that section, and the      regulations of the DOJ and DOT, to determine whether and to      what extent those regulations are substantive regulations      which implement the provisions of Title II and Title III of      the ADA applied by section 210(b) of the CAA.       In section 1.105(a)(1), the Board has modified the      nomenclature used in the incorporated regulations to comport      with the CAA and the organizational structure of the Office      of Compliance. In the Board's judgment, making such changes      satisfies the CAA's ``good cause'' requirement. With the      exception of these technical and nomenclature changes and      additional proposed regulations relating to the investigation      and inspection authority granted to the General Counsel under      the CAA, the Board does not propose substantial departure      from otherwise applicable regulations. The dates referenced      in section 1.105(a)(2) reflect that the ADA public access      provisions of the CAA became effective on January 1, 1997      rather than effective date of the ADA which was January 26,      1992. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(h). The three year provision in      section 1.105(a)(3) was developed after consultation with the      Office of the Architect of the Capitol regarding what would      be a reasonable time frame for implementing these provisions      of the regulations. In several portions of DOJ and DOT      regulations, references are made to dates such as the      effective date of the regulations or effective dates derived      from the statutory provisions of the ADA. The Board proposes      to substitute dates which correspond to analogous periods for      the purposes of the CAA. In this way covered entities under      section 210 may have the same time to come into compliance      relative to the effective date of section 210 of the CAA      afforded public entities subject to Title II of the ADA. In      the Board's judgment, such changes satisfy the CAA's ``good      cause'' requirement. In section 1.105(a)(4), which was also      developed based upon consultations with the Office of the      Architect of the Capitol (``AOC''), the Board modified the      exception for ``historic'' property to include properties,      buildings, or facilities designated as an historic or      heritage assets by the AOC. This was necessary because the      DOJ regulations limit the definition of historic properties      to those ``listed or eligible for listing in the National      Register of Historic Places or properties designated as      historic under State or local law'' 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.104.      While there are certainly properties on Capitol Hill which      have historically significant features that are worthy of      preservation, these properties are not eligible for listing      on the National Register of Historic Places or considered      historic under State of local law. See, Historic Preservation      Act of 1966, 16 U.S.C. 470g (exempting the White House and      its grounds, the Supreme Court building and its grounds, and      the United States Capitol and its related buildings and      grounds from the provisions of the Historic Preservation      Act).       In section 1.105(b), the Board has adopted a rule of      interpretation to cover the few instances where there are      differences between regulations implementing Title II and      Title III of the ADA. The CAA is unique in that it applies      both Title II and Title III provisions to covered public      entities. The public accommodation provisions of Title III of      the ADA are otherwise only applicable to private entities.      See, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 12181(7). This section of the regulation      reflects the Board's determination that Congress applied      provisions of both Title II and Title III of the ADA to      legislative branch entities to ensure that individuals with      disabilities are provided the most access to public services,      programs, activities and accommodations provided by law.       In section 1.105(c), the Board has listed the specific DOJ      regulations incorporated into the regulations being issued      under section 210 of the CAA. As noted earlier, the Board has      adopted all of the DOJ regulations implementing Titles II and      III of the ADA with the following exceptions:       1. The Board is not incorporating the DOJ regulations      regarding retaliation or coercion (28 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 35.134      & 36.206). Sections 35.134 and 36.206 of the DOJ's      regulations implement section 503 of the ADA, which prohibits      retaliation against any individual who exercises his or her      rights under the ADA. 28 CFR pt. 35, App. A at 464 & pt. 36,      App. B at 598 (section-by-section analysis). Sections 35.134      and 36.206 are not provisions which implement a right or      protection applied to covered entities under section 210(b)      of the CAA and, therefore, they will not be included within      the adopted regulations. The Board notes, however, that      section 207 of the CAA provides a comprehensive retaliation      protection for employees (including applicants and former      employees) who may invoke their rights under section 210,      although section 207 does not apply to nonemployees who may      enjoy rights and protections against discrimination under      section 210.       2. As noted above, unlike the Board in 1997, the current      Board has decided not to propose adoption of the DOJ Title II      regulation relating to employment discrimination, 28 C.F.R.      Sec. 35.140. The Board notes that since 1997 most courts      considering this issue have decided that employees of public      entities must use the procedures in Title I of the ADA to      pursue employment discrimination claims and that these claims      cannot be pursued under Title II. See, e.g., Brumfield v.      City of Chicago, 735 F.3d 619 (7th Cir. 2013); Elwell v.      Okla. ex rel. Bd. of Regents of the Univ. of Okla., 693 F.3d      1303 (10th Cir. 2012); Zimmerman v. Or. Dep't of Justice, 170      F.3d 1169 (9th Cir. 1999). The prohibition against employment      discrimination because of disability in Title I of the ADA is      incorporated into section 201(a)(3) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1311(a)(3). Under section 210(c) of the CAA, ``with      respect to any claim of employment discrimination asserted by      any covered employee, the exclusive remedy shall be under      section 1311 of this title.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(c).      Similarly, under section 225(e) of the CAA, ``[o]nly a      covered entity who has undertaken and completed the      procedures in sections 1402 and 1403 of this title may be      granted a remedy under part A of this subchapter.'' 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1361(e). When taken together, these sections of the CAA      make it clear that the exclusive method for obtaining relief      for employment discrimination because of disability is under      section 201, which involves using the counseling and      mediation procedures contained in sections 402 and 403 of the      CAA. For these reasons, the Board has found good cause not to      incorporate the DOJ Title II regulation relating to      employment discrimination, 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.140, into these      regulations.       3. The Board has not incorporated Subpart F of the DOJ's      regulations (28 C.F.R. Sec. Sec. 35.170-35.189), which set      forth administrative enforcement procedures under Title II.      Subpart F implements the provisions of section 203 of the      ADA, which is applied to covered entities under section 210      of the CAA. Although procedural in nature, such provisions      address the remedies, procedures, and rights under section      203 of the ADA, and thus the otherwise applicable provisions      of these regulations are ``substantive regulations'' for      section 210(e) purposes. See 142 Cong. Rec. at S5071-72      (similar analysis under section 220(d) of the CAA). However,      since section 303 of the CAA reserves to the Executive      Director the authority to promulgate regulations that      ``govern the procedures of the Office,'' and since the Board      believes that the benefit of having one set of procedural      rules provides the ``good cause'' for modifying the DOJ's      regulations, the Board proposes to incorporate the provisions      of Subpart F into the Office's procedural rules, to omit      provisions that set forth procedures which conflict with      express provisions of section 210 of the CAA or are already      provided for under comparable provisions of the Office s      rules, and to omit rules with no applicability to the      Legislative Branch (such as provisions covering entities      subject to section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, provisions      regarding State immunity, and provisions regarding referral      of complaints to the Justice Department). See 142 Cong. Rec.      at S5071-72 (similar analysis and conclusion under section      220(d) of the CAA).       4. The Board has not incorporated Subpart G of the DOJ's      regulations, which designates the Federal agencies      responsible for investigating complaints under Title II of      the ADA. Given the structure of the CAA, such provisions are      not applicable to covered Legislative Branch entities and,      therefore, will not be adopted under section 210(e).       5. The Board has not incorporated the insurance provisions      contained in 28 C.F.R. Sec. 36.212. Section 36.212 of the      DOJ's regulations restates section 501(c) of the ADA, which      provides that the ADA shall not be construed to restrict      certain insurance practices on the part of insurance      companies and employers, so long as such practices are not      used to evade the purposes of the ADA. Section 501(c) of the      ADA is not incorporated by reference into section 210 of the      CAA. Because section 36.212 implements a section of the ADA      which is not incorporated into the CAA and appears intended      primarily to cover insurance companies which are not covered      entities under the CAA, the Board finds good cause not to      incorporate this regulation.       6. The Board has not incorporated Subpart E of the DOJ's      regulations (sections 36.501 through 36.599) setting forth      the enforcement procedures under Title III of the ADA. As the      Justice Department noted in its NPRM regarding subpart E, the      Department of Justice does not have the authority to      establish procedures for judicial review and enforcement and,      therefore, ``Subpart E generally restates the statutory      procedures for enforcement''. 28 CFR pt. 36, App. B at 638      (section-by-section analysis). Additionally, the regulations      derive from the provisions of section 308 of the ADA, which      is not applied to covered entities under section 210(b) of      the CAA. Thus, the regulations in subpart E are not      promulgated by the Attorney General as substantive      regulations to implement the statutory provisions of the ADA      referred to in section 210(b), within the meaning of section      210(e).       7. The Board has not incorporated Subpart F of the DOJ's      regulations which establishes procedures to implement section      308(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the ADA regarding compliance with State      laws or building codes as evidence of compliance with      accessibility standards under the ADA. 28 CFR pt. 36, App. B      at 640 (section-by-section analysis). Section 308 is not one      of the laws applied to covered entities under section 210(b)      of the CAA and, therefore, these regulations will not be      adopted under section 210(e).       In section 1.105(d), the Board has listed the specific DOT      regulations incorporated into the regulations being issued      under section 210 of the CAA. As noted earlier, the Board has      adopted all of the DOT regulations implementing Titles II and      III of the ADA with the following exceptions:       1. Although the Board has adopted the definitions in      section 37.3 of the DOT's regulations, relating to      implementation of Part II of Title II of the ADA (sections      241 through 246), those definitions dealing with public      transportation by intercity and commuter rail are not adopted      because sections 241 through 246 of the ADA were not within      the rights and protections applied to covered entities under      section 210(b) and, therefore, the regulations implementing      such sections are not substantive regulations of the DOT      required to be adopted by the Board within the meaning of      section 210(e). Accordingly, the Board will give no effect to      the definitions of terms such as ``commerce,'' ``commuter      authority,'' ``commuter rail car,'' ``commuter rail      transportation,'' ``intercity rail passenger car,'' and      ``intercity rail transportation,'' which relate to sections      241 through 246 of the ADA.       2. Although the Board has adopted the Nondiscrimination      regulation set forth in section 37.5 of the DOT's      regulations, subsection (f) of section 37.5 of the this      regulation relates to private entities primarily engaged in      the business of transporting people and whose operations      affect commerce. This subsection implements section 304 of      the ADA, which is not a right or protection applied to      covered entities under section 210(b) of the CAA. See 56 Fed.      Reg. 13856, 13858 (April 4, 1991) (preamble to NPRM regarding      Part 37). Therefore, it is not a regulation of the DOT      included within the scope of rulemaking under section 210(e)      of the CAA and will not be considered by the Board to be      included in these regulations.       3. Several portions of the DOT's regulations refer to      obligations of entities regulated by state agencies      administering federal transportation funds. See, e.g.,      sections 37.77(d) (requires filing of equivalent service      certificates with state administering agency), 37.135(f)      (submission of paratransit development plan to state      administering agency) and 37.145 (State comments on      paratransit plans). Any references to obligations not      imposed on covered entities, such as state law      requirements and laws regulating entities that receive      Federal financial assistance, will be considered excluded      from these proposed regulations.       4. The Board has not adopted section 37.11 of the DOT's      regulations relating to administrative enforcement because it      does not implement any provision of the ADA applied to      covered entities under section 210 of the CAA. Moreover, the      enforcement procedures of section 210 are explicitly provided      for in section 210(d) (``Available Procedures'').      Accordingly, this section will not be included within the      incorporated regulations. The subject matter of enforcement      procedures is addressed in the Office's procedural rules and      in Part 2 of these regulations.       5. Certain sections of Subparts B (Applicability) and C      (Transportation Facilities) of the Secretary's regulations      were promulgated to implement sections 242 and 304 of the      ADA, provisions that are not applied to covered entities      under section 210(b) of the CAA or are otherwise inapplicable      to Legislative Branch entities. Therefore, the Board will      exclude the following sections from its substantive      regulations on that basis: 37.21(a)(2) and (b) (relating to      private entities under section 304 of the ADA and private      entities receiving Federal assistance from the Transportation      Department), 37.25 (university transportation systems), 37.29      (private taxi services), 37.33 (airport transportation      systems), 37.37(a) and 37.37(e)-(g) (relating to coverage of      private entities and other entities under section 304 of the      ADA), and 37.49-37.57 (relating to intercity and commuter      rail systems). Similarly, the Board proposes modifying      sections 37.21(c), 37.37(d), and 37.37(h) and other sections      where references are made to requirements or circumstances      strictly encompassed by the provisions of section 304 of the      ADA and, therefore, not applicable to covered entities under      the CAA. See, e.g., sections 37.25-37.27 (transportation for      elementary and secondary education systems).       6. Subpart D (sections 37.71 through 37.95) of the DOT's      regulations relate to acquisition of accessible vehicles by      public entities. Certain sections of subpart D were      promulgated to implement sections 242 and 304 of the ADA,      which were not applied to covered entities under section      210(b) of the CAA, or are otherwise inapplicable to      Legislative Branch entities. Therefore, the Board will      exclude the following sections from its substantive      regulations on that basis: 37.87-37.91 and 37.93(b) (relating      to intercity and commuter rail service).       7. Subpart E (sections 37.101 through 37.109) of the DOT's      regulations relates to acquisition of accessible vehicles by      private entities. Section 37.101, relating to acquisition of      vehicles by private entities not primarily engaged in the      business of transporting people, implements section 302 of      the ADA, which is applied to covered entities under section      210(b). Therefore, the Board will adopt section 37.101 as      part of its section 210(e) regulations. Sections 37.103,      37.107, and 37.109 of the regulations implement section 304      of the ADA, which is inapplicable to covered entities under      the ADA. Therefore, the Board     proposes not to include them within its substantive      regulations under section 210(e) of the CAA.       8. Part 37 of the DOT's regulations includes several      appendices, only two of which the Board proposes to adopt as      part of these regulations. The Board proposes to adopt as an      appendix to these regulations Appendix A (Modifications to      Standards for Accessible Transportation Facilities, ADA      Accessibility Guidelines for Buildings and Facilities), which      provides guidance regarding the design, construction, and      alteration of buildings and facilities covered by Titles II      and III of the ADA. 49 CFR pt. 37, App. A. Such guidelines,      where not inconsistent with express provisions of the CAA or      of the regulations adopted by the Board, may be relied upon      by covered entities and other in proceedings under section      210 of the CAA to the same extent as similarly situated      persons may rely upon them in actions brought under Title II      and Title III of the ADA. See 142 Cong. Rec. at S222 and 141      Cong. Rec. at S17606 (similar resolution regarding Secretary      of Labor's interpretative bulletins under the Fair Labor      Standards Act for section 203 purposes). The Board proposes      not to adopt Appendix B, which gives the addresses of FTA      regional offices. Such information is not relevant to covered      entities under the CAA. The Board also proposes not to adopt      Appendix C, which contain forms for certification of      equivalent service. These forms appears to be irrelevant to      entities covered by the CAA and therefore will not be adopted      by the Board. Finally, the Board will adopt Appendix D to      Part 37, the section-by-section analysis of Part 37. The      Board notes that the section-by-section analysis may have      some relevance in interpreting the sections of Part 37 that      the Board has adopted.       9. The Board proposes to adopt, with minimal technical and      nomenclature changes, the regulations contained in Part 38      and accompanying appendix, with the exception of the      following subparts which the Board has determined implement      portions of the ADA not applied to covered entities under      section 210(b) of the CAA and/or the Board believe have no      conceivable applicability to legislative branch operations:      Subpart E, Commuter Rail Cars and Systems; and Subpart F,      Intercity Rail Cars and Systems.       In section 1.105(d), the Board has proposed the adoption of      one regulation promulgated by the Access Board, 36 C.F.R.      Sec. 1190.34, relating to the accessibility of leased      buildings and facilities. While the DOJ does not have a      regulation pertaining to leased buildings and facilities, the      Access Board has promulgated this regulation that sets      minimal accessible standards whenever the federal government      leases a building or facility (or a portion thereof).      Generally, this regulation requires that fully accessible      space be leased when available, but also sets some minimal      accessibility requirements when fully accessible spaces are      not available. These minimum requirements include at least      one accessible entrance, an accessible route to major      function areas, an accessible toilet, and accessible parking      (if that is included in the rent). If there is no space      available that meets even these minimal requirements, the      regulation does contain an exception that would permit the      short term leasing of spaces that do not even meet these      minimal standards. The most common ADA public access      complaint received by the General Counsel from members of the      public relates to the lack of ADA access to spaces being      leased by legislative branch offices. The Board therefore      finds good cause to clarify the ADA access obligations      regarding leased spaces by adopting 36 C.F.R. Sec. 1190.34.       Regulations proposed in Part 2.       Sec. 2.101 Purpose and scope. This section references and      notes that Part 2 of these regulations implements section      210(d) of the CAA which requires that the General Counsel      accept and investigate charges of discrimination filed by      qualified individuals with disabilities who allege a      violation of Title II or Title III of the ADA by a covered      entity. It also notes that by procedural rule or policy, the      General Counsel or the Office may further describe how the      General Counsel will exercise the statutory authority      provided by section 210(d) of the CAA. The Board notes that      the Executive Director is proposing amendments to the      Office's Procedural Rules that do include provisions relating      to section 210(d) of the CAA.       Sec. 2.102 Definitions. This section provides definitions      for the undefined terms used in section 210(d) of the CAA. In      Sec. 2.102(a), the term ``charge'' is defined in a manner      consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Fed. Express      Corp. v. Holowecki, 552 U.S. 389, 402 (2008). In      Sec. 2.102(b), the definition of the term ``file a charge''      clarifies how charges can be presented to the General Counsel      by listing the methods by which the General Counsel has      accepted charges in the past. In Sec. 2.102(c), the term      ``occurrence of the alleged violation'' is defined in a      manner that includes both isolated acts of discrimination and      continuing violations. See, e.g., Havens Realty Corp. v.      Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 380 (1982). In Sec. 2.102(d), the term      ``the rights and protections against discrimination in the      provision of public services and accommodations'' is defined      by referencing the specific sections of Titles II and III      that are incorporated into the CAA in section 210(b)(1). 2      U.S.C. Sec. 1331(b)(1).       Sec. 2.103 Investigatory Authority. This section explains      the investigatory methods that the General Counsel will use      when investigating charges of discrimination and clarifies      the duty of cooperation owed by all parties. The language      used to describe the investigatory methods listed in      Sec. 2.103(a) is derived from the Supreme Court's decision in      Dow Chemical Co. v. United States, 476 U.S. 227, 233 (1986)      which describes what is intended when an agency is granted      investigatory authority that is not otherwise defined in the      statute. The duty to cooperate with investigations described      in Sec. 2.103(b) is implicit in the CAA. By empowering the      General Counsel to investigate potential violations of the      the ADA, Congress expressed its expectation that legislative      branch employees and offices would cooperate fully with      investigations conducted by the General Counsel pursuant to      this authority. This regulation is consistent with prior      policy guidance the General Counsel has provided to covered      entities.       Sec. 2.104 Mediation. This section explains when the      General Counsel will request mediation of a charge of      discrimination. The language in Sec. 2.104(a) is derived from      section 210(d)(2) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d)(2). The      explanation of what happens when mediation results in a      settlement is contained in Sec. 2.104(b) and is consistent      with the language in section 210(d)(3) and with the General      Counsel's past practice of closing cases that are resolved      during mediation. The language in Sec. 2.104(c) is derived      from section 210(d)(3) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d)(3).       Sec. 2.105 Complaint. The language in this section is is      derived from section 210(d)(3) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1331(d)(3).       Sec. 2.106 Intervention by charging individual. The      language in this section is is derived from section 210(d)(3)      of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d)(3).       Sec. 2.107 Remedies and Compliance. This section describes      the remedies available and the compliance dates when a      violation of section 210 is found. The remedy language in      Sec. 2.107(a) is based upon the statutory language in section      210(c) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d)(3). The allowance of      attorney's fees and costs described in Sec. 2.107(a)(1) is      based upon the language in 28 C.F.R. Sec. 35.175 & 36.505      which recognize that attorney's fees may be awarded under      both Titles II and III of the ADA. The availability of      compensatory damages described in Sec. 2.107(a)(2) derives      from sections 210(c) and of the CAA which incorporates by      reference the remedies contained sections 203 and 308(a) of      the ADA. Section 203 of the ADA provides that the remedies      set forth in the Rehabilitation Act (at 29 U.S.C. Sec. 794a)      shall be the remedies for violations of Title II of the ADA.      The Supreme Court has made clear that the remedies available      under Title II of the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act are      ``coextensive with the remedies available in a private cause      of action brought under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of      1964'' which includes compensatory, but not punitive,      damages. Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. 181, 185 (2002). The      language in Sec. 2.107(a)(1) & (a)(2) requiring that payment      be made by the covered entity responsible for correcting the      violation is from section 415(c) of the CAA which requires      that funds to correct ADA violations ``may be paid only from      funds appropriated to the employing office or entity      responsible for correcting such violations.'' 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1415(c). The compliance date set forth in Sec. 2.107(b)      is from section 210(d)(5) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1331(d)(5).       Sec. 2.108 Judicial Review. This section is from section      210(d)(4) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d)(4).       Regulations proposed in Part 3.       Sec. 3.101 Purpose and scope. This section references and      notes that Part 3 of these regulations implements section      210(f) of the CAA which requires that the General Counsel, on      a regular basis, at least once each Congress, inspect the      facilities of covered entities to ensure compliance with the      Titles II and III of the ADA and to prepare and submit a      report to Congress containing the results of the periodic      inspections, describing any violations, assessing any      limitations in accessibility, and providing the estimated      cost and time needed for abatement. It also notes that by      procedural rule or policy, the General Counsel or the Office      may further describe how the General Counsel will exercise      the statutory authority provided by section 210(d) of the      CAA. The Board notes that the Executive Director is proposing      amendments to the Office's Procedural Rules that do include      provisions relating to section 210(f) of the CAA.       Sec. 3.102 Definitions. This section defines terms used in      section 210(f) of the CAA which are not defined in the      statute. In Sec. 3.102(a), the term ``facilities of covered      entities'' is defined. The term ``facility'' is defined in 28      C.F.R. Sec. 35.104, which is incorporated by reference into      these regulations. See Sec. 1.105(c). ``Facilities of covered      entities'' is defined to include all facilities where covered      entities provide public programs, activities, services or      accommodations, including those facilities designed,      maintained, altered or constructed by a covered entity.      Because the General Counsel's inspections under section      210(f) of the CAA are focused upon finding barriers to access      in facilities, the term ``violation'' is defined in      Sec. 3.102(b) as any barrier to access caused by      noncompliance with the applicable standards. The definition      of ``estimated cost and time needed for abatement'' was      developed in consultation with Office of the Architect of the      Capitol which proposed that reporting regarding estimated      abatement cost and time be provided using a range of dollar      amounts and dates due to the difficulty in precisely      estimating such costs and dates.       Sec. 3.103 Inspection authority. This section describes the      general scope of the General     Counsel's inspection authority [Sec. 3.103(a)] and recognizes      that the General Counsel has the right to review information      and documents [Sec. 3.103(b)], receive cooperation from      covered entities [Sec. 3.103(c)], and become involved in pre-     construction review of alteration and construction projects      [Sec. 3.103(d)].       The general scope of authority in Sec. 3.103(a) is derived      from the language in section 210(f)(1) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1331(f)(1). This subsection also describes the      discretion that the General Counsel has exercised when      conducting these inspections since the enactment of the CAA.       The document and information review described in      Sec. 3.103(b) recognizes that a thorough inspection of      facilities can require the review of documents and other      information to ascertain whether a covered entity is in      compliance with the ADA. The language in this subsection is      based upon prior policy guidance the General Counsel has      provided to covered entities.       The duty to cooperate with inspections described in      Sec. 3.103(c), like the duty to cooperate with investigations      described in Sec. 2.103(b), is implicit in the CAA. By      empowering the General Counsel to inspect all facilities for      potential violations of the the ADA, Congress expressed its      expectation that legislative branch employees and offices      would cooperate fully with such inspections conducted by the      General Counsel pursuant to this authority. This regulation      is consistent with prior policy guidance the General Counsel      has provided to covered entities.       The pre-construction review of alteration and construction      projects described in Sec. 3.103(d) was developed after      consultation with the Office of the Architect of the Capitol      and addresses concerns raised by oversight and appropriations      staff over finding a cost efficient process that would allow      better identification and elimination of potential ADA      compliance issues during the pre-construction phases of new      construction and alteration projects.       Sec. 3.104 Reporting, estimating cost & time and compliance      date. This section describes the reporting obligations of the      General Counsel set forth in section 210(f)(2) of the CAA. 2      U.S.C. Sec. 1331(f)(2). The language in Sec. 3.104(a) is      directly from section 210(f)(2) of the CAA. Subsection      3.104(b) merely recognizes that the General Counsel needs the      cooperation of covered entities to provide the cost and time      estimates for abatement required by section 210(f)(2). The      compliance date set forth in Sec. 3.104(c) is from section      210(d)(5) of the CAA. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(d)(5).

Enacted into law on January 23, 1995, the      Congressional Accountability Act (``CAA'') in Section 210(b)      provides that the rights and protections against      discrimination in the provision of public services and      accommodations established by the provisions of Title II and      III (Sections 201 through 230, 302, 303, and 309) of the      Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C.      Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189 (``ADA'')      shall apply to the following entities:       (1) each office of the Senate, including each office of a      Senator and each committee;       (2) each office of the House of Representatives, including      each office of a Member of the House of Representatives and      each committee;       (3) each joint committee of the Congress;       (4) the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services;       (5) the United States Capitol Police;       (6) the Congressional Budget Office;       (7) the Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including      the Botanic Garden);       (8) the Office of the Attending Physician; and       (9) the Office of Compliance;       Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis      of disability in the provision of public services, programs,      activities by any ``public entity.'' Section 210(b)(2) of the      CAA provides that for the purpose of applying Title II of the      ADA the term ``public entity'' means any entity listed above      that provides public services, programs, or activities. Title      III of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of      disability by public accommodations and requires places of      public accommodation and commercial facilities to be      designed, constructed, and altered in compliance with      accessibility standards. Section 225(f) of the CAA provides      that, ``[e]xcept where inconsistent with definitions and      exemptions provided in this Act, the definitions and      exemptions of the [ADA] shall apply under this Act.'' 2      U.S.C. Sec. 1361(f)(1).       Section 210(d) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel      of the Office of Compliance accept and investigate charges of      discrimination filed by qualified individuals with      disabilities who allege a violation of Title II or Title III      of the ADA by a covered entity. If the General Counsel      believes that a violation may have occurred, the General      Counsel may file with the Office a complaint against any      entity responsible for correcting the violation. 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1361(d).       Section 210(f) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel      of the Office of Compliance on a regular basis, and at least      once each Congress, conduct periodic inspections of all      covered facilities and to report to Congress on compliance      with disability access standards under Section 210. 2 U.S.C.      Sec. 1331(f).       (b) Purpose and scope of regulations. The regulations set      forth herein (Parts 1, 2, and 3) are the substantive      regulations that the Board of Directors of the Office of      Compliance has promulgated pursuant to Section 210(e) of the      CAA. Part 1 contains the general provisions applicable to all      regulations under Section 210, the method of identifying      entities responsible for correcting a violation of Section      210, and the list of executive branch regulations      incorporated by reference which define and clarify the      prohibition against discrimination on the basis of disability      in the provision of public services and accommodations. Part      2 contains the provisions pertaining to investigation and      prosecution of charges of discrimination. Part 3 contains the      provisions regarding the periodic inspections and reports to      Congress on compliance with the disability access standards.     Sec. 1.102 Definitions.       Except as otherwise specifically provided in these      regulations, as used in these regulations:       (a) Act or CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act      of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-1, 109 Stat. 3, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-     1438).       (b) ADA means the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990      (42 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 12131-12150, 12182, 12183, and 12189) as      applied to covered entities by Section 210 of the CAA.       (c) Covered entity and public entity include any of the      entities listed in Sec. 1.101(a) that provide public      services, programs, or activities, or operates a place of      public accommodation within the meaning of Section 210 of the      CAA. In the regulations implementing Title III, private      entity includes covered entities.       (d) Board means the Board of Directors of the Office of      Compliance.       (e) Office means the Office of Compliance.       (f) General Counsel means the General Counsel of the Office      of Compliance.       Sec. 1.103 Authority of the Board.       Pursuant to Sections 210 and 304 of the CAA, the Board is      authorized to issue regulations to implement the rights and      protections against discrimination on the basis of disability      in the provision of public services and accommodations under      the ADA. Section 210(e) of the CAA directs the Board to      promulgate regulations implementing Section 210 that are      ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the      Attorney General and the Secretary of Transportation to      implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection      (b) except to the extent that the Board may determine, for      good cause shown and stated together with the regulation,      that a modification of such regulations would be more      effective for the implementation of the rights and      protections under this section.'' 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e).      Specifically, it is the Board's considered judgment, based on      the information available to it at the time of promulgation      of these regulations, that, with the exception of the      regulations adopted and set forth herein, there are no other      ``substantive regulations promulgated by the Attorney General      and the Secretary of Transportation to implement the      statutory provisions referred to in subsection (b) [of      Section 210 of the CAA]'' that need be adopted.       In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made      certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations      as promulgated by the Attorney General and the Secretary of      Transportation. Such changes are intended to make the      provisions adopted accord more naturally to situations in the      Legislative Branch. However, by making these changes, the      Board does not intend a substantive difference between these      regulations and those of the Attorney General and/or the      Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such      changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute      an interpretation of the regulations or of the statutory      provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.     Sec. 1.104 Method for identifying the entity responsible for        correction of violations of section 210.       (a) Purpose and scope. Section 210(e)(3) of the CAA      provides that regulations under Section 210(e) include a      method of identifying, for purposes of this section and for      categories of violations of Section 210(b), the entity      responsible for correcting a particular violation. This      section sets forth the method for identifying responsible      entities for the purpose of allocating responsibility for      correcting violations of Section 210(b).       (b) Violations. A covered entity may violate Section 210(b)      if it discriminates against a qualified individual with a      disability within the meaning of Title II or Title III of the      ADA.       (c) Entities Responsible for Correcting Violations.      Correction of a violation of the rights and protections      against discrimination is the responsibility of the entities      listed in subsection (a) of Section 210 of the CAA that      provide the specific public service, program, activity, or      accommodation that forms the basis for the particular      violation of Title II or Title III rights and protections      and, when the violation involves a physical     access barrier, the entities responsible for designing,      maintaining, managing, altering or constructing the facility      in which the specific public service program, activity or      accommodation is conducted or provided.       (d) Allocation of Responsibility for Correction of Title II      and/or Title III Violations. Where more than one entity is      found to be an entity responsible for correction of a      violation of Title II and/or Title III rights and protections      under the method set forth in this section, as between those      parties, allocation of responsibility for correcting the      violations of Title II or Title III of the ADA may be      determined by statute, contract, order, or other enforceable      arrangement or relationship.     Sec. 1.105 Regulations incorporated by reference.       (a) Technical and Nomenclature Changes to Regulations      Incorporated by Reference. The definitions in the regulations      incorporated by reference (``incorporated regulations'')      shall be used to interpret these regulations except when they      differ from the definitions in Sec. 1.102 or the      modifications listed below, in which case the definition in      Sec. 1.102 or the modification listed below shall be used.      The incorporated regulations are hereby modified as follows:       (1) When the incorporated regulations refer to ``Assistant      Attorney General,'' ``Department of Justice,'' ``FTA      Administrator,'' ``FTA regional office,'' ``Administrator,''      ``Secretary,'' or any other executive branch office or      officer, ``General Counsel'' is hereby substituted.       (2) When the incorporated regulations refer to the date      ``January 26, 1992,'' the date ``January 1, 1997'' is hereby      substituted.       (3) When the incorporated regulations otherwise specify a      date by which some action must be completed, the date that is      three years from the effective date of these regulations is      hereby substituted.       (4) When the incorporated regulations contain an exception      for an ``historic'' property, building, or facility that      exception shall apply to properties, buildings, or facilities      designated as an historic or heritage asset by the Office of      the Architect of the Capitol in accordance with its      preservation policy and standards and where, in accordance      with its preservation policy and standards, the Office of the      Architect of the Capitol determines that compliance with the      requirements for accessible routes, entrances, or toilet      facilities would threaten or destroy the historic      significance of the building or facility, the exceptions for      alterations to qualified historic buildings or facilities for      that element shall be permitted to apply.       (b) Rule of Interpretation. When a covered entity is      subject to conflicting regulations implementing both Title II      and Title III of the ADA, the regulation providing the most      access shall apply.

Section 210(d) of the CAA requires that the General Counsel      accept and investigate charges of discrimination filed by      qualified individuals with disabilities who allege a      violation of Title II or Title III of the ADA by a covered      entity. Part 2 of these regulations contains the provisions      pertaining to investigation and prosecution of charges of      discrimination. By procedural rule or policy, the General      Counsel or the Office may further describe how the General      Counsel will exercise the statutory authority provided by      Section 210.     Sec. 2.102 Definitions.       (a) Charge means any written document from a qualified      individual with a disability or that individual's designated      representative which suggests or alleges that a covered      entity denied that individual the rights and protections      against discrimination in the provision of public services      and accommodations provided in Section 210(b)(1) of the CAA.       (b) File a charge means providing a charge to the General      Counsel in person, by mail, by electronic transmission, or by      any other means used by the General Counsel to receive      documents. Charges shall be filed within 180 days of the      occurrence of the alleged violation.       (c) The occurrence of the alleged violation means the later      of (1) the date on which the charging individual was      allegedly discriminated against; or (2) the last date on      which the service, activity, program or public accommodation      described by the charging party was operated in a way that      denied access in the manner alleged by the charging party.       (d) The rights and protections against discrimination in      the provision of public services and accommodations means all      of the rights and protections provided by Section 210(b)(1)      of the CAA through incorporation of Sections 201 through 230,      203, 303, and 309 of the ADA and by the regulations issued by      the Board to implement Section 210 of the CAA.     Sec. 2.103 Investigatory Authority.       (a) Investigatory Methods. When investigating charges of      discrimination and conducting inspections, the General      Counsel is authorized to use all the modes of inquiry and      investigation traditionally employed or useful to execute      this investigatory authority.

Sec. 2.104  Mediation.       (a) Belief that violation may have occurred. If, after      investigation, the General Counsel believes that a violation      of the ADA may have occurred and that mediation may be      helpful in resolving the dispute, prior to filing a      complaint, the General Counsel may request, but not      participate in, mediation under subsections (b) through (d)      of Section 403 of the CAA between the charging individual and      any entity responsible for correcting the alleged violation.       (b) Settlement. If, prior to the filing of a complaint, the      charging individual and the entity responsible for correcting      the violation reach a settlement agreement that fully      resolves the dispute, the General Counsel shall close the      investigation of the charge without taking further action.       (c) Mediation Unsuccessful. If mediation under (a) has not      succeeded in resolving the dispute, and if the General      Counsel believes that a violation of the ADA may have      occurred, the General Counsel may file with the Office a      complaint against any entity responsible for correcting the      violation.     Sec. 2.105  Complaint.       The complaint filed by the General Counsel shall be      submitted to a hearing officer for decision pursuant to      subsections (b) through (h) of Section 405 of the CAA.

Sec. 2.107  Remedies and Compliance.       (a) Remedy.

In any action commenced      pursuant to Section 210 of the CAA by the General Counsel,      when a charging individual has intervened, the hearing      officer and the Board, in their discretion, may allow the      prevailing charging individual a reasonable attorney's fee,      including litigation expenses, and costs, and the covered      entity responsible for correcting the violation shall pay      such fees, expenses and costs from its appropriated funds as      part of the funds to correct violations of Section 210 under      Section 415(c) of the CAA.       (2) Compensatory Damages. In any action commenced pursuant      to Section 210 of the CAA by the General Counsel, when a      charging individual has intervened, the hearing officer and      the Board, in their discretion, may award compensatory      damages to the prevailing charging individual, and the      covered entity responsible for correcting the violation shall      pay such compensatory damages from its appropriated funds as      part of the funds to correct violations of Section 210 under      Section 415(c) of the CAA.       (b) Compliance Date. Compliance shall take place as soon as      possible, but no later than the fiscal year following the end      of the fiscal year in which the order requiring correction      becomes final and not subject to further review.     Sec. 2.108  Judicial Review.       A charging individual who has intervened or any respondent      to the complaint, if aggrieved by a final decision of the      Board, may file a petition for review in the United States      Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, pursuant to Section      407 of the CAA.       PART 3--MATTERS PERTAINING TO PERIODIC INSPECTIONS AND      REPORTING.       Sec. 3.101  PURPOSE AND SCOPE       Sec. 3.102  DEFINITIONS       Sec. 3.103  INSPECTION AUTHORITY       Sec. 3.104  REPORTING, ESTIMATED COST & TIME AND COMPLIANCE     Sec. 3.101 Purpose and scope.       Section 210(f) of the CAA requires that the General      Counsel, on a regular basis, at least once each Congress,      inspect the facilities of covered entities to ensure      compliance with the Titles II and III of the ADA and to      prepare and submit a report to Congress containing the      results of the periodic inspections, describing any      violations, assessing any limitations in accessibility, and      providing the estimated cost and time needed for abatement.      Part 3 of these regulations contains the provisions      pertaining to these inspection and reporting duties. By      procedural rule or policy, the General Counsel or the Office      may further describe how the General Counsel will exercise      this statutory authority provided by Section 210.     Sec. 3.102 Definitions.       (a) The facilities of covered entities means all facilities      used to provide public programs, activities, services or      accommodations that are designed, maintained, altered or      constructed by a covered entity and all facilities where      covered entities provide public programs, activities,      services or accommodations.       (b) Violation means any barrier to access caused by      noncompliance with the applicable standards.       (c) Estimated cost and time needed for abatement means cost      and time estimates that can be reported as falling within a      range of dollar amounts and dates.     Sec. 3.103 Inspection authority.       (a) General scope of authority. On a regular basis, at      least once each Congress, the General Counsel shall inspect      the facilities of covered entities to ensure compliance with      the Titles II and III of the ADA. When conducting these      inspections, the General Counsel has the discretion to decide      which facilities will be inspected and how inspections will      be conducted. The General Counsel may receive requests for      ADA inspections, including anonymous requests, and conduct      inspections for compliance with Titles II and III of     the ADA in the same manner that the General Counsel receives      and investigates requests for inspections under Section      215(c)(1) of the CAA.       (b) Review of information and documents. When conducting      inspections under Section 210(f) of the CAA, the General      Counsel may request, obtain, and review any and all      information or documents deemed by the General Counsel to be      relevant to a determination of whether the covered entity is      in compliance with Section 210 of the CAA.       (c) Duty to cooperate. Covered entities shall cooperate      with any inspection conducted by the General Counsel in the      manner provided by Sec. 2.103(b).       (d) Pre-construction review of alteration and construction      projects. Any project involving alteration or new      construction of facilities of covered entities are subject to      inspection by the General Counsel for compliance with Titles      II and III of the ADA during the design, pre-construction,      construction, and post construction phases of the project.      The Office of the Architect of the Capitol shall, within one      year from the effective date of these regulations, develop a      process with the General Counsel to identify potential      barriers to access prior to the completion of alteration and      construction projects that may include the following      provisions:       (1) Design review or approval;       (2) Inspections of ongoing alteration and construction      projects;       (3) Training on the applicable ADA standards;       (4) Final inspections of completed projects for compliance;      and       (5) Any other provision that would likely reduce the number      of ADA barriers in alterations and new construction and the      costs associated with correcting them.     Sec. 3.104 Reporting, estimating cost & time and compliance        date.       (a) Reporting duty. On a regular basis, at least once each      Congress, the General Counsel shall prepare and submit a      report to Congress containing the results of the periodic      inspections conducted under Sec. 3.103(a), describing any      violations, assessing any limitations in accessibility, and      providing the estimated cost and time needed for abatement.       (b) Estimated cost & time. Covered entities shall cooperate      with the General Counsel by providing information needed to      provide the estimated cost and time needed for abatement in      the manner provided by Sec. 2.103(b).       (c) Compliance date. All barriers to access identified by      the General Counsel in its periodic reports shall be removed      or otherwise corrected as soon as possible, but no later than      the fiscal year following the end of the fiscal year in which      the report describing the barrier to access was issued by the      General Counsel.     Recommended Method of Approval:       The Board recommends that (1) the version of the proposed      regulations that shall apply to the Senate and entities and      facilities of the Senate be approved by the Senate by      resolution; (2) the version of the proposed regulations that      shall apply to the House of Representatives and entities and      facilities of the House of Representatives be approved by the      House of Representatives by resolution; and (3) the version      of the proposed regulations that shall apply to other covered      entities and facilities be approved by the Congress by      concurrent resolution.

Camens,       Chair of the Board, Office of Compliance.                                  ____                                                    U.S. Congress,                                         Office of Compliance,                                                   Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     President Pro Tempore of the Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: Section 303(a) of the Congressional      Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA), 2 U.S.C.

Having obtained the approval of the Board as required by      Section 303(b) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. I383(b), I am      transmitting the attached notice of proposed procedural      rulemaking to the President pro tempore of the Senate. I      request that this notice be published in the Senate section      of the Congressional Record on the first day on which both      Houses are in session following the receipt of this      transmittal. In compliance with Section 303(b) of the CAA, a      comment period of 30 days after the publication of this      notice of proposed rulemaking is being provided before      adoption of the rules.

Sincerely,                                             Barbara J. Sapin,                                               Executive Director,                                             Office of Compliance.       Attachment.  From the Executive Director of the Office of Compliance: Notice of      Proposed Rulemaking (``NPRM''), and Request for Comments From                           Interested Parties.   PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE RULES OF PROCEDURE, NOTICE OF PROPOSED    RULEMAKING, AS REQUIRED BY 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1383, THE CONGRESSIONAL            ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 1995, AS AMENDED (``CAA'').                         INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT       Shortly after the creation of the Office of Compliance      (Office) in 1995, Procedural Rules were adopted to govern the      processing of cases and controversies under the      administrative procedures established in subchapter IV of the      Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA) 2 U.S.C. 1401-     1407. The Rules of Procedure were amended in 1998 and again      in 2004. The existing Rules of Procedure are available in      their entirety on the Office of Compliance's web site:      www.compliance.gov. The web site is fully compliant with      section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C.      794d).       Pursuant to section 303(a) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1383(a)),      the Executive Director of the Office has obtained approval of      the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance regarding      certain amendments to the Rules of Procedure.       After obtaining the Board's approval, the Executive      Director must then ``publish a general notice of proposed      rulemaking . . . for publication in the Congressional Record      on the first day on which both Houses are in session      following such transmittal.'' (Section 303(b) of the CAA, 2      U.S.C. 1383(b)).                                 NOTICE       Comments regarding the proposed amendments to the Rules of      Procedure of the Office of Compliance set forth in this      NOTICE are invited for a period of thirty (30) days following      the date of the appearance of this NOTICE in the      Congressional Record. In addition to being posted on the      Office of Compliance's section 508 compliant web site      (www.compliance.gov), this NOTICE is also available in the      following alternative formats: Large Print, Braille.

Submission of comments must be made in writing to      the Executive Director, Office of Compliance, 110 Second      Street, S.E., Room LA-200, Washington, D.C. 20540-1999.

Copies of submitted comments will be available for review at      the Office of Compliance, 110 Second Street, S.E.,      Washington, D.C. 20540-1999, on Monday through Friday (non-     Federal holidays) between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 4:30      p.m.                       SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA), PL 104-     1, was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. The CAA applies      the rights and protections of 13 federal labor and employment      statutes to covered employees and employing offices within      the Legislative Branch of Government. Section 301 of the CAA      (2 U.S.C. 1381) establishes the Office of Compliance as an      independent office within that Branch. Section 303 (2 U.S.C.      1383) directs that the Executive Director, as the Chief      Operating Officer of the agency, adopt rules of procedure      governing the Office of Compliance, subject to approval by      the Board of Directors of the Office.       The rules of procedure establish the process by which      alleged violations of the 13 laws made applicable to the      Legislative Branch under the CAA will be considered and      resolved. Subpart A covers general provisions pertaining to      scope and policy, definitions, and information on various      filings and computation of time. Proposed Amendments to      Subpart A provide for electronic filing and clarify      requirements and procedures concerning confidentiality.      Subpart B provides procedures for counseling, mediation, and      election between filing an administrative complaint with the      Office of Compliance or filing a civil action in U.S.      District Court. A new Subpart C of the Procedural Rules sets      forth the proposed rules and procedures for enforcement of      the inspection, investigation and complaint sections 210(d)      and (f) of the CAA relating to Public Services and      Accommodations under Titles II and III of the Americans with      Disabilities Act (ADA). Subpart C has been reserved for these      rules since 1995. Because the Office of the General Counsel      conducts ADA inspections and investigates ADA charges using      procedures that are similar to what are used in its      Occupational, Safety and Health (OSH) inspections and      investigations conducted under section 215 of the CAA, the      procedural rules are similar to what are contained in Subpart      D of the Procedural Rules relating to OSH inspections and      investigations. The proposed Amendments to Subpart D clarify      potential ambiguities in the rules and procedures and make      modifications in terminology to better comport with the      statutory language used in Section 215 of the CAA. Subparts      E, F, and G include the process for the conduct of      administrative hearings held as the result of the     filing of an administrative complaint. Subpart H sets forth      the procedures for appeals of decisions by hearing officers      to the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance and for      appeals of decisions by the Board of Directors to the United      States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Proposed      Amendments to Subpart H also reference procedures for other      proceedings before the Board. Subpart I of the Rules contain      other matters of general applicability to the dispute      resolution process and to the operation of the Office of      Compliance, including proposed Amendments concerning      attorney's fees and violations of formal settlement      agreements.       These proposed amendments to the Rules of Procedure are the      result of the experience of the Office in processing disputes      under the CAA since the original adoption of these Rules in      1995. The proposed Amendments to Subpart D of the Procedural      Rules reflect the experience of the Office of General Counsel      in conducting OSH inspections and investigations since 1995.       EXPLANATION REGARDING THE TEXT OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS       Material from the 2004 version of the Rules is printed in      roman type. The text of the proposed amendments shows       deletions in italicized type within bold italics brackets       and added text in bold. Only subsections of the Rules that      include proposed amendments are reproduced in this NOTICE.      The insertion of a series of small dots (. . . . .) indicates      additional, unamended text within a section has not been      reproduced in this document. The insertion of a series of      asterisks (* * * * *) indicates that the unamended text of      entire sections of the Rules have not been reproduced in this      document. For the text of other portions of the Rules which      are not proposed to be amended, please access the Office of      Compliance web site at www.compliance.gov.

These rules of the Office of Compliance govern the      procedures for consideration and resolution of alleged      violations of the laws made applicable under Parts A, B, C,      and D of title II of the Congressional Accountability Act of      1995. The rules include definitions, procedures for      counseling, mediation, and for electing between filing a      complaint with the Office of Compliance and filing a civil      action in a district court of the United States under Part A      of title II. The rules also address the procedures for      compliance, investigation and enforcement under Part B of      title II, [variances] and for compliance, investigation,      [and] enforcement, and variance under Part C of title II. The      rules include [and] procedures for the conduct of hearings      held as a result of the filing of a complaint and for appeals      to the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance from      Hearing Officer decisions, as well as other matters of      general applicability to the dispute resolution process and      to the operations of the Office of Compliance.

See also      sections 1.06, 5.04, and 7.12 of these rules.       (b) Prohibition.

Moreover,      nothing in these rules prohibits a party or its      representative from disclosing information obtained in      confidential proceedings for the limited purposes of      investigating claims, ensuring compliance with the Act or      preparing its prosecution or defense, to the extent that such      disclosure is reasonably necessary to accomplish the      aforementioned purposes and provided that the party making      the disclosure takes all reasonably appropriate steps to      ensure that persons to whom the information is disclosed      maintain the confidentiality of such information.       (c) Participant. For the purposes of this rule, participant      means any individual or party, including a designated      representative, that becomes a participant in counseling      under section 402, mediation under section 403, the complaint      and hearing process under section 405, or an appeal to the      Board under section 406 of the Act, or any related proceeding      which is expressly or by necessity deemed confidential under      the Act or these rules.

A participant is free to disclose facts and other      information obtained from any source outside of the      confidential proceedings. For example, an employing office or      its representatives may disclose information about its      employment practices and personnel actions, provided that the      information was not obtained in a confidential proceeding.      However, an employee who obtains that information in      mediation or other confidential proceeding may not disclose      such information. Similarly, information forming the basis      for the allegation of a complaining employee may be disclosed      by that employee, provided that the information contained in      those allegations was not obtained in a confidential      proceeding. However, the employing office or its      representatives may not disclose that information if it was      obtained a confidential proceeding.        (e) Violation of Confidentiality. Any complaint regarding a      violation of the confidentiality provisions must be made to      the Executive Director no later than 30 days after the date      of the alleged violation. Such complaints may be referred by      the Executive Director to a Hearing Officer. The Hearing      Officer is also authorized to initiate proceedings on his or      her own initiative, or at the direction of the Board, if the      alleged violation occurred in the context of Board      proceedings. Upon a finding of a violation of the      confidentiality provisions, the Hearing Officer, after notice      and hearing, may impose an appropriate sanction, which may      include any of the sanctions listed in section 7.02 of these      rules, as well as any of the following:        (1) an order that the matters regarding which the violation      occurred or any other designated facts shall be taken to be      established against the violating party for the purposes of      the action in accordance with the claim of the other party;        (2) an order refusing to allow the violating party to      support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or      prohibiting him from introducing designated matters in      evidence;        (3) an order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or      staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or      dismissing with or without prejudice the action or      proceedings or any part thereof, or rendering a judgment by      default against the violating party;        (4) in lieu of any of the foregoing orders or in addition      thereto, the Hearing Officer shall require the party      violating the confidentiality provisions or the      representative advising him, or both, to pay, at such time as      ordered by the Hearing Officer, the reasonable expenses,      including attorney fees, caused by the violation, unless the      Hearing Officer finds that the failure was substantially      justified or that other circumstances make an award of      expenses unjust. Such an order shall be subject to review on      appeal of the final decision of the Hearing Officer under      section 406 of the Act. No sanctions may be imposed under      this section except for good cause and the particulars of      which must be stated in the sanction order.

(e) Confidentiality and Waiver.       (1) Absent a waiver under paragraph 2, below, all      counseling shall be kept strictly confidential and shall not      be subject to discovery. All participants in counseling shall      be advised of the requirement for confidentiality and that      disclosure of information deemed confidential could result in      sanctions later in the proceedings. Nothing in these rules      shall prevent a counselor from consulting with personnel      within the Office concerning a matter in counseling, except      that, when the person being counseled is an employee of the      Office, the counselor shall not consult with any individual      within the Office who might be a party or witness without the      consent of the person requesting counseling. Nothing      contained in these rules shall prevent the Executive Director      from compiling and publishing statistical information such as      that required by Section 301(h)(3) of the Act. [so long as      that statistical information does not reveal the identity of      the employees involved or of employing offices that are the      subject of a request for counseling.]       (2) The employee and the Office may agree to waive      confidentiality [of] during the counseling process for the      limited purpose of allowing the Office [contacting the      employing office] to [obtain information] notify the      employing office of the allegations.[to be used in counseling      the employee or to attempt a resolution of any disputed      matter(s).] Such a limited waiver must be written on the form      supplied by the Office and signed by both the counselor and      the employee.                             .  .  .  .  .

(5) obtain the name, business and e-mail addresses, and      telephone number of the employee's representative, if any,      and whether the representative is an attorney.        [(i)](h)Counselor Not a Representative. The counselor      shall inform the person being counseled that the counselor      does not represent either the employing office or the      employee. The counselor provides information regarding the      Act and the Office and may act as a third-party intermediary      with the goals of increasing the individual's understanding      of his or her rights and responsibilities under the Act and      of promoting the early resolution of the matter.        [(j)] (i) Duration of Counseling Period.

[(h)] (j) Role of Counselor in Attempting Informal      Resolution. In order to attempt to resolve the matter brought      to the attention of the counselor, the counselor must obtain      a waiver of confidentiality pursuant to section 2.03(e)(2) of      these rules.

Once the      employee notifies the Office that he or she is using the      internal procedure, the employee shall provide a waiver of      confidentiality to allow the Executive Director to notify      the Architect of the Capitol or the Capitol Police that      the employee will be using the internal procedure.       (ii) The period during which the matter is pending in the      internal procedure shall not count against the time available      for counseling or mediation under the Act.       (iii) If the dispute is resolved to the employee's      satisfaction, the employee shall so notify the Office within      20 days after the employee has been served with a final      decision.

(iii) The period during which the matter is pending in the      internal grievance procedure shall not count against the time      available for counseling or mediation under the Act. If the      grievance is resolved to the employee's satisfaction, the      employee shall so notify the Office within 20 days after the      employee has received service of the final decision resulting      from the grievance procedure. If no request to return to the      procedures under these rules is received within 60 days after      the expiration of the period recommended by the Executive      Director the Office will issue a Notice of End of Counseling,      as specified in section 2.04(i) of these Rules.        (v) If a request to return to counseling is not made by the      employee within the time periods outlined above, the Office      will issue a Notice of the End of Counseling.       (2) Notice to Employees who Have Not Initiated Counseling      with the Office.

Sec. 2.04 Mediation.       (a)  Explanation] Overview. Mediation is a process in which      employees, employing offices and their representatives, if      any, meet separately and/or jointly with a  neutral  mediator      trained to assist them in resolving disputes. As  parties to       participants in the mediation, employees, employing offices,      and their representatives discuss alternatives to continuing      their dispute, including the possibility of reaching a      voluntary, mutually satisfactory resolution. The  neutral       mediator has no power to impose a specific resolution, and      the mediation process, whether or not a resolution is      reached, is strictly confidential, pursuant to section 416 of      the Act.       (b) Initiation. Not more than 15 days after receipt by the      employee of the notice of the conclusion of the counseling      period under section 2.03(l), the employee may file with the      Office a written request for mediation. Except to provide for      the services of a mediator and notice to the employing      office, the invocation of mediation shall be kept      confidential by the Office. The request for mediation shall      contain the employee's name, home and e-mail addresses,  and       telephone number, and the name of the employing office that      is the subject of the request. Failure to request mediation      within the prescribed period  will  may preclude the      employee's further pursuit of his or her claim. If a request      for mediation is not filed within 15 days of receipt of a      Notice of the End of Counseling, without good cause shown,      the case will be closed and the employee will be so notified.                               . . . . .       (d) Selection of  Neutrals  Mediators; Disqualification.      Upon receipt of the request for mediation, the Executive      Director shall assign one or more  neutrals  mediators to      commence the mediation process. In the event that a  neutral       mediator considers him or herself unable to perform in a      neutral role in a given situation, he or she shall withdraw      from the matter and immediately shall notify the Office of      the withdrawal. Any party may ask the Office to disqualify a       neutral  mediator by filing a written request, including the      reasons for such request, with the Executive Director. This      request shall be filed as soon as the party has reason to      believe there is a basis for disqualification. The Executive      Director's decision on this request shall be final and      unreviewable.       (e) Duration and Extension.                                . . . . .       (2) The  Office  Executive Director may extend the      mediation period upon the joint written request of the      parties, or of the appointed mediator on behalf of the      parties , to the attention of the Executive Director . The      request shall be written and filed with the  Office       Executive Director no later than the last day of the      mediation period. The request shall set forth the joint      nature of the request and the reasons therefore, and specify      when the parties expect to conclude their discussions.      Requests for additional extensions may be made in the same      manner. Approval of any extensions shall be within the sole      discretion of the  Office  Executive Director.       (f) Procedures.        (1) The  Neutral's  Mediator's Role. After assignment of      the case, the  neutral  mediator will promptly contact the      parties.

The       neutral  mediator may accept and may ask the parties to      provide written submissions.       (2) The Agreement to Mediate. At the commencement of the      mediation, the  neutral  mediator will ask the  parties       participants and/or their representatives to sign an      agreement prepared by the Office (``the Agreement to      Mediate''). The Agreement to Mediate will define what is to      be kept confidential during mediation and set out the      conditions under which mediation will occur, including the      requirement that the participants adhere to the      confidentiality of the process and a notice that a breach of      the mediation agreement could result in sanctions later in      the proceedings. The Agreement to Mediate will also provide      that the parties to the mediation will not seek to have the      counselor or the  neutral  mediator participate, testify or      otherwise present evidence in any subsequent administrative      action under section 405 or any civil action under section      408 of the Act or any other proceeding.

The Office may participate in the mediation process through a      representative and/or observer. The mediator will determine,      as best serves the interests of mediation, whether the      participants may meet jointly or separately with the      mediator.       (h) Informal Resolutions and Settlement Agreements. At any      time during mediation the parties may resolve or settle a      dispute in accordance with section  9.05  9.03 of these      rules.       (i) Conclusion of the Mediation Period and Notice. If, at      the end of the mediation period, the parties have not      resolved the matter that forms the basis of the request for      mediation, the Office shall provide the employee, and the      employing office, and their representatives, with written      notice that the mediation period has concluded. The written      notice  to the employee  will be  sent by certified mail,      return receipt requested, or will be  personally delivered      evidenced by a written receipt, or sent by first class mail,      e-mail, or fax.  , and it  The notice will specify the mode      of delivery and also  notify  provide information about the      employee's  of his or her  right to elect to file a complaint      with the Office in accordance with section 405 of the Act and      section 5.01 of these rules or to file a civil action      pursuant to section 408 of the Act and section  2.06  2.07 of      these rules.       (j) Independence of the Mediation Process and the  Neutral       Mediator. The Office will maintain the independence of the      mediation process and the  neutral  mediator. No individual,      who is appointed by the Executive Director to mediate, may      conduct or aid in a hearing conducted under section 405 of      the Act with respect to the same matter or shall be subject      to subpoena or any other compulsory process with respect to      the same matter.

This      rule shall also not preclude the Office from reporting      statistical information to the Senate and House of      Representatives that does not reveal the identity of the      employees or employing offices involved in the mediation.      All parties to the action and their representatives will      be advised of the confidentiality requirements of this      process and of the sanctions that might be imposed for      violating these requirements.

(a) Under section 210(f)(1) of the CAA, the General Counsel      is authorized to enter without delay and at reasonable times      any facility of any entity listed in section 210(a)      (``covered entities''), to inspect and investigate during      regular working hours and at other reasonable times, and      within reasonable limits and in a reasonable manner, any      facility, and all pertinent conditions, structures, machines,      apparatus, devices, equipment and materials therein; to      question privately any covered entity, employee, operator, or      agent; and to review records maintained by or under the      control of the covered entity.       (b) Prior to inspecting areas containing information which      is classified by an agency of the United States Government      (and/or by any congressional committee or other authorized      entity within the Legislative Branch) in the interest of      national security, and for which security clearance is      required as a condition for access to the area(s) to be      inspected, the individual(s) conducting the inspection shall      have obtained the appropriate security clearance.     Sec. 3.03 Requests for Inspections by Members of the Public        and Covered Entities.       (a) By Members of the Public.       (1) Any person who believes that a violation of section 210      of the CAA exists in any facility of a covered entity may      request an inspection of such facility by giving notice of      the alleged violation to the General Counsel. Any such notice      shall be reduced to writing on a form available from the      Office, shall set forth with reasonable particularity the      grounds for the notice, and shall be signed by the person or      the representative of the person. A copy shall be provided to      the covered entity or its agent by the General Counsel or the      General Counsel's designee no later than at the time of      inspection, except that, upon the written request of the      person giving such notice, his or her name and the names of      individual employees referred to therein shall not appear in      such copy or on any record published, released, or made      available by the General Counsel. If the person making the      request is a qualified individual with a disability, as      defined by section 201(2) of the Americans with Disabilities      Act of 1990 (ADA) (42 U.S.C. 12131(2)), the request for      inspection shall be considered a charge of discrimination      within the meaning of section 210(d)(1) of the CAA.       (2) If upon receipt of such notification the General      Counsel's designee determines that the notice meets the      requirements set forth in subparagraph (1) of this section,      and that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the      alleged violation exists, he or she shall cause an inspection      to be made as soon as practicable, to determine if such      alleged violation exists. Inspections under this section      shall not be limited to matters referred to in the notice.       (3) Prior to or during any inspection of a facility, any      person may notify the General Counsel's designee, in writing,      of any violation of section 210 of the CAA which he or she      has reason to believe exists in such facility. Any such      notice shall comply with the requirements of subparagraph (1)      of this section.       (b) By Covered Entities. Upon written request of any      covered entity, the General Counsel or the General Counsel's      designee shall inspect and investigate facilities of covered      entities under section 210(d) of the CAA. Any such requests      shall be reduced to writing on a form available from the      Office.     Sec. 3.04 Objection to Inspection.       Upon a refusal to permit the General Counsel's designee, in      exercise of his or her official duties, to enter without      delay and at reasonable times any place of employment or any      place therein, to inspect, to review records, or to question      any covered entity, operator, agent, or employee, in      accordance with section 3.02 or to permit a representative of      employees to accompany the General Counsel's designee during      the physical inspection of any facility in accordance with      section 3.07, the General Counsel's designee shall terminate      the inspection or confine the inspection to other areas,      conditions, structures, machines, apparatus, devices,      equipment, materials, records, or interviews concerning which      no objection is raised. The General Counsel's designee shall      endeavor to ascertain the reason for such refusal, and shall      immediately report the refusal and the reason therefor to the      General Counsel, who shall take appropriate action.     Sec. 3.05 Entry Not a Waiver.       Any permission to enter, inspect, review records, or      question any person, shall not imply or be conditioned upon a      waiver of any cause of action under section 210 of the CAA.     Sec. 3.06 Advance Notice of Inspections.       (a) Advance notice of inspections may not be given, except      in the following situations:       (1) in circumstances where the inspection can most      effectively be conducted after regular business hours or      where special preparations are necessary for an inspection;       (2) where necessary to assure the presence of      representatives of the covered entity and employees or the      appropriate personnel needed to aid in the inspection; and       (3) in other circumstances where the General Counsel      determines that the giving of advance notice would enhance      the probability of an effective and thorough inspection.       (b) In the situations described in paragraph (a) of this      section, advance notice of inspections may be given only if      authorized by the General Counsel or by the General Counsel's      designee.     Sec. 3.07 Conduct of Inspections.       (a) Subject to the provisions of section 3.02, inspections      shall take place at such times and in such places of      employment as the General Counsel may direct. At the      beginning of an inspection, the General Counsel's designee      shall present his or her credentials to the operator of the      facility or the management employee in charge at the facility      to be inspected; explain the nature and purpose of the      inspection; and indicate generally the scope of the      inspection and the records specified in section 3.02 which he      or she wishes to review. However, such designation of records      shall not preclude access to additional records specified in      section 3.02.       (b) The General Counsel's designee shall have authority to      take or obtain photographs related to the purpose of the      inspection, employ other reasonable investigative techniques,      and question privately, any covered entity, operator, agent      or employee of a covered facility. As used herein, the term      ``employ other reasonable investigative techniques''      includes, but is not limited to, the use of measuring      devices, testing equipment, or other equipment used to assess      accessibility or compliance with the ADA Standards.       (c) In taking photographs and samples, the General      Counsel's designees shall take reasonable precautions to      insure that such actions with flash, spark-producing, or      other equipment would not be hazardous. The General Counsel's      designees shall comply with all employing office safety and      health rules and practices at the workplace or location being      inspected, and they shall wear and use appropriate protective      clothing and equipment.       (d) The conduct of inspections shall be such as to preclude      unreasonable disruption of the operations of the covered      entity.       (e) At the conclusion of an inspection, the General      Counsel's designee shall confer with the covered entity or      its representative and informally advise it of any apparent      ADA violations disclosed by the inspection. During such      conference, the employing office shall be afforded an      opportunity to bring to the attention of the General      Counsel's designee any pertinent information regarding      accessibility in the facility.       (f) Inspections shall be conducted in accordance with the      requirements of this subpart.     Sec. 3.08 Representatives of Covered Entities.       (a) The General Counsel's designee shall be in charge of      inspections and questioning of persons. A representative of      the covered entity shall be given an opportunity to accompany      the General Counsel's designee during the physical inspection      of any facility for the purpose of aiding such inspection.      The General Counsel's designee may permit additional      representatives from the covered entity to accompany the      designee where he or she determines that such additional      representatives will further aid the inspection. A different      covered entity representative may accompany the General      Counsel's designee during each different phase of an      inspection if this will not interfere with the conduct of the      inspection.       (b) The General Counsel's designee shall have authority to      resolve all disputes as to whom is the representative      authorized by the covered entity for the purpose of this      section.       (c) If in the judgment of the General Counsel's designee,      good cause has been shown why accompaniment by a third party      who is not the requestor or an employee of the covered entity      (such as a sign language interpreter, braille reader,      architect or accessibility expert) is reasonably necessary to      the conduct of an effective and thorough physical inspection      of the workplace, such third party may accompany the General      Counsel's designee during the inspection.       (d) The General Counsel's designee may deny the right of      accompaniment under this section to any person whose conduct      interferes with a fair and orderly inspection. With regard to      information classified by an agency of the U.S. Government      (and/or by any congressional committee or other authorized      entity within the Legislative Branch) in the interest of      national security, only persons authorized to have access to      such information may accompany the General Counsel's designee      in areas containing such information.     Sec. 3.09 Consultation with Individuals with Disabilities       The General Counsel's designee may consult with individuals      with disabilities concerning matters of accessibility to the      extent he or she deems necessary for the conduct of an      effective and thorough inspection. During the course of an      inspection, any person shall be afforded an opportunity to      bring any violation of section 210 of the CAA which he or she      has reason to believe exists in the facility to the attention      of the General Counsel's designee.     Sec. 3.10 Inspection Not Warranted; Informal Review.       (a) If the General Counsel's designee determines that an      inspection is not warranted because there are no reasonable      grounds to believe that a violation exists under section 210      of the CAA, he or she shall notify the party making the      request of such determination. The complaining party may      obtain review of such determination by submitting a written      statement of position with the General Counsel and, at the      same time, providing the covered entity with a copy of such      statement. The covered entity may submit an opposing written      statement of position with the General Counsel and, at the      same time, provide the complaining party with a copy of such      statement. Upon the request of the complaining party or the      covered entity, the General Counsel, at his or her      discretion, may hold an informal conference in which the      complaining party and the covered entity may orally present      their views. After considering all written and oral views      presented, the General Counsel shall affirm, modify, or      reverse the designee's determination and furnish the      complaining party and the covered entity with written      notification of this decision and the reasons therefor. The      decision of the General Counsel shall be final and not      reviewable.       (b) If the General Counsel's designee determines that an      inspection is not warranted because the requirements of      section 3.03(a)(1) have not been met, he or she shall notify      the complaining party in writing of such determination. Such      determination shall be without prejudice to the filing of a      new notice of alleged violation meeting the requirements of      section 3.03(a)(1).     Sec. 3.11 Charge filed with the General Counsel.       (a) Who may file.       (1) Any qualified individual with a disability, as defined      in section 201(2) of the Americans with Disabilities Act of      1990 (42 U.S.C. 12131(2)), as applied by section 210 of the      CAA, who believes that he or she has been subjected to      discrimination on the basis of a disability in violation      of section 210 of the CAA by a covered entity, may file a      charge against any entity responsible for correcting the      violation with the General Counsel. A charge may not be      filed under section 210 of the CAA by a covered employee      alleging employment discrimination on the basis of      disability; the exclusive remedy for such discrimination      are the procedures under section 201 of the CAA and      subpart B of the Office's procedural rules.       (b) When to file. A charge under this section must be filed      with the General Counsel not later than 180 days from the      date of the alleged discrimination.       (c) Form and Contents. A charge shall be written or typed      on a charge form available from the Office. All charges shall      be signed and verified by the qualified individual with a      disability (hereinafter referred to as the ``charging      party''), or his or her representative, and shall contain the      following information:       (i) the full name, mail and e-mail addresses, and telephone      number(s) of the charging party;       (ii) the name, mail and e-mail addresses, and telephone      number of the covered entit(ies) against which the charge is      brought, if known (hereinafter referred to as the ''      respondent'');       (iii) the name(s) and title(s) of the individual(s), if      known, involved in the conduct that the charging party claims      is a violation of section 210 and/or the location and      description of the places or conditions within covered      facilities that the charging party claims is a violation of      section 210;       (iv) a description of the conduct, locations, or conditions      that form the basis of the charge, and a brief description of      why the charging party believes the conduct, locations, or      conditions is a violation of section 210; and (v) the name,      mail and e-mail addresses, and telephone number of the      representative, if any, who will act on behalf of the      charging party.     Sec. 3.12 Service of charge or notice of charge.       Within ten (10) days after the filing of a charge with the      General Counsel's Office (excluding weekends or holidays),      the General Counsel shall serve the respondent with a copy of      the charge, except when it is determined that providing a      copy of the charge would impede the law enforcement functions      of the General Counsel. Where a copy of the charge is not      provided, the respondent will be served with a notice of the      charge within ten (10) days after the filing of the charge.      The notice shall include the date, place and circumstances of      the alleged violation of section 210. The notice may not      include the identity of the person filing the charge if that      person has requested anonymity.     Sec. 3.13 Investigations by the General Counsel.       The General Counsel or the General Counsel's designated      representative shall promptly investigate each charge      alleging violations of section 210 of the CAA. As part of the      investigation, the General Counsel will accept any statement      of position or evidence with respect to the charge which the      charging party or the respondent wishes to submit. The      General Counsel will use other methods to investigate the      charge, as appropriate.     Sec. 3.14 Mediation.       If, upon investigation, the General Counsel believes that a      violation of section 210 may have occurred and that mediation      may be helpful in resolving the dispute, the General Counsel      may request, but not participate in, mediation under      subsections (b) through (d) of section 403 of the CAA and the      Office's procedural rules thereunder, between the charging      party and any entity responsible for correcting the alleged      violation.     Sec. 3.15 Dismissal of charge.       Where the General Counsel determines that a complaint will      not be filed, the General Counsel shall dismiss the charge.     Sec. 3.16 Complaint by the General Counsel.       (a) After completing the investigation, and where mediation      under section 3.14, if any, has not succeeded in resolving      the dispute, and where the General Counsel has not settled or      dismissed the charge, and if the General Counsel believes      that a violation of section 210 may have occurred, the      General Counsel may file with the Office a complaint against      any entity responsible for correcting the violation.       (b) The complaint filed by the General Counsel under      subsection (a) shall be submitted to a hearing officer for      decision pursuant to subsections (b) through (h) of section      405 of the CAA. Any person who has filed a charge under      section 3.11 of these rules may intervene as of right with      the full rights of a party. The procedures of sections 405      through 407 of the CAA and the Office's procedural rules      thereunder shall apply to hearings and related proceedings      under this subpart.     Sec. 3.17 Settlement.       Any settlement entered into by the parties to any process      described in section 210 of the CAA shall be in writing and      not become effective unless it is approved by the Executive      Director under section 414 of the CAA and the Office's      procedural rules thereunder.     Sec. 3.18 Compliance Date.       In any proceedings under this section, compliance shall      take place as soon as possible, but not later than the fiscal      year following the end of the fiscal year in which the order      requiring correction becomes final and not subject to further      review.Subpart D--Compliance, Investigation, Enforcement and Variance Process   under Section 215 of the CAA (Occupational Safety and Health Act of              1970)--Inspections, Citations, and Complaints     Sec. 4.01 Purpose and Scope     Sec. 4.02 Authority for Inspection     Sec. 4.03 Request for Inspections by Employees and Employing          Offices     Sec. 4.04 Objection to Inspection     Sec. 4.05 Entry Not a Waiver     Sec. 4.06 Advance Notice of Inspection     Sec. 4.07 Conduct of Inspections     Sec. 4.08 Representatives of Employing Offices and Employees     Sec. 4.09 Consultation with Employees     Sec. 4.10 Inspection Not Warranted; Informal Review     Sec. 4.11 Citations     Sec. 4.12 Imminent Danger     Sec. 4.13 Posting of Citations     Sec. 4.14 Failure to Correct a Violation for Which a Citation          Has Been Issued; Notice of Failure to Correct Violation;          Complaint     Sec. 4.15 Informal Conferences Rules of Practice for Variances, Limitations, Variations, Tolerances,                              and Exemptions     Sec. 4.20 Purpose and Scope     Sec. 4.21 Definitions     Sec. 4.22 Effect of Variances     Sec. 4.23 Public Notice of a Granted Variance, Limitation,          Variation, Tolerance, or Exemption     Sec. 4.24 Form of Documents     Sec. 4.25 Applications for Temporary Variances and other          Relief     Sec. 4.26 Applications for Permanent Variances and other          Relief     Sec. 4.27 Modification or Revocation of Orders     Sec. 4.28 Action on ApplicationsSec. 4.29 Consolidation of          Proceedings     Sec. 4.30 Consent Findings and Rules or Orders     Sec. 4.31 Order of Proceedings and Burden of Proof                 Inspections, Citations and Complaints                 *        *        *        *        *     Sec. 4.02 Authority for Inspection.

(a) If, on the basis of the inspection, the General Counsel      believes that a violation of any requirement of section 215      of the CAA, [or of] including any occupational safety or      health standard promulgated by the Secretary of Labor under      Title 29 of the U.S. Code, section 655, or of any other      regulation  standard , rule or order promulgated pursuant to      section 215 of the CAA, has occurred, he or she shall issue      to the employing office responsible for correction of the      violation  , as determined under section 1.106 of the Board's      regulations implementing section 215 of the CAA,  either a      citation or a notice of de minimis violations that [have] has      no direct or immediate relationship to safety or health. An      appropriate citation or notice of de minimis violations shall      be issued even though, after being informed of an alleged      violation by the General Counsel, the employing office      immediately abates, or initiates steps to abate, such alleged      violation. Any citation shall be issued with reasonable      promptness after termination of the inspection. No citation      may be issued under this section after the expiration of 6      months following the occurrence of any alleged violation      unless the violation is continuing or the employing office      has agreed to toll the deadline for filing the citation.                 *        *        *        *        *     Sec. 4.13 Posting of Citations.

Where, because of the nature of the      employing office's operations, it is not practicable to post      the citation at or near each place of alleged violation, such      citation shall be posted, unedited, in a prominent place      where it will be readily observable by all affected      employees. For example, where employing offices are engaged      in activities which are physically dispersed, the citation      may be posted at the location to which employees report each      day. Where employees do not primarily work at or report to a      single location, the citation may be posted at the location      from which the employees operate to carry out their      activities. When a citation contains security information as      defined in Title 2 of the U.S. Code, section 1979, the      General Counsel may edit or redact the security information      from the copy of the citation used for posting or may provide      to the employing office a notice for posting that describes      the alleged violation without referencing the security      information. The employing office shall take steps to ensure      that the citation or notice is not altered, defaced, or      covered by other material. Notices of de minimis violations      need not be posted.       (b) Each citation, notice, or a copy thereof, shall remain      posted until the violation has been abated, or for 3 working      days, whichever is later. The pendency of any proceedings      regarding the citation shall not affect its posting      responsibility under this section unless and until the Board      issues a final order vacating the citation.                         .    .    .    .    .     Sec. 4.15 Informal Conferences.       At the request of an affected employing office, employee,      or representative of employees, the General Counsel may hold      an informal conference for the purpose of discussing any      issues raised by an inspection, citation, or notice issued by      the General Counsel. Any settlement entered into by the      parties at such conference shall be subject to the approval      of the Executive Director under section 414 of the CAA and      section [9.05] 9.03 of these rules. If the conference is      requested by the employing office, an affected employee or      the employee's representative shall be afforded an      opportunity to participate, at the discretion of the General      Counsel. If the conference is requested by an employee or      representative of employees, the employing office shall be      afforded an opportunity to participate, at the discretion of      the General Counsel. Any party may be represented by counsel      at such conference.                         .    .    .    .    .

Within 15 days after receipt of a copy of a      complaint or an amended complaint, the respondent shall file      an answer with the Office and serve one copy on the      complainant. [The answer shall contain a statement of the      position of the respondent on each of the issues raised in      the complaint or amended complaint, including admissions,      denials, or explanations of each allegation made in the      complaint and any affirmative defenses or other defenses to      the complaint.] In answering a complaint, a party must state      in short and plain terms its defenses to each claim asserted      against it and admit or deny the allegations asserted against      it by an opposing party. Failure to [file an answer] deny an      allegation, other than one relating to the amount of damages,      or to raise a claim or defense as to any allegation(s) shall      constitute an admission of such allegation(s). Affirmative      defenses not raised in an answer that could have reasonably      been anticipated based on the facts alleged in the complaint      shall be deemed waived. A respondent's motion for leave to      amend an answer to interpose a denial or affirmative defense      will ordinarily be granted unless to do so would unduly      prejudice the rights of the other party or unduly delay or      otherwise interfere with or impede the proceedings.

Any such withdrawal must be approved by the      Hearing Officer and may be with or without prejudice to      refile at the Hearing Officer's discretion.       (g) Withdrawal of Complaint by the General Counsel. At any      time prior to the opening of the hearing the General Counsel      may withdraw his complaint by filing a notice with the      Executive Director and the Hearing Officer and by serving a      copy on the respondent.

Pursuant to section 416(c) of the Act, except as provided      in sub-sections 416(d), (e) and (f), all proceedings and      deliberations of Hearing Officers and the Board, including      any related records, shall be confidential. Section 416(c)      does not apply to proceedings under section 215 of the Act,      but does apply to the deliberations of Hearing Officers and      the Board under section 215. A violation of the      confidentiality requirements of the Act and these rules      [could] may result in the imposition of procedural or      evidentiary sanctions. [Nothing in these rules shall prevent      the Executive Director from reporting statistical information      to the Senate and House of Representatives, so long as that      statistical information does not reveal the identity of the      employees involved or of employing offices that are the      subject of a matter.] See also sections [1.06] [1.07] 1.08      and 7.12 of these rules.

(a) [Explanation] Description. Discovery is the process by      which a party may obtain from another person, including a      party, information, not privileged, reasonably calculated to      lead to the discovery of admissible evidence, for the purpose      of assisting that party in developing, preparing and      presenting its case at the hearing. No discovery, oral or      written, by any party shall [This provision  shall not be      construed to permit any discovery, oral or written, to  be      taken of, or from, an employee of the Office of      Compliance,  or the  counselor (s) , or mediator  the      neutral(s) involved in counseling and mediation. ,      including files, records, or notes produced during      counseling and mediation and maintained by the Office.        (b) Initial Disclosure.  Office Policy Regarding Discovery.      It is the policy of the Office to encourage the early and      voluntary exchange of relevant and material nonprivileged      information between the parties, including the names and      addresses of witnesses and copies of relevant and material      documents, and to encourage Hearing Officers to develop      procedures which allow for the greatest exchange of relevant      and material information and which minimizes the need for      parties to formally request such information.  Within 14 days      after the pre-hearing conference and except as otherwise      stipulated or ordered by the Hearing Officer, a party must,      without awaiting a discovery request, provide to the other      parties: the name and, if known, mail and e-mail addresses      and telephone number of each individual likely to have      discoverable information that the disclosing party may use to      support its claims or defenses; and a copy or a description      by category and location of all documents, electronically      stored information, and tangible things that the disclosing      party has in its possession, custody, or control and may use      to support its claims or defenses.       (c) Discovery Availability. Pursuant to section 405(e) of      the Act,  the Hearing Officer in his or her discretion may      permit  the parties may engage in reasonable prehearing      discovery.  In exercising that discretion, the Hearing      Officer may be guided by the Federal Rules of Civil      Procedure.        (1) The  Hearing Officer may authorize  parties may take      discovery by one or more of the following methods:      depositions upon oral examination or written questions;      written interrogatories; production of documents or things or      permission to enter upon land or other property for      inspection or other purposes; physical and mental      examinations; and requests for admission.       (2) The Hearing Officer may adopt standing orders or make      any order setting forth the forms and extent of discovery,      including orders limiting the number of depositions,      interrogatories, and requests for production of documents,      and may also limit the length of depositions.                               . . . . .       (d) Claims of Privilege.       (1) Information Withheld. Whenever a party withholds      information otherwise discoverable under these rules by      claiming that it is privileged or confidential or subject to      protection as hearing or trial preparation materials, the      party shall make the claim expressly in writing and shall      describe the nature of the documents, communications or      things not produced or disclosed in a manner that, without      revealing the information itself privileged or protected,      will enable other parties to assess the applicability of the      privilege or protection. A party must make a claim for      privilege no later than the due date for the production of      the information.       (2) Information Produced As Inadvertent Disclosure. If      information produced in discovery is subject to a claim of      privilege or of protection as hearing preparation material,      the party making the claim may notify any party that received      the information of the claim and the basis for it. After      being notified, a party must promptly return, sequester, or      destroy the specified information and any copies it has; must      not use or disclose the information until the claim is      resolved; must take reasonable steps to retrieve the      information if the party disclosed it before being notified;      and may promptly present the information to the Hearing      Officer or the Board under seal for a determination of the      claim. The producing party must preserve the information      until the claim is resolved.     Sec. 6.02 Request for Subpoena.       (a) Authority to Issue Subpoenas. At the request of a      party, a Hearing Officer may issue subpoenas for the      attendance and testimony of witnesses and for the production      of correspondence, books, papers, documents, or other      records. The attendance of witnesses and the production of      records may be required from any place within the United      States. However, no subpoena by any party may be issued for      the attendance or testimony of an employee  with  of the      Office of Compliance, a counselor, or a mediator, including      files, records, or notes produced during counseling and      mediation and maintained by the Office. Employing offices      shall make their employees available for discovery and      hearing without requiring a subpoena.       (d) Rulings. The Hearing Officer shall promptly rule on the      request for the subpoena.                               * * * * *                          Subpart G--Hearings     Sec. 7.01 The Hearing Officer     Sec. 7.02 Sanctions      Sec. 7.03 Disqualification of the Hearing Officer      Sec. 7.04 Motions and Prehearing Conference      Sec. 7.05 Scheduling the Hearing      Sec. 7.06 Consolidation and Joinder of Cases      Sec. 7.07 Conduct of Hearing; Disqualification of          Representatives      Sec. 7.08 Transcript      Sec. 7.09 Admissibility of Evidence      Sec. 7.10 Stipulations      Sec. 7.11 Official Notice      Sec. 7.12 Confidentiality      Sec. 7.13 Immediate Board Review of a Ruling by a Hearing          Officer      Sec. 7.14 Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law;          Posthearing Briefs      Sec. 7.15 Closing the record      Sec. 7.16 Hearing Officer Decisions; Entry in Records of the          Office; Corrections to the Record; Motions to Alter,          Amend or Vacate the Decision.

Hearing Officers shall conduct fair and      impartial hearings and take all necessary action to avoid      undue delay in the disposition of all proceedings. They shall      have all powers necessary to that end unless otherwise      limited by law, including, but not limited to, the authority      to:                               . . . . .

(b) The Hearing Officer may impose sanctions upon the      parties under, but not limited to, the circumstances set      forth in this section.       (1) Failure to Comply with an Order. When a party fails to      comply with an order (including an order for the taking of a      deposition, for the production of evidence within the party's      control, or for production of witnesses), the Hearing Officer      may:       [(a)](A) draw an inference in favor of the requesting party      on the issue related to the information sought;       [(b)](B) stay further proceedings until the order is      obeyed;       [(c)](C) prohibit the party failing to comply with such      order from introducing evidence concerning, or otherwise      relying upon, evidence relating to the information sought;       [(d)](D) permit the requesting party to introduce secondary      evidence concerning the information sought;       [(e)](E) strike, in whole or in part, [any part of] the      complaint, briefs, answer, or other submissions of the party      failing to comply with the order, as appropriate;        [(f)](F) direct judgment against the non-complying party in      whole or in part; or       [(g)](G) order that the non-complying party, or the      representative advising that party, pay all or part of the      attorney's fees and reasonable expenses of the other party or      parties or of the Office, caused by such non-compliance,      unless the Hearing Officer or the Board finds that the      failure was substantially justified or that other      circumstances make an award of attorney's fees and/or      expenses unjust.       (2) Failure to Prosecute or Defend. If a party fails to      prosecute or defend a position, the Hearing Officer may      dismiss the action with prejudice or [rule for the      complainant] decide the matter, where appropriate.                                . . . . .       (4) Filing of frivolous claims. If a party files a      frivolous claim, the Hearing Officer may dismiss the claim,      in whole or in part, with prejudice or decide the matter for      the party alleging the filing of the frivolous claim.       (5) Failure to maintain confidentiality. An allegation      regarding a violation of the confidentiality provisions may      be made to a Hearing Officer in proceedings under Section 405      of the CAA. If, after notice and hearing, the Hearing Officer      determines that a party has violated the confidentiality      provisions, the Hearing Officer may:        (A) direct that the matters related to the breach of      confidentiality or other designated facts be taken as      established for purposes of the action, as the prevailing      party claims;       (B) prohibit the party breaching confidentiality from      supporting or opposing designated claims or defenses, or from      introducing designated matters in evidence;       (C) strike the pleadings in whole or in part;        (D) stay further proceedings until the breach of      confidentiality is resolved to the extent possible;        (E) dismiss the action or proceeding in whole or in part;      or       (F) render a default judgment against the party breaching      confidentiality.        (c) No sanctions may be imposed under this section except      for good cause and the particulars of which must be stated in      the sanction order.                                . . . . .     Sec. 7.04  Motions and Prehearing Conference.                               . . . . .       (b) Scheduling of the Prehearing Conference. Within 7 days      after assignment, the Hearing Officer shall serve on the      parties and their designated representatives written notice      setting forth the time, date, and place of the prehearing      conference, except that the Executive Director may, for good      cause, extend up to an additional 7 days the time for serving      notice of the prehearing conference.        (c) Prehearing Conference Memoranda. The Hearing Officer      may order each party to prepare a prehearing conference      memorandum. At his or her discretion, the Hearing Officer may      direct the filing of the memorandum after discovery by the      parties has concluded. [That] The memorandum may include:                               . . . . .       (3) the specific relief, including, where known, a      calculation of [the amount of] any monetary relief [,] or      damages that is being or will be requested;       (4) the names of potential witnesses for the party's case,      except for potential impeachment or rebuttal witnesses, and      the purpose for which they will be called and a list of      documents that the party is seeking from the opposing party,      and, if discovery was permitted, the status of any pending      request for discovery. (It is not necessary to list each      document requested. Instead, the party may refer to the      request for discovery.); and                               . . . . .       (d) At the prehearing conference, the Hearing Officer may      discuss the subjects specified in paragraph (c) above and the      manner in which the hearing will be conducted [and proceed].      In addition, the Hearing Officer may explore settlement      possibilities and consider how the factual and legal issues      might be simplified and any other issues that might expedite      the resolution of the dispute. The Hearing Officer shall      issue an order, which recites the action taken at the      conference and the agreements made by the parties as to any      of the matters considered and which limits the issues to      those not disposed of by admissions, stipulations, or      agreements of the parties. Such order, when entered, shall      control the course of the proceeding, subject to later      modification by the Hearing Officer by his or her own motion      or upon proper request of a party for good cause shown.     Sec. 7.05  Scheduling the Hearing.                               . . . . .       (b) Motions for Postponement or a Continuance. Motions for      postponement or for a continuance by either party shall be      made in writing to the [Office] Hearing Officer, shall set      forth the reasons for the request, and shall state whether      the opposing party consents to such postponement. Such a      motion may be granted by the Hearing Officer upon a showing      of good cause. In no event will a hearing commence later than      90 days after the filing of the complaint.     Sec. 7.06  Consolidation and Joinder of Cases.                               . . . . .       (b) Authority. The Executive Director prior to the      assignment of a complaint to a Hearing Officer; a Hearing      Officer during the hearing; or the Board [, the Office, or a      Hearing Officer] during an appeal may consolidate or join      cases on their own initiative or on the motion of a party if      to do so would expedite processing of the cases and not      adversely affect the interests of the parties, taking into      account the confidentiality requirements of section 416 of      the Act.     Sec. 7.07  Conduct of Hearing; Disqualification of        Representatives.                               . . . . .

(f) Failure of either party to appear, present witnesses,      or respond to an evidentiary order may result in an adverse      finding or ruling by the Hearing Officer.
