 President, Seattle's African American community loses a visionary and much respected leader when the Rev. Dr. Samuel B. McKinney steps down after four decades of service at the Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Seattle. Dr. McKinney is well known throughout the region as a tireless advocate for social justice, supporter of youth and proponent of economic development.  Samuel Berry McKinney was born in Michigan, and raised in Ohio. He entered Morehouse College in Atlanta, where he became friends with a fellow minister's son, Martin Luther King, Jr. His college career was interrupted by a tour of service in the U.S. Army, but he returned to Morehouse to earn his degree in 1949. He then continued his education at Colgate Rochester Divinity School, graduating in 1952.  Dr. McKinney began his ministry at Mt. Zion on the first Sunday of February 1958. His ministry would become the longest in the church's 107-year history as well as one of the most accomplished.  He quickly established himself as an energetic and ambitious young pastor. In 1961, Dr. McKinney invited his college friend, Dr. King, to participate in a lecture series presented by the Brotherhood of Mount Zion Baptist Church, a program started by Dr. McKinney. It would be Dr. King's only visit to Seattle and had a lasting impact on Seattle's African American community.  Mt. Zion has flourished under Dr. McKinney's leadership. The membership has more than tripled in size. An educational wing was constructed in 1963 and a new sanctuary in 1975. The church was a forerunner in accredited, church-site, preschool and kindergarten education. The Feeding Ministry provides meals to hundreds of homeless persons, seniors and shut-ins each week. Mt. Zion's six choirs provide music for the church and community at large.  Mt. Zion's work on behalf of children has been especially noteworthy and reflects Dr. McKinney's belief in educational achievement. The Educational Excellence Program presents annual awards to students from kindergarten to grade 12. The Scholarship Ministry annually provides an average of over $25,000 for undergraduate and graduate school education. The Youth Credit Union brings to participants training and experience in responsible financial management.  Dr. McKinney is well known in local and national church circles. He has served as a leader of the American Baptist Convention USA. He was the first African American president of the Church Council of Greater Seattle from 1965 to 1967. He has served as Advisor on Racism to the World Council of Churches, and as a representative to WCC's Seventh Assembly.  Dr. McKinney's leadership has extended beyond the religious community to the community at large. He has been active on the community, regional and state level. He was an original member of the Seattle Human Rights Commission and served for 12 years on the Washington State Commission for Vocational Education. He was founder of the Seattle Opportunities Industrialization Center and served as President of the Board of Directors for 20 years. He was a charter member of Seattle's first African American bank and served on the Advisory Board of Directors for the 1990 Goodwill Games. He has served as Chair of the Washington State Rainbow Coalition.  For his many works of community service, Dr. McKinney was awarded the YMCA's prestigious A.K. Guy Award. He was also honored by his alma mater with the hanging of his portrait in the Chapel of Morehouse.  Even with retirement growing near, Dr. McKinney remains involved in a variety of community activities. They include membership on the boards of the Fred Hutchinson Research Center, Washington Mutual Savings Bank, the Seattle Foundation and the Washington Gives Foundation. He is also a member of the Housing Commission of the National Baptist Convention, USA.  At Dr. McKinney's side throughout his years of service has been his wife, Louise Jones McKinney. Mrs. McKinney, retired from the Seattle Public Schools where she was Director of Academic Achievement, shares her husband's deep commitment to community service and to encouraging academic progress. The McKinneys have passed their values and work ethic to their accomplished daughters. Lora-Ellen McKinney earned her Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology and has received awards for her innovative work with children. Rhoda Eileen McKinney Jones has a graduate degree from Columbia University School of Journalism and writes for many national church publications.  I know that Dr. McKinney will continue to make his mark on the community. I wish him the best of success in his future endeavors.                          ____________________
