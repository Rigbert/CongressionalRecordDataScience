 David has served me on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence for over a decade, beginning as my designee in March of 2005, then as my staff director from January of 2009 when I took over as chairman of the Committee. Over this decade, I have grown to trust his expertise and advice on all aspects of our oversight of the Intelligence Community and to rely on David's keen abilities to manage the committee in a fair and bipartisan manner, while shepherding through some of the Nation's most important and sometimes controversial legislation.  Prior to joining the Intelligence Committee in 2005, David worked on the House Select Committee on Homeland Security and was the senior policy adviser to Representative Jane Harman on matters of national security. Before coming to Congress, David worked for 2 years at the National Research Council's Board on Chemical Sciences and Technology on projects studying the ability to make explosives more detectable and identifiable. He has a master's of public policy from the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he worked for now-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, who I understand recommended him to Representative Harman. David is a proven expert on both process and substance, which I am certain he developed by applying his characteristic analytic approach to everything, a skill he developed while a student in chemistry at Cornell University.  David's accomplishments on the Intelligence Committee are extensive, so I will mention only a few of the highlights today. As staff director, David played a central role in assisting and guiding me and the committee through all stages of the committee's study of the CIA's detention and interrogation program, where a deft hand was required to negotiate numerous aspects of the review with the CIA and the administration. He played a significant role in prodding the administration to provide information and access to critically important material. He worked with the committee study team to declassify and secure release of a 500-page executive summary of the full 6,700-page report, a process that required months of excruciatingly detailed negotiations. The report is believed to be the largest review in congressional history. After the release of the declassified summary, David helped me and Senator McCain draft and pass legislation that will help ensure these types of harsh interrogation techniques will never be used again by the CIA or any other agency or representative of the U.S. Government.  David also managed the bipartisan committee staff as it helped pass seven straight intelligence authorization bills from 2009 to the most recent one, which was signed by the President last month under the leadership of Chairman Burr. This effort, which helps ensure proper oversight of the intelligence community, was a significant achievement as no legislative guidance had been provided to the intelligence community during the previous 5 years prior to 2009. I thank David for leading the staff development of these bills and helping to successfully push them through Senate passage to bring them to the President's desk.  Another recent significant accomplishment in which David's steady hand and expert advice helped achieve success is his work on the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015. This act, which was signed by the President last month, will help this Nation defend itself from cyber attacks by encouraging increased information sharing on cyber intrusions between private industry and the government.  As staff director, David also oversaw the completion of two important committee reviews. The first one was a committee report on the 2009 Christmas Day attempted bombing of flight 253 over Detroit, and the second one was a bipartisan report on the 2012 Benghazi attacks. Each unflinchingly laid out the facts and helped determine what changes should be made as an appropriate response. David also worked to improve oversight of counterterrorism operations that helped assure the American public that Congress knew the details of what was being done by the executive branch, as well as provided recommendations for improvements.  In 2007, David worked on the committee's investigation into prewar intelligence regarding Iraq. David served as the co-lead for the committee's sixth and final report on this topic, which dealt with the subject of prewar statements by senior policymakers. This was an important and sensitive subject, and David and his staff colleagues handled it with objectivity and professionalism. The report, approved by a bipartisan majority of the committee in June 2008, helped resolve a number of important questions regarding the run-up to the Iraq War. The great work that David and his colleagues did on this project ensured that the public finally received the facts and helped conclude what had at times been a contentious chapter in the committee's history.  I also want to echo many of the comments that our committee staff has made about David including one that was passed onto me where a colleague said that he ``has been the rock upon which the staff's foundation is built.'' He has been a solid and stable leader that has provided the confidence that the staff needs to flourish. David's intellect and knowledge of the intelligence community and his communication skills in conveying that knowledge to committee members has gained him the respect and admiration of the entire committee. Finally, his demeanor and behavior in dealing with people, both inside and outside the committee, on both sides of the aisle and in both bodies of Congress, as wellas with leaders of the intelligence community and the executive branch, is an example to be emulated.  As I mentioned earlier, these are just a few of David's traits and accomplishments that I have come to rely upon while he served on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. And I thank him for them. I also want to thank David's wife, Kerry Searle Grannis, for enduring the long hours and time away from home that is often a part of life in the Senate; and to acknowledge their three beautiful children--Owen, Amelia, and Nathaniel--who I hope now will have more time with their father, who can help them achieve more Boy Scout badges, excel in drama classes, and perfect that high board dive and soccer goal. Kerry has mentioned how wonderful a husband and father David has been, supporting her as she completed her Ph.D. and sharing all household chores, driving duties, and doctors' appointments for his busy crew.  I know David will thrive as he begins a new set of challenges as the Principal Deputy Under Secretary at the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis. I wish him the very best and thank him for his many years of service and dedication to this country and to me.                          ____________________
