Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would just remind my colleagues that this bill is supported by literally hundreds of national State and local organizations, including the National Grocers Association, the National Association of Convenience Stores, the Food Marketing Institute, the American Pizza Community, the National Association of Truck Stop Operators, amongst many, many others.                              {time}  1330  I want to also reiterate that this bill, again, is bipartisan and has passed the Energy and Commerce Committee 39-14, in this Congress, and last year in the House, where it passed 266-144.  The bottom line is this: it clarifies that establishments acting in good faith will not be penalized, particularly in a criminal way, for inadvertent human error in reasonable variations in serving sizes and ingredients, giving them 90 days to correct a violation before enforcement action is brought by the FDA.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote in support of this bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Mr. DeSAULNIER. I rise to express my strong opposition to H.R. 772, the so-called Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act.  I have worked at every level of the restaurant business, starting as a dishwasher and busboy, and eventually managing and owning various restaurants in the San Francisco Bay area. As a former restaurateur and a member of the California Restaurant Association, I have a deep appreciation for the value American consumers place on nutritional information when determining their food purchases.  Numerous studies, like the International Food Information Council and elsewhere, suggest that nutritional information is second only to taste when choosing what to eat from a menu. Other peer-reviewed studies have found that consumers make healthier choices when nutrition information is placed directly on the menu.  Making nutrition information readily available and standardized is an important step in fighting the growing epidemic of obesity and chronic disease. According to the CDC, more than two-thirds of American adults are overweight or obese, nearly a third of American children are overweight, and the prevalence of childhood obesity children has more than tripled since 1971.  That is why, as a California State Senator, I co-authored the first-in-the-nation menu labeling law. This bipartisan legislation was passed with industry support and cooperation, and signed by a Republican governor.  In contrast, the bill before us today creates giant loopholes in the ACA's national menu labeling provisions and allows selected establishments to arbitrarily determine serving sizes, and obscure the total number of servings per item. For example, if this bill would become law pizza chains, supermarkets, and convenience stores would be exempt from having to provide information to consumers at the point-of-sale. The bill would also further delay the implementation of our existing nationwide menu labeling efforts that are supported by more than 75 percent of American consumers.  Particularly harmful for my constituents, H.R. 772 would preempt state efforts to address the obesity epidemic locally. The bill also undermines state and local efforts to enforce or enact their own food labeling laws, and extends to food labelling in general, not simply menu labeling as the bill's title would lead us to believe.  This misguided legislation unravels all of the cooperative work being done by the restaurant industry and government agencies across the nation. I urge my colleagues to oppose this effort to undermine local transparency efforts and vote No on H.R. 772.
