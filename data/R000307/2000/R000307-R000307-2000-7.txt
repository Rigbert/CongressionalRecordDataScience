I think it will be helpful if I read this, if the Senator from Oklahoma will permit me. This is somebody from the administration. He stated this:       We are trapped in a death spiral.  I do not think one could make it any more plain than that.       We are trapped in a death spiral. The requirement to      maintain our aging equipment is costing us more each year in      repair costs, down time, and maintenance tempo. But we must      keep this equipment in repair to maintain readiness. It      drains our resources--resources we should apply to      modernization of the traditional systems and development of      new systems.  Then the Secretary went on to say:       So we stretch out our replacement schedules to ridiculous      lengths and reduce the quantities of new equipment we      purchase, raising the cost and still further delaying      modernization.  I do not think one can be any plainer than that. So the Senator's remarks are backed up not only from what we hear in testimony but also from the many bases at home and overseas. I thank my distinguished colleague for all the effort he makes from his personal time and other duties to go to bases all over the world. He checks with the enlisted; he checks with the NCOs; he checks with the officers; and he checks with the commanders and shows them his candor and integrity. We talked about this at great length.  In terms of readiness, there is no other person in the Congress of the United States or, for that matter, whom I know in this city who knows better the readiness problems we have, and it is backed up by this statement by a Secretary of the administration. We owe the Senator from Oklahoma a debt of gratitude.
