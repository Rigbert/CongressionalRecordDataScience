  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, despite a flood, a sea of red ink, tomorrow Republicans propose to cut taxes. Cut taxes for whom? The wealthy. They want to float the yachts of the wealthy on a sea of red ink.  One of the cuts is for people who get a chip dividend on their stocks and is paid for by dramatically increasing the costs of student loans.  I have met with students at Oregon State and the University of Oregon during the break. These kids are working hard trying to realize the American Dream. Some of them are holding down three jobs and borrowing as much as they can, and the Republicans say they have to pay more for those loans so that rich people can pay a rate of taxes on dividends less than someone who works for $25,000 a year.  That is an outrageous position for the majority party.                          ____________________[Page H11115]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                 YACHTS FOR THE RICH, DEBT FOR THE POOR  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)
