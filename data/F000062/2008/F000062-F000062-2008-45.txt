 President, I wish I could come to the floor and say there is a quick fix for gasoline prices at the pump. This is needed as much as anywhere in California where gas prices are high and at times the very highest. I wish I could say there was this quick fix, but I cannot. I wish I could say if we could drill all of the Outer Continental Shelf, if we could drill on all of the public land in America, the price of gasoline at the pump would drop immediately, but I cannot.  In all good conscience, I do not believe opening the Outer Continental Shelf to new drilling would lower the prices at the pump anytime in the near future. In the first place, it takes 2 years for MMS, Minerals and Management Service, to do the contracts. Secondly, all drilling rigs are now leased.
