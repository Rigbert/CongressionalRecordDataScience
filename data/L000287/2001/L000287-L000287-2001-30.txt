Mr. Speaker, another man is gone. Another human being is gone. How long will we continue to travel down this inhumane road? The death penalty is not worthy of a great Nation. It is barbaric, it is uncivilized. What do we want, retribution, to get even, or to have revenge?  I happen to believe that in every human being there is the spark of the divine, and no government, not State or federal, has the right to destroy that spark. That right is reserved for the Almighty and the Almighty alone. How can we appeal to our people, especially our young people, not to use an instrument of violence to settle their disputes, and then sanction killing, sentencing someone to death?  It is time for us to join with the majority of the world and put an end to this form of barbaric punishment. It is time to put an end to the death penalty. Enough is enough, Mr. Speaker.                          ____________________
