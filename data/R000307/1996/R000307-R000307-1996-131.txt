Speaker, I realize this farm bill debate has been like Lonesome Dove; we are almost home, and we have all of our body parts, and we will get there if we will just pay a little bit of attention.  This is a revote on some of the amendments that we have just considered. As has been indicated by the gentleman from California, the $3.5 billion in regard to rural development, we all know we would like to have rural development, but it is $3.5 billion. We just voted on that.  We have another situation in regard to conservation funding. The gentleman from Nebraska [Mr. Barrett], the gentleman from New York [Mr. Boehlert], and the rest of us put together a package, and this package is another $300 million over that which we cannot afford.  Then again, as the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] has pointed out in regard to dairy, there are significant reductions in regard to the dairy program.  So this is simply a repeat of past amendments we have had before, and I must say in terms of a motion to recommit with 229 pages that nobody has seen up there--well, somebody had to see it--that nobody has really perused to know what is in it, we at least know in terms of cost and policy these are amendments that we voted on before. We ought to get on with it.
