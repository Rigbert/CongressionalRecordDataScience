President, I think the regular order is to go out now. First, I suggest that I will want some time this afternoon to explain what this amendment really does and also to explain in some detail the marginal wells this would affect. The average marginal well in my State of Oklahoma is 2 barrels a day. We are not talking about giants here. This is a totally different situation. We will have an opportunity to pursue that after resuming the regular order.                          ____________________
