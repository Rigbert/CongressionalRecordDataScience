Madam Speaker, pursuant to the Republican Leadership standards on earmarks, I am submitting the following information regarding earmarks I receive as part of H.R. 2487--the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010.  Project Name: Steller Sea Lion Comanagement, Biosampling and Outreach/Education  Bill Number: H.R. 2487  Department of Commerce, NOAA-ORF  Legal name and address of entity receiving earmark:  Alaska Sea Otter and Steller Sea Lion Commission  6239 B Street, Suite 204  Anchorage, AK 99518  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: TASSC will take a two pronged approach to sea lion biosampling. First, TASSC will work with two high harvest communities to fund local monitors-local residents that will work with the hunters and facilitate sea lion biosampling and help to monitor and document the local environment. Secondly, TASSC will train approximately 25 coastal Alaska residents on proper sample collection techniques and protocols from those sea lions harvested for subsistence.  Subsistence hunted Steller sea lion biosamples are very valuable to the research community. Collection and analysis of these samples can provide critical information that no other source can provide. It is recognized as a top priority activity in the 1992 and soon to be finalized Steller Sea Lion Recovery Plan. The importance of collecting samples from animals taken for subsistence is widely recognized by such groups as the National Marine Mammal Lab, Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Alaska Sea Life Center and the University of Alaska.

Box 196650  Anchorage, AK 99519  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: Funding will be used for the continued development and operations of the Municipality of Anchorage Sexual Assault Response Team (SART) Center. This project will support victims through care while participating in investigation and prosecution and help in prosecution of sexual assault cases through professional evidence collection, documentation, preservation and processing.  The SART Center is essential in the collection of evidence through the forensic medical exam by the sexual assault nurse examiner and its operations is essential in Anchorage's effort to reduce and eliminate sexual assault.

Appropriated Amount: $400,000  Detailed Finance Plan:  Program Administration, Victim Advocacy, Forensic Investigation: $340,000  Indirect/Communications: $60,000  Project Name: The Yukon River Drainage Fisheries Association  Bill Number: H.R. 2487  Department of Commerce, NOAA-ORF  Legal name and address of entity receiving earmark:  The Yukon River Drainage Fisheries Association  725 Christensen Drive, Suite 3-B  Anchorage, AK 99508  Description of how the money will be spent and why the use of federal taxpayer funding is justified: The Yukon River Drainage Fisheries Association (YRDFA) promotes healthy wild salmon fisheries along the Yukon River in Alaska. It manages programs to aid in the management through the gathering of data from subsistence harvests, Native Elders' knowledge and tracking fisheries issues impacting Yukon River salmon. The Yukon River Drainage Fisheries Association also educates fishers and managers in responsible usage and ensures both are able to work to steward the salmon fisheries.  The federal government is obligated to maintain sustainable salmon runs on the Yukon River through the Yukon River Salmon Agreement and to provide subsistence priority under the Alaska Native Interest Claims Act. YRDFA plays a key role in involving the users of the resources in maintaining the salmon runs for which the federal government is responsible for managing.

It will also help to fund the i-SAFE initiatives that provide data to FBI, local law enforcement, schools and industry leaders such as USPTO, RIAA and ASCAP. This data is provided through the i-SAFE National Assessment Center--a compilation of student surveys that serve as the world's largest data base of student online behavior and attitudes.  Appropriated Amount: $630,000  Detailed Finance Plan:  i-SAFE Inc. is the leading provider of e-Safety education and training in schools nationwide. i-SAFE also provides schools/districts behavioral statistical data regarding Internet behavior and usage by their students. i-SAFE programmatic assets address a broad range of e-Safety issues through a uniquely comprehensive and holistic framework that includes training of educators (i.e., Professional Development Program--i-SAFE has trained over 85,000 educators nationwide) both online and in-person, extensive community outreach programs towards parents, seniors, legal/law-enforcement officers and, most importantly, a world-class age-appropriate curriculum which features integrated teaching and learning activities for students in all grades from primary to secondary schools. i-SAFE has educated over 8.5 million students nationwide and has cooperative agreement with many of the State Dept. of Education(s) and Districts in all 50 states including schools in Washington DC to name a few: Sidwell Friends School; St. Patricks Episcopal Day School; Woodridge Elementary; Woodridge High School & St. Peters Interparish School.  i-SAFE fulfills a vital role in the digital age and global information society, throughout the United States by empowering Internet users with the knowledge and awareness needed to garner the most benefit from Information and Communications Technologies (ICTs) and the Internet via safe, responsible, ethical and legal use.  Beginning in 2009 Congress mandated that elementary and secondary schools receiving E-Rate discounts must submit a certification to the Federal Communications Commission that as part of their Internet safety policy they are ``educating minors about appropriate online behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms and cyber bullying awareness and response. i-SAFE can provide to every school, throughout the United States the ``E-Rate Certification Compliance Package''. This package includes all classroom curriculum that is mandated to be taught through the Legislation mandate of the Broadband Act.  Funding will be used to expand the i-SAFE curriculum to more students and classrooms throughout the nation as well as implement the ``E-Rate Compliance Package'' into schools throughout the nation.  This request will also allow i-SAFE to provide, on a quarterly basis, student assessment data (i.e., metrics) to the district/schools upon request allowing them to have metrics on students behavioral attitudes towards online safety.  This Administration is focused on providing every student and school(s) the ability to communicate and learn through today's 21st century communication. Safety is a key component for schools that provide students with the means to access online information and services within their learning environment in the classroom. Education is the diadem to the success of students being empowered with the knowledge of learning safe and responsible tactics as a citizen in today's global economy. The only environment that is conducive for every student, regardless of age, race or socio-economic, to deploy such global education, is that of the classroom. To date, over 8.5 million students nationwide have acquired the critical thinking and decision-making skills to ensure safe online behavior. The efficacy of the i-SAFE program has proven invaluable to the tax payers nationwide.                          ____________________
