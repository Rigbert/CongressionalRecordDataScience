Speaker, I rise today to introduce legislation which seeks to clear the name of Dr. Samuel A. Mudd and set aside his conviction for harboring John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln. Due to the tremendous amount of controversy over Dr. Mudd's conviction, his case was reviewed by five high-ranking civilian employees of the Department of the Army in January, 1992. After all the testimony and evidence was presented, the civilian panel unanimously declared Dr. Mudd innocent of the charges. However, without commenting on the facts in this case, the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Army declined to accept this decision based on jurisdictional grounds. I believe that Dr. Mudd deserves an official exoneration, and that the Department of the Army should follow the recommendations of its own civilian panel, and that of two former Presidents.  On April 14, 1865 President Lincoln was assassinated at Ford's Theater by the actor, John Wilkes Booth. Following the extensive manhunt for Booth that ensued, on April 21, 1865, Dr. Samuel Mudd, a gentleman farmer and physician, living in Southern Maryland, was arrested for ``aiding and comforting'' Booth. Specifically, he was accused of setting Booth's leg which was broken when he jumped off the balcony onto the stage at Ford's Theater.  Dr. Mudd was represented by General Thomas Ewing, Jr., who served in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1870's, representing Lancaster, OH. Because President Lincoln was also Commander in Chief, Dr. Mudd was tried before a military commission, known as the Hunter Commission. Although he was found guilty, Dr. Mudd was imprisoned, not hung as were four of Booth's alleged co-conspirators. After being imprisoned in the Dry Tortugas for 4 years, President Andrew Jackson pardoned him because of his devoted medical care of prisoners and guards in a yellow fever epidemic.  For more than 75 years now, Dr. Richard Mudd, the grandson of Dr. Samuel Mudd, has been working to have his grandfather's conviction set aside. He is now 96 years old and has devoted his entire adult life to this very important and worthy cause. His efforts to have the Department of the Army set aside the conviction have been, and continue to be, grounded in fact and have substantial support among historians throughout the Nation. Moreover, former Presidents Carter and Reagan have both written letters proclaiming their belief that Dr. Mudd was innocent.  In July, 1990, at the urging of Senator Biden, the Judge Advocate General of the U.S. Army determined that the U.S. Army Board of Correction of Military Records [ABCMR] had the jurisdiction to review such a case and to determine the feasibility of setting aside the conviction. For 2 years, the Mudd family collected historical information and prepared their case, which was presented to the Army in January, 1992. Their argument that Dr. Mudd's conviction should be set aside was based on the premise that the Army did not have jurisdiction over a civilian, who had a constitutional right to be tried by a jury of his peers in civil court. Moreover, his due process rights, they argued, had been violated because insufficient evidence of his guilt had been presented to the military commission.  Mr. Speaker, the five member board unanimously found that Dr. Mudd's conviction should be set aside and recommended such action to the Secretary of the Army. They had determined that the Hunter Commission of 1865 did not have the jurisdictional authority to try Dr. Samuel Mudd and that he had suffered a ``gross infringement of his constitutional rights.'' These jurisdictional arguments were bolstered by a Supreme Court decision in 1886 that a citizen of the United States, who was not a member of the armed forces, could not be tried by the military when the civil courts are open and functioning. However, in a surprise decision in July, 1992, Acting Assistant Secretary William D. Clark declined to adopt the Board's recommendation. While this decision was appealed in August, 1992, no further action was taken until March, 1996.  In March, 1996, as over 130 years had passed since the assassination of President Lincoln, Assistant Secretary Sara Lister declined to adopt the board's recommendation to set aside Dr. Mudd's conviction, adding that her decision did not ``involve the substantive aspects of whether Dr. Mudd was actually guilty or innocent.'' Rather, Assistant Secretary Lister found that it was improper to attempt to retry this case or determine the feasibility and appropriateness of a decision made over 100 years earlier. She thus found that she did not have the appropriate jurisdiction to set aside Dr. Mudd's conviction. She determined that ``It would be inappropriate for the Army to administratively correct the record of conviction or attempt to alter legal history by non-judicial means.''  However, Mr. Speaker, for those of us who believe that there is significant evidence and information proving Dr. Mudd's innocence, therefore agreeing with the ABCMR's 1992 decision, we cannot stand idly by and allow this conviction to stand. If the facts are clear and conclusive, as the ABCMR found in 1992 and as former Presidents Carter and Reagan have determined, then the Congress must act to set aside the conviction of an innocent man.  Despite the Army's claim that the appropriate time to appeal this decision was 130 years ago, we must understand the hysteria and upheaval that ensued immediately following President Lincoln's tragic assassination. It is clear that the pressure to round up and arrest all of those involved in the assassination led to a conviction that fell far short of meeting the prosecution's burden of proof requirement. Moreover, the process by which Dr. Mudd was found guilty clearly violated his constitutional right to a ``trial by jury.''  Governor Engler and state legislators from Michigan, including Senator William Van Regenmorter, and the Charles County Board of Commissioners in Maryland support efforts to have this conviction overturned. Moreover, there are hundreds of people throughout the Nation who are dedicated to seeing justice served and history recorded accurately in this case. I am introducing this legislation today with my colleague from Illinois, Representative Thomas Ewing, who himself is collaterally related to Samuel Mudd's lawyer. It directs the Secretary of the Army to set aside the conviction and specifically cites the denial of due process of law and insufficient evidence. Because Dr. Mudd was found guilty by a military court, his record can only be cleared by the U.S. Army.  Mr. Speaker, while it is clear that Dr. Mudd did set John Wilkes Booth's broken leg, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that he was either a co-conspirator in the assassination of President Lincoln or even aware of the events which had occurred earlier that evening on Friday, April 14, 1865.  I urge my colleagues to join me in ensuring that history is recorded accurately and that our Nation's most basic individual rights, embodied in the Constitution, are not violated at any time. Dr. Samuel Mudd's name and honor and that of his family, many of whom live in my district, hangs in the balance. We ought to allow the findings and decision of the Army Board of Correction of Military Records, themost reputable and qualified entity to date which has reviewed this case, to stand, thus ending the 132-year-long disservice accorded to Dr. Samuel Mudd.                          ____________________
