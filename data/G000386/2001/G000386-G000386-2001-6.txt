9 billion of tax relief in 2002 for over 36 million taxpayers, or one-third of all income tax payers.  Business owners and entrepreneurs account for 10 million, or 30 percent, of those benefitting from the rate reduction.  When you refuse to accelerate the rate cuts you harm farmers and small business persons. This is because most small business owners and farmers operate their businesses as sole proprietorships, partnerships or ``Sub S'' corporations.  The income of these types of entities is reported directly on the individual tax returns of the owners. Therefore, a rate reduction for individuals reduces taxes for farms and small businesses.  That is why the additional rate reduction under the White House-Centrist plan is so important. In 2002 alone, it injects $17.9 billion of stimulus into our ailing economy and small businesses.  So what would a small business do with these tax savings? Well, considering that most of the recent job growth has come from small businesses, I believe they would hire more people and make more business investments.  We know that 80 percent of the 11.1 million new jobs created between 1994 and 1998 were from businesses with less than 20 employees.  And 80 percent of American businesses have fewer than 20 employees.  This is what I refer to as the ``80-80 Rule'' for supporting rate reductions.  In addition, lowering taxes now would increase a business' cash flow during the current economic slowdown. The higher cash flow would increase the demand for investment and labor.  But don't just take my word for it. Take it from an October 2000 report by the National Bureau of Economic Research, a very well-regarded non-partisan organization, entitled ``Personal Income Taxes and the Growth of Small Firms.''  This report reaches the unambiguous conclusion that when a sole proprietor's marginal tax rate goes up, the rate of growth of his or her business enterprise goes down.  Simply stated, high personal income tax rates discourage the growth of small businesses. And right now, that is the last thing we need.  That is why it is important to do rate reductions the right way, and fully accelerate the 27% rate reduction. We are simply accelerating a decision this Senate made last summer.  We should have confidence in our decision. We know that tax cuts are stimulative.  When working Americans have more of their own income, they feel more financially secure and are more comfortable with spending.  A full reduction of the 27 percent rate to 25 percent is much more stimulative than a reduction that is deferred to 2007, as called for under the Democrat plan.  In closing, let me say who really loses when the Senate loses its right to vote on the White House-Centrist bill. It is our displaced workers, it is our fellow Americans who still have a job and the security of our jobs base; and it is the soundness of our nation's economy.  The Senate Democrat Leadership will not allow an up or down vote on our bipartisan White House-Centrist stimulus package. Why? Because it would pass. We have a majority of Senators who support this package.  Instead, the Senate Democrat Leadership has created a ``make-believe boogey-man'' over the issue of how health care benefits should be delivered to unemployed. But the majority of this Senate does not agree with them.  But voting on this issue and helping the economy recover is not really what is on their minds. It is not their political objective.  The Senate Democratic leadership is playing political brinkmanship, hoping that the American public buys into their excuses for inaction.  The Senate Democratic Leadership keeps their fingers crossed, hoping that our economic difficulties will last until next fall so they can blame it on the President in their campaign ads.  But the blame doesn't go to the President. He has bent over backwards to accommodate their demands. And it still is not enough. The Senate Democratic leadership would rather move the goal post than agree to a solution.  This is not what we were elected by to do. This is not in service of our country. It is in no one's best interest.  We are at war. Our economy is in crisis. And the only impediment to recovery is the refusal of the Senate Democratic leadership to allow this Senate to pass this economic stimulus package. A majority of our members will vote for this bill.  I hope the Senate leadership hears the pleas of the American people and stops blocking this bill through procedural technicalities. The Senate should be allowed to do its job.
