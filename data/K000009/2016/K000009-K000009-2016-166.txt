Speaker, I rise today to recognize the 125th Anniversary of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 8 of Toledo, Ohio. This is an incredibly significant milestone of labor history in Northwest Ohio.  Since 1891, IBEW Local 8 has served northwest Ohio with distinction, providing the highest quality of electrical work and providing power to the residents of Northwest Ohio. Its members continue to dedicate their careers to the advancement of wages, benefits and working conditions for all electrical workers.  IBEW Local 8's skilled technicians are committed to building our communities forward. The deep history of IBEW Local 8 shows that the Toledo Chapter was one of the first-ever locals chartered in the United States, established at the founding of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers nationally.  The skilled men and women of IBEW Local 8 have contributed their time and talents to many notable projects in Northwest Ohio. Committed to quality workmanship, their skills have been critical to the development of industry throughout our region.  IBEW founder Henry Miller envisioned a union of electrical workers banded together toward the goal of improved safety, wages and working conditions for the brotherhood. A century later, his legacy stands tall through the brothers and sisters of Local 8. We offer our heartiest congratulations to IBEW Local 8 in celebration of its rich history and thank you for working to illuminate our world over the last 125 years.                          ____________________
