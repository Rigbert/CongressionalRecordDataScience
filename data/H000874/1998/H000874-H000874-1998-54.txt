Speaker, the gentleman from Arizona did not offer objection. I made a mistake in picking up the wrong piece of paper, having thought the staff had already handed it to the desk, the proper motion. When the incorrect motion, the motion the gentleman and I also discussed, was read, my staff pointed out that I had handed the incorrect paper.  Mr. Speaker, I want to tell my friend I understand his problem. But I also want to tell my friend that we are now cutting a very fine point in terms of knowing full well that I had talked to the gentleman about the motion, I picked up the wrong piece of paper, and I would hope my friend would not put me in a position or the House in a position of an inadvertent picking up of the wrong piece of paper puts us in a position where procedurally we will now be, I think, responding in a way that I think is not going to facilitate the work of the House.
