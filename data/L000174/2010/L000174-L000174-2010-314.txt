President, I am pleased that the Senate today confirmed Julie Brill as Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission, FTC. I have known Julie for her work during nearly 20 years as an Assistant Attorney General from Vermont, and believe that both the FTC and consumers around the country will benefit greatly from her appointment.  Ms. Brill is extremely well qualified to serve as an FTC Commissioner. She graduated from Princeton University and New York University Law School, served as a law clerk to the Vermont Federal Judge Franklin Billings, and served both as an Assistant Attorney General in Vermont and General Counsel of the Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance and Securities. Most recently, Ms. Brill worked as Senior Deputy Attorney General of the Consumer Protection Division in the North Carolina Department of Justice. Over her professional career, Ms. Brill has worked on critical issues in agriculture, tobacco, food, pharmaceuticals, and identity theft. Her expertise and intelligence have allowed her to excel in all of these areas.  The FTC has an important role in protecting consumers from unfair and deceptive trade practices as well as anticompetitive behavior by businesses. Ms. Brill will serve consumers well in her new position as a Commissioner.  Ms. Brill has spent much of her professional life working on behalf of the people of Vermont, and I look forward to continuing to work with her as she helps to advance Chairman Leibowitz's active agenda. I know her family, and was delighted to introduce her at her confirmation hearing. I congratulate Ms. Brill on her confirmation.                          ____________________
