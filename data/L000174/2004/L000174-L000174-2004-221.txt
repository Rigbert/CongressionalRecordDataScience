President, we have heated debates, and we have times when we are happy and times when we are not here in the Senate. Today is a happy day. I am pleased that later I will be able to cast my vote in favor of Peter Hall for confirmation to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. I know this will be a nomination that will be strongly supported on both sides of the aisle.  Mr. Hall is going to fill the Green Mountain State's seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He currently serves as the U.S. Attorney. He was nominated by President Bush. He has strong support not only of Governor Douglas but the entire Vermont delegation. I commend both the Republican and Democratic leadership for working out an accommodation that makes it possible to vote on his nomination.  By tradition, there is a Vermont seat on the Second Circuit. It is currently vacant. The reason it is vacant is because of the sudden and tragic death of the last judge to hold the seat, the late Fred Parker. Judge Parker was appointed to the U.S. District Court for Vermont in 1990 by the first President Bush. That was done on the strong recommendation of Senator Jeffords and with my support. He was a well-known Republican in Vermont, and he served as the deputy attorney general for the State of Vermont.  After distinguished service on the District Court bench, he was appointed by President Clinton to the Second Circuit with the strong support of Senator Jeffords. President Clinton knew that Fred Parker was a well-known Republican, but he also knew of his qualifications and of the high esteem in which he was held in Vermont, and so he nominated Judge Parker to the Second Circuit, and he was confirmed by the Senate.  I mention that because over the years Senator Jeffords and I--and before that Senator Stafford of Vermont and I--have tried to keep partisan politics out of the Judiciary. If you look at the quality of the people we recommended, you will see we have actually been quite successful in doing that. Fred Parker was such an example. He was a good man, a good lawyer, and a good judge. We were in Georgetown Law School together. I knew him from that time. He was in the Marine Corps. I knew him from then until his untimely death last year. I knew him to be a man of integrity and intelligence. He served the courts and the people of Vermont with dedication and fairness, and we miss him.  Peter Hall has big shoes to fill, but both from what everyone knows about him and from what I know personally in having worked with him, he is completely up to the job. He did have a couple strikes against him. He had the nerve to be born in one of those Southern States, Connecticut. He went all the way even further south to North Carolina for college, and then he attended law school in New York. But we decided to forgive him for those missteps in his career because he came to his senses as soon as he graduated from law school, and then he moved to Vermont. He has been there long enough to be considered a Vermonter.  He clerked for the well-respected Judge Albert Coffrin of the U.S. District Court for the District of Vermont.  We are a small State. When I first started practicing law, it was in Judge Coffrin's law firm, before he became a member of the bench. He was a good friend. His widow still lives in Vermont. He was without a doubt one of the most respected and one of the best trial judges we have had.  Peter Hall, showing the wisdom he has demonstrated, stayed in Vermont from that day forth. His career and the exemplary way he served the U.S. Government in the law are admirable.  After he completed his clerkship with Judge Coffrin, he joined the U.S. attorney's office in Vermont. He was a Federal prosecutor the next 18 years. He rose to the position of first assistant, later being named U.S. Attorney. During those years, he has gained invaluable trial experience so beneficial for any judge. He learned about Federal criminal law.  I was a prosecutor, so of course I always have a soft spot for someone who served as a prosecutor.  His resume is not limited to Government service. In 1986, he began a 15-year career in the private practice of law, focusing on civil practice, with a particular emphasis on mediation, showing a talent for that. He also used his time during that period to serve the bar. He provided ethics training to Vermont State prosecutors. He held the office of president of the Vermont Bar Association, and in that office as former prosecutor, advocated for funding for public defenders for equal access to justice.  In the best sense of those who make the best judges, he found time for pro bono work, getting involved in the Vermont family court system. He served as guardian ad litem for children caught up in disputes between their parents.  In 2001, President Bush nominated Peter Hall to be the U.S. Attorney for Vermont. His record in that office is one all prosecutors should hope to have, a tough but a fair prosecutor. I supported Peter's nomination to the U.S. Attorney's office. I support him now.  Lest there be any question, let us have no misunderstanding about Peter's party affiliation: He is a Republican through and through. From 1986 to 1993 he was variously a member of the town of Chittenden, Rutland County, and State of Vermont Republican committees and a member of the National Republican Party. He has helped run statewide Republican campaigns, and was an elected Republican official for 5 years, holding one of the most important offices a citizen in Vermont can hold, a member of the Select Board of the Town of Chittenden. Incidentally, Chittenden is named after the first Governor of Vermont, Thomas Chittenden. He was recommended to the President by Vermont's Republican Governor. Governor Douglas noted in his letter of support to this nomination, that Peter is ``a dedicated public servant, a strong leader and will be an asset to the Second Circuit.''  I ask consent the Governor's letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                             State of Vermont,                                       Office of the Governor,                                                   March 10, 2004.     Hon. Orrin G. Hatch,     Chairman,     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Ranking Democratic Member, U.S. Senate, Committee on the          Judiciary, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: I am writing to express my strongest support      for U.S. Attorney Peter Hall for appointment to the U.S.      Court of Appeals, 2nd Circuit.       Peter's record of service of the people of Vermont is      exemplary. As U.S. Attorney, he has been a strong and      effective leader in Vermont's anti-terrorism effort. Peter      has been a principal organizer in promoting ``Operation Safe      Commerce,'' an international initiative aimed to track and      monitor cargo shipments that could be susceptible to      terrorist attacks.       In addition, Peter has been an active leader in promoting      the President's ``Project Safe Neighborhoods'' initiative      designed to make our streets safer by taking guns out of the      hands of convicted felons.       I unequivocally support Peter for the judgeship. He is a      dedicated public servant, a strong leader, and will be an      asset to the 2nd Circuit.           Sincerely,                                                 James H. Douglas,                                                         Governor.
