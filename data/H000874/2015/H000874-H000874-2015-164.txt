Speaker, I will place a statement into the Congressional Record paying tribute to the memory of my dear friend, Earl Hargrove, who passed earlier this month.  Earl was a very respected figure in Maryland's Fifth District; in Maryland; and, indeed, nationally. He built a successful specialty decorations and event planning business and served our Nation in the Marine Corps.  Everyone has seen Earl Hargrove's work in America because he did many of the inaugural floats for our Presidents; so when you watched television, you were watching the work of Earl Hargrove, his family, and coworkers.  I am honored to celebrate his life and legacy today, and I hope my colleagues will join me in offering condolences to Earl's wife of six decades, Gloria LoveHargrove, and to his children and grandchildren.                          ____________________
