Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 1184, as passed by the Senate, corrects a minor flaw in current passport law. While this flaw is minor in the sense of its legal impact, the possible impact it has had and could have on family members of our brave servicemen and -women who have made the ultimate sacrifice is significant enough that we should move to correct it quickly.  Under current law, the State Department waives passport fees for family members traveling abroad to official grave sites of armed servicemembers. However, the current law does not make a similar exception for family members traveling to attend a funeral or memorial service for a servicemember killed in action and then buried or memorialized overseas. S. 1184 would rightly extend this fee waiver to these families as well.  The ability to attend a funeral or memorial service for one who has paid the ultimate price in the service of our country is just as necessary an aspect of paying our final respects as being able to visit their grave.  Mr. Speaker, the logistical and financial burden imposed by these fees on grieving families can quickly build up. This small flaw in our current law has had large ramifications, and it does a disservice to the families of our fallen heroes and creates undue stress and pain that could easily be corrected.  Correcting this flaw would mean a great deal to those families who have given most. In this regard, I urge that S. 1184 be passed quickly and sent to the President for his signature.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
