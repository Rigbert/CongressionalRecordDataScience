 President, I yield myself 5 minutes, and then I will yield Senator Kyl 5 minutes.  I want my colleagues to reject this amendment. I, like the Senator from New York, agree we need to strengthen and improve Medicare, and I proved that last year with a bipartisan bill on Medicare give-back. Working with Senator Baucus, we put together a $43 billion bill that would have improved health care in rural America and address many of the issues the Senator from New York wants to address as well.  While I support addressing the needs of all Medicare providers, I cannot support doing it in this way in the amendment being proposed. We have to do this in a comprehensive, studied, and targeted way.  Everyone agrees that Medicare needs improving, and most of us would agree that Medicare payments need to be updated, but we do not have agreement on how that should be done. Some, including this Senator, believe that at least some providers need more money, but other Senators who might disagree with me say that providers are doing well and that their funding should be reduced.  Even very recently, we had the nonpartisan Medicare Payment Advisory Committee last week make recommendations to Congress calling for reductions in some provider payments.  I do not take these recommendations as gospel truth, and they are not going to govern my decisionmaking, but I believe we have a responsibility in the Finance Committee to examine all of these issues closely. More important, the only way we get anything done in this body is by a bipartisan approach. So we have to build a consensus before we pass a one-size-fits-all policy such as the one before us. I believe the place to do that is the Finance Committee. We will do our homework. That means listening to providers, beneficiaries, and experts to craft payment adjustments that ensure access to services for Medicare beneficiaries.  I will certainly ensure that the Finance Committee consider my colleague's proposal.
