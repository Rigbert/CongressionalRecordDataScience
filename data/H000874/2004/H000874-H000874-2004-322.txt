Chairman, I appreciate that information.  With respect to the transportation reauthorization bill, can the leader tell me for what length of time we will extend the existing authorization?  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman will yield further, it is just an extension of the authorization. As far as length of time, the bill has not been written yet, but in the discussions that I have been privy to, I am advised that it could very well be about 2 months.
