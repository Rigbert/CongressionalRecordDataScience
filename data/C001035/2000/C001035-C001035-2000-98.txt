President, it is disappointing to hear the rhetoric from some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, implying that if we give our family farmers and our family business owners much needed relief from confiscatory death taxes that we will somehow not be able to afford prescription drug coverage for our senior citizens, or education for our children. That is simply not true. It is disheartening to hear these distortions from some of my colleagues.  I rise today as a longtime supporter of death tax relief for family-owned businesses and farms. In fact, the very first bill I introduced as a Senator in 1997 was to provide targeted estate tax relief for our family-owned businesses. I was very pleased when key elements of my legislation were incorporated into the 1997 tax reform bill.  I first became interested in this issue in my role as director of the Center for Family Business at Husson College in Bangor, ME, where I served prior to coming to the Senate. The center sponsored a seminar on how a family business should plan to pass a business on from generation to generation. It soon became very clear to me that a major obstacle to this goal, and a significant reason why so few family businesses survive to the second, third, or fourth generation, is the onerous estate tax.  To illustrate this fact, let me share with my colleagues the story of Judy Vallee of Portland, ME. Ms. Vallee's father started a restaurant in Portland, ME. He worked very hard. The whole family worked hard. Eventually he was able to build his business from one restaurant in Portland, ME, to a chain of 25 restaurants up and down the east coast.  Unfortunately, he died. The family was hit with a whopping estate tax bill of about $1 million--a bill they simply did not have the cash to pay because their assets were tied up in these restaurants. The result was the dismantling of this business, this very successful family business, which Mr. Vallee had labored a lifetime to build.  The ultimate result was that the family was forced to sell off all the restaurants but the one they started with in Portland. That is simply wrong. It is unfair when our tax policy forces a family to dismantle a lifetime of work. It is unfair that a parent cannot pass on to the next generation the fruits of that hard work.  The need for death tax relief is something that small businesses and farmers tell me about every time I am back home in Maine. And that is every weekend. I recently talked with auto dealers from all over the State, including an auto dealer in Bangor, ME, who has built a successful business that he very much wants to leave to his sons.  I have also talked with funeral directors, with bakery owners, with lumber dealers--with a host of businesses of all sizes and kinds throughout the State--who simply have the goal of working hard, creating jobs, building their businesses, and being able to leave those businesses to the next generation. Many of these businesses are capital intensive but cash poor. That is why they are hit so hard when the owner dies and they are subjected to onerous estate tax rates.  In many small towns throughout the State of Maine, these family businesses are the heart and the soul of the community. They are the businesses that support the United Way, sponsor the Little League team, and contribute generously to other local community-based charities. They are the businesses that are always there to help because they employ their friends, their neighbors, and their family members. They are so closely linked to the economy of the small towns in which they exist.  I know that small business owners across the State of Maine were so pleased to see the House of Representatives approve H.R. 8 last month withsuch a strong bipartisan vote. I stress, the vote was, indeed, broad based and bipartisan. A total of 65 House Democrats--both moderate and liberal Members--constituting more than 30 percent of the entire House Democratic caucus, joined Republicans in voting for the bill.  Here in the Senate there is also broad bipartisan support for the death tax relief bill introduced by my friend and colleague, Senator Jon Kyl, who has been such a leader in this effort.  As a matter of sound, long-term tax policy, H.R. 8 seeks to make a very fundamental and noteworthy change to the Tax Code. It recognizes that it is the sale of the asset, not the death of the owner, that should trigger a Federal tax. H.R. 8 would establish the principle that if family members inherit assets or property--a family business or a farm, for example--the Federal Government would tax those assets when they are sold by the heirs by imposing a capital gains tax.  Furthermore, the legislation before us would allow the Government to use the decedent's basis for determining the taxable amount of the inherited assets. So if a family businessperson dies and leaves the assets and property of their business to his or her children, they can continue running the business if they choose to do so without having to worry about the Federal Government's death tax bill forcing them to break up the business or sell the farm. This change would represent a giant step forward for many small businesses and family farms throughout Maine and the country.  There are two other points that I want to make about the impact of the death tax. The first is that it has a very unfortunate impact on jobs. The National Association of Women Business Owners, a group I was pleased to work with in my time with the Small Business Administration, has written a letter endorsing passage of this legislation. This organization surveyed many of its members and found that, on average, 39 jobs per business, or 11,000 jobs of those businesses surveyed, have already been lost due to the planning and the payment of the death tax. You can multiply that death tax time and again to see the deleterious impact of the death tax on job creation.  I know a bag manufacturer in northern Maine who told me that he spends tens of thousands of dollars each year on life insurance in order to be prepared in case he dies so that his family would not be hit by the estate tax. That is money he would like to invest right back into his business in order to hire more people or to buy new equipment or to expand his company. But instead, he is having to divert this money into planning for the estate tax. That is a point that is missed by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle.  They claim that only 2 percent of the people are affected by the estate tax. In fact, it is so many more than that because of businesses that spend tens of thousands of dollars each year on life insurance or estate tax planning in order to avoid the imposition of the death tax.  The second point that I want to make is the impact of the death tax on the concentration of economic power in this country. I think this is an issue that has been largely overlooked in this debate.  When a small business is sold because the children cannot afford to pay the death tax, it is usually sold to a large out-of-State corporation which is not subject to the death tax. When that happens, it generally results in layoffs for local employees, diminished commitment to the community, and a greater concentration of economic power. Surely, we should not want that to be the result of our Federal tax policy.  The time has come for Congress to act this year to provide overdue death tax relief to our Nation's small businesses and family farms.  In doing so, we will take a giant step forward in making our tax policy far fairer. No longer will it be the death of an owner that triggers the imposition of tax but, rather, the sale of the asset when income is realized. That makes so much more sense as a matter of tax policy. We will also be telling people who have worked so hard over a lifetime to build their business that we, too, believe in the American dream.  I yield back any time I may have remaining, and I yield the floor.                          ____________________
