Speaker, for the last 14 years, I have been the proud sponsor of an Annual Congressional Black History Month Breakfast. Each year, it has been a privilege to hear the remarks of many distinguished guest speakers and this morning was no exception. The honored speaker for this year's breakfast was the Honorable Eric Holder, U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. I found Mr. Holder's remarks insightful, thought provoking, and timely. Therefore, I am proud to submit his statement for the Record.                          Black History Speech                            (By Eric Holder)       In discussing black history we must always be cognizant of      its continuing nature and we are obligated to assess where      black America stands at the time of that discussion. Though I      would like to talk today about the concept of, and importance      of, black history I would also like to discuss the black      present. The past and the present are inextricably bound and      to understand either, one must comprehend both. History      should be used as a tool in trying to understand a present      that seems at times to be frightening and illogical. It is my      belief that the seeds of our inner cities present distress      are found in the manner in which this nation has dealt with      its black population over the years. But we must also      acknowledge that this same population has done much in recent      years to contribute to its present negative condition. The      study of black history is a means by which we can understand      and plan for a better black future. To look forward one must      also look back.       Let me start with the present. Black America today stands      at a crossroads. A valiant past filled with courage and      struggle is being replaced with a present replete with      irresponsible behavior and an almost passive acceptance of      negative actions in general and of violence in particular.      Black Americans, like too many others in our society, have      become all too willing to blame others for their situation.      It is definitely true that government has not done all that      it could, or should, have done in the recent past. But a      study of black history indicates that we have frequently had      to deal with governmental indifference or outright hostility.      This did not stop our striving in the past, cannot be used an      excuse in the present, and must not inhibit our growth as a      people in the future. We black Americans must commit      ourselves to responsible behavior and do all that we can to      retard the growth of the culture of violence that so grips      many of our communities.       It is time for black America to come to grips with the      crime and violence problem that destroys so many promising,      young black lives. Put quite simply, it is time for black      people to begin to identify with, and work with, the forces      that are fighting to make our streets safe.      The preoccupation with criminal defendants and the abject      neglect of criminal victims is in some ways a moral      indictment of our community. This concern was      understandable in a past where people of color were      systemically, routinely and legally denied the rights to      which they were obviously entitled. But in a present where      at least the legal impediments to equality have been      largely erased, such concerns are largely misplaced. I am      not naive, however. Black people must be ever vigilant to      insure that all of our people, criminal defendants      included, are always treated in the same constitutional      manner as all other Americans. But for too long we have      sought to excuse that which we know to be wrong and in the      process have ignored the real pain suffered by members of      our own community. The overwhelming majority of crime      committed by black defendants is directed at other black      people. Over 90% of the nation's black homicide victims,      for example, were killed by other black people. This is      truly a sad part of black history but is an aspect of our      existence in this country that must be explored and      honestly discussed if the next chapters in our story are      to be filled with hope and progress.       We must also strive to curb other voluntary conduct that      threatens the very existence of our people. The plagues of      AIDS and unwed births that so affect the black community, for      example, are the products of irresponsible sexual conduct.      Because this conduct is voluntary it can, and should, be      rather easily controlled. I understand that in things sexual      and personal we must tread lightly but is it not painfully      clear that by being just a little more responsible these      problems could be cured? We must insure that we do all we can      to reduce the rate of black unwed births in our nation that      now stands at 67%--two out of every three black babies are      born into this condition. In some parts of Washington that      figure rises to over 80%--four out of every five babies. This      plague tears at the fabric that has traditionally bound us      together. It inhibits the development of the black community      by stunting the growth of both the mother and the child      itself. A recent study showed that women who became mothers      when they were married, over 21 and high school graduates      gave birth to children who lived in poverty about 10% of the      time. By contrast, women who were under 21, high school      dropouts and not married gave birth to children 79% of whom      lived in poverty. There is little dispute that there is a      direct line between poverty and the social problems that so      bedevil us. As you can see, at least a part of the poverty      problem is self inflicted and could be controlled by self      restraint.       In the current discussion about unwed births, welfare      reform and values we too frequently focus on women as if they      created children without the assistance of men. We must never      stigmatize the women in our community who valiantly struggle      against great odds to raise good kids and we must always love      all of our children whatever the marital status of their      parents. But we must recognize that this is a problem. And we      must acknowledge the irresponsibility of men in this      situation. When I was a judge at the District of Columbia      Superior Court it was striking to me to find that virtually      every young man who came before me in a criminal case did not      have a man who was meaningfully involved in his life. As the      United States Attorney for this city I have been struck by      the way in which children have responded to the men in our      office, both black and white, in our outreach efforts. We      have programs with elementary schools in the city and it is      in some ways sad to see our youngsters, black youngsters,      cling to the men in my office for the support and guidance      they should be receiving from their fathers at home. In any      discussion of our situation we must      focus more on absentee fathers. We cannot hope to have our      young boys grow up to be good men without role models to      emulate. And the best role model is not an athlete, not an      entertainer and not a United States Attorney. The best      role model is a father at home who devotes himself to the      child he has brought into the world. An army of these kind      of fathers would probably do more to cure our social      problems than all the government programs we might ever      devise. We must somehow force the concept of family back      into the consciousness of the men who are now too willing      to create children but not willing to help raise them.       Moving from a partial examination of the black present to a      look into the black past one finds that the history of black      America and the history of this nation are inextricably tied      to each other. It is for this reason that the study of black      history is important to everyone-black or white. For example,      the history of the United States in the nineteenth century      revolves around a resolution of the question of how America      was going to deal with its black inhabitants. The great      debates of that era and the war that was ultimately fought      are all centered around the issue of, initially, slavery and      then the reconstruction of the vanquished region. A dominant      domestic issue throughout the twentieth century has been,      again, America's treatment of its black citizens. The civil      rights movement of the 1950's and 1960's changed America in      truly fundamental ways. Americans of all colors were forced      to examine basic beliefs and long held views. Even so, most      people, who are not conversant with history, still do not      really comprehend the way in which that movement transformed      America. In racial terms the country that existed before the      civil rights struggle is almost unrecognizable to us today.      Separate public facilities, separate entrances, poll taxes,      legal discrimination, in essence an American apartheid, all      were part of an America that the movement destroyed.       In addition, the other major social movements of the latter      half of this century-feminism, the nation's treatment of      other minority groups, even the anti-war effort are all tied      in some way to the spirit that was set free by the civil      rights movement. Those other movements may have occurred in      the absence of the civil rights struggle but the fight for      black equality came first and helped to shape the way in      which other groups of people came to think of themselves and      to raise their desire for equal treatment. Further, many of      the tactics that were used by these other groups were      developed in the civil rights movement.       And today the link between the black experience and this      country is still evident. While the problems that presently      afflict the      [[Page E465]] black community may be more severe, they are an      indication of where the rest of the nation may be if      corrective measures are not quickly taken. For example, the      rate of white unwed births has risen dramatically in recent      years, continues to rise and now stands at almost 30%. The      level of violence now found in once quiet suburbs is alarming      and further demonstrates that our past, present and future      are linked. It is not safe for this nation to assume that      unaddressed social problems in the poorest parts of our      country will not ultimately affect the larger society.       Black history is extremely important because it is American      history. Given this, it is in some ways sad that there is a      need for a black history month. Though we are all enlarged by      our study and knowledge of the roles played by blacks in      American history, and though there is a crying need for all      of us to know and acknowledge the contributions of black      America, a black      history month is a testament to the problem that has      afflicted blacks throughout our stay in this country.      Black history is given a separate and clearly not equal      treatment by our society in general and by our educational      institutions in particular. [It is only given a month (the      only month with 28 days!) of recognition.] As a former      American history major I am struck by the fact that such a      major part of our national story has been divorced from      the whole. In law, culture, science, sports, industry and      other fields, knowledge of the rules played by blacks is      critical to an understanding of the American experiment.      For too long we have been too willing to segregate the      study of black history. There is clearly a need at present      for a device that focuses the attention of the country on      the study of the history of its black citizens. But we      must endeavor to integrate black history into our culture      and into our curriculums in ways in which it has never      occurred before so that the study of black history, and a      recognition of the contributions of black Americans,      become commonplace. Until that time, Black History Month      must remain an important, vital concept. But we have to      recognize that until black history is included in the      standard curriculum in our schools and becomes a regular      part of all our lives, it will be viewed as a novelty,      relatively unimportant and not as weighty as so called      ``real'' American history.       I was invited to speak to you today because some consider      me, the first black person to be named United States Attorney      for the District of Columbia, a part of black history. We do      a great disservice to the concept of black history      recognition if we do not acknowledge that my appointment      cannot be viewed in isolation. I stand on the shoulders of      many other black Americans, all of whom should be widely      known to all Americans: admittedly, the identities of some of      these people, through the passage of time, have become lost      to us--the men, and women, who labored long in fields, who      were later legally and systemically discriminated against,      who were lynched by the hundreds in this century and those      others who have been too long denied the fruits of our great      American culture. But the names of others of these people      should strike a resonant chord in the historical ear of all      in our nation: Frederick Douglas, W.E.B. DuBois, Walter      White, Langston Hughes, Marcus Garvey, Martin Luther King,      Malcolm X, Joe Louis, Jackie Robinson, Paul Robeson, Ralph      Ellison, James Baldwin, Maya Angelou, Toni Morrison, Ralph      Bunche, Rosa Parks, Marion Anderson, Emmit Till. These are      just some of the people who should be generally recognized      and are just some of the people to whom all of us, black and      white, owe such a debt of gratitude. It is on the broad      shoulders that I stand as I hope that others will some day      stand on my more narrow ones.       Black history is a subject worthy of study by all      Americans. To truly comprehend this country you must have      knowledge of its constituent parts. Black Americans have      played a pivotal role in the development of this nation.      Perhaps the greatest strength of the United States is the      diversity of its people. But an unstudied or misunderstood      diversity can become a divisive force. An appreciation of the      unique black past, acquired through the study of black      history, will help lead to understanding and compassion in      the present, where it is so sorely needed, and to a future      where all of our people are truly valued.                               ____________________
