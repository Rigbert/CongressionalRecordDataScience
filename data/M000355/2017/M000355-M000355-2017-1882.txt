  Tonight we will vote on the nomination of Mike Pompeo to be Director of the CIA. He enjoys overwhelming support to be confirmed, just as we know that many other Cabinet nominees command sufficient support as well. So let us confirm them now and never forget the way Republicans worked with the administration of former President Obama to confirm seven members of his Cabinet the day he took office and nearly his entire Cabinet within 2 weeks.  Both parties appear to agree that our economy, our health care, and our politics need fixing so let us get down to fixing them. Let us join hands and move forward. The American people are ready for solutions, and after 8 long years, they are ready for Democrats to work with Republicans to deliver them.                          ____________________
