  I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this historic conference report.  In my remarks yesterday I thanked the various staff members on both sides of the aisle for their outstanding work.  Also I ask unanimous consent an editorial in today's Wall Street Journalcalled ``Dead Men Voting'' about the scandal unfolding in South Dakota be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 16, 2002]                Voter Fraud Wanders Off the Reservation                           (By John H. Fund)       Today the Senate will approve and send to President Bush a      landmark bill that will upgrade voting machines and begin to      curb the voter fraud that is creeping into too many close      elections. It can't come soon enough. Last week, a massive      vote-fraud scandal broke out in a Senate race in Tom      Daschel's home state of South Dakota that could determine      control of that body.       The FBI and state authorities are investigating hundreds of      possible cases of voter registration and absentee ballot      fraud. Attorney General Mark Barnett, a Republican, says the      probe centers on or near Indian reservations. ``All of those      counties are being flooded with new voters, ``says Adele      Enright, the Democratic auditor of Dewey County. ``We just      got a huge envelope of 350 absentee ballot applications      postmarked from the Sioux Falls office of the Democratic      Party.''       Steve Aberle, the Dewey County state's attorney, says, many      of the applications are in the same handwriting. At least one      voter, Richard Maxon, says his signature was forged. Mr.      Aberle, a Democrat with relatives in the Cheyenne River      Tribe, says many Native Americans have wanted little to do      with ``the white man's government.'' But this year many      tribal elections have been scheduled for Nov. 5, the same day      as the critical election for Democrat Tim Johnson's Senate      seat. A Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee memo last      month noted that the ``party has been working closely with      the Native population to register voters and Senator Johnson      has set up campaign offices on every reservation.''       More and more counties are uncovering fraud. Rapid City      officials are investigating two brothers who may have forged      registrations. Denise Red Horse of Ziebach County died Sept.      3 in a car crash. But both Ziebach and Dewey counties found      separate absentee-ballot applications from her dated Sept. 21      in bundles of applications mailed from Democratic      headquarters. Maka Duta, who worked for the Democratic Party      collecting registrations in Ziebach, bought a county history      book that contains many local names. Some are turning up in      the pile of new registrations. At least nine absentee ballot      requests have been returned by the post office. Mable Romero      says she receive a registration card for her three-year-old      granddaughter, Ashley. Some voters claim to have been offered      cash to register to vote. In both Dewey and Ziebach counties,      the number of registered voters easily exceeds the number of      residents over 18 counted by the 2000 census.       Renee Dross, an election clerk for Shannon County, says her      office has received some 1,100 new voter registrations in a      county with only 10,000 people. ``Many were clearly signed by      the same person,'' she says. Some registrants actually live      in neighboring Nebraska. As in most states, South Dakotans      are on an ``honor system'' and don't show photo ID to      register or vote. Only the unprecedented flood of      applications raised any suspicions.       State Democrats told the Christian Science Monitor they      expect 10,000 new votes from the Indian reservations this      year. In 1996, Sen. Johnson won by only 8,600 votes. Russell      LaFountain, the director of Native Vote 2008, says his      organizers are encouraging ``strong absentee balloting.''      Pine Ridge Reservation residents told me that 11 workers are      being paid $14 an hour to contact voters. The statewide      Indian voter project is run by Brian Drapeaux and Rich      Gordon, two former staffers for Sen. Daschle. Democratic      officials say they've fired Ms. Duta and claim they were the      first to bring the fraud to light. Ms. Enright, the Dewey      County auditor, says that claim isn't true and is ``pure      spin.''       Voter fraud isn't unknown on reservations. Democrats have      often given out free tickets to Election Day picnics for      voters on the Pine Ridge Reservation, where 63% of people      live below the poverty level. In 1998, that prompted U.S.      Attorney Karen Schreier, a Democrat, and Attorney General      Barnett, a Republican, to write an unusual joint letter to      county auditors noting that ``simply offering to provide''      food or gifts ``in exchange for showing up to vote is clearly      against the law.'' Amazingly, Kate Looby, the Democratic      candidate for secretary of state this year, has criticized      laws barring the holding of picnics for those who vote. She      also wants to drop restrictions on absentee voting.       Making voting easy is desirable, but only if legitimate      voters don't have their civil right cancelled out by those      who shouldn't vote. In 1980, only about 5% of voters      nationwide cast absentee or early ballots. Now nearly 20% do.      ``Absentee voting is the preferred choice of those who commit      voter fraud,'' says Larry Sabato, a professor at the      University of Virginia. He suggests media outlets set up      ``campaign corruption hotlines'' and begin taking voter fraud      seriously. The Miami Herald won a Pulitzer Prize in 1998      after its stories on how 56 absentee-ballot ``vote brokers''      forged ballots in a Miami election. The sitting mayor was      removed from office.       In Texas, Democrat state Rep. Debra Danburg, who chairs the      state House elections panel, has tried without success to      reform absentee-ballot laws that are so loose she says they      make ``elderly voters a target group for fraud.'' Eric      Mountain of the Dallas County district attorney's office says      some campaigns have paid vote brokers $10 to $15 a ballot.      Many seniors are visited at home and persuaded to have      someone mark an absentee ballot for them. Others have      absentee ballots stolen from their mailboxes.       The law Congress is passing addresses some of the problems      the federal government created with the 1994 Motor Voter Law.      Let's hope the latest scandal in South Dakota--uncovered only      due to incredibly sloppy cheating--prompts states to examine      their own absentee-ballot laws so they will stop being      treated as an engraved invitation to fraud.                                  ____                               Exhibit 1       Thank you to the following organizations for their      significant contributions and steadfast support:       Election Center;       National Association of Secretaries of State;       National Association of Counties;       National Conference of State Legislatures;       National Association of State Election Directors; and       National Association of County Recorders, Election      Officials and Clerks.                           challenge ballots
