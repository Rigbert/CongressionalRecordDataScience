Speaker, on September 20, 2003, Port Clinton, Ohio will mark its 175th anniversary. The town along the shores of Lake Erie will celebrate this milestone with a daylong party featuring historic re-enactors, old-fashioned food and contests, a parade and fireworks. The city will pay tribute to its fishing and boating heritage focusing on a display of vintage Lake Erie boats, fried fish dinners, and a giant walleye shaped birthday cake.  In our nation's infancy, New York statesman and the father of the Erie Canal DeWitt Clinton suggested a canal from the Portage River in Northwest Ohio down to the Ohio River in Cincinnati. Although the canal was not built, four years later in June of 1828, Ezekiel Haines founded Port Clinton at the proposed canal's beginning. He named the town he founded in honor of DeWitt Clinton in tribute to Mr. Clinton's vision. The town lay on the Eastern edge of Northwest Ohio's Great Black Swamp and was home to many tribes of Native Americans who hunted and fished its marshes and waterways. Fishing was the mainstay of the town's first settlers, and remains so today.  The city has many marinas, and boats were built in Port Clinton until 1974. Although they are no longer built in the community, Port Clinton's marinas are home for many commercial and recreational boats and the docks of the Port Clinton Fish Company are still in service. Even though it has developed through the decades into a commercial center and home to business, industry, and tourism, Port Clinton has never lost its flavor as a small lake town. Superbly situated between Lake Erie and beautiful natural refuges, Port Clinton remains an idyllic waterfront community. I join with its residents in proudly sharing its 175th birthday.                          ____________________
