Speaker, I appreciate the recognition to speak on the resolution.  Article 1, section 9 of the Constitution states that ``No money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law.''  It is the fiscal duty of the Congress to appropriate the money necessary to provide the funds needed to support the execution of programs and operations of the Federal Government. To date, only five of these important measures have been considered.  The failure of this unrealistic budget resolution is especially true in respect to the fiscal year 2003 Labor, Health and Human Services, Education and Related Agencies appropriations bill in its funding for education. This inaction has hampered this body's constitutional duty.                              {time}  1500  Mr. Speaker, this inaction has hampered this body's constitutional duty and impinged its integrity. President Bush dedicated significant amounts of time and public dialogue during his first months in office to the passage of H.R. 1, the Leave No Child Behind Act. It specifically authorized large increases in a number of key educational programs. However, within weeks of signing the bill, the President submitted a budget that stopped 6 years of steady progress. His budget director now insists that if Congress exceeds the budget request by even the smallest amount, the President will veto the entire appropriations bill.  Mr. Speaker, section 702 of House rule IX, entitled ``The General Principles,'' concluded that certain matters of business arising under the Constitution mandatory in nature for the House have been held to have a privilege which supersedes the rules establishing the order of business. The powers of raising revenue and appropriating funds is the question of the House's constitutional authority and is therefore privileged in nature, especially given the importance of this funding to the future of our Nation.  The future of our labor force and our economy is heavily dependent on elevating the education and skills of future workers. The achievement gap between students who are at risk and the rest of the student population remains large and has failed to close.  It is not only the prerogative of this Chamber but its constitutional duty for the House to take action on the Labor, Health and Human Services and Labor bill. The Congress has provided States with an unfunded mandate by approving H.R. 1 without the necessary financial resources to fund it. The majority of this body voted for H.R. 1, and we should deserve to be heard.  Mr. Speaker, my question of privilege regards the integrity of our proceedings as a House as prescribed by the Constitution. The U.S. Constitution conveys upon this body the power to originate appropriation measures. It is not only our responsibility, it is our duty and obligation to reinstate this message and this legislation about the importance of education. And I do believe the resolution that I have introduced is privileged in the House.
