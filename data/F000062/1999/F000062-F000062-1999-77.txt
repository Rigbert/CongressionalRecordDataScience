  Ergonomic programs have proven to be effective in reducing repetitive motion injuries in the workplace. Many businesses which have voluntarily instituted an ergonomic program have found the long term benefits to far outweigh the short term costs.  Red Wing Shoes in Minnesota found that their workers' compensation costs dropped 75 percent in the 4 years after they began an ergonomic program.  Fieldcrest-Cannon in Columbus, Georgia, saw the number of workers' suffering from repetitive motion injuries drop from 121 in 1993 to 21 in 1996.  By redesigning its workstations, OshKosh B'Gosh reduced workers' compensation costs by one-third.  Mr. President, I certainly agree that decisions on government regulations should be based on sound science. In this case, there is already a substantial body of scientific evidence which concludes that there is a relationship between MSDs and the workplace and that ergonomic programs can significantly reduce these injuries.  During this decade, more than 6.1 million workers have suffered from serious workplace injuries as a result of ergonomic hazards. As we move into the next century, American workers must be given adequate protection from these preventable injuries. Congress must allow OSHA to move forward with sensible ergonomic regulations. I urge my colleagues to vote to defeat this amendment.
