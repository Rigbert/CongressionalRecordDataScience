Speaker, reclaiming my time, is the gentleman fielding any phone calls in his district about this Government shutdown?  For instance, in my district, Federal prison guards received 1 week's pay for the month of December. They are going to work every day and putting their lives on the line in prisons, guarding dangerous prisoners, and they are being paid for 1 week out of 4 in December.  Does the gentleman consider that punitive to Federal prison guards who are doing their job?
