President, it is my understanding that the Senator from Iowa, Senator Harkin, has come to the floor to offer an amendment that makes reference to the community services block grant funding and the possibility that if we pass a continuing resolution without adequately funding this program, communities all across America will be denied some basic funds they need.  I have made a point, as I travel around my State of Illinois, of asking village presidents and mayors and leaders how this money is used. It turns out to be money that is essential for many programs. It is one of the most unusual programs in that there is such a wide variety of things that are done with these dollars by communities, from afterschool programs for children at risk to programs for senior citizens that are essential for their well-being.  I am sorry I wasn't here earlier to join with Senator Harkin, but I come to the floor in support of his effort. America can do better. We can make certain that we fund these essential programs so that the vulnerable across America are not left behind. If we focus on this, as we should have before Hurricane Katrina--and we will in the future--it is going to be a stronger nation.  I want to make sure my voice is added to that of Senator Harkin in support of this valuable program.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
