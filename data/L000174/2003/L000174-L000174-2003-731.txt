On Friday, Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina and      U.S. Rep. Grace Napolitano, D-Santa Fe Springs, joined a news      conference held by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus to      denounce Estrada and oppose his Senate confirmation to the      second-highest court in the United States.       ``When this gentlemen came before us, we asked specific      questions and he had very little offer,'' said Napolitano,      vice chairwoman of the 20-member caucus. ``He really was a      blank page. This could be our Latino Clarence Thomas.''       But Assemblyman Robert Pacheco, a Republican from the City      of Industry, who was reached by telephone later in the day      Friday, accused the caucus of taking a partisan stand.       ``They don't represent the entire Latino community,'' he      said. ``I'm very upset with the way they're approaching it,      because of the partisan nature.       ``What an opportunity for the Latino community to have      someone in that position who has earned his stripes, having      risen from poverty.''       The news conference was held at the Mexican-American Legal      Defense and Educational Fund's office in Los Angeles. The      organization also is opposing confirmation.       The Senate Judiciary Committee recently approved the      nomination, but some Senate Democrats since then have      launched a filibuster to prevent a vote.       Estrada has served as assistant U.S. solicitor and an      assistant U.S. attorney.       Napolitano said that caucus members had interviewed      Estrada, and he hadn't responded favorably to their questions      on whether he had worked with any minority organizations or      on behalf of minorities and if he had been involved as a      volunteer.       Estrada said no to the questions, she said.       Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Los Angeles, said that      Estrada shouldn't be confirmed to the court just because of      his ethnic origin.       ``We have worked very hard to ensure that Latinos are      nominated to high positions in the country,'' Roybal-Allard      said. ``Just because someone has a Hispanic surname doesn't      automatically qualify him for any position.''       Boyal-Allard also denied the caucus was acting for partisan      reasons.       ``Out of all the nominees, President Bush has appointed,      this is the first time we have been opposed,'' she said.      ``We're opposed to Miguel Estrada based on his lack of      qualifications.''                                  ____     Hispanic Lawmakers From California Oppose Bush's Court Nominee                            (By Paul Chavez)       Los Angeles.--Hispanic lawmakers from California stepped up      their campaign Friday against the first Hispanic to be      nominated for a spot on an important federal appellate court.       Three Democratic members of the Congressional Hispanic      Caucus and representatives from two advocacy groups said      lawyer Miguel Estrada, 41, has refused to answer key      questions about his position on cases, his background and      other key issues.       ``Ethnic origin is no automatic pass to becoming a judge on      the federal judiciary, you have to be qualified,'' said Rep.      Xavier Becerra, D-Los Angeles.       Estrada's nomination by President Bush has been held up in      the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, with Democrats launching      a filibuster to stall a full Senate vote until Estrada      answers more questions and provides documents from his work      with the Department of Justice.       Estrada was nominated in May 2001 by Bush for a seat on the      U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which has      been a steppingstone for three current justices on the U.S.      Supreme Court.       Estrada, a partner in the law firm that worked with Bush      during the Florida election recount, came to the United      States at age 17 from Honduras. He graduated from Harvard Law      School in 1986 and has argued 15 cases before the Supreme      Court.       Republicans have accused Democrats of treating Estrada      unfairly because he is a conservative Hispanic.       Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard, D-Los Angeles, said the      decision to oppose Estrada's appointment was not easy.       ``This was a particularly difficult and disappointing      decision that had to be made given the fact that the Hispanic      caucus actively works long and hard to promote the      appointment of more Latino judges,'' she said.       The Hispanic caucus decided to oppose Estrada after      interviewing him, Roybal-Allard said.       ``Unfortunately, he did not satisfactorily answer any of      our questions with regard to his experience or sensitivity or      commitment to ensuring equal justice and opportunity for      Latinos,'' she said.       Rep. Grace Napolitano, D-Norwalk, said Estrada told the      caucus that he has not done any work on behalf of minority      organizations. She said such work was important since Estrada      ``could be our Latino Clarence Thomas.''       The Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which is made up      exclusively of Democrats, along with the Mexican American      Legal Defense and Educational Fund have previously stated      their opposition to Estrada's appointment.       The California branch of the League of United Latin      American Citizens also said Friday it was opposed to his      nomination, although its national leadership has supported      Estrada. His nomination also has been supported by the U.S.      Hispanic Chamber of Commerce.       Democrats have sought documents written by Estrada when he      worked in the Justice Department's Solicitor General's      Office. But White House counsel Alberto Gonzales told      senators in a letter Wednesday that the administration would      not release the documents, which are normally not made      available.       All of the living former solicitors general--four Democrats      and three Republicans--have agreed with the White House      position, Gonzales said.
