 I certainly appreciate the gentleman offering this amendment. I think it's very, very important. Certainly I think the most serious threat confronting this Nation is that of nuclear terrorism.  Again, I appreciate the gentleman's work on the issue day in and day out, offering the amendment, as well as those who support it. I rise in support of it.
