President, I would certainly oppose this amendment. The regional commission is a joint Federal-State economic development effort that includes some of the most economically distressed counties of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and northern New York. For decades, these people have faced tough economic circumstances. These programs have helped.  More importantly, every Federal dollar invested leverages, on average, 2.6 dollars in matching funds in return. New jobs are created. Thousands of jobs are retained. That is how we should be investing our Federal dollars.  We invest in other countries around the world, and we ought to be investing them in our own country and support programs like the Northern Border Regional Commission and not eliminate them.  I hope Senators will oppose this amendment.
