Speaker, pipeline safety is especially personal for me. Back in 2010, we experienced a bad spill just outside of my district in southwest Michigan that impacted the Kalamazoo River. Ask anyone who was directly affected. Seeing the aftermath firsthand smacks the senses and leaves a lasting impression. While a spill can happen in an instant, the damage can take decades and, in fact, more than $1 billion to fix. Underscoring the need for strong safety laws is what this bill does.  Congress asked the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration--that is PHMSA for short--to develop and enforce pipeline safety regulations. PHMSA doesn't do the job by itself. It relies heavily on partnerships with States and local governments to inspect the pipelines and, yes, to enforce the law; but the reality is that more can be done to prevent accidents from occurring and to mitigate spills when the unthinkable happens.                              {time}  1730  The amendment to the Senate bill before us today, this bill, incorporates texts from two House bills, which were both approved unanimously in committee: H.R. 5050, the Pipeline Safety Act, which passed the Committee on Energy and Commerce; and H.R. 4937, the PIPES Act of 2016, which passed the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  This important legislation will reauthorize PHMSA's pipeline safety through 2019, press PHMSA to complete overdue safety regs, and impose additional new safety requirements for pipeline operators.  I have often said that pipelines should be subject to greater scrutiny and more frequent inspections, and those that cross the Straits of Mackinac are a perfect example. The Straits of Mackinac is a narrow waterway that separates Michigan's two peninsulas. It connects Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. The exceptionally strong and complex currents hundreds of feet deep make this area tremendously sensitive. If a spill were to occur, the consequences would be unthinkable.  Our solution improves protections for the Great Lakes and other areas around the country where the threat of a spill poses the greatest risk to public safety and the environment. It also requires pipeline operators to consider a worst-case discharge into icy waters and conduct more frequent and transparent and, in some cases, annual inspections of deep underwater crossings. This bill does that.  We also update and improve PHMSA's pipeline safety program in a number of other ways by closing the gaps in Federal standards for underground natural gas storage and liquefied natural gas facilities. It promotes better use of data and technology and improves communication with pipeline operators to incorporate the lessons learned from past incidents.  We promised action, and today that is what this bill does. I am proud of the bipartisan agreement that will make a real difference. I am proud of the relationship that our committee has with Chairman Shuster and the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and all the good work that everyone has done--Mr. Pallone, Mr. Rush, and our colleagues in the Senate. This is a bipartisan bill. Let's get 'er done.
