President, at this time I will not give my full statement in opposition. I will say I would like, at this point, to have printed in the Record a couple of letters, one from the Transportation Institute and the other from the Seafarers International Union of North America, AFL-CIO, both saying essentially the same thing; that is, $165 million has been spent forhoppers to be able to have modern dredges work in the same areas. The capacity is there to bring the McFarland up to date. It would be, according to the Corps of Engineers, a cost of about $20 million. For all these reasons, they oppose it.  I ask unanimous consent that these two letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                     Transportation Institute,                                  Camp Springs, MD, July 17, 2006.     Hon. James M. Jeffords,     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Environment & Public          Works, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Ranking Member Jeffords: The Transportation Institute      is of the understanding that the Senate is about to take up      consideration of the Energy and Water Resources Act of 2005.      We would like to take this opportunity to respectfully      request that the Senate reject any attempt that might be      offered during floor consideration of this bill that would      modify the language contained in Sections 2021 and 563 of the      bill.       These sections would decommission the 39 year-old Federal      dredge McFarland. The Corps of Engineers is in support of the      decommissioning, citing the private sector's aggressive $165      million investment in hopper dredge capacity over the past      eight years. Moreover, it is our understanding that the Corps      of Engineers has calculated an annual savings of some $10      million as a direct result of decommissioning the McFarland.      Given the fact that the continued operation of the McFarland      would only duplicate existing private sector capacity, it      would seem fiscally prudent to take advantage of such a cost-     saving opportunity.       The Transportation is in strong support of the passage of      the Water Resources Development Act of 2005 with the language      of Sections 2021 and 563 intact. Passage of this legislation      would protect the commercial and environmental interests of      our national waterway transportation system while      concurrently reflecting the proven capability of our private      hopper dredge industry.           Sincerely,     James L. Henry.                                  ____                                     Seafarers International Union                                             of North America,                                  Camp Springs, MD, July 16, 2006.     Hon. James M. Inhofe, Chairman, Hon. James M. Jeffords,        Ranking,     Committee on Environment and Public Works, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Inhofe and Ranking Member Jeffords: It is our      understanding that the Senate is about to consider S.728, the      Energy and Water Resources Development Act of 2005. The      Seafarers International Union, along with a broad coalition      or union, industry, agriculture, aggregate and other      interests, has corresponded with Congress in support of this      long overdue legislation critical to maintaining and      protecting the commercial and environmental integrity of this      vital national transportation system.       We would like to take this opportunity to recommend your      opposition to any potential amendment that might be offered      during floor consideration that would modify the intent of      Section 2021 and Section 563 of this bill. This provision, as      presently worded, decommissions the 39 year-old Federal      hopper dredge McFarland The decommissioning of this dredge      has the support of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers citing an      anticipated annual savings of $10 million. Furthermore, over      the past 8 years, the private sector has invested some $165      million in capital to expand and modernize the private sector      hopper dredge fleet. In fact, I participated in the      christening ceremony of the SIU-crewed hopper dredge Liberty      Island, the newest addition to the Great Lakes Dredge and      Dock hopper dredge fleet.       In closing, the Seafarers International Union supports      passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 2005 with      Section 563 fully intact. To do so would be cost effective      and entirely appropriate given the private sector's      demonstrated hopper dredge capability. Once again, we      appreciate the opportunity to comment on this matter.           Sincerely,                                                    Michael Sacco.
