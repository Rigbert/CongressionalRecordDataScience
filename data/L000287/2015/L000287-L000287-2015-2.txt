Chairman, I appreciate that there is a driver shortage, but it is important, very important, to follow the data. We should not put inexperienced drivers on the road before we have all of the facts.  In my congressional district, in Metro Atlanta, we have three major interstate highways running through our city: I-75, I-85, and I-20. Even with experienced drivers, there is always some major accident. We need to follow the data. I urge all of my colleagues to support my commonsense amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.  I yield back the balance of my time.
