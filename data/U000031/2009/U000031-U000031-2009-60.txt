This team of young ladies, lead by Coach Tim Halloran and assisted by Coaches Erin Moore, Alyssa Chludzinski and Trainer Cailee Servais, has put in endless hours of hard work and dedication to bring home the their third state championship trophy since 2002.  Winning a state championship is a memory that will last a lifetime. It is a remarkable achievement that few teams ever experience, and it is a legacy that will live with the 2009 Lady Fighting Irish forever. This young team, lead by captains Maddie Brennan, Julie Ross and Stephanie Johnson, played a close game against the Madison Heights Bishop Foley Ventures and came out victorious beating the Ventures 1-0.  It is an honor to pay tribute to the entire Lady Fighting Irish team: Rebecca Farrer, Kalani Bates, Sara Howard, Maria Escamillia, Megan Putnam, Johanna Hamilton, Stephanie Walley, Christina Pinon, Aleks Svikis, Maddie Brennan, Ana Villalobos, Emma Forster, Neil Locke, Claire Sorek, Stephanie Johnson, Casey Lamp, Erin May, Mallory Busso, Maggie Wenzel, Ashleigh Reisterer and Julie Ross. We are so proud of all of you.  On behalf of all the residents of southwest Michigan, congratulations again to the Lady Fighting Irish, Coach Halloran and the entire greater Kalamazoo community--you are an inspiration to us all. It is Hackett Catholic Central pride at its finest. Go Fighting Irish!                          ____________________
