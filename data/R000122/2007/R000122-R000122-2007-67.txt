President, I point out that a similar measure passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 383 to 35 on a bipartisan basis, strongly supported in the House.  Also, during the BRAC process, the Army determined the capacity of Fort Carson was adequate for the brigades stationed there.  I urge the adoption of the amendment.
