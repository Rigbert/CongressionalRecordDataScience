SCALISE. And so now we need to talk about how to fund the wall, how to fund the structure, call it what you will. And again, the President, himself, has said you can title it however you want. You can ban cement fencing.  But at the same time, what Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer voted for in 2006 is the authority to build what is needed, but they didn't put the money there. It is time to finally back up the word. It is hot air until you put the money on the table.  So the money has been put on the table by the Republicans, at least an offer, backed up with real data of where the money would be spent to secure this country. There has not been a counteroffer.  So let's talk now about the final issue, and that is adjournment.  I know later today the House will be voting to adjourn. Last week, the House, under the Democratic majority, as you proudly talk about the fact that you all are in the majority, you all voted to adjourn. We voted not to adjourn.  We should stay here to get this job done, to finally have a real negotiation to solve our differences. We can solve our differences, but we are not going to solve them by continuing to adjourn every weekend when we should be negotiating and getting the government back open and securing the border.  On this final thought, would the gentleman address the vote, the motion that will be made later to adjourn that we oppose?  I yield to the gentleman.
