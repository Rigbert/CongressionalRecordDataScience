Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments and again would pledge with the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) and myself and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and others to continue to work with her towards those solutions.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price). The gentleman has been involved with election reform as long as I can remember. He is an extraordinary leader on this bill and in this House on these issues.
