President, I am pleased that the Senate is passing legislation to renew and extend family farmer bankruptcy protection through June 30, 2005.  Senator Grassley and I introduced the Family Farmer Bankruptcy Relief Act, S. 2864, to retroactively renew and temporarily extend these protections that our farmers have come to rely upon because Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code expired on January 1, 2004. Representative Tammy Baldwin and Representative Nick Smith have introduced companion legislation in the House of Representatives.  But our bipartisan legislation is just a short-term fix. We need to stop playing politics and permanently reauthorize the Chapter 12 family farmer protections.  Too many family farmers have been left in legal limbo in bankruptcy courts across the country because Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code is still a temporary measure. This is the eleventh time that Congress must act to restore or extend basic bankruptcy safeguards for family farmers because Chapter 12 is still a temporary provision despite its first passage into law in 1986. Our family farmers do not deserve these lapses in bankruptcy law that could mean the difference between foreclosure and farming.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from many representatives of family farmers that underscores the need for renewing the Chapter 12 bankruptcy protections be printed in the Record at the end of my remarks.
