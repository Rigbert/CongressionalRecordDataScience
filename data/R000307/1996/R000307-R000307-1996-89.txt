Chairman, I thank the gentleman. It used to be in this body, where we delegated responsibility, we appropriated the credit and sifted the blame. Through the leadership of the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. Livingston], we do not do that anymore. Let me point out to the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana, we started with $56.6 billion in the mandatory account, went down to $43 billion, went down to $38 billion, went down to $36 billion. These are farm program payments. The reason we went from 38 to 36 is to pay for this. It is paid. It is capped. It is paid. This is not a new entitlement payment program. We paid for it.
