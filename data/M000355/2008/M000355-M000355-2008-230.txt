 President, the only way the DNC can maintain this suit is if there is a nonfunctioning FEC. Thus, in order for the DNC's already failed lawsuit to go forward, this package must be objected to, and they have done just that.  I hope this continued delay of getting a fully constituted FEC is not related to the fact that the DNC is trying to, we think, file a lawsuit on Monday. Those are the kinds of shenanigans which I don't think we ought to export from the campaign to the Senate. In the Senate, it strikes me we have an obligation to get this Federal Election Commission reconstituted and functioning, not to try to give one party's national committee or another some kind of advantage in a pending lawsuit.  So I am encouraged by the majority leader's desire to get these nominations completed. I know we are not having votes Monday, but we are in Monday. It strikes me that Monday would be a very good time to get these nominees confirmed, if, in fact, we can't do it later today if the snag the majority leader indicated could be cleared up. I know, because he has just said, he shares my view that we ought to get this job done, and I think the best time to do it would be today.
