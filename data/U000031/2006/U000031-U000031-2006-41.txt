Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I rise in support of H.R. 5852, the 21st Century Emergency Communications Act of 2006.  I would especially like to commend Representative Reichert for his authorship of this legislation. In addition, I want to recognize the efforts of both Chairman Barton and Chairman King in preparing this legislation for consideration on the floor today.                              {time}  1100  Mr. Speaker, without a doubt, this Nation has endured significant domestic tragedies in the past 5 years, and of course, 9/11 and Hurricane Katrina stand out as most catastrophic.  While both were catastrophic, the causes were very different. The former a profoundly evil terrorist act, and the latter a terrible act of nature. But there at least is one common lesson that we learned from both tragedies: We learned how critically important interoperable communication is for our Nation's first responders during crisis regardless of the cause. It really is a matter of life and death.  At its heart, H.R. 5852 is designed to improve interoperable communications among our Nation's first responders. Of course, this Congress has already paved the way by providing for an orderly digital television transition to be completed by February 17, 2009, at which point 24 megahertz of spectrum in the upper 700 megahertz band will be returned by the broadcasters and provided to first responders to facilitate interoperable radio communications. That spectrum is ideally suited for this purpose. Congress also earmarked $1 billion from upcoming spectrum auction proceeds to assist State and local governments in procuring interoperable communications equipment.  But the legislation before us today mandates a National Emergency Communications report to recommend goals and time frames for the achievement of redundant, sustainable, and interoperable emergency communication systems. It requires a baseline assessment of current emergency communications capabilities and periodic assessments on progress in filling existing gaps, and it accelerates the development of national voluntary consensus standards for emergency communications equipment. It requires State and local governments to establish effective statewide interoperable communication plans before being able to use DHS grant funds for emergency communications. It facilitates coordination on emergency communications by establishing regional working groups comprised of Federal, State, and local officials, first responders, and other relevant stakeholders. And it elevates the importance of emergency communications within the Department of Homeland Security, enhancing accountability and resources to ensure first responders on the ground that it can communicate with one another.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5852 is truly an excellent bill which builds on the work that this Congress has already done to ensure that our Nation's first responders have the interoperable communications that they need to do their job of protecting our constituents in times of crisis. Again, I want to commend Representative Reichert, Chairman Barton, and Chairman King for their excellent work. I would urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
