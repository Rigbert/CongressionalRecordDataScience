These are AID's own figures. In 1984, $264 million; in 1986, it was $295 million; by 1992, it had jumped to $325; by 1993, it was up to $447 million. On a graph this would show a steady growth. And, again, this was under the Mexico City policy.  So again it is a red herring that my good friends are floating here today that we want to kill family planning. We want to separate abortion from family planning.
