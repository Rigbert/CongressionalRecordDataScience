REID. I have to finish a sentence. This is a significant point of the story.       During this time, however, other theories emerged about the      naming of Searchlight.  We are getting to a point--I want your attention, Mr. President. We are getting to a point now in this book where we are going to find out how Searchlight got its name. I hope the Chair will give me your full attention because it is one of the most asked questions there is: How did Searchlight get its name? That is what this chapter is all about. I hope you will give me your full attention.  I am happy to yield to my friend from Illinois for a question without my losing the floor.
