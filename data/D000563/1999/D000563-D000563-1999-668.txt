President, I rise today to make a few remarks concerning a bill that Senator DeWine and I are introducing today that we hope will improve the lives of many of the nation's asthmatic children.  Asthma is one of the most common chronic conditions in the U.S., affecting an estimated 14.9 million people, causing over 1.5 million emergency department visits and over 5,500 deaths in 1995, and estimated to cost over $14.5 billion by the year 2000. Asthma deaths have tripled over the past two decades despite improvements in clinical treatment.  Asthma is considered the worst chronic health problem affecting children. Childhood asthma has dramatically increased by over 160 percent since 1980. Currently, 7 percent of the nation's children suffer from asthma. It is particularly prevalent among the urban poor because of the lack of accessible health care and the high number of allergens in the environment. Research supported by the National Institutes of Health demonstrated that the combination of cockroach allergen, house dust mites, molds, tobacco smoke, and feathers are important causes of asthma-related illness and hospitalization among the children in inner-city areas of the United States.  To combat asthma, innovative community-based programs have been developed in some areas to fight this growing public health problem. For example, in Los Angeles the Asthma and Allergy Foundation has set up two ``breathmobiles.'' The converted motor homes, staffed by doctors and nurses, visit schools to test, treat, and educate at-risk children. Since the program began two years ago, there has been a 17 percent decline in the number of children visiting emergency rooms for asthma.  Today, I am introducing with Senator DeWine ``The Childhood Asthma Initiative'' to help more communities create childhood asthma programs tailored to meet their local needs. This bill funds grants for state and community-based organizations to support a variety of treatment, educational, or preventive programs. The funds are targeted to areas where childhood asthma and asthma-associated mortality rates are high. This will enable those areas with the most need to provide services that reduce emergency room visits, create healthier environments, reduce mortality rates from asthma, and provide overall improved quality of life. The bill also helps enroll eligible asthmatic children in Medicaid or State Children's Health Insurance Programs (S-CHIP). Furthermore, the bill provides additional funding for S-CHIP to incorporate asthma screening, treatment, and education in to their programs.  The bill coordinates Federal asthma activities through the National Asthma Education Prevention Program Coordinating Committee, and increases data collection by the CDC on prevalence and mortality associated with asthma. These efforts will help link patients to effective treatments and disseminate new breakthroughs in asthma treatment.  This bill has been endorsed by the National Association of Children's Hospitals and Research Institutions, the American Lung Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Association of Maternal and Child Health Programs.  I hope that many of my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill. Nobody should die from asthma. Treatments are available. Let us make sure that every child in America that suffers from asthma has access to those treatments.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be inserted in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed, in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 805       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Asthma Relief Act      of 1999''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:       (1) Asthma is one of the Nation's most common and costly      diseases. It affects an estimated 14,000,000 to 15,000,000      individuals in the United States, including almost 5,000,000      children.       (2) Asthma is often a chronic illness that is treatable      with ambulatory care, but over 43 percent of its economic      impact comes from use of emergency rooms, hospitalization,      and death.       (3) In Illinois, the mortality rate for blacks from asthma      is the highest in the nation with 60.8 deaths per every      1,000,000 population. In Ohio, the mortality rate for blacks      from asthma is 32.2 per 1,000,000 population and the      mortality rate for whites from asthma is 11.7 per 1,000,000.       (4) In 1995, there were more than 1,800,000 emergency room      visits made for asthma-related attacks and among these, the      rate for emergency room visits was 48.8 per 10,000 visits      among whites and 228.9 per 10,000 visits among blacks.       (5) Hospitalization rates were highest for individuals 4      years old and younger, and were 10.9 per 10,000 visits for      whites and 35.5 per 10,000 visits for blacks.       (6) From 1979 to 1992, the hospitalization rates among      children due to asthma increased 74 percent.       (7) It is estimated that more than 7 percent of children      now have asthma.       (8) Although asthma can occur at any age, about 80 percent      of the children who will develop asthma do so before starting      school.       (9) From 1980 to 1994, the most substantial prevalence rate      increase for asthma occurred among children aged 0-4 years      (160 percent) and persons aged 5-14 years (74 percent).       (10) Asthma is the most common chronic illness in      childhood, afflicting nearly 5,000,000 children under age 18,      and costing an estimated $1,900,000,000 to treat those      children. The death rate for children age 19 and younger      increased by 78 percent between 1980 and 1993.       (11) Children aged 0 to 5 years who are exposed to maternal      smoking are 201 times more likely to develop asthma compared      with those free from exposure.       (12) Morbidity and mortality related to childhood asthma      are disproportionately high in urban areas.       (13) Minority children living in urban areas are especially      vulnerable to asthma. In 1988, national prevalence rates were      26 percent higher for black children than for white children.       (14) Certain pests known to create public health problems      occur and proliferate at higher rates in urban areas. These      pests may spread infectious disease and contribute to the      worsening of chronic respiratory illnesses, including asthma.       (15) Research supported by the National Institutes of      Health demonstrated that the combination of cockroach      allergen, house dust mites, molds, tobacco smoke, and      feathers are important causes of asthma-related illness and      hospitalization among children in inner-city areas of the      United States.       (16) Cities outside the United States have developed and      implemented effective systems of cockroach management.       (17) Integrated pest management is a cost-effective      approach to pest control that emphasizes prevention and uses      a range of techniques, including property maintenance and      cleaning, and pesticides as a means of last resort.       (18) Reducing exposure to cockroach allergen, as part of an      integrated approach to asthma management, may be a cost-     effective way of reducing the social and economic costs of      the disease.       (19) No current Federal funding exists specifically to      assist cities in developing and implementing integrated      strategies to reduce cockroach infestation.       (20) Asthma is the most common cause of school absenteeism      due to chronic illness with 10,100,000 days missed from      school per year in the United States.       (21) According to a 1995 National Institute of Health      workshop report, missed school days accounted for an      estimated cost of lost productivity for parents of children      with asthma of almost $1,000,000,000 per year.       (22) According to data from the 1988 National Health      Interview Survey (NHIS), which surveyed children for their      health experiences over a 12-month period, 25 percent of      those children reported experiencing a great deal of pain or      discomfort due to asthma either often or all the time during      the previous 12 months.       (23) Managing asthma requires a long-term, multifaceted      approach, including patient education, behavior changes,      avoidance of asthma triggers, pharmacologic therapy, and      frequent medical follow-up.       (24) Enhancing the available prevention, educational,      research, and treatment resources with respect to asthma in      the United States will allow our Nation to address more      effectively the problems associated with this increasing      threat to the health and well-being of our citizens.

(b) Collaborative Efforts.--The activities described in      subsection (a)(1) may be conducted in collaboration with      eligible entities awarded a grant under section 511 of the      Social Security Act (as added by section 3).  Mr. DeWINE. Mr. President, today I join with my colleague, Senator Durbin, in introducing the ``Children's Asthma Relief Act of 1999.'' This bill would authorize $50 million for each of 5 years for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to develop and expand projects to provide asthma services to children. These grants may also be used to equip mobile health care clinics that provide asthma diagnosis and asthma-related health care services, educate families on asthma management, and identify and enroll uninsured children who are eligible for but not receiving health coverage under Medicaid or the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP). The ability to identify and enroll children in these programs will ensure that children with asthma receive the care they need.  Research supported by the NIH has shown that the combination of cockroach waste, house dust mites, molds, tobacco smoke, and feathers (among other allergens) contribute to asthma-related illness and hospitalization. Children living in urban areas are especially susceptible.  Asthma is the most common chronic illness that forces children to miss school. From 1979 to 1992, the hospitalization rates among children due to asthma increased 74 percent. Estimates show that more than 7% of children now suffer from asthma. Hospitalization rates were highest for individuals 4 years old and younger. According to 1998 data from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) my home state of Ohio ranks about 17th in the estimated prevalence rates for asthma. Nationwide, the most substantial prevalence rate increase for asthma occurred among children aged 4 years old and younger.  I believe that an important component of this bill is that it requires those receiving grants to coordinate with current children's health programs such as the Maternal and Child Health Program, Medicaid, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, supplemental nutrition programs, and child welfare, foster care and adoption assistance programs. This type of coordination with other children's programs will help to ensure not just a better targeting of funding, but also will help to identify children in these programs who are asthmatic and may otherwise remain undetected and untreated.  This bill would authorize $5 million for each of 5 years for the Secretary of HHS to award matching grants to states that develop plans to carry out asthma-related programs for children according to NIH guidelines through the state children's health insurance programs.  Since research shows that children living in urban areas suffer from asthma at such alarming rates and that allergens such as cockroach waste contribute to the onset of asthma, this bill adds urban cockroach management to the current preventive health services block grant which can currently be used for rodent control. To reduce roach allergens, this block grant could be used to cover the costs of structural rehabilitation of public housing, schools, and other public facilities to control roach infestation, while minimizing or avoiding the use of pesticides.  This bill would require that NIH give the National Asthma Education Prevention Program (within NIH) an additional $5 million for each of 5 years to develop a federal plan for responding to asthma and to submit recommendations to Congress on ways to strengthen and better coordinate federal asthma-related activities.  To better monitor the prevalence and determine which areas have the greatest incidences of children with asthma, this bill would require CDC to conduct local asthma surveillance activities to collect data on the prevalence and severity of asthma and to annually publish data on the prevalence rates of asthma among children and on the childhood mortality rate. This surveillance data will help us better detect asthmatic conditions so that more children can be treated and we can ensure that we are targeting our resources in an effective and efficient way to reverse the disturbing trend in the hospitalization and death rates of children who suffer from asthma.  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support this very important initiative to help the nearly 5 million children who have been diagnosed with asthma and to help those who suffer from asthma but who remain untreated.                                 ______                                       By
