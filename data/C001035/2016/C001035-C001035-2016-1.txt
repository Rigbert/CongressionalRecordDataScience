President, as a young man growing up in Searchlight, Nevada, Harry Reid was an accomplished amateur boxer. During his 30 years of service in this Chamber, Senator Reid has demonstrated time and again the qualities of skill, hard work, and determination that he learned in the ring all those years ago.  Prior to joining the Senate in 1987, Senator Reid established a deep commitment to public service in the House of Representatives and in State and local offices. And before that, he served Congress and supported his young family working nights as a Capitol police officer while attending law school at George Washington University. As a Senate leader, serving as Democratic whip, majority leader, and, currently, Democratic leader, he has been a formidable advocate for his caucus.  In the Senate, Senator Reid has been a passionate voice for education, environmental protection, health care, and renewable energy. His commitment to those who serve our Nation in uniform is evident through his support for military readiness and for our veterans.  The great Jack Dempsey defined a champion as ``someone who gets up when he can't.'' In his many years of service to the people of Nevada and to our nation, Senator Harry Reid has proven himself to be a fighter who always answers the bell. I wish him and his wife, Landra, health and happiness for many more years to come.
