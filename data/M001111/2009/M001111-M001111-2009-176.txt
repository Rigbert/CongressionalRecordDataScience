 President, I thank Senator Bond, who has been, as I said, a good partner working with me on this critical bill.  Again, we are on the floor this afternoon. We are ready and able to go to work if our colleagues would come and file their amendments. I think Senator Bond and I would be happy to move to third reading and pass the bill if nobody comes.
