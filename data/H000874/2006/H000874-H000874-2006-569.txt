Speaker, today I would like to recognize the contributions of my friend and an excellent, committed public servant for Prince George's County and the State of Maryland, Lynn Skerpon of Upper Marlboro.  For six years, Lynn served as the very effective, efficient and competent Register of Wills in Prince George's County. She was appointed to this position on August 1, 2000, and then was elected to a four-year term in November 2002.  As the Washington Post noted in an editorial this past September: ``The register of wills is not, as some have suggested, a mere court clerk but a significant job that in a given year administers some 4,000 estates, collects millions in taxes and fees and sorts through increasingly complicated legal issues.'' In fact, one of Lynn's proudest moments was assisting families of the September 11th victims and working with the federal government and other agencies in expediting aid to the those families.  Lynn is an accomplished, successful lawyer, who also has great experience in the legislative arena. She graduated from Princeton University in 1975, and then acquired her law degree from the State University of New York at Buffalo School of Law three years later.  Early in her career, Lynn practiced as a sole practitioner and in firms, focusing on estates and trusts. She was an assistant legislative officer in the Office of the Governor from 1982 to 1984, and a hearing examiner with the Maryland Tax Court from 1984 to 1986. She also served as sessions counsel to Prince George's County Senators in 1997-98, and in the legislative office of the County Executive in 1999-2000.  In addition to her professional service and achievements, Lynn also is active in her church, schools and civic and community associations, including the Board of Trustees of Capital Hospice, the Board of Trustees of Prince George's Community College, and United Way of Prince George's County.  As Lynn moves to a new phase of her already successful career, I wish her and her family nothing but the best and know that she will continue to serve the community that she has called home for more than 20 years.                          ____________________
