COVERDELL. Yes, they do. It goes further than this one. If the Governor fails to meet it, he goes to prison.  I remember very well when I first went to the State senate, within several years, we were going to exceed our revenues by some $120 million. The Governor was forced, choosing this over prison, to call a special session, and we found a way to eliminate the expenditure of $120 million.  Now, if that amendment, a requirement and discipline, I might point out to the Senator from Oklahoma, if it had not been in place, do you think we could have come into special session? Do you think we would have taken on the hard job of finding where to eliminate $120 million?  The answer is no. It required a discipline built into our core governance, the Constitution of the State of Georgia, to force us to make the hard decisions, which we did. We fought about them. We set our priorities, made the decision, and went home. Some were happy, some were not, but we made the decision, Mr. President. We made the decision. And we kept the finances of the State of Georgia intact. I might add that the financial health of my home State is considerably improved over the financial health of our home nation.
