 Most recently, Larry has served as Bowling Green's Vice President for University Relations and Governmental Affairs. He has worked closely with the university's presidents, including its current President, Dr. Sidney Ribeau, always demonstrating honesty, skill, and integrity. During his career, Larry met notables such as Bob Hope, Red Skelton, and Doc Severinsen, but never failed to treat all people with equanimity--affording respect to students, university staff, families, and visitors alike.  A native of Canton, Ohio, Larry graduated from Bowling Green State University in 1967 with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Journalism and a specialization in public relations. Following graduation, he began his business career in the Press Relations Department of Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Company in Toledo.  In 1973, Larry returned to his alma mater as Assistant Director of Alumni Affairs where he undertook a $2.2 million campaign to build an alumni center on campus. Five years later, he was promoted to Director of Alumni Affairs. In 1998, Larry incorporated state government relations into his job responsibilities while still serving as alumni director. In August, 2000, he moved to the President's Office where he continued to serve the President and the community.  During his tenure in the Alumni Office, Larry served as chair of the University's 7th Anniversary celebration. He was one of three alumni administrators in the United States selected by the Asian Institute of Management for travel to Manila, Philippines to train Filipino educators. He also served as host of a weekly television show called ``Time Out'' on the local PBS affiliate.  In addition to his responsibilities at BGSU, Larry served on the boards of trustees for the Bowling Green Chamber of Commerce, the Bowling Green Community Development Foundation and the United Way of Greater Toledo. He is also a University representative on the Toledo Symphony Board.  One of Larry's avocations is baseball. As an 18-year-old standout, he had a scheduled tryout for the Baltimore Orioles organization. It appeared as though Larry was destined to be a professional baseball player. However, the week before his tryout, he broke his wrist and was unable to tryout. With a broken wrist, his life path changed and he decided to go to college at Bowling Green State University. At BGSU he fell in love and married Frances Greiger and also fell in love with BGSU. Not only has the marriage thrived in 42 years, but Larry's love for baseball still continues. Since 1995 Larry has played in an adult baseball league and annually plays in the Legends of Baseball League in Cooperstown, New York. This past August, Larry was inducted into the Legends of Baseball Hall of Fame.  His family jokes that while on family vacations in other states people would recognize Larry--``Larry Weiss, Bowling Green State University'' and his relationship with Bowling Green State University will continue. He will lead the University's 100th anniversary celebration.  Upon Larry Weiss' official retirement from Bowling Green State University, I wish him time to spend with family and friends doing that which he most enjoys as he travels this new road of life. We know that his lifetime of dedication to building Bowling Green State University into one of the largest recognized universities in the state will not end with retirement. Let us express to Larry and his family our sincerest gratitude and Godspeed in the years ahead.                          ____________________
