I share his concerns that we need to develop a very solid and clear definition of what operational TSM is, what is developmental TSM, and what is considered a legacy system.  Mr. Chairman, I would also like to have clarified the issue of contracting out of TSM and specifically putting the responsibility for a new contract into the hands of the Department of Defense. I cannot support, as the gentleman knows, this proposal. Can the gentleman share with me his intention as it relates to this issue?
