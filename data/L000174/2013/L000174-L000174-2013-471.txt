President, 50 years ago today, the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision in Gideon v. Wainwright. That case affirmed a fundamental principle of our democratic society, that no person, regardless of economic status, should face prosecution without the assistance of a lawyer. It is worth pausing today to celebrate Gideon and the extraordinary idea that in a free society the government which seeks to convict someone must also assume the cost of providing an effective defense.  In the last 50 years, we have come a long way in ensuring equal justice for all Americans and there is much about our criminal justice system in which to take pride. But we must also be honest and recognize that in too many courtrooms it is better to be rich and guilty than poor and innocent. The rich will have competent counsel, but those who have little often find their lives placed in the hands of underpaid court-appointed lawyers who are inexperienced, overworked, inept, uninterested, or worse.  The bottom line is that the promise made in Gideon remains unfulfilled. Atthe core of this problem is the fact that too many States still lack adequate programs for providing effective representation. That failure results in miscarriages of justice, including wrongful convictions, in violation of our constitutional obligation to provide effective assistance of counsel. In his column yesterday in The New York Times, Lincoln Caplan noted, ``by well-informed estimates, at least 80 percent of state criminal defendants cannot afford to pay for lawyers and have to depend on court-appointed counsel.'' A recent article on the front page of USA Today correctly calls the problem a ``national crisis,'' highlighting one public defender's office in Pennsylvania that has four investigators to handle its 4,000 cases a year and where some lawyers have no desk or phone. A similar AP article which ran in the Washington Post cites additional examples of this ongoing failure of our criminal justice system, including one public defender in Indianapolis who was asked to represent 300 clients at a time. I know what it takes to work a case effectively from my time as a prosecutor, and no lawyer can provide effective counsel to 300 defendants at once.  We can no longer ignore the disturbing examples discussed in these articles. We are on notice that a constitutional right is consistently being violated and, if we are to call ourselves a country of laws, it is our obligation as a nation, and particularly as the Congress, to take action and make a change. That is why today, I am introducing the Gideon's Promise Act of 2013. This legislation takes important new steps to breathe life into Gideon and ensure the fairness of our criminal justice system for all participants.  I first introduced this legislation last Congress, as part of the reauthorization of the Justice For All Act. That law, passed in 2004, was an unprecedented bipartisan piece of criminal justice legislation. It was the most significant step Congress had taken in many years to improve the quality of justice in this country and to improve public confidence in the integrity of the American justice system. I plan to reintroduce the reauthorization of the Justice for All Act, again, later this spring and it will include this critical provision to ensure that our criminal justice system operates effectively and consistent with our constitutional obligations.  The Gideon's Promise Act takes several important new steps to improve the quality of the criminal justice system. First, it seeks to encourage States to adopt a comprehensive approach in using the Federal funds received through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant, JAG, Program. This will help to ensure that their criminal justice systems operate effectively as a whole and that all parts of the system work together and receive the resources they need. Specifically, the bill reinstates a previous requirement of the Byrne JAG Program that States develop, and update annually, a strategic plan detailing how grants received under the program will be used to improve the administration of the criminal justice system. The requirement was removed from the Byrne JAG grant application several years ago, but groups representing States and victims have requested that it be reinstated in order to improve the efficient and effective use of criminal justice resources. The plan must be formulated in consultation with local governments and all segments of the criminal justice system. The Attorney General will also be required to provide technical assistance to help States formulate their strategic plans.  This legislation also takes important new steps to ensure that all criminal defendants, including those who cannot afford a lawyer, receive constitutionally adequate representation. It requires the Department of Justice to assist States that want help developing an effective and efficient system of indigent defense, and it establishes a cause of action for the Federal Government to step in when States are systematically failing to provide the representation called for in the Constitution.  This is a reasonable measure that gives the States assistance and time needed to make necessary changes and seeks to provide an incentive for States to do so. As a former prosecutor, I have great faith in the men and women of law enforcement, and I know that the vast majority of the time our criminal justice system does work fairly and effectively. I also know that the system only works as it should when each side is well represented by competent and well-trained counsel. That realization was reflected in the testimony of District Attorney Patricia Lykos of Houston that competent defense attorneys are critical to a prosecutor's job. Our system requires good lawyers on both sides. Incompetent counsel can result not only in needless and time-consuming appeals but, far more importantly, can lead to wrongful convictions and overall distrust in the criminal process.  In working on this legislation, I have also learned that the most effective systems of indigent defense are not always the most expensive. In some cases, making the necessary changes may also save States money.  I remain committed to ensuring that our criminal justice system operates as effectively and fairly as possible. Unfortunately, we are not there yet. Too often the quality of justice a defendant receives in our system depends on how much he or she can pay for an attorney. The Constitution requires that we do better. Americans need and deserve a criminal justice system that keeps us safe, ensures fairness and accuracy, and fulfills the promise of our Constitution for all people.  This bill will take important steps to bring us closer to that goal and I urge all Senators to support this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and three articles be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 597       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

(3) Effective date.--Paragraph (2) shall take effect 2      years after the date of enactment of this Act.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Mar. 9, 2013]                      The Right to Counsel: Badly                              Battered at 50                          (By Lincoln Caplan)        A half-century ago, the Supreme Court ruled that anyone      too poor to hire a lawyer must be provided one free in any      criminal case involving a felony charge. The holding in      Gideon v. Wainwright enlarged the Constitution's safeguards      of liberty and equality, finding the right to counsel      ``fundamental.'' The goal was ``fair trials before impartial      tribunals in which every defendant stands equal before the      law.''        This principle has been expanded to cover other      circumstances as well: misdemeanor cases where the defendant      could be jailed, a defendant's first appeal from a conviction      and proceedings against a juvenile for delinquency.        While the constitutional commitment is generally met in      federal courts, it is a different story in state courts,      which handle about 95 percent of America's criminal cases.      This matters because, by well-informed estimates, at least 80      percent of state criminal defendants cannot afford to pay for      lawyers and have to depend on court-appointed counsel.        Even the best-run state programs lack enough money to      provide competent lawyers for all indigent defendants who      need them. Florida set up public defender offices when Gideon      was decided, and the Miami office was a standout. But as      demand has outpaced financing, caseloads for Miami defenders      have grown to 500 felonies a year, though the American Bar      Association guidelines say caseloads should not exceed 150      felonies.        Only 24 states have statewide public defender systems.      Others flout their constitutional obligations by pushing the      problem onto cash-strapped counties or local judicial      districts.        Lack of financing isn't the only problem, either. Contempt      for poor defendants is too often the norm. In Kentucky, 68      percent of poor people accused of misdemeanors appear in      court hearings without lawyers. In 21 counties in Florida in      2010, 70 percent of misdemeanor defendants pleaded guilty or      no contest--at arraignments that averaged less than three      minutes.        The Supreme Court has said that poor people are entitled      to counsel ``within a reasonable time'' after a case is      initiated. But defendants, after their arrest, can spend      weeks or even months in jail without a lawyer's help. In a      Mississippi case, a woman charged with shoplifting sat in      jail for 11 months before a lawyer was appointed.        The powerlessness of poor defendants is becoming even more      evident under harsh sentencing schemes created in the past      few decades. They give prosecutors, who have huge discretion,      a strong threat to use, and have led to almost 94 percent of      all state criminal cases being settled in plea bargains--     often because of weak defense lawyers who fail to push back.        The competency of lawyers is, of course, most critical in      death penalty cases. In dozens of states, capital cases are      routinely handled by poorly paid, inexperienced lawyers. And      yet, only very rarely are inmates ever granted a new trial      because of incompetent counsel.        In a Georgia death penalty case last year, the United      States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that even      though the main defense lawyer drank a quart of vodka each      night of the trial, there was no need for a retrial. The      lawyer was himself preparing to be criminally prosecuted for      stealing client funds, and presented very little evidence      about the defendant's intellectual disability. But the court      said the defendant had a fair trial because proof that he      killed a sheriff's deputy outweighed any weakness in his      legal representation.        In an infamous 1996 Texas death-penalty case, the Texas      Court of Criminal Appeals upheld a defendant's death sentence      even though his lead counsel slept during the trial.        The Supreme Court has made it possible for courts to      uphold such indefensible lawyering. In 1984, in Strickland v.      Washington, the court said that for a defendant to be      entitled to a new trial, he must show both that his lawyer's      advice was deficient and that the deficiency deprived him of      a fair trial--a very high hurdle. And the court's majority      defined competency as requiring only that the lawyer's      judgment be ``reasonable under prevailing professional      norms.''        Justice Thurgood Marshall, writing in dissent, said the      result of this empty standard ``is covertly to legitimate      convictions and sentences obtained on the basis of      incompetent conduct by defense counsel.'' That is exactly      what has happened in the past three decades. In fact,      incompetent counsel for poor defendants is so widespread that      under this standard the prevailing professional norm has been      reduced to mediocrity.        After 50 years, the promise of Gideon v. Wainwright is      mocked more often than fulfilled. In a forthcoming issue of      The Yale Law Journal, Stephen Bright, president of the      Southern Center for Human Rights in Georgia, and Sia Sanneh,      a lawyer with the Equal Justice Initiative in Alabama,      recommend that all states have statewide public defender      systems that train and supervise their lawyers, limit their      workloads and have specialized teams in, for example, death-     penalty cases.        There is no shortage of lawyers to do this work. What      stands in the way is an undemocratic, deep-seated lack of      political will.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 17, 2013]50 Years After Landmark Ruling, Lawyer's Help is Legal Fiction for Many                             Accused of Crime                         (By Associated Press)       Washington.--It is not the happiest of birthdays for the      landmark Supreme Court decision that, a half-century ago,      guaranteed a lawyer for criminal defendants who are too poor      to afford one.       A unanimous high court issued its decision in Gideon v.      Wainwright on March 18, 1963, declaring that states have an      obligation to provide defendants with ``the guiding hand of      counsel'' to ensure a fair trial for the accused.       But in many states today, taxpayer-funded public defenders      face crushing caseloads, the quality of legal representation      varies from county to county and people stand before judges      having seen a lawyer only briefly, if at all.       ``There is no denying that much, much needs to be done,''      Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday at a Justice      Department event to commemorate the anniversary.       Clarence Earl Gideon had been in and out of jail in his      nearly 51 years when he was arrested on suspicion of stealing      wine and some money from vending machines at a Panama City,      Fla., pool hall in 1961. Gideon asked the judge for a lawyer      before his trial, but was turned down. At the time, Florida      only provided lawyers for indigent defendants in capital      cases.       A jury soon convicted Gideon and the state Supreme Court      upheld the verdict on appeal. Then, from his Florida prison      cell, Gideon scratched out his Supreme Court appeal in pencil      on prison stationery. It arrived at the court early in 1962,      when the justices were looking for a good case to take on the      issue of indigent defense. The court appointed Washington      lawyer Abe Fortas, a future justice, to represent him.       Just two months after hearing arguments, Justice Hugo Black      wrote for the court that ``in our adversary system of      criminal justice, any person hauled into court, who is too      poor to hire a lawyer, cannot be assured a fair trial unless      counsel is provided for him. This seems to us to be an      obvious truth.''       Five months later, Gideon got a lawyer and a new trial, and      the attorney poked holes in the prosecution's case. A jury      quickly returned its verdict: not guilty.       So that was the promise of Gideon--that a competent lawyer      for the defense would stand on an equal footing with      prosecutors, and that justice would prevail, at least in      theory.       A half-century later, there are parts of the country where      ``it is better to be rich and guilty than poor and      innocent,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the      Senate Judiciary Committee and a former prosecutor. Leahy      said court-appointed lawyers often are underpaid and can be      ``inexperienced, inept, uninterested or worse.''       Regardless of guilt or innocence, few of those accused of      crimes are rich, while 80 percent say they are too poor to      afford a lawyer.       People who work in the criminal justice system have become      numb to the problems, creating a culture of low expectations,      said Jonathan Rapping, a veteran public defender who has      worked in Washington, D.C., Atlanta and New Orleans.       Rapping remembers walking into a courtroom in New Orleans      for the first time for a client's initial appearance before a      judge. Several defendants in jump suits were shackled      together in one part of the courtroom. The judge moved      briskly through charges against each of the men, with a      lawyer speaking up for each one.       Then he called a name and there was no lawyer present. The      defendant piped up. ``The guy said he hadn't seen a lawyer      since he was locked up 70 days ago. And no one in the      courtroom was shocked. No one was surprised,'' Rapping said.       Complaints about the quality of representation also are      difficult to sustain, under a high bar that the Supreme Court      set in a 1984 case. The relatively few cases in which a      lawyer's work is deemed so bad that it violates     his client's rights typically have an outlandish set of facts      that would be funny if the consequences weren't tragic. ``You      see too many instances of ineffective assistance of counsel,      too many instances where you think, `Was this lawyer crazy?'      '' Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan said at the Justice      Department event.       She recounted a case from last term in which a lawyer      advised his client to reject a plea deal with a seven-year      prison term and go to trial The lawyer said prosecutors could      not prove a charge of intent to murder because the victim had      been shot below the waist. 'The defendant was convicted and      sentenced to 30 years in prison.       Kagan was part of the 5-4 decision in the defendant's      favor.       In some places, lawyers are overwhelmed by their caseloads.      A public defender in Indianapolis lasted less than a year in      his job after being asked to represent more than 300      defendants at a time, said Norman Lefstein, former dean of      the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law.       ``A lawyer with an S on his chest for Superman couldn't      represent these people. He simply couldn't do it. There are      only so many hours in a day. But it's not just caseload. It's      the other support services that go along with it,'' including      investigators, said Lefstein, who has studied problems in      indigent defense for decades.       In Luzerne County, in northeastern Pennsylvania, the chief      public defender told the local court he would stop accepting      certain cases because his office had too many clients, too      few lawyers and not enough money. A judge's ruling in June      acknowledged the lack of money and manpower, but forbade the      defender's office to turn away cases. The judge's ruling was      encouraging, Leftein said, but on his last visit to Wilkes-     Bane in January he found ``the caseloads are worse than      ever.''       Eighteen states, including California, Illinois, New York      and Pennsylvania, leave the finding of indigent defense      entirely to their counties, said Rhoda Billings, a former      chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court who has      looked at the issue for the American Bar Association. Those      states ``have a significant disparity in the appointment of      counsel'' from one county to the next, Billings said.       Public defenders in those counties often report to elected      officials or their appointees, rather than independent boards      that are insulated from politics. But even programs run at      the statewide level are not free of political influence,      Billings said, citing the case of a New Mexico public      defender fired by the governor.       The lack of independence raises questions about whether      decisions are being made in the best interests of clients,      Rapping said.       The avalanche of cases and politics come together to      present a formidable obstacle to alleviating some of the      problems that afflict the system in some states. Politicians      do not like asking voters for money for indigent defense.       ``Arguing for more money to defend criminals is not the      easiest way to win a close election,'' said former Vice      President Walter Mondale. As Minnesota's attorney general in      the early 1960s, Mondale recruited 21 other states to join in      a brief urging the court to rule as it did and rejected a      plea from Florida to support limits on states'      responsibilities to poor defendants.       Heralded for its powerful statement about the right to a      lawyer, the Gideon decision also left states on their own to      pay for the provision of counsel, Lefstein said. ``It came as      an unfunded mandate to 50 state governments and that problem      endures,'' he said, noting that in England, Parliament      provides money to local governments to pay for legal      representation of the poor.       ``The federal government does next to nothing to support      indigent defense in the United States,'' Lefstein said.       Since becoming attorney general more than four years ago,      Holder has shown a commitment to the issue. He established an      ``Access to Justice'' program and made Harvard Law School      professor Laurence Tribe its initial director. The department      also has sent a few million dollars to defense programs      across the country. He announced nearly $2 million in new      grants on Friday.       The right announced by the Supreme Court 50 years ago only      covers criminal cases. It has never been extended to civil      matters, although as Mondale pointed out, they can lead to      people losing their homes, their families, being confined in      a mental institution or being thrown out of the country.       To people in those situations, he said, the distinction      between criminal and civil law ``doesn't make much of a      difference.''                                  ____                    [From USA Today, Mar. 12, 2013]               You Have the Right to Counsel. Or Do You?  50 years after the U.S. Supreme Court enshrined the constitutional  right to a lawyer, budget realities are undermining justice in America                           (By Rick Hampson)       Wilkes-Barre, PA.--The first face visitors see when they      walk into the public defender's office here is a photo of      Clarence Gideon, the drifter, drinker, gambler and thief who      became a hero of American jurisprudence.       It was in his case, Gideon v. Wainwright, that the Supreme      Court ruled 50 years ago this month that everyone accused of      a serious crime has a constitutional right to a lawyer,      whether they can afford it or not.       When he was charged with breaking into a pool hall outside      Panama City, Fla., Gideon asked for a court-appointed lawyer.      After the judge said no, he represented himself, was found      guilty and sentenced to five years. From prison, he appealed      to the Supreme Court, which took his case and ordered a new      trial.       If he came back today, Clarence Gideon might rue the      quality of legal representation he'd receive. He might not      get any at all.       Such was the fate last year of some indigent criminal      defendants who walked in the public defender's door here and      past Gideon's gaze. They were told that, because of a      shortage of staff lawyers, the office was turning down all      but the most serious new cases. They were given a letter to      show the judge.       Al Flora, Luzerne County chief public defender, says that      ethically and legally he had no choice: His overburdened      lawyers couldn't take on new clients and do justice to those      they already had. He sued county officials--his bosses--to      let him hire more lawyers and to stop them from retaliating      against him.       The situation in Luzerne County reflects what experts say      is a national crisis in indigent legal defense that has      thwarted Gideon's promise of legal equality.       Many public defenders are overwhelmed by caseloads, and      financially pressed states and counties are levying fees and      applying means tests for granting counsel. ``We're not      calling the anniversary a celebration,'' says Edwin Burnette      of the National Legal Aid and Defender Association. ``There's      nothing to celebrate.''       Flora is not the only rebel. The Florida Supreme Court is      considering a similar attempt by the Miami-Dade County public      defender's office to limit its caseload. Last year, the      Missouri Supreme Court authorized public defenders with      unmanageable caseloads to decline new cases, and the American      Bar Association urged states and counties not to fire public      defenders who do.       The problem is money. An explosion in the number of      criminal cases has overwhelmed the indigent defense system,      which represents about 80% of all accused.       The right to counsel is stronger than ever; it was expanded      by the Supreme Court during its last term. Although few in      state and county government quarrel with the principle of      Gideon, few are eager to cover the ever-growing tab for its      realization.       That worries advocates on each side of Gideon, including      Bruce Jacob, the former Florida assistant attorney general      who argued the state's case before the Supreme Court, and      former vice president Walter Mondale, who as attorney general      of Minnesota in 1963 filed a brief supporting Gideon.       ``We're not close to fulfilling the promise of Gideon,''      Jacob says. Although more defendants see a lawyer than 50      years ago, he says, many advocates don't have time to give      clients ``effective representation.''       Any celebration of the anniversary should be ``subdued,''      Mondale says, because ``we've missed the mark, and we may be      going backwards.''       Others, while conceding the problem, take a more positive      view. ``For the most part, public defenders and prosecutors      get it right,'' says Scott Burns, director of the National      District Attorneys Association. ``Gideon would celebrate this      anniversary.''                    `I AM ENTITLED . . . TO COUNSEL'       Clarence Gideon was jailed before he was old enough to      drive and behind bars for much of his young adulthood. By the      time he was 51, he'd been convicted of five felonies,      including thefts from a government armory and a country      store.       His biographer, Anthony Lewis, described him as a ``used-up      man'' who looked 15 years older than his age. In a letter,      Gideon admitted ``the utter folly and hopelessness'' of much      of his life.       On Aug. 4, 1961, facing trial on a charge that would send      him back to prison, Gideon told the judge, ``The United      States Supreme Court says I am entitled to be represented by      counsel.''       The only problem: It had not, and he was not.       Beginning with Betts v. Brady (1942), the court had refused      to declare a blanket constitutional right to counsel in non-     capital state felony trials unless defendants faced ``special      circumstances,'' such as youth, illiteracy or unusually      complex issues.       Undeterred, the imprisoned Gideon mailed the court a      petition for a new trial. Handwritten in pencil on lined      prison paper, it began with anachronistic legalese: ``Comes      now the petitioner . . .''       The court received many petitions like it every week from      prisons around the country, but Gideon had two things in his      favor.       First, he had raised the constitutional issue at trial,      which meant he could use it to appeal.       Second, he didn't claim special circumstances, and--whether      Gideon knew it or not--a majority of the justices already      were inclined to jettison Betts v. Brady in favor of a flat      constitutional right to counsel.       All the court needed was a case on which to rule. And here      came Gideon.       On March 18, 1963, the court ruled unanimously that      Gideon's conviction was unconstitutional because he'd been      denied his request for counsel.       Justice Hugo Black wrote that in our adversarial justice      system, the ``noble idea (that) every defendant stands equal      before the law . . . cannot be realized if the poor man      charged with a crime has to face his accusers without a      lawyer.''       The case was sent back to Florida, which had quickly      established a network of public defenders. But Gideon      insisted on a private practitioner, Fred Turner. It was a      shrewd choice.       Turner interviewed Gideon in jail and spent several days      investigating. He checked out the pool hall. He drove to the      town where the prosecution witness had been earlier on the      night of the crime. He picked pears with the witness's mother      in her yard. He became convinced the witness was the      perpetrator.       The jury took just over an hour: Not guilty. Gideon went      out and got a hamburger.       The jailbird's name became synonymous with freedom. In      Florida alone, 976 prisoners were released because of Gideon;      an additional 500 got a new trial.       After his release, Gideon stayed out of trouble. He died of      cancer in 1972 at 61, too soon to see himself played by Henry      Fonda in the 1980 TV movie Gideon's Trumpet.       His gravestone in Hannibal, Mo., bears a message drawn from      a letter he wrote in prison. It reflects his belief that he      was part of something bigger than himself: ``I believe each      era finds an improvement in law,'' Gideon wrote. ``Each year      brings out something new for the benefit of mankind.''                        ALL WE CAN DO IS TRIAGE       After the inspirational Gideon v. Wainwright poster in the      reception area, it's all downhill in the Luzerne public      defender's office.       The walls are scuffed, the carpets stained. File folders      are stacked on the floor. ``It's a mess,'' admits Al Flora,      leading a tour. ``Half the time the secretaries can't find      the right file.'' As a result, clients sometimes aren't      notified of their court dates.       Some of the office's 21 lawyers have no desk or personal      phone. The top of a file cabinet serves as a desk for one      lawyer. A nightstand in a corner accommodates another.       The office, which handles about 4,000 cases a year in this      northeastern Pennsylvania county of 320,000, has only four      investigators and four secretaries. Lawyers often have to      type their own briefs. They have little time to take      depositions or seek discovery of prosecution evidence.       A third of Flora's lawyers have never tried a case. They're      smart and energetic, he says, but so inexperienced that if      given a full caseload, ``they'd crack. . . . All we can do is      triage cases.''       He says some public defenders ``don't want to talk about      the problem. I decided to go the other way. This has to      stop.''       Traditionally, Southern states have had the worst record of      giving poor defendants counsel. But Jonathan Rapping, founder      of the Southern Public Defender Training Center, says the      problem now is more acute in Northeastern jurisdictions with      shrunken industrial bases and chronic fiscal woes.       That describes Luzerne County, which gets no state funds      for public defenders. Last year, Flora's $2.7 million budget      was cut 7%, and later--until a judge intervened--a hiring      freeze blocked him from filling five lawyers' slots that were      budgeted.       In six months, he turned away more than 500 applicants for      legal counsel, an approach that antagonized county officials.      John Dean, a county attorney, has accused Flora of regarding      the county as ``nothing more than a checkbook'' and suggested      he handle more cases himself.       In June, a judge told Flora to resume taking all comers and      told the county to let Flora hire more lawyers. Since then,      the county has paid for a computerized case management system      and promised to find more office space.                         AN EROSION OF JUSTICE       In the past 18 months, a third of the office's lawyers have      left. One was Ed Olexa, 38. He'd read Gideon in law school      but didn't bargain for what he found when he became a public      defender four years ago.       Although he was a $34,000-a-year part-timer--19 hours a      week--he usually had 150 to 170 cases, far in excess of the      maximum recommended by the American Bar Association for full-     time defenders. The cases took up 40 to 50 hours a week.      Along with his private cases, he worked up to 70 hours a      week.       He often was scheduled to appear before two or three      different judges at the same time in different places around      the county. He'd meet clients for the first time in the      courtroom--some straight from jail, still in handcuffs--and      go before the judge with only the complaint and a hurried      conversation with his client as background.       That, he says, was the worst: No time to establish rapport      with clients or get the details that can win an acquittal. No      time to do what Turner did for Gideon. Instead, he spent his      time asking judges for more time. ``It offended my sense of      justice,'' he says.       And his clients'. He won't discuss their specific      complaints but says, ``The best attorney in the world would      be incompetent under those circumstances.''       Over time, most experts say, the costs are clear. Poor      people arrested for misdemeanors plead guilty and go free      rather than wait to see a public defender, even though a      conviction on their record might hurt their chances for      employment, loans or housing. At worst, the innocent go to      jail, and the guilty go free.       The Luzerne chief public defender is a part-time post; the      county plans to make it full time. Flora has applied.       ``I want to see it done right,'' he says. ``I believe      people who are impoverished and can't afford a lawyer deserve      one. If we can't provide that, then what kind of society do      we really have?''                                 ______                                       By
