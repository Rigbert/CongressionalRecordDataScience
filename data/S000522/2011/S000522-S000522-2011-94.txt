Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Helsinki Commission and Co-Chairman of the Congressional Poland Caucus, I rise today to speak about the legacy of Jan Karksi, the Polish resistance fighter who risked his life over and over again to bring first-hand reports of the mass murder of Jews in German-occupied Poland to the allied governments. 2014 will be the centennial of Karski's birth, making this a fitting time to remember and honor the heroism of this man.  To that end, a ``Jan Karski U.S. Centennial Campaign'' has been launched. This campaign will shine a spotlight on this historic figure of towering moral authority, and will increase public knowledge about Jan Karski's extraordinary courage and commitment. This American campaign is joined by a similar undertaking by the Polish History Museum in Warsaw, Poland.  I would like to have reprinted with my remarks today the eloquent tribute to Jan Karski made recently by David Harris, Executive Director of the American Jewish Committee. For those who are unfamiliar with Karski's singular effort to sound the alarm regarding the unfolding Holocaust in Europe, I urge them to read David's description, published in the Jerusalem Post, of what Jan Karski did, and why it still matters today.                            [Oct. 17, 2011]                           Ode to Jan Karski                           (By David Harris)       He passed away in 2000, at the age of 86.       The more time goes by, the more I miss him. Precisely when      his voice is needed more than ever, he is no longer among us.       In 1914, Jan Karski (ne Kozielewski) was born to a Catholic      family in Poland. The youngest of eight children, in 1939 he      was mobilized in the Polish army just before the Nazi      invasion on September 1. His wartime saga as officer, as      Soviet prisoner, as escapee, in the hands of the Gestapo, and      as a Polish Underground activist and courier, is beyond      remarkable.       In a world today where words such as ``courage'' and      ``heroism'' have been so overused--applied freely from sports      to entertainment to politics--as to be rendered practically      meaningless, Jan Karski was the rare human being who embodied      both.       He put his life on the line repeatedly in defense of higher      principles--the struggle against Nazism and the defense of      his homeland, Poland. He carried with him all his life the      physical scars of his experience, including the wrists he      slit in an attempted suicide after prolonged beating by his      Nazi captors.       The emotional scars never healed, either. Nor did he want      them to. After the war, serving on the faculty of Georgetown      University for four decades, he would not allow what he had      witnessed to fade from memory, though, given his unusual      modesty, he refused to make a second career from his past      exploits.       He had seen the monstrous, indescribable bestiality of the      Third Reich unleashed throughout Poland. And Poland was the      epicenter of the Nazi grand design.       In 1944, he wrote a book, Story of a Secret State: My      Report to the World, after he had reached the United States      on assignment to recount what he had seen in Poland to      American officials. Once here, he was told by his superiors      not to return because his underground cover had been blown.       The book was an instant bestseller. Over the years,      however, it faded into obscurity. Now it has been republished      by Penguin in the United Kingdom, with, it is to be hoped, an      American edition to follow.       It is a gripping account. Indeed, it should be must-reading      for an understanding of the Second World War from the ground      up.       In effect, it tells three stories.       The first is of Karski, especially from the years 1939 to      1944.       The narrative is straightforward, unadorned, and moving--a      sobering reminder of what man is capable of when moral and      physical courage meld into one.       The second is of wartime Poland, and especially the      development of the Polish resistance movement.       There is no other story like it in occupied Europe. Not      only did local officials refuse to collaborate with the      Nazis, unlike the experience in France, Norway, and many      other countries, but the combined efforts of the Polish      government-in-exile and the elaborately woven underground      were beyond anything imaginable at the time.       And the third was of the Polish Jewish tragedy.       Before the clandestine journey that took him to London and      Washington, to meetings with the likes of British Foreign      Minister Anthony Eden and U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt,      Karski, wearing a Star of David armband, was smuggled twice      into the Warsaw ghetto. Later, disguised as a guard, he spent      hours in a Nazi camp that shipped Jews to the Belzec death      camp.       What he saw in the Warsaw Ghetto and Izbica Lubelska never      left him.       Here is what he wrote in Story of a Secret State: ``I know      history. I have learned a great deal about the evolution of      nations, political systems, social doctrines, methods of      conquest, persecution, and extermination, and I know, too,      that never in the history of mankind, never anywhere in the      realm of human relations did anything occur to compare with      what was inflicted on the Jewish population of Poland.''       Then he asks: ``Is it still necessary to describe the      Warsaw ghetto?''       Fortunately, he answered his own question. Unfortunately,      however, not everyone read his response.       In the past decade alone, after Karski's death, we have      witnessed a flurry of pro-Palestinian activists--from members      of the British Parliament like George Galloway, Oona King and      Jenny Tonge, to Norwegian diplomat Trine Lelling; from U.N.      rapporteur Richard Falk to Portuguese Nobel laureate Jose      Saramago; from Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez to Spanish      newspaper cartoonists--who superimpose Nazi terminology on      Israel with abandon, including obscene comparisons of the      Warsaw Ghetto and Gaza Strip.       Here's Karski's reply at the time: ``So much has already      been written about it, there have been so many accounts by      unimpeachable witnesses. A cemetery? No, for these bodies      were still moving, were indeed often violently agitated.      These were still living people, if you could call them such.      For apart from their skin, eyes, and voice there was nothing      human left in these palpitating figures. Everywhere there was      hunger, misery, the atrocious stench of decomposing bodies,      the pitiful moans of dying children, the desperate cries and      gasps of a people struggling for life against impossible      odds.''       And then, perhaps anticipating what the impact of time and      distance might mean for understanding this era, Karski wrote:      ``I know that many people will not believe me, will not be      able to believe me, will think I exaggerate or invent. But I      saw it.''       Until his dying day, Karski stood as a guardian of the past      and its relevance to the present. He remained a fierce anti-     communist and, fortunately, lived to see his beloved Poland      return to the democratic family of nations, including      accession to NATO. He served as an early warning system      against the recurrence of anti-Semitism. And he understood      the central role of Israel in the life of the Jewish people.       In 1993, AJC gave Karski its highest award. In his      acceptance speech, he memorably declared that he was      confident there would never again be a Holocaust against the      Jews and said he knew why. He paused for a moment and then,      summoning his one-word explanation from the depths of his      soul, he pronounced each of the three syllables of ``Israel''      as if they were separate words, allowing the moment to      linger.       Jan Karski is gone, leaving no immediate family behind. But      with his eyewitness account, his recorded words, and his      towering example of courage, conviction, and compassion,      there is hope the world won't descend into an abyss of moral      fog and historical relativism or denial.       May Story of a Secret State become required reading, as a      source of both information and inspiration, in every 20th      century history course. And may copies find their way into      the hands of those today who display their shameful ignorance      by misrepresenting history.                          ____________________
