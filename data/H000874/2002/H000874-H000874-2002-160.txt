Speaker, we continue on what I call the fiscal irresponsibility rampage that the majority party is on. I want to say at the outset to my friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Weller), I do not know what the exact numbers are, but let me tell the gentleman something, 100 percent of the people who live in my district will be adversely affected by the interest rates that he will drive up by his race towards deeper and deeper and deeper deficits. That is what will happen to everybody in his fiscal irresponsibility rampage that this committee is on and the Congress is pursuing.  It is popular, of course, to get up here week after week and vote for tax cuts. Of course. It is easy. It is also irresponsible. As we have $314 billion in debt this year facing us and trillions of dollars in the years ahead, is it responsible fiscal leadership? It is absolutely not. Not with the record surpluses turning into deficits in less than one year of this administration. Not with the Federal Government expected to run a budget deficit of more than $300 billion spending 100 percent of the Social Security surpluses; not with a House majority violating its repeated pledge not to raid the Social Security surpluses; and not with the Treasury Department's practically begging Congress to raise the debt limit before June 28, which they have refused to do.  Do Democrats support marriage penalty relief? Of course we do. It is the fair and right thing to do. But why this bill and why now? There is only 2 weeks left before the 4th of July break and we have not considered one of the 13 must-pass appropriations bills.  Furthermore, fully 70 percent of the marriage penalty provisions of this GOP bill will not take affect until 2006 and most till 2011, as the previous speaker said.  Is this legislation more important than defense? Is it more important than homeland security? Is it more important than prescription drugs and a host of other pressing issues so we can affect 2011? I think any commonsense response to that is, of course it is not.  The truth is this bill will cost more than $63 billion over the next decade. And every last cent, every last cent of that $63 billion comes out of the Social Security surplus. Worse yet, in the second decade of this century, when the baby boomers begin to retire in full force, the cost of this bill is estimated to be $330 billion out of Social Security revenues. The bill is nothing but an exercise in demagoguery. I urge the Members to vote no, to vote yes on the substitute, vote no on the bill.                         Parliamentary Inquiry
