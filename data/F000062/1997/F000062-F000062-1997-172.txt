 It has been a very special privilege for me to work with the Senator on the centrist coalition.  I am not in the leadership of this body, but I would be hopeful that the leadership would hear this. I think this budget agreement--on our side, we have said every time we have had the debate on the balanced budget amendment, we do not need an amendment to the Constitution. Let us just sit down and do it. Well, we make a mockery of our own statements if we do not sit down and do it right now. And we have that opportunity to do it in this agreed-upon compromise.  So I would be hopeful that it might be possible to put together some guarantee both for the Senator from Utah and the Senator from Massachusetts, who have worked so hard, both of them. I have never seen the chairman of the Judiciary Committee as passionate as he has been in the Chamber in the last 2 hours. He obviously believes. The Senator from Massachusetts has a long history--the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, other bills, his chairmanship and his ranking status on the Labor Committee. I think we know his commitment and we know he will be there forworking families and for children at any time. I hope there can be some appreciation in this body for the need to have an agreement to honor the agreement that was made and to once and for all say to the American public we have come together as two political parties. We have balanced this budget by the end of 5 years, and we can all be proud of working together.
