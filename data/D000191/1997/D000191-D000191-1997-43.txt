Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Speaker, here we are today on the last day of this session of the Congress before the big recess engaged in the big lie, the big lie. This is a balanced budget agreement. Well, after we voted yesterday, the Congressional Budget Office came up with an analysis, and the analysis is, guess what? Deficits have gone down for the last 5 years, but next year for the first time in 5 years they will go up and we will double the deficit by 1999.  The American people know we cannot give away huge tax breaks, increase spending, and balance the budget. Congress did this once before in the early 1980's, and guess what. Three years later they came back and they had to repeal substantial portions of what they did.  This bill today will reduce revenues to the Federal Government by $275 billion over 10 years, and it is going to balance the budget. This is great. We are going to have zero tax on capital gains, the Republicans tell us now by next year, and that will balance the budget. We will not tax capital gains, but all those little people who work for wages will pay taxes, and that is how we will balance the budget.  What an absurd and very, very cynical assertion on their side of the aisle. Listen to a few things in here:  Simplify foreign tax credit limitation for dividends from 1,050 companies to provide look-throughs starting in 2003. Now all the middle-class Americans out there looking for that foreign deduction for the look-through starting in 2003, that is a billion dollar gift. Well, I am sure that a lot of my constituents, average working Americans, are looking forward to that.  Then we have the capital gains provisions, $21 billion, and now they say they want to repeal the tax.  Had a young woman in my office yesterday. She wants to become a neurosurgeon. We talked a little bit. She said, ``What does this mean?''  I said, ``It means if you become a neurosurgeon, you earn $250,000 a year, you'll pay 40 percent of your income in taxes. But the rich kid who went to college with you who has not worked a day in his or her life who then just invests for a living will pay taxes at half that rate.  She was outraged. She said, ``How can that be fair?''  Well, they are saying it is not fair, the rich kid who inherits the money tax free should pay zero income tax his or her entire life; that is the Republican position. That is absurd.  Then we have the alternative minimum tax. It was so embarrassing in the 1980's when the largest, most profitable corporations in America not only did not pay taxes, they got tax refunds paid for by the rest of us for taxes they did not pay, that Ronald Reagan supported putting in place an alternative minimum tax for corporations. They are repealing that here today. That will cost $20 billion, a nice gift to the large corporations. Oh, that is for middle-income America.                              {time}  1115  That is for middle-income America. Sure it is, Mr. Speaker.  Then we have the subtotal here for gift and generation-skipping tax provisions, which they call estate tax relief, $35 billion. So the sum total here today is $275 billion in tax rates; crumbs for the middle class, and just wonderful bounty for the wealthiest in America.
