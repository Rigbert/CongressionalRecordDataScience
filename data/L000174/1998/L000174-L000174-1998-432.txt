President, I wish to applaud the distinguished Senator from Washington State. Senator Murray has stated the reasons why the Senate voted the right way on Margaret McKeown and on Ed Shea. I would also note for the record that the Senator from Washington has been extraordinarily diligent in working very hard for these two highly qualified nominees. I know the frustration she has felt with the delay, especially on Margaret McKeown and with so many vacancies on the Ninth Circuit and given that this has been 2 years--in fact, 2 years this Sunday.  This delay is the result of a process that has become a little bit crazy. I commend the distinguished Senator, and I thank her for her help on this. I think it would have been impossible for us to be here for this vote without her help, and I applaud her for that.
