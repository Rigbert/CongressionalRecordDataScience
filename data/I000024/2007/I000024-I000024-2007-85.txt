President, I am going to wind the clock back to 1994. I had the occasion of voting twice against NAFTA, once when I was in the House and once when I was in the Senate, in the same year because I came in in a special election. I remember at that time we had a delegation of six, four House Members and two Senators from Oklahoma, and I was the only one out of six who voted against NAFTA.  Ironically, the very arguments I made in the House and Senate back in 1994 are the same things we are hearing now. I said at that time I could see what was going to be happening in the future; that we would be having Mexican truckers coming in; that they would be competing in a way where they would not have to qualify with all of our environmental standards, our safety standards, our wage and hour standards. It appears to me that is the case.  I listened very carefully to my good friend from Missouri, but I have not seen--and having reviewed the IG report--that all of these questions have been answered. I have to say I am inclined to agree with the Senator from North Dakota that the problem that existed in 1994 still exists today, and I would probably oppose this amendment.  I would like to also make a comment, a request. When I have a chance, after the disposition of this, I would like to bring up amendment No. 2796 for its immediate consideration. I will wait and see if I can get in the queue.  I yield the floor.
