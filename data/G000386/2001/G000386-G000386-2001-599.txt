 President, I yield myself such time as I might consume up to 15 minutes. I may not use all 15 minutes, if there are other speakers waiting to come to the floor.  I have been asked by the manager of this bill to accommodate Senator Durbin by adding 11 minutes at the end of the time of morning business for Senator Durbin, and in the process of my doing that for Senator Thomas, I need to apologize to the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu, because she asked to do the same thing. I guess we weren't at that point so accommodating because I said I would accommodate her at 3 o'clock this afternoon. I apologize to Senator Landrieu.
