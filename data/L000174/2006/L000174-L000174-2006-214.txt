President, I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer. I commend him for his duty in the chair on a Friday morning where the smell of jet fumes have proven an allure to many of our colleagues in both parties who have headed off. I might say to my friend, the distinguished Presiding Officer, I do realize he cannot respond from the chair, but all of us look forward to that time. I am willing to spend the month of August in my own State of Vermont.  I said to somebody that we make sacrifices in these jobs, and they suggested the idea of being in Vermont for a month, which is one of the prettiest times of the year up there, was probably not the world's greatest sacrifice. I invite the Presiding Officer and anybody else to come up and visit. You don't have to wear a tie, and you can go to county fairs. Most of the people at the county fairs are Republicans, but most of them vote for me, so I am delighted to go there. They would vote for the distinguished Presiding Officer, too.                          ____________________[Page S8404]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                           THE AUGUST RECESS
