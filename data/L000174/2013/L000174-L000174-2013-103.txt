He also spoke about what this shutdown is doing to law enforcement.  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, I am going to speak further on that. But I couldn't help but think, as I was asked by a friend in Vermont: What is going on?  I said: Well, you know, we had hundreds of hours of committee meetings, votes, and all. We had hours and hours of debate in the House and the Senate, and we passed the Affordable Care Act.  Even though it passed the House and the Senate and was signed into law by the President, however, the Tea Party continues to oppose the law. So they did two things that they thought would knock it out. One, they went to a Republican dominated U.S. Supreme Court and said let's knock out this law. The Supreme Court said no. They upheld the law.  Then they ran a candidate for President of the United States, whose main argument was that he would get rid of the Affordable Care Act.  He lost badly.  Throughout all this time and after 40 votes to get rid of the Affordable Care Act, the Republicans have not offered what we would get as an alternative? Most parents like the fact that theirchildren can stay on their insurance while they are in college. Are you going to get rid of that--and do they have something with which to replace that? Most people like the fact that if you have a preexisting condition, cancer, a heart condition, or something like that, they can still get health care. They want to do away with that. What do they have to replace this sort of care?  After 40 votes, a Presidential election, the Supreme Court--they have lost everywhere. It makes me think of General Custer at Little Big Horn who came galloping in because he knew he was going to win.  They have been handed the same kind of defeat that Custer was at Little Big Horn. And if they have a better idea on health insurance for America, then I think they should have the guts to bring it to the floor and vote up or down, not just shut down the government like they are doing now.  Today marks the fifth day of the government shutdown, and by refusing to pass a continuing resolution to simply fund the continuing operations of the Federal Government, Republicans are threatening the critical functions of all three branches of government. As chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I am acutely aware of the devastating impact that Republicans' treatment of Federal judiciary is having on our system of justice.  The last time Republicans refused to pay the bills that we in Congress had already incurred, it undermined our Nation's credit rating. It also resulted in what is known as sequestration and the corresponding cuts to the Federal judicial branch have been devastating. But with the ongoing shutdown of the entire Federal Government, a handful of ideologues in the House of Representatives are holding the entire judicial system hostage and this threatens our entire democracy.  Earlier this year, in the face of sequestration, a group of 87 Federal district judges warned that sustained budget cuts ``have forced us to slash our operations to the bone, and we believe that our constitutional duties, public safety, and the quality of the justice system will be profoundly compromised by any further cuts.''  Now, thanks to the Republican shutdown, according to a letter to all Federal courts from Judge John Bates, Director of the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, the judiciary will only be able to remain open for approximately 10 business days into October. What will happen after those 10 days? What happens when the operating funds run out completely? Will we be able to swiftly bring criminals and terrorists to justice? There is no court to bring them to. Will small businesses and individuals be able to have their claims resolved? Again, no court. Each and every Federal court in this country will soon have to start making decisions about what part of justice is essential and what can be delayed until funding is restored. If this shutdown continues, millions of Americans will not have access to the justice they deserve under our Constitution. Here in the United States, where we have the most open, transparent, honest, effective system of justice in the world, we are slamming the doors on everybody--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents alike.  This coming Monday, the first Monday in October, marks the opening of the new term of our Supreme Court. On its first day, it will hear an important case about a worker's right to bring an age discrimination claim under the Constitution. On its second day, it will hear another significant case about whether there should be any limits on the amount of money wealthy individuals can pump into our elections. If the shutdown continues, it is unclear how our courts, including our highest court, will cope with the funding being withheld. Will the Court remain open to the public to hear arguments the following week if this shutdown continues? Will local courthouses have to shut down entirely for parts of the year? Will the guarantee of defense for the indigent, established under Gideon v. Wainwright, continue to be eroded by further cuts to our Federal public defenders? Or will we in Congress finally turn the page on our fiscal mistreatment of a co-equal branch of government?  We must not take for granted that we have the greatest justice system in the world. Its cost is less than 1 percent of the entire Federal budget, yet we fail to support it. The New York Times, referencing Judge Bates's letter and the ongoing stress to our justice system, rightly noted this week that unless Congress ends this needless shutdown, ``the damage to American justice would be compounded and hard to recover from once the impasse is over.''  I thank the men and women of the judicial branch of our Federal Government for their dedication under increasingly difficult circumstances and I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the New York Times, Oct. 1, 2013]                      The Courts and the Shutdown                        (By Dorothy J. Samuels)       The opening of a new Supreme Court term on the statutorily      prescribed first Monday in October is always surrounded by a      fair amount of drama having to do with the momentous legal      issue the justices will be taking up. The government shutdown      has imbued the start of the 2013-2014 term this coming      Monday, Oct. 7, with a different sort of suspense.       A notice posted on the Supreme Court's website says the      court ``will continue to conduct its normal operations''      through this Friday. It is silent about what will happen if      the ``lapse of appropriations,'' as the notice delicately      describes the madness, continues beyond that. The court will      be announcing its plans a week at a time.       It is expected, though, that the term's first oral      arguments will proceed as scheduled, shutdown or no, and that      the court will conduct business as usual, much as it did      during the Clinton-era shutdowns. How long Supreme Court      operations could remain unharmed if the shutdown drags on is      unclear.       For lower federal courts, a prolonged shutdown could be      disastrous. Sufficient reserve funds are on hand for normal      court operations for just 10 business days, through Oct. 15,      according to a memo recently circulated by Judge John Bates,      director of the Administrative Office of the United States      Courts.       Once those funds are depleted, there would need to be      extensive furloughing of staff, and reductions in probation,      pretrial and courthouse security services to comply with the      federal Anti-Deficiency Act, which allows only ``essential      work'' to continue during a government shutdown. Coming on      top of the devastation to the nation's court system caused by      the maniacal across-the-board budget cuts known as      sequestration, the damage to American justice would be      compounded and hard to recover from once the impasse is over.
