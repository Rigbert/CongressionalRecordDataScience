President, on July 1, 2005, we welcomed home a son of Providence College to assume the presidency of that great institution. Father Brian Shanley is a man of great intellect, great enthusiasm, and a man of deep and abiding faith.  He is superbly prepared to continue the extraordinary progress of Providence College as a distinguished community of scholars serving to educate the talented young men and women who proudly claim PC as their own.  Generations of students and graduates of Providence College have enriched our Nation and our State not only with their knowledge but just as importantly with their character.  Father Shanley understands this great legacy of Providence College and, through his effort and his energy, he will sustain and enhance this extraordinary place.  St. Thomas Aquinas, a theologian who Father Shanley is acquainted with, wrote ``If the highest aim of a captain were to preserve his ship, he would keep it in port forever.''  Under Father Shanley, I do not think Providence College will get many ``port calls.'' He will sail forward with determination, faith, and good humor to inspire faculty and students to think seriously, to face the challenges of our times, and to live a life of character and concern that has always been the hallmark of Providence College.  I wish him good luck and Godspeed.                          ____________________
