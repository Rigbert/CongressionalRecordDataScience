 President, today the Senate will resume consideration of the campaign finance reform legislation.  There will be numerous amendments offered with a time limitation of 30 minutes. Senators should be aware that all amendments must be offered prior to 11 a.m. By previous consent, any votes ordered will be stacked to occur at 11 o'clock this morning.  A vote on final passage, as everyone I think now knows, will occur on Monday at 5:30.                          ____________________
