 Let me just summarize this part of the debate--we will be resuming the debate after the vote--by quoting a letter from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners to Senator Nelson and myself. They raise exactly the point that Senator Nelson and I have raised:       Members of the NAIC are also concerned about enforcement.      As you know as a former state regulator, if there is no      enforcement then there is no protection. States have      developed the infrastructure necessary to receive and process      consumer complaints in a timely fashion and ensure that      insurers comply with the laws. The federal government does      not have this capability, and [these] proposals [before the      Senate] do not provide any resources to federal agencies to      develop such capability. It has taken the Health Care      Financing Administration (HCFA) years to develop the      infrastructure required to enforce the Health Insurance      Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) which included      only six basic provisions that most states had already      enacted. The proposed patient protection bills are far more      complicated than HIPAA and will require considerable      oversight.  If we pass the McCain-Kennedy bill without this amendment, we are holding forth a hollow promise to consumers.                           Amendment No. 820
