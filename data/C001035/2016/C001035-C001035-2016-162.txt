President, I rise to honor and congratulate the Vital Voices Global Partnership and the 2016 Vital Voices Award recipients: Hafsat Abiola, Khanim Latif, Yoani Sanchez, and Akanksha Hazari.  The Vital Voices Global Partnership identifies, invests in, and brings visibility to extraordinary women around the world by unleashing their leadership potential to transform lives and accelerate peace and prosperity. Vital Voices equips such leaders with the management, business development, marketing, and communications skills required to expand their enterprises, to provide for their families, and create jobs in their communities. Vital Voices seeks to empower these women leaders to create a better world for us all.  The Vital Voices Global Partnership has trained and mentored over 14,000 women in 144 countries over the last 15 years, in addition to this year's award recipients Hafsat Abiola of Nigeria, founder of the Kudirat Initiative for Democracy, campaigns to end violence against women, trains young female leaders, and works to increase civic participation. Khanim Latif of Iraq, the Director of Asuda, places her life at risk to provide safe haven to victims of sexual and gender-based violence, and fights threats of honor killings and female genital cutting. Yoani Sanchez of Cuba, founder of ``Generacion Y'', created a blog that captures daily life in Cuba in an effort to encourage political change and increase public awareness and engagement; and Akanksha Hazari of India fights to deliver basic necessities such as clean water and electricity to impoverished communities and to empower the underserved in India.  Such leaders, supported by the Vital Voices Global Partnership Fund, and through their selfless efforts and advocacy, continue to advance social justice, support democracy, and strengthen the rule of law across the globe.  With this in mind, I am pleased to offer this resolution with Senator Feinstein.
