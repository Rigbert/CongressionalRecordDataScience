The National Rifle Association is trying to put up some figleaf and say they are really for gun control. America knows better. We have been listening to these folks for a long time. They were opposed to the prohibition against cop-killer bullets--special bullets that would penetrate the bulletproof vests worn by policemen--because it infringed on people's constitutional rights. Give me a break. There isn't a right in the Bill of Rights that isn't limited for the common good.
