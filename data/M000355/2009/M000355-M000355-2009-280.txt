 President, as some of my colleagues may be aware, this week the State Department acceded to a Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in Southeast Asia, TAC. This action reflects an effort by the administration to engage vigorously in the region, which I applaud.  The State Department consulted with the Senate prior to taking this step. During the course of these consultations, Senator Kerry, Senator Lugar, and I sought clarification on issues related to the substance of the TAC and to the unique process suggested for U.S. accession. To confirm our understandings on these points, Senators Kerry, Lugar, and I sent a letter to the Secretary of State on July 10, 2009. On the basis of the understandings set forth in this letter, we did not object to the Department's plan for acceding to the TAC. I believe the letter may be of some interest to Senators since it involves both the constitutional role of the Senate in the treaty making process and American foreign policy in Southeast Asia.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter to Secretary Clinton dated July 10, 2009.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2009.     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,     Secretary of State,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Clinton: We write to you regarding the      proposed U.S. accession to the Treaty of Amity and      Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC). We believe that U.S.      accession to the TAC reflects the strong American commitment      to the region and to vigorous engagement with the Association      of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), both of which we fully      support. The U.S. has important foreign policy and economic      interests in Southeast Asia which we believe this agreement      can further.       There are two important points of clarification, however,      that we wish to make as part of the Senate's input in the      context of the State Department's congressional      consultations. First, we understand that the Department is      considering having the United States accede to the TAC in      late July as a sole executive agreement, which would not      require the advice and consent of the Senate. We note that      the title of the agreement refers to the agreement as a      ``treaty,'' and we are unaware of any precedent for the      United States acceding to an agreement styled as a ``treaty''      without the advice and consent of the Senate as provided for      in Article 11, Section 2 of the Constitution. At the same      time, we are mindful that other factors apart from the formal      name of the agreement could suggest that it is consistent      with U.S. practice for the United States to accede to the TAC      as an executive agreement. Of particular importance, the      agreement is largely limited to general pledges of diplomatic      cooperation and would not appear to obligate the United      States to take (or refrain from taking) any specific action      (with the exception of provisions of Article X which we      understand will be the subject of a reservation as discussed      below). We also note that the United States did not take part      in the negotiations among ASEAN countries leading up to the      conclusion of the TAC in 1976, or in the decision to      characterize it as a treaty.       In light of these unique considerations, we will not object      to the Department's plan to accede to the TAC as an executive      agreement. We continue to believe, however, that the use of      the term ``treaty'' in the title of an agreement will      generally dictate that Senate advice and consent will be      required before the United States may accede to the      agreement. In this regard, treatment of the TAC as an      executive agreement should not be considered a precedent for      treating future agreements entitled ``treaties'' as sole      executive agreements. To ensure our understanding that the      process surrounding this agreement is not misinterpreted in      the future as a precedent, we will submit this letter into      the Congressional Record. We would also request that the      State Department include it in the next edition of the Digest      of United States Practice in International Law.       Second, Article X of the TAC provides that ``[e]ach High      Contracting party shall not in any manner or form participate      in any activity which shall constitute a threat to the      political and economic stability, sovereignty, or territorial      integrity of another High Contracting Party.'' We also note      that the U.S. has proposed a reservation to the TAC that      states that the TAC, noting in particular Article X, ``does      not limit actions taken by the United States that it      considers necessary to address a threat to its national      interests.''       We interpret this reservation as ensuring that the TAC does      not limit the authority of the U.S. government--either the      executive branch or the Congress--to take actions that it      considers necessary in pursuit of U.S. national interests in      the region or with respect to any individual nation.       We thank you for your close consideration of this matter      and for the Department's consultation prior to acceding to      the TAC.           Sincerely,     John F. Kerry,       Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.     Mitch McConnell,       Republican Leader United States Senate.     Richard G. Lugar,       Ranking Member Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.                          ____________________
