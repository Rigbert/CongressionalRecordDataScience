  Mr. President, I will not go through the whole of my statement. Let me just make a few other points.  I must say I compliment the Chair for his work and his, not only intellectual dedication but, it seems to me, passionate commitment to do something about the international sex trafficking occurs. This is a women's issue internationally.  I suspect he feels the same way I feel about this legislation. I suspect he believes there is probably not much more that he has done that is as tangible and might affect the lives of people, that you could look to, you could count, you could touch, you could see. When I said there are a lot of calls, literally over half a million women, over 500,000 women have picked up the phone and called, probably huddled in the dark in the corner of their closet or their room, hoping their husband or significant other is not around, and said in a whisper, ``Help me, help me''--given their name and address and said, ``Help me.''  Think of that. Think of that. A half a million women have picked up the phone. How many more have not picked up the phone?  The thing we should be aware of--and I know the Chair knows this--it is counterintuitive to think a child who watches his mother being beaten to a pulp would then beat his wife or girlfriend later. That is counterintuitive. Wouldn't you think that would be the last thing a child would do? But the psychologists tell us it is the first thing. They learn violence is a readily available and acceptable means of resolving power disputes.  You know, as the Chair I am sure knows--I am not being solicitous because of his work in this generic field--about 60 percent of the people in prison today have been abused or were in families where they witnessed abuse. This is not rocket science. I hope we get on with it.  There are a few things I want to mention. This bill does not merely reauthorize what we have done. I made a commitment, when I wrote this bill and we finally got it passed as part of the Biden crime bill, that I would go back and look at it--and others have, too, but personally since I was so involved in it--and the parts that were working I would try to beef up; the parts that were weak and did not make sense, I would jettison. In the reauthorization, I would get rid of them.  I hope my colleagues will see we have kept that commitment. We take the parts we found were lacking in our first bill and we, in fact, beefed them up. We kept the police training, the court training, and all those issues. We kept the violent crime reduction trust fund which, by the way, gets about $6.1 billion a year from paychecks that are not going to Federal employees anymore and go into this trust fund. It trains attorneys general and the rest.  What it does beyond all it has already been doing is it provides for transitional housing for women. We have over 300,000, in large part thanks to Senator Specter from Pennsylvania, who has been so dedicated in his appropriations subcommittee to this. We have built all these new shelters. We do not send women to shantytowns. This is decent housing with anonymity, giving them an opportunity to get out from under the male fist abusing them, and they can bring their children with them.  Seventy percent of children on the street are homeless because their mothers are on the street, a victim of domestic violence. We realized there is a gap here because there are so many women knocking down the door to get into these shelters to get out of abusive circumstances. We can only keep them there for 30 days, 60 days, sometimes longer. They cannot go back home because their husband has either trashed the home or tried to sell the home or they have to move back in with the husband. We tried to find some transitional housing that takes them down the road for the next couple of years and gives them some hope.  We also beef up cross-State protection orders. For example: God forbid there is a woman staffer in ear shot and she lives in Virginia or Maryland or a nearby State and she went to the court and said: Look, my husband or my boyfriend or this man has harassed me or beaten me, and I want him tostay away from me. The court issues what they call stay-away orders, victim protection orders.  That woman may work in the District of Columbia. Now she crosses the line from Virginia or Maryland into D.C., and she gets harassed. The man violates the order, and she goes to a D.C. cop or D.C. court. They do not have any record of it. There is no record or they do not honor it. I am not talking about D.C. particularly. One State does not honor another State.  What we have done is beefed up the requirement that States honor these stay-away orders when women cross the line, literally cross a State line, cross a jurisdictional line.  There is a very well-known reporter at the Washington Post--although he has written about this, I am not going to take the liberty of using his name without his permission. His daughter was in a similar situation in Massachusetts. She was abused by someone. A stay-away order was issued. She was in Massachusetts. She was in a different county. The man, in fact, violated the order. They went into a local court. The local court, because there were not computerized records, did not know there was a State stay-away order.  By the way, the stay-away order says if you violate the order, you go to jail. If a man follows a woman into a different jurisdiction and the jurisdiction knows that order exists and he violates the order, they can arrest him and send him to jail on the spot because it is part of the probation, in effect, to stay away. It is part of the sentence, if you will; not literally a sentence. They can put him in jail.  George's daughter said: This guy has an order. He is not supposed to be near me.  The judge said: We have no record of that order because they are not computerized for interchange of these records.  They walked outside the courtroom, and this man shot her dead. He shot dead on the spot the daughter of this famous Washington reporter because there was not the honoring, even within the State, of these orders. We beefed that up.  By the way, in my State of Delaware, which has a relatively low murder rate, 60 percent of all the people murdered in the last 2 years were women murdered by their husband or their boyfriend. Did my colleagues hear what I just said? Murdered by their husband or boyfriend. The vast majority of women who are murdered in America are murdered by a significant other or their husband. This is not a game.  We are now in a position where there is, in fact, no authorization for the continuation of this law for which we worked so hard. Come October 1, which is what, how many days? Today is the 26th. The point is, in less than a week, this law is out of business.  I have much more to say about this, but I will not take the time of the Senate now. I am encouraged, I am heartened by what the House did. I am encouraged by what Senator Lott said to me today on the floor, and I look forward to the opportunity to convince the leader to bring this up in whatever form that will allow us to pass it because, again, this is not a Republican or Democratic issue. This literally affects the lives of thousands and thousands of women.                          ____________________
