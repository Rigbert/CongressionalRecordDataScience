Speaker, it is my distinct honor to congratulate some of the most dedicated and skilled workers in northwest Indiana. On September 17, 1999, in a salute to their workers' durability and longevity, the Sheet Metal Workers Local #20, of Gary, Indiana, will honor their members with sixty, fifty, forty, and twenty-five years of continuous service. These individuals, in addition to the other Local #20 members who have served northwest Indiana so diligently for such a long time, are a testament to the prototypical American worker: loyal, dedicated, and hard-working.  The men and women of Local #20 are a fine representation of America's working families. I am proud to represent such dedicated men and women in Congress. The Sheet Medal Workers Constitution states, ``* * * to establish and maintain desirable working conditions and thus provide for themselves and their families that measure of comfort, happiness, and security to which every citizen is entitled in return for his labor, from a deep sense of pride in our trade, to give a fair day's work for a fair day's pay.'' For sixty years, Edward Shirnko and Denator Migliorini have followed this creed. For fifty years, the following individuals have followed this creed: Mike Busika, James Cameron, Earl Chance, Melvin Crook, Marvin Forsythe, Vernon W. Hoehn, Eugene Hornrich, James Kocman, Eugene Koontz, Richard McClelland, Marcus Meyer, Charles D. Meyers, James Moscato, Raymond Mueller, Joseph E. Mullholland, William D. Nielsen, Chester Nowak, Ray Ritthaler, William Singel, Joseph Zeman, and Thomas M. Zimmer. In 1959, Jack Bacon, J.B. Bugg, Melvin Earnhart, Willima K. Hart, Vernon W. Hoehn, Louis Holzli, James R. Hood, Dellis Ivers, Leroy Johnson, Homer Keller, Robert Kish, Gordon LaBounty, Frank Macewicz, Jr., Clyde Martin, Gilbert Mecchia, Terry Messenich, Donald O'Dell, Homer Rachford, Lorne Rearick, John Sisco, and Daniel Wracker began their forty years of service to northwest Indiana and membership in the Sheet Metal Workers trade union. In addition to the great service and dedication displayed by the sixty, fifty, and forty-year continued service members, the members with twenty-five years of continued service that will be honored include: Daniel Bajda, Frank Beigelbeck, Lloyd Bielski, Timothy Bolster, Joseph L. Byres, Dan Gross, James Hirschfelder, Ted Jones, Vincent Macielewicz, James Odle, Peter Nielson, Larry P. Long, Tom Lopez, Donald McAuliffe, James Moskalick, John Moskalick, Leo Plawecki, Glen Shanks, Benito Torres, David Towasnicki, Thomas D. Zimmer, Melvin Lolkema, and William J. Singel.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these dedicated, upstanding members of the Sheet Metal Workers Local #20 for their hard work in fulfilling the American dream. I offer my heartfelt congratulations to these individuals, as they have worked arduously to make this dream possible for others. They have proven themselves to be distinguished advocates for the labor movement, and they have made northwest I a better place in which to live and work.                          ____________________
