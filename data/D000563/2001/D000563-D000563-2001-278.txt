President, I rise in support of Senator Stabenow's amendment. This amendment simply asks that a study be conducted on the environmental effects of drilling in the Great Lakes. And to give that study time to be completed, a moratorium be placed on drilling for the next 2 years.  Before we put in jeopardy one of the world's largest bodies of freshwater, it is sound public policy that we first have a better understanding of the impact drilling would have on the Great Lakes.  After all, the Great Lakes contain 20 percent of the world's freshwater and 95 percent of the freshwater in the United States. The Great Lakes contain 6 quadrillion gallons of freshwater--only the polar ice caps and Lake Baikal in Siberia contain more.  Preserving our world's supply of freshwater is becoming increasingly important as the population grows. Think of it this way, if you put all the water in the world in a 1 gallon container, 1 tablespoon of that would represent all the freshwater in the world. And \1/5\ of that tablespoon would represent the freshwater from the Great Lakes.  Lake Michigan alone provides safe drinking water for more than 10 million people every day. More than 33 million people live in the Great Lakes basin.  In addition to providing vital drinking water, the Great Lakes are a source of a thriving tourism industry, and provide ecological diversity and habitat for migratory waterfowl and fish.  Last week, the Senate passed my amendment to the Interior spending bill to prevent energy developing in our national monuments. Much like our national monuments, the Great Lakes will do little to add to our energy independence.  The 13 directionally drilled wells on the Michigan shore (7 of which are still in operation) have produced, since 1979, less than half a million barrels of oil. In contrast, the United States consumes more than 18 million barrels of oil a day, according to the American Petroleum Institute. So all the oil drilled from the Great Lakes in the past 20 years has amounted to less than 1 hour's worth of U.S. oil consumption.  As many as 30 new wells have been proposed for oil drilling under Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Even if we produced 30 times as much oil from these new wells as we have from the older ones, it wouldn't supply enough crude oil to keep the United States running for one day.  A serious accident could contaminate Lake Michigan and put at risk the drinking water used by millions of people from Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Putting our Nation's largest supply of fresh water at risk for less than a day's worth of oil makes no sense.  Modern technology may reduce the chances for a bad oil spill, but there are always uncontrollable factors, as we saw with the Exxon Valdez. Who would have thought that just one tanker could do so much damage? The Exxon Valdez measured 986 feet long--about the size of three football fields. But it spilled 10.8 million gallons of oil. It affected about 1,300 miles of shoreline. And it cost about $2.1 billion for Exxon to cleanup.  Proponents of drilling in the Great Lakes focus on the revenues to be gained or the oil to be produced. Sensible expansion of crude oil production can be a valuable component of a new energy strategy. But we should focus also on improved energy efficiency and target production in areas where the environmental risks are not as great.  Let's take care to protect our natural resources, and explore for oil and gas in environmentally safe locations. There is no sound reason to put the Great Lakes at risk.                          ____________________
