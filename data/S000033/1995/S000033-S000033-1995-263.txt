 Salinas, was President of that country. His brother is in jail under arrest for masterminding a political assassination. Furthermore, the former Deputy Attorney General of their country who had the responsibility for cracking down on the very serious drug problem in Mexico and the exporting of drugs from Mexico to the United States. Surprise, surprise. Where is that Deputy Attorney General today, who was their drug czar? My goodness, he is also in jail. He is in jail under charge that he has taken millions and millions of dollars from the Mexican drug cartel.  Mr. DeFAZIO. Do not forget that, of course, President Salinas said his brother was innocent and went back and staged I think it was a 12-hour hunger strike and then fled the country for the United States he was so convinced of his brother's innocence. He is of course somewhere at large in the United States living off of his Swiss back accounts and his investments in New York City and his many residences there.
