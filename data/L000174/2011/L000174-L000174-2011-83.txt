President, just to notify other Senators, I am shortly going to suggest the absence of a quorum. I will then ask us to come out of the quorum at noon, and unless I hear that somebody wishes to speak on either of the nominees, I will then move that time be yielded back. I willnot do that until 12:00. But I now suggest the absence of a quorum.
