President, I would like to take a moment to pay tribute to ADM Michael Mullen, a man who served our country with distinction for 43 years.  During his tenure as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, he has presided over the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, the historic repeal of the don't ask, don't tell policy, the successful operation against Osama bin Laden, and an episode of unprecedented change in the Middle East. He has been tireless in his job, having visited our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan so many times that we have lost count. Moreover, his tenure as Chairman has been noteworthy for the amount of time he has spent with our troops on the front lines of war.  Before becoming Chairman, Admiral Mullen served as the Navy's Chief and Vice Chief of Naval Operations, as the Commander of U.S. Naval Forces in Europe, and as the Commander of the Allied Joint Force Command in Naples, Italy. Over the course of his career, Admiral Mullen has served aboard seven warships, three times as the commanding officer. In the U.S. Navy's history, he is only the third naval officer ever to be appointed to four different four-star assignments. He is also one of the few remaining veterans of the Vietnam War serving in the top ranks of our military.  When the Vermont National Guard's 1-86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team deployed to Afghanistan in 2010, Admiral Mullen traveled to Vermont to visit the troops at one of their departure ceremonies. On a cold January morning, joined by his wife Deborah, he spoke to a hall packed with families and friends seeing their soldiers off to war. He thanked them for their service to our Nation, and he assured them all--the troops and their families--that they had the full support of our country's highest ranking military officer. It was a great comfort to the Guard, and they will not forget his expression of support. Neither will I.  In fact, Admiral Mullen and his wife, Deborah, have dedicated much of their time to advancing a range of initiatives to support troops and their families. These include wounded warrior care, veteran employment and education, survivor benefits, suicide prevention, and mental health. Again, these efforts speak to the type of man and leader Admiral Mullen is and to his commitment to our men and women in uniform.  I wish Mike and Deborah all the best. He departs the U.S. military with the sincere thanks of a grateful nation. I know that I have benefitted from his wise counsel over the years. America is fortunate to have such a leader.                          ____________________
