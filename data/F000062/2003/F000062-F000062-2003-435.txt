 President, I rise today to pay my respects to four more Californians who have died in combat in Iraq, as well as to nine other Americans who were stationed in California and have made the ultimate sacrifice in our efforts to liberate the Iraqi people. Most of these men have left family in California.  So far, of the 44 Americans who have died, 10 were from California, while another 9 were stationed there. This accounts for around 45 percent of all those killed in action.  But first, I would like to take a moment to remind my colleagues about the two servicemen killed and another wounded late last week in Geresk, Afghanistan, when they were ambushed by Taliban forces while on a reconnaissance patrol.  As America focuses almost exclusively on the conflict in Iraq, we must not forget the bravery and sacrifice of men such as SGT Orlando Morales, SSG Jacob Frazier, and others in America's larger, global war on terror.  Of the four Californians I would like to recognize today, two of them, members of the 1st Tank Battalion of 29 Palms, were killed when their tank plunged off a bridge near Nasiriyah, during a heavy sandstorm. Both of them were still legal residents.  LCpl Patrick T. O'Day: One of these was 20-year-old Patrick O'Day, who was born in Scotland and came to the United States when he was just 3. He learned to read around the same time and quickly impressed his family and surprised his kindergarten teacher.  He was captain of the wrestling team at Santa Rosa Middle School and a 2001 graduate of Santa Rosa High School, where he met his future wife Shauna. They were married in October of last year, and they are expecting their first child in September.  His younger brother, Thomas, said that Patrick was ``always someone that could make anyone in the room laugh. When he came into a room, everyone knew he was there. He could change the atmosphere very quickly. . . . He was just so much fun to be around.''  PVT Francisco A. Martinez Flores: Francisco Martinez Flores was also in the tank that plunged in the Euphrates River. He was born in Guadalajara, Mexico, and settled in Duarte, CA, when only a little boy.  He attended Maxwell Elementary School and graduated from Duarte High School in 2000, where he was a popular and outgoing football player with a passion for fixing up old cars.  He had expressed a desire to be ``a great soldier'' ever since he was a young boy. ``[The Marines] returned to me a true man,'' said his mother, Martha, who had gone back to Mexico to bury her father when her son was deployed to the gulf. She never had the opportunity to say goodbye.  Francisco Martinez Flores was to become a U.S. citizen in 2 weeks. But the 21-year-old marine was killed before he could take an oath of allegiance to the country he died fighting for.  LCpl Jesus Suarez del Solar: Just 20, Cpl Suarez had already served in Afghanistan, and was ready to returning to combat, this time in Iraq. This past December, he had married his longtime girlfriend Sayne. They had a baby boy, Erik.  ``I'm very proud of Jesus,'' said his father, Fernando. ``I want Americans to know that immigrants that came to the United States, we did not come to take their jobs. We came here to give them our blood, so they can have freedom and they can have a world free of terrorism. That's why my son died.''  Known as something of a charmer and even a bit of a flirt, he graduated in 2001 from Valley High School, in Escondido, a town about 30 miles north of San Diego. His principal, Janice Boedeker, said that ``Jesus wanted to become a marine from the time I met him, as a junior in high school. He was just a wonderful kid with maturity beyond his years.''  ``He was so excited about being a part of the infantry and the Marine Corps,'' Boedeker said. ``I always ask kids about their goals what they want to do. There was never a question with him. I remember he wrote in big, capital letters: MARINES.''  One of his teachers, Tom Gabriella, remembered how Jesus ``felt he could build a solid life around the Marine Corps. . . .Once, he gave a presentation to a class. He always had a big smile on his face.''  GySgt Joseph Menusa: Born in the Philippines, Joseph Menusa came to the United States when he was 10 and grew up in San Jose. A veteran of the first gulf war, he was killed in battle on Thursday, March 27. He was a graduate of Silver Creek High, Class of '89.  He was working his way up the ranks and was in the process of gaining his U.S. citizenship when he received his deployment orders to the gulf.  On the eve of his deployment, Sgt Menusa told his wife Stacy why he had to go. ``He said he was in charge of these young kids and he was the only one who had ever seen combat. He needed to be their guide.''  Capt Tuan Pham, who was born in Vietnam and worked with Sgt Menusa as a Marine recruitment officer in San Francisco, had this to say about his friend: ``We are both naturalized Americans and believe in the ideals of what this country represents. He paid the ultimate price for something we all believe in--freedom.''  Of those Americans stationed in California, most were from the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force based at Camp Pendleton, in San Diego County. While from all across the country, these men were so much a part of the local community, where the mood is somber, yellow ribbons are everywhere, and the flags at half mast.  I would also like to commend the local newspaper, the San Diego Union Tribune, for doing an impressive job of providing much of the information on those stationed at Camp Pendleton.  2Lt Therrel S. Childers, Harrison County, MS: While most youngsters pick a new career more often than they outgrow their sneakers, Lt Therrel Childers, the son of a Navy Seabee, first decided he wanted to be a marine when only 5 years old.  He joined the Marines a month after he graduated from high school; they sent him to college and promoted him. 25 years after he first glimpsed his future, Second Lieutenant Childers was fatally injured on a battlefield in Iraq.  ``We're proud of him,'' his mother said from her Powell, WY, home. ``He died doing what he believed in.'' He approached his life with a unique intensity that made him successful both in his career and in the classroom.  His professors at The Citadel, in Charleston, SC, saw the dedicationthat made him a good marine. ``When he decided to study French, he wanted to speak French perfectly,'' said one of his professors, Guy Toubiana. ``It really bothered him if he was making a couple of mistakes.''  His intensity sometimes made him the butt of jokes, but somehow he remained a likable guy, perhaps because he maintained his sense of humor. And despite his military surroundings, he still had a sensitive side. ``He was very warm,'' Toubiana said.  The 30-year-old spent his limited free time climbing mountains, running road races, and mountain biking. Perhaps he would be most proud that marine friends remember him as someone they could count on.  John Bacon, who met Childers at The Citadel, said Childers would always show up to help lift a heavy sofa on moving day. ``He was a type of person that would never let you down,'' Bacon said. ``The world lost a great man.''  Marine Cpt Ryan Anthony Beaupre, St. Anne, IL: Cpt Ryan Beaupre, who was single, abandoned an accounting career to join the Marines in 1996. ``He always wanted to fly, but his parents wanted him to get a college degree first,'' said Bob Themer, a friend of the family's.  Beaupre, who was from St. Anne, IL, and graduated from Illinois Wesleyan University, and worked in accounting for a year. ``Then he came home and told them he could do more as a marine,'' Themer said.  Beaupre lived in an Encinitas apartment overlooking the sea, where he often surfed, said neighbor Ron Holdsworth. He remembers a comment the marine made after military helicopters flew by their building one day.  ``At the time, we were in Afghanistan fighting, and he said, `The thing about being a marine is you know when your brother marines are fighting, you can't sit still. You want to go help them.' ''  Navy Hospital Corpsman Michael Vann Johnson, Jr., Little Rock, AR: Navy corpsman Michael Vann Johnson, Jr., was killed Tuesday while tending to a marine wounded in battle in Iraq. He was hit in the head by shrapnel from a grenade and fatally injured, his sister, Janisa Hooks, told the Associated Press in Little Rock, AR, where Johnson was born and raised.  Only 25 years old, Johnson was a hospital corpsman who had been assigned to travel with Camp Pendleton-based marines in Iraq.  ``He provided medical care right up to the time he was killed,'' said Doug Sayers, spokesman for the San Diego Naval Medical Center, where Johnson had been stationed.  Johnson had worked at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot since June 2001, helping oversee the health care of thousands of recruits, Sayers said. ``A big hole has been ripped in the soul of the clinic down there,'' Sayers said.  Johnson's mother Jana Norfleet said she had recently received a letter from her son saying that he was going to be all right. She said he wrote that ``God had twisted a guardian angel around him.''  Marine Cpl Brian Matthew Kennedy, Houston, TX: ``He gave his life in an effort to contribute to the freedom of the Iraqi people,'' Mark Kennedy of Houston wrote in a statement about his 25-year-old son, Brian. ``We are so very proud of him and his service to his country.''  But sitting at home, staring at a photograph of his handsome, athletic son in his marine dress uniform, reminiscing about Brian's love of football and lacrosse, patriotism and pride seems overwhelmed by a father's pain. ``We just miss him terribly already,'' the father said. ``He was a wonderful man.''  Sgt Michael V. Lalush, 23, Troutville, VA: Sgt Michael Lalush--pronounced LAW'-lish--was always busy trying to fix things, said Linda McMillan, a family friend who knew the sergeant from birth. He always had his hands in equipment, tinkering with lawnmowers and cars. As a teenager, he dragged home a pink 1965 Volkswagen Beetle, rebuilt and repainted it, and in no time was driving it around the neighborhood.  Lalush moved to Virginia with his family in 1994 from Sunnyvale, CA, settling in a quiet house on a hilltop overlooking farmland about 20 miles north of Roanoke.  A tall, gangly boy who eventually sprouted several inches above his parents, Lalush was anything but the stereo typically domineering military man, McMillan said. He was quieter, more sensitive, she said. He loved his sister Danielle and depended on his family.  More than anything, Lalush wanted to be a pilot and he wanted to be a marine. After graduating from Lord Botetourt High School, Lalush left for boot camp at Parris Island in South Carolina. He was transferred to Camp Lejeune, NC, and then to Camp Pendleton.  SSgt Donald C. May, Jr. Richmond, VA: SSgt Donald May, Jr., followed both parents into the Marine Corps and, just like his dad, became a tank commander. He disappeared in Iraq nearly a week ago and his mother learned Monday he had been killed.  May and his crew were in the 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division, based at the Marine Corps Air-Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, CA.  He joined the Marine Corps the year he graduated from high school and spent 4 years in the military police, serving in the Middle East for the last few months of the first gulf war in 1991. He left for 2 years, serving in the Reserves, then ``got back in as a tank commander, just like his dad,'' his mother said.  May's wife Deborah is 7\1/2\ months pregnant with a boy, due May 16. She went into premature labor Friday after learning that her husband was missing, but doctors were able to halt the delivery.  Maj Kevin Nave, White Lake Township, MI: A veteran of the 1991 Persian Gulf war, Maj Kevin Nave is the first Michigan native reported killed in the war with Iraq. He was from White Lake Township, about 20 miles north of Detroit, where he used to fish in the river behind his house.  He and his wife Carrie lived at Camp Pendleton with their son Anthony, 6, and daughter, Maeve, who turned 5 Thursday.  Nave graduated in 1985 from Waterford Kettering High School where he was on the school's varsity football and wrestling teams.  He was a very positive type personality, a school leader and a good citizen,'' said Ronald Zeeman, dean of students and a math teacher during Nave's years there. ``The whole Waterford Kettering staff was proud of him. To have something like this happen, it really hits home.''  After high school, Nave went to the University of Michigan on a Reserve Officer Training Corps scholarship. He graduated in 1989 with a degree in political science and attended marine officer's school immediately after college, said T.J. McCullough, a high school classmate and ex-marine.  According to T.J. McCullough, a high school classmate and ex-marine, ``He was motivated, focused and driven, but one of the nicest, most easygoing guys you'd ever want to meet,'' said McCullough. ``I know he followed his dream. He was a career marine.''  Marine LCpl William W. White, NY: A shy and quiet 24-year-old with a sweet and charming smile, Marine LCpl William W. White had grand plans for his return from Iraq.  He had tested to become a New York City firefighter, a job that would take him home to his native Brooklyn. White and his wife Mychaele 23, wanted to begin a family when they moved back east.  Instead, the Camp Pendleton marine, whose father fought with the Army in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, was killed when his Humvee overturned into a canal and he drowned.  Along with his wife, White leaves behind two younger brothers and his parents in Brooklyn. According to his mother-in-law, Debra Gentry, ``He was one of the sweetest, kindest guys. He always put himself last.''  SSgt Kendall Damon Waters-Bey, Baltimore, MD: A specialist in helicopter maintenance, Sgt Kendall Damon Waters-Bey was assigned to the Marine Medium Helicopter Squadron-268, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing.  Waters-Bey was among four United States Marines and eight British soldiers killed when a CH-46 helicopter crashed Thursday in Kuwait, about 9 miles from the Iraqi border.  He grew up in the rowhouse working-class neighborhood of northeast Baltimore, graduating from Northern High School where he excelled in swimming and track. At home, his sisters recalled, he excelled in jokes and cooking. ``He was always making faces,making people laugh,'' said his sister Michelle.  The oldest of five children, 29-year-old Waters-Bey had been living in California with his wife of 11 months, Angela, who serves in the Navy. He also leaves behind a 10-year-old son from a previous marriage.  Maj Jay Thomas Aubin, Waterville, ME: An 18-year marine veteran, 36-year-old Maj Thomas Aubin was an instructor with Marine Aviation Weapons and Tactics Squadron 1 in Yuma, AZ, before deploying for war with the Camp Pendleton force.  Aubin's hometown was Waterville, ME, where he was the first of 30 grandchildren in a family that has been in that State for generations.  ``He was a very determined little boy,'' said his aunt, Kim Willette of Winslow, ME. ``He had big dreams. He always wanted to fly planes and knew he was going to, just like his dad--a private pilot. Jay would fall asleep in the back of the Cessna.''  ``There's no way to soften the blow, his aunt said. ``He prepared us for this all the time,'' she said. ``But that doesn't make it any easier.''  He is survived by his wife Rhonda and children Alicia, 10, and Nathan, 7.  SSgt James Cawley, Layton, UT: SSgt James Cawley, was a marine reservist and Salt Lake City police detective, was killed in a fire fight in Iraq Saturday.  ``He could have been anything but he chose to be a soldier and an officer because of his strong beliefs,'' his family wrote in a prepared statement distributed by the police department Sunday.  Cawley leaves behind a wife, Miyuki, an 8-year-old son, Cecil, and a 6-year-old daughter, Keiko. He served for 12 years in the Marines, traveling around the world. He met his wife Miyuki in Okinawa, Japan, while serving there.  He also served a proselytizing mission with the Mormon Church in Fukuoka, Japan. ``He knew that his life was not the end and that we will all be together again in a far greater place,'' the letter said.  Detective Mark Schuman, Cawley's partner on the Salt Lake City force for 18 months and one of his closest friends, had just received a letter from Cawley a few days ago. At the time of his writing, Cawley was in Kuwait, awaiting further instructions.  ``He was a loyal and trusting friend, and he was an outstanding officer,'' Schuman said. ``He was a very patriotic man, and he loved the Marine Corps, and he felt it was his duty to protect us and protect America.''  As our troops move rapidly towards Baghdad, I continue to hope for a quick resolution to this conflict. I hope that the repressive regime of Saddam Hussein will soon collapse and the Iraqi people will be liberated. And I hope all of this can be done with as few casualties as possible, Iraqi, American and allied, civilian and military.  To those that have already fallen, we must never forget their sacrifice. They have given their future for that of our Nation--and we as a nation owe them and the others that have fallen our eternal gratitude.                          ____________________
