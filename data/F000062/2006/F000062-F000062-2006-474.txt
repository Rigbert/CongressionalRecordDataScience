 President, I would like to offer a few words in observance of the passing of U.S. District Judge William Matthew Byrne, Jr., a great legal mind and ambassador of justice who nobly served our country for over 30 years on the Federal bench.  I extend my deepest sympathy to the family of Judge Byrne, his many friends and colleagues, and the members of the legal community everywhere who had come to know his talent and charm. A giant in his field, Judge Byrne tirelessly traveled the globe teaching and promoting the rule of law. His efforts touched countless individuals and left an immeasurable impact on legal systems on an international scale.  After honorably serving our Nation in the U.S. Air Force and amassing an unparalleled 96 percent conviction record as a U.S. attorney in Los Angeles, Judge Byrne was named head of the Commission on Campus Unrest by President Nixon. As head of the Commission, Judge Byrne sought to bridge the growing cultural divide that had developed as a result of the war in Vietnam.  The Commission's report revealed Judge Byrne's unassailable judgment and great courage. Bravely stepping into the middle of the fray, he found fault with students and police alike. Judge Byrne's work on the Commission played an important role in reuniting the country around our shared values. His contribution was recognized in 1971, when he was confirmed to a Federal judgeship at the age of 40, makinghim at that time the youngest man in America's history to rise to this prominent position.  Although he dealt with many high-profile cases, Judge Byrne was most remembered for his courageous handling of the trial of Daniel Ellsberg, the man charged with releasing classified documents in the infamous Pentagon Papers case. The Government, he ruled, did not have a case, and a mistrial was declared.  In a time of rampant government scandal and deep-seated corruption at the highest levels of power, Judge Byrne courageously stood up for his convictions, sending the powerful message that nobody was above the law.  ``The totality of the circumstances in this case,'' Judge Byrne ruled, ``offend a sense of justice.'' It is for this sense of justice that Judge Byrne will always be remembered.  Throughout his long and remarkable career, Judge Byrne distinguished himself as a man of sound jurisprudence, honor, and integrity. His lasting legacy of sensible legal adjudication serves as an inspiration to all Americans.  Once again, my heart goes out to Judge Byrne's family and all those who knew him.  He will truly be missed.                          ____________________
