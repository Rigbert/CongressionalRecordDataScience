 1619, the currency exchange rate oversight bill. I support this bill. Back in 2007, I helped draft some of the language that is contained in this current bill.  China is a big beneficiary of international trade, yet it fails to allow its currency to float freely. As a result, U.S. exporters get cheated. It is time we do something to send the message that enough is enough.  I am all for free trade, I want free trade. Free trade helps our farmers, manufacturers, and our Nation as a whole. There is talk that this bill will cause a trade war with China. I am not convinced that is the case. Plus, keep in mind, this bill is about more than China. This bill is a much needed overhaul of a law that dates back to 1988. This bill puts in meaningful consequences for countries that do not address their currency manipulation.  All of that being said, I have to say I do not support the way this bill is being brought to a vote. While I want a vote on this bill and I want to vote for this bill, my colleagues should have the right to offer and debate their respective amendments. The majority leader's use of cloture to prevent the meaningful debate on motions is unacceptable. It is more of the same partisan politics that the American people are tired of. And in this instance, when there is bipartisan support for the bill, the majority leader's heavyhanded approach just doesn't make sense.  That is why, even though I support the currency bill, I am voting against cloture. If cloture fails, I sincerely hope we can have a meaningful debate and still move toward passage of this important legislation.                             CLOTURE MOTION
