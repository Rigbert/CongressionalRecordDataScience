Nina McClelland, a resident of Toledo and a champion of ensuring safe water starting with her work at the Toledo water treatment plant and being the first woman in Ohio to earn a Class A operator license for wastewater treatment over 50 years ago.  On Thursday, September 19, 2019, The University of Toledo honors Dr. McClelland, former President and CEO of NSF (National Sanitation Foundation) International, Chair of the Board of Directors of the American Chemical Society and Dean Emeritus of The University of Toledo, by announcing the creation of the Dr. Nina McClelland Laboratory for Water Chemistry and Environmental Analysis.  The laboratory is an important initiative for The University of Toledo's efforts to be a leader in solving existing and emerging environmental problems in the region and for the world. To continue Dr. McClelland's legacy and life-long passion for ensuring safe water, this state-of-the-art analytical laboratory will focus on the development of innovative scientific methodology to address concerns related to our water resources, especially issues important for public health. Together with other scientists on campus the laboratory will complement their activities and strive to create a hub for new scientific discoveries and research breakthroughs to address the most pressing environmental issues. Another mission of the laboratory is to provide outstanding training for our students with state-of-the-art instrumentation and facilities to ensure they learn in the best environment possible. The goal is to provide a new generation of researchers to be the new leaders and stewards for our environment.  Dr. McClelland has been active in various governance roles in the American Chemical Society (ACS), the world's largest scientific organization, and has served The University of Toledo as Dean and Professor Emerita, College of Arts and Sciences, and Executive-In-Residence, College of Business and Innovation. Dr. McClelland has served as a Consultant and Principal with The Bartech Group, T.C. AirTech, LLC, and James Cavnar, Founder and President of Cross International of the International Clean Water Program.  Serving on several major committees throughout her career, Dr. McClelland has been a member of U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; National Science Foundation; National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council; Centers for Disease Control; State of Michigan, Governor's Council on Environmental Quality; and American National Standards Institute.  The work that Dr. McClelland has done in her groundbreaking career is inspirational, and her dedication to public health is laudable. We congratulate her on all her accomplishments and wish nothing but the best for the researchers that will work in the newly createdDr. Nina McClelland Laboratory for Water Chemistry and Environmental Analysis at The University of Toledo. Onward to Dr. McClelland, and her legacy to the future.                          ____________________
