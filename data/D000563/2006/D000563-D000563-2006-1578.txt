After years of being a lawyer, I thought to myself: I can do this. I will fill out my own income tax return.  I went back home Sunday afternoon and sat down to fill out what is a pretty simple income tax return for a Member of Congress. It took me 3 or 4 hours, and then I had to come back to it the next day, and I filed it. I then found out I had made several glaring errors. This was before TurboTax, H&R Block's Web site, and all the rest of these things. But I thought: Let me do it myself. I tell the Senator from Oregon that I have an abiding respect for what he just said after that humbling experience.  I would like to ask the Senator whether he thinks we would have more impetus for simplifying tax returns if Members of Congress had to file their own tax returns, prepare their own tax returns, and then submit to the American people the fruits of their labor as to whether they made mistakes?
