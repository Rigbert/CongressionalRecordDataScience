President, on the side supporting the pending motion, there is 15 minutes under the unanimous consent agreement and a similar amount of time on the other side. If all time is used, I would notify Members our rollcall vote will be about 11 o'clock.  I ask unanimous consent that on our side, supporting the motion, I be allowed 5 minutes, Senator Reed of Rhode Island 5 minutes, and Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota 5 minutes.
