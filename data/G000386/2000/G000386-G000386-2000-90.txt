 President, I rise today in support of H.R. 782, the Older Americans Act Amendments of 2000. I join my colleagues in commending Chairmen Jeffords and DeWine and other members of the committee for their hard work and endless energy in bringing this important measure to the floor.  In its 35th year, the Older Americans Act continues to meet its mission of helping seniors stay independent and part of their community. The wide array of services available under the act serve as the life-line to millions of seniors across the Nation.  Seniors in both rural and urban areas rely heavily on one or more of these services: nutrition services such as home-delivered meals; meals served in congregate settings; transportation services to medical appointments; legal assistance; protection from abuse through the ombudsman program; pension counseling services; in-home services; and volunteer and employment opportunities for older persons.  As chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, I am particularly pleased that this bill contains the National Family Caregiver Support Program. Over the past 3 years, Senator Breaux and I have convened a number of hearings to examine the important role that family caregivers play. More than 20 million Americans are caring for an aging or ailing family member. To put this number in perspective, there are fewer than 2 million seniors living in nursing homes. So simply by looking at the numbers, we can conclude that the bulk of caring for our Nation's elderly is carried out by family and friends in the form of informal caregiving.  The story of Barbara Boyd, a state legislator from Ohio who testified before the Special Committee on Aging last year, provides a good example of what a caregivers job entails. Ms. Boyd cared at home for her mother who had Alzheimer's disease and breast cancer. Her mother had $20,000 in savings and a monthly Social Security check. That went quickly. Her prescription drugs alone ran $400 a month. Antibiotics, ointments to prevent skin breakdown, incontinence supplies, and other expenses cost hundreds of dollars a month.  Ms. Boyd exhausted her own savings to care for her mother, and exhausted herself. She isn't complaining. Family caregivers don't complain.  The contribution of family caregivers is enormous. Economically, family caregiving is worth billions of dollars. Emotionally and physically, caregiving is often an overwhelming task. Caregivers know what it entails to juggle personal and professional demands with the responsibilities that accompany caregiving.  This is why the Family Caregiving Support Program, now a part of the Older Americans Act bill before us, is critically important to families caring for loved ones who are ill or who have disabilities. The program uses existing resources to meet a pressing need. In this case, the already successful network of aging centers will administer the program.  It will serve millions of caregivers throughout hundreds of communities nationwide by providing: respite care; information and assistance; caregiving counseling and training and supplemental services to caregivers and their families.  Our country is aging, and that demographic shift creates new needs, and this legislation helps us meet those needs. The Older Americans Act not only serves as a critical safety net, but it embraces important principles that we should uphold in policies that serve our nation's elderly.  The act calls attention to the need to prepare our nation's aging population for its own longevity by enhancing health promotion opportunities, improving flexibility for states and area agencies on aging, by modernizing programs and services, and in calling for a White House Conference on Aging in 2005.  Finally, the act provides authorization for the thirteen area agencies on aging in my home state of Iowa. In 1999, these funds enabled the agencies to serve nearly 293,000 elderly Iowans. The services the act funds are critical to older Americans in my state and throughout the country.   I ask unanimous consent that a copy of a letter I recently received from Representative Boyd be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Ohio House of Representatives,                                   Columbus, OH, October 16, 2000.     Senator Chuck Grassley,     Dirksen Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: We have in the state of Ohio term      limits, and I am at the end of my fourth term. I will      certainly miss the House, but I know my work is not done. I      will continue to advocate for the elderly, especially      Alzheimer's and caregivers. There is a rumor that I will be      in other areas of ``expertise'', which are Welfare Reform,      Human Services, and healthcare. It is my understanding that I      have a great advocacy being voiced in my interest in public      policy in the state of Ohio.       My passion will always revolve around the issue of      caregiving. I have found that I remain a voice on the issue      and a sounding board for those who are heartbroken.       October 21st will be two years since Mother passed, and      there is not a day that dawns that I do not think of her.      She, in her last years, taught me more than I ever learned in      college. Everyday I marvel at the fact that I did what I set      out to do during those five and a half years. Truly, my      heavenly father watches over me.       If there is ever an opportunity to serve on a national      level, on a board or committee on caregiving, please keep me      in mind. I will be sure to keep in touch with you.       Thank you again for giving me an opportunity to tell my      story as a caregiver.           Yours in Service,                                                     Barbara Boyd,                                             State Representative.
