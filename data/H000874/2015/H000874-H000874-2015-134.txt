 I note that the Export-Import Bank, which, of course, expires on June 30, is not among the scheduled pieces of legislation.  As the gentleman knows, Speaker Boehner has been quoted as saying that, if we don't pass the Export-Import Bank, that there are thousands of jobs on the line that would disappear pretty quickly if the Ex-Im Bank were to disappear. He then again said, as the Chamber closest to the people, ``The House works best when it is allowed to work its will.''  The majority leader knows that I am absolutely convinced that the Export-Import Bank is supported by a majority of Members of this House, but this House has not been allowed to work its will on the Export-Import Bank.  Predecessors of yours and a very dear friend of mine, Senator Blunt, said not too long ago that he believed that, if a bill were brought to the floor of the House, it would have the votes. More importantly, because he is now, of course, in the other body but is among the leadership in the other body, he said that the bill had the votes in the Senate. I believe he is right on both of those observations.  I understand the majority leader is not for the bill. It is my understanding that the Speaker is. I would hope that those of us who support it and, frankly, those who oppose it would have the opportunity, as the Speaker indicated, for the House to work its will.  Can the gentleman tell me whether there are any plans prior to June 30, when the Export-Import Bank authorization to give loans expires, are there any plans to bring that legislation before this House in a timely fashion so that the authorization would not expire?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The gentleman did say he knows my stance on this issue; and, no, there is no action scheduled before the House.
