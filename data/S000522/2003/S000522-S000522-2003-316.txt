Mr. Speaker, as a co-chair of the newly formed Refugee Caucus, I rise on behalf of the world's 15 million refugees on the eve of World Refugee Day, which occurred last Friday, June 20th.  We know that the plight of refugees throughout the world is precarious. They have fled war, persecution, natural disasters, and severe poverty in their home countries. The lucky few live in camps, where attempts are made to provide the basic necessities but disease and hopelessness run rampant.  Those not in the camps are left to fend for themselves, aliens in a foreign land where they often lack food and shelter. Refugees who try to find work are often exploited and many women and children refugees become victims of forced sex trafficking rings.  It is not only important to remember the plight of the refugees, but also to remember those who have reached out to help the refugees. We know that UNHCR, The Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, International Rescue Committee, Immigration Refugee Services of America, International Catholic Migration Agency, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, Episcopal Migration Ministries, Church World Service, and many others provide tremendous and compassionate support for refugees throughout the world.  We also know that numerous governments have been generous in accepting refugees into their borders, including many in Africa. I would like to take a moment to recognize one of these governments--The Republic of Zambia.  For the last three decades, Zambia has been one of the most generous hosts of refugees in the world. Zambia's history of refugee protection began with its independence in 1964, when it hosted refugees fleeing wars in Angola, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. By 1967, UNHCR was operational in Zambia and remains today, working in partnership to protect refugees. Through the years, Zambia has afforded refugees freedom of movement, access to educational and social services including medical treatment, and land for farming.  In recent years Zambia has generously hosted over 280,000 refugees. Last year, Zambia launched an innovative and collaborative response to under-developed in local communities greatly impacted by large-scale and long-term refugee populations. The United States contributed $1 million to the ``Zambian Initiative'' which has worked to integrate long-staying Angolan refugees in Zambia's West Province. By promoting longer-term development of the education, health, environment and agriculture sectors and by allowing refugees and local populations to have equal access to these programs, the Zambian Initiative has offered a model to all countries hosting refugees.  I commend the continuing efforts of the Zambian government in seeking progressive national policies that have helped integrate refugees into their nation. I hope that the generosity of Zambia towards refugees and asylum seekers can be fully recognized by both our government and governments throughout the world. I am confident that they will continue to remain a generous supporter of refugees and hope that other nations will follow their example.                          ____________________
