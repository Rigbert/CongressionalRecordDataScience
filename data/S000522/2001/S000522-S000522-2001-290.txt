Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I rise to engage in a colloquy with the distinguished chairman of the subcommittee. I want to commend the gentleman for the robust increases he has included in H.R. 2660 for veterans health care programs. I again want to reiterate to my colleagues that an increase of $1.2 billion for the VA's Medicare account will go a long way toward improving services for our veterans.  There is an area of particular interest to me I would like to discuss the with the distinguished chairman, and that is the success of Alzheimer's disease. I am proud to support a bill that will help to improve the treatment of veterans that suffer from this debilitating dementia.  As cochairman of the Congressional Alzheimer's Task Force, I am proud of the clinical research the VA has been conducting on Alzheimer's disease. As the chairman is aware, the VA has developed a very promising model to treat Alzheimer's patients at the Bedford, Massachusetts, VA facility. This model emphasizes a home-like setting, making patients feel comfortable, instead of subjecting them to painful and heroic medical interventions, and employs an interdisciplinary team of clinicians, dieticians and therapists. All reviews of the Bedford program have concluded that it provides better care than traditional long-term care approaches.  It is my hope that, with the additional resources contained in this bill, the VA will take concrete steps to examine successful Alzheimer's programs such as the Bedford VA model and look to expand this approach to other VA medical centers.  I will yield to the chairman on that issue.
