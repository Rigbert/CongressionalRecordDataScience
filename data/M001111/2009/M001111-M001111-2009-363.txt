 I appreciate the inclusion of these children and believe it is a step in the right direction. In particular, it covers those children and youth who: (1) have experienced a long-term period without living stably or independently in permanent housing; (2) have experienced persistent instability; and (3) who are likely to continue to do so because of disability or other barriers.  Since these concepts, such as the term ``long term period,'' are open to interpretation, is it the Senators' intent that HUD should consider the needs of children and the effects of instability on their developmental and academic progress when developing the regulations for this provision?
