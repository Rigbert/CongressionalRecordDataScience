Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to add to the comments of the gentleman from Hawaii.  I understand the concern of the gentleman from Colorado. In my opening statement I mentioned that I was very concerned. This is not a new issue. I was, first, not notified by the Navy nor the national security branch that, so when I did find out that this possibly occurred, I contacted not only the two senior Senators from Hawaii, I also contacted by senior Senator from Alaska.  I know I am not supposed to mention the other body. They said there was no problem. They had had the review and decided that these concerns were unwarranted. So I am still a little bit concerned that the Navy, after 15 months, now would editorialize and throw up this sort of smokescreen, if I may call it. Really what it means is they just do not want to get rid of anything they have, even though it is for a legitimate reason and a legitimate right, and to have justice served, this provision should be adopted.  It bothers me because, if this is a brandnew issue, it has been sprung on the House, it would be a different story. It was not sprung on the House. This has been around for a long, long time. We hear Friday now that these things may occur which, as was said before, there is no documentation, in fact backing up their premise.  So I am urging my Members to reject the argument from the Navy because I think they are flat wrong.
