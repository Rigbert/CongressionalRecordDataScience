 President, sections 114(d) and 116(c) of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, allow the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to revise the allocations, aggregates, and levels for a number of deficit-neutral reserve funds. These reserve funds were incorporated into the Bipartisan Budget Act by reference to S. Con. Res. 8, the Senate-passed budget resolution for 2014. Among these sections is a reference to section 319 of S. Con. Res. 8, which establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for terrorism risk insurance. The authority to adjust enforceable levels in the Senate for terrorism risk insurance is contingent on that legislation not increasing the deficit over either the period of the total of fiscal years 2014 through 2019 or the period of the total of fiscal years 2014 through 2024.  I find that S. 2244, the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2014, as reported on June 23, 2014, fulfills the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for terrorism risk insurance. Therefore, pursuant to sections 114(d) and 116(c) of H. J. Res. 59, I am adjusting the budgetary aggregates, as well as the allocation to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.  I ask unanimous consent that the following tables detailing the revisions be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    BUDGETARY AGGREGATES--PURSUANT TO SECTION 116 OF THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT OF 2013 AND SECTION 311 OF THE                                        CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET ACT OF 1974----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                     $s in millions                             2015             2015-19            2015-24----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Current Budgetary Aggregates:*    Spending:        Budget Authority...............................          2,940,093                n/a                n/a        Outlays........................................          3,004,206                n/a                n/a    Revenue............................................          2,533,388         13,882,333         31,202,135----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Adjustments Made Pursuant to Sections 114(d) and 116(c) of the Bipartisan Budget Act:**    Spending:        Budget Authority...............................                120                n/a                n/a        Outlays........................................                120                n/a                n/a    Revenue............................................                  0              1,770              4,000----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Revised Budgetary Aggregates:    Spending:        Budget Authority...............................          2,940,213                n/a                n/a        Outlays........................................          3,004,326                n/a                n/a    Revenue............................................          2,533,388         13,884,103         31,206,135----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------n/a = Not applicable.
