 President, one of the things that we sometimes confuse here--I know I do--is what is a political obligation and what is a constitutional obligation. I respectfully suggest that there is no constitutional requirement for the President of the United States--this President or any future President--to submit to the Senate for ratification, as if it were an amendment to a treaty, a Strategic Concept that is a political document. We use the words interchangeably on this floor. A new commitment or obligation, as I said, does not a treaty make.  Our Strategic Concept has always been a political, not legal document. Before last month's summit, NATO had revised the Strategic Concept five times in the past and never once had required the Senate's advice and consent. Doing so now would gravely undermine NATO's alliance and our efforts, as well as being a significant overreach in terms of our constitutional authority.  Let's not be fooled by the fact that the Roberts-Warner amendment only expresses the sense of the Senate. My concern is that unless we know exactly its dimension, it will be read in other NATO capitals as much more than it is. Just as my friend from Kansas quoted from the headlines and editorials of other newspapers--I might note that they were not governments, but other newspapers--I point out that people in other countries can misread actions taken by a country or group of countries. My concern is that in NATO capitals our actions will be misread.  The amendment sets out political criteria in point 1; and then in point 2 transforms them into legally binding ones that would require the Senate's advice and consent. This is a clever use of a non sequitur.  NATO's Strategic Concept has always given political guidance to the alliance's members. To that extent, this sixth revision of the Strategic Concept imposes commitments. But contrary to the assertions made by my distinguished friend from Kansas, it in no way changes the fundamental purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty of 1949.  We should oppose this amendment for four reasons, but if we are not going to oppose it now that it has been changed from its original amendment, we should at least recognize four important points:  One, to suggest that--if it were to be suggested--the Strategic Concept should be treated as an amendment to the treaty would set a terrible precedent and send a horrible signal at a time when we are striving to maintain alliance unity.  It would signal our NATO allies that the United States will not implement the new Strategic Concept without formal Senate advice and consent.  If we pass this amendment, couldn't the British, French, or Germans say tomorrow that they are going to disregard NATO's operating procedures? Couldn't they say tomorrow that they are no longer going to be bound by their commitment to beef up their military capacity as they committed to in 1991?  Given that NATO's decisions require unanimity, and that all 19 NATO member parliaments might then assert that they would have to ratify each and every future change in an operating procedure, we would be building in chaos to the alliance. How could we operate under those circumstances?  The second point I want to make is that we should remember that there have been many other changes in the Strategic Concept, as my friend from Michigan has pointed out, and they were never considered the equivalent of a new international treaty.  As I mentioned, before this year, NATO's original 1949 Strategic Concept had been revised five other times. Included among those were three fundamental transformations.  In 1957, the alliance adopted a new strategy, which would have shocked my friend from Kansas. It was called Massive Retaliation. Talk about a commitment--a commitment that was, I might add, totally consistent with the provisions of the treaty. It was an operating procedure.  In 1967, NATO abandoned the doctrine of Massive Retaliation in favor of the doctrine of Flexible Response. And then, in 1991, to continue to make the treaty relevant operationally, NATO recognized that after the end of the Soviet threat, NATO would nonetheless be confronted by a series of new threats to the alliance's security, such as ethnic rivalries and territorial disputes. It altered the Strategic Concept accordingly.  These were dramatic changes to alliance strategy, yet not once did the Senate, notwithstanding the fact it was not asleep, believe it had to provide its advice and consent.  There was a great deal of discussion about the 1991 Strategic Concept. I participated in it, others participated in it, and it revolved around what was the purpose of NATO and how we were operationally going to function now that the worry was no longer having 50 Soviet divisions coming through the Fulda Gap in Germany--a recognition that the territorial integrity of member states was still threatened, and instead of Soviet divisions rolling through the Fulda Gap with Warsaw Pact allies, there was a different threat, nonetheless real, nonetheless warranting this mutual commitment made to defend the territorial integrity of member states.  We discussed it. We debated it. There were those who thought it didn't go far enough. There are those who thought it went too far. But it wasn't that we were asleep and didn't pay attention. In fact, maybe it was because--and I am not being facetious--my friend was in the House where they don't deal with treaties, where it is not their constitutional obligation, and where foreign policy is not the thing they spend the bulk of their time on. But we weren't asleep over here. In fact, the current 1999 version of the Strategic Concept is much more similar to its 1991 predecessor than the 1991 document was to any of its predecessors.  My third point is simple. The revised Strategic Concept does not require advice and consent because it is not a treaty.  The rules under U.S. law on what constitutes a binding international agreement are set forth in the Restatement of Foreign Relations Law of the United States, as well as in the State Department regulations implementing the Case-Zablocki Act.  Under the Restatement, the key criterion as to whether an international agreement is legally binding is if the parties intend that it be legally binding and governed by international law. (Restatement, Sec. 301(1)).  Similarly, the State Department regulations state that the ``parties must intend their undertaking to be legally binding and not merely of political or personal effect.'' (22 Code of Federal Regulations Sec. 181.2(a)(1)).  Thus, many agreements that are not binding are essentially political statements. There is a moral and political obligation to comply in such cases, but not a legal one.  The most well-known example of such a political statement is the Helsinki Final Act of 1975, negotiated under the Ford administration and credited by most of us as the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union, the most significant political act that began to tear the Berlin Wall down. That was a political statement--commitments we made, but not of treaty scope requiring the advice and consent of the Senate.  The second key criterion is whether an international agreement contains language that clearly and specifically describe the obligations that are to be undertaken.  An international agreement must have objective criteria for determining the enforceability of the agreement. (22 C.F.R. Sec. 181.2(a)(3)).  Another criterion is the form of the agreement. That is, a formal document labeled ``Agreement'' with final clauses about the procedures for entry into force is probably a binding agreement. This is not a central requirement, but it does provide another indication that an agreement is binding. (22 C.F.R. Sec. 181.2(a)(5)).  A reading of the Strategic Concept clearly indicates that it is not a binding instrument of which treaties are made.  Rather, the Strategic Concept is merely a political statement with which my colleague from Kansas and others disagree. I respect that. I respect their disagreement with the political commitment that was made. But their political disagreement with a political commitment does not cause it to rise to the level of a binding treaty obligation requiring the advice and consent of the Senate, no matter how important each of them may be, no matter how relevant their objectives may be, no matter how enlightened their foreign policy may be.  Rather, the Strategic Concept is merely a political statement that outlines NATO's military and political strategy for carrying out the obligations of the North Atlantic Treaty.  Nowhere in the Strategic Concept can you find binding obligations upon the members of NATO.  For, if that were the case, all of our European allies as of a year ago, with the exception of Great Britain, would have been in violation of their treaty obligations--would have been in violation of their treaty obligations because of the commitments they made to build up--I will not bore the Senate with the details--their military capacity. Yet no one here on the floor has risen to suggest over the past several years, even though we have decried their failure to meet their obligations, that they have violated their treaty obligations.  Instead, the language of the Strategic Concept contains general statements about how NATO will carry out its mission.  The most important question, as I stated, is the intent of the parties. As the President wrote to the Chairman of the Committee on Armed Services on April 14, ``the Strategic Concept will not contain new commitments or obligations for the United States.''  Of course, the Strategic Concept creates a political commitment. And we take our political commitments seriously.  All member states, the United States included, assume political obligations when they take part in the alliance's integrated military planning.  That is what target force goals are all about. And, Mr. President, that lies at the heart of burden-sharing, whose importance several of us continually stress to our NATO allies.  The 1999 Strategic Concept creates a planning framework for NATO to act collectively to meet new threats if they arise.  So I would summarize the key point in this way: the Strategic Concept imposes political obligations to create military capabilities, but it does not impose legal obligations to use those capabilities.  My fourth point is that I understand the concern that NATO's core mission--alliance defense--not be altered. It has not been.  Our negotiators at last month's NATO summit did exactly what the vast majority of Senators wanted.  They consciously incorporated the Senate's concerns that NATO remain a defensive alliance when they negotiated the revised Strategic Concept.  The revised Strategic Concept duplicates much of the language contained in the Kyl amendment to the Resolution of Ratification on NATO Enlargement.  You all remember the Kyl amendment. We were not asleep at the switch. We were not failing to pay attention. We debated at length--my friend from Virginia, and I, and others--NATO enlargement. It is one of the few areas on which we have disagreed.  We debated at length the Kyl amendment. Let me remind my colleagues that the amendment was adopted by the Senate in April of 1998 by a 90-9 vote.  Rather than reviewing the specifics of the document, because time does not permit, nor do I think memories have to be refreshed that clearly, because everyone remembers, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to enter into the Record a document provided by the Clinton administration that reviews paragraph by paragraph the similarities between the Kyl amendment and the 1999 Strategic Concept.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:          The Kyl Amendment and the Strategic Concept of NATO(Document drafted for Assistant Secretary of the State Marc Grossman on  April 29, 1999 and handed out by Secretary Grossman to Members of the                          Senate on May 5, 1999)       Assistant Secretary for European Affairs Marc Grossman in      SFRC testimony on April 21: ``During the NATO enlargement      debate some 90 Senators led by Senator Kyl passed an      amendment laying out clear criteria for NATO's updated      Strategic Concept. We heard your message and made the      criteria established by Senator Kyl our own.''       Language from the Kyl Amendment: ``The Senate understands      that the policy of the United States is that the core      concepts contained in the 1991 Strategic Concept of NATO,      which adapted NATO's strategy to the post-Cold War      environment, remain valid today, and that the upcoming      revision of that document will reflect the following      principles:''               I.
