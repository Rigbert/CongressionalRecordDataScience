Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Barbara Carmichael who passed away on October 17, 2012. Barbara was a pillar of the community in Norco, California and she will be deeply missed.  Barbara Carmichael moved to Norco in 1980 and served three terms on the Norco City Council starting in November 1990. She was mayor in 1992 and 1998, and left the council in 2003. In order to be closer to family, she moved to the small town of Manton in Northern California in 2005. During her time there, Barbara became active in local organizations and sat on the Manton Joint Unified School District Board of Trustees last year.  Barbara also was a 4-H leader for 22 years, honorary Future Farmers of America chapter farmer, a Norco Chamber of Commerce Fair Committee member for 10 years, Corona Regional Hospital Foundation Board member, a Riverside City College advisory board member, and was active in many other community groups. According to Norco Mayor Kevin Bash, Barbara was instrumental in securing national historical status for the former Norconian hotel and was involved in the initial planning stages of the Silverlakes equestrian and sports park. The way in which Barbara lived her life should serve as reminder to others that the power of an individual with drive, perseverance and a stellar work ethic can do great things.  Barbara is survived by daughters Bree Zimmerman and Brittney Mailhes, and five grandchildren.  On Sunday, November 18, 2012, a memorial service celebrating Barbara's extraordinary life will be held. Barbara will always be remembered for her contributions to the community, work ethic, generosity, and love of family. Her dedication to her work, family and community are a testament to a life lived well and a legacy that will continue. I extend my condolences to Barbara's family and friends; although Barbara may be gone, the light and goodness she brought to the world remains and will never be forgotten.                          ____________________
