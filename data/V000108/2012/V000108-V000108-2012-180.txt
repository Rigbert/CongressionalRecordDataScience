Speaker, it is with great pleasure and sincere respect that I congratulate my good friend Mr. Loreto ``Baby Lou'' Gonzalez on his retirement from ArcelorMittal, formerly the Inland Steel Company. Mr. Gonzalez, a member of United Steelworkers Local 1010 for many years, has dedicated his life to the interests of his fellow tradesmen and the entire community in Northwest Indiana. For his lifetime of service, Baby Lou was honored at a retirement celebration at Club Ki-Yowga in East Chicago, Indiana, on January 7, 2012.  Baby Lou is the youngest of seven children born to Loreto and Carlota Gonzalez. Following his graduation in 1965 from East Chicago Washington High School, Baby Lou began working at Inland Steel in the slab yard. After years of service, he eventually moved to the 80'' hot strip where he became a crane operator. Mr. Gonzalez has been one of the most active members of Steelworkers Local 1010, where he was a grievance steward for 30 years.  Baby Lou's dedication to his community has always been a focal point of his life's work. He has helped Local 1010 annually with its food and coat drive to assist families in need. Recognizing the importance of civic involvement, he has also assisted in voter registration and community outreach programs to help improve the lives of all residents of Northwest Indiana. Baby Lou Gonzalez has served as a board member for the Catherine House and the Northwest Indiana Catholic Youth Organization. Additionally, he has spent countless hours coaching and developing baseball players in the East Chicago Little League and Senior League, worked tirelessly as a precinct committeeman, and is currently a member of the Human Rights Committee for East Chicago.  While my friend has been a dedicated worker for the last 47 years, and a steadfast contributor to his community, he has been an even more dedicated husband to Irene, father to Louie, Irene, and Kurt, and grandfather to three wonderful grandchildren.  Mr. Speaker, Loreto Gonzalez has given his time and efforts selflessly to the steelworkers with whom he has worked and to the people of Northwest Indiana for his entire life. He has been a true role model to his peers and a true friend to Northwest Indiana. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Baby Lou for his outstanding contributions to Northwest Indiana and in wishing him well upon his retirement.                          ____________________
