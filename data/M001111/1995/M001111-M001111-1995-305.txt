 I was      informed today that for some reason you are trying to erase      WIC from Seattle. Obviously, you do not know the importance      of WIC to thousands of pregnant women and their children.      Women must eat, receive proper medical care, good social      care, and correct knowledge and advice to bring healthy      babies (like you once were yourself) into this world. Mothers      will do almost anything to protect and provide for their      babies. Including theft and illegal ways of making money.  She goes on to say that:       Nobody wants to rely on anyone else, but in these days and      ages, life is so vastly unfair, that sometimes your low days      outnumber your high days. So until then, when everyone in      this world is totally self-sufficient, programs like WIC are      needed and worth every penny the government puts towards it.  Another letter writer talks about how important WIC has been to her children and ends by saying that:       Having WIC has meant my children would always have formula      or milk. They probably wouldn't have had milk everyday if it      weren't for WIC. I am a working mom and make just a little      too much to stay on food stamps so WIC has bridged a big gap      in our food budget. Please don't take it away from the      children. They need it.  Another letter:       We are a struggling family of 7 with a small business. We      hope to not need help soon but there are a lot of people      still out there who wouldn't survive without this program.       I think you will find that these are caring, responsible,      hard-working individuals who have benefited tremendously from      this program. It has been the safety net they need.  Finally, I want to share a few quotes from some letters children wrote:       ``If we don't get our lunch we would starve. Don't do this      to us. You are breaking our hearts.''       [[Page S4562]] ``Instead of taking something that we do not      need you are taking something that we do need. I am one of      those children that needs those programs.''       ``We need school lunches because we do not have lunch at      home. I do not like you for taking this away.''  I could go on and on but will not as time will not allow it.  I will, however, submit these for the record so that others can read them. I wanted to make the point that these are caring, responsible, hard-working individuals who have benefited tremendously from these programs.  These are children who know the only full meal they or many of their friends get is at school. It has been the safety net they need. These letters make that point so much better than I can.  In closing, I want to say that I do not argue that our welfare system is in need of some change. What I do not like is the assumption that every person utilizing these programs is out to take the Government and the taxpayers.  Like so many other issues, the House has gone too far on child nutrition.  Welfare reform merits in-depth, serious consideration and I am anxious to begin that process. I think a little common sense will go a long way on this issue.  However, in the case of child nutrition programs, I am appalled that such little time or consideration was taken before this bill was reported out of committee. We cannot afford to follow the House lead and expect responsible, effective legislation to result.  This legislation affects a group of Americans who are completely unable to come to Congress and speak out. I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose the wholesale slashing of child nutrition when the issue comes to the Senate.  I yield the floor.                            ____________________
