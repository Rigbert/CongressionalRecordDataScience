President, I am pleased that the Senate has passed the United States Patent and Trademark Office Reauthorization Act, Fiscal Year 1999, H.R. 3723. This bill, which passed the House of Representatives on May 12, 1998, is an important measure that would benefit all American inventors and would, for the first time in the history of the U.S. patent system, reduce patent fees.  The United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) is totally funded by user fees. Prior to 1990, the PTO was funded through a combination of user fees and taxpayer revenue. However, in a deficit reduction exercise in 1990, taxpayer support for the operations of the PTO was eliminated and user fees were substantially increased by the imposition of a surcharge on patent fees. The temptation to use the surcharge has proven to be increasingly irresistible to Congress and the Administration, to the detriment of sound functioning of our nation's patent system. Through Fiscal Year 1998, a total of $235 million has been diverted from the PTO to other unrelated agencies and programs.  At the urging of the inventor community, Congress allowed the surcharge to sunset at the end of Fiscal Year 1998. This means, however, that Congress must take affirmative action to adjust patent fees or the PTO will suffer a drastic reduction in revenue for the current fiscal year which will leave it unable to hire the patent examiners needed to reduce the time required to get a patent to eighteen months. Prompt processing of patent applications is particularly important for those inventors who need their patents to raise risk capital.  The Administration forwarded a draft bill to the Congress which would have continued patent fees at the current levels. However, in an oversight hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, Commissioner Lehman stated that the PTO would be unable to use all the revenues that would be generated if patent fees were to be continued at their current level in fiscal year 1999. Commissioner Lehman stated that keeping fees at their current level would generate $50 million in excess fee revenue which the Administration planned to divert to other government programs. The response by the House of Representatives was to craft a bill, H.R. 3723, that would adjust patent fees to provide all of the money which the PTO indicated that it could use in fiscal year 1999, but which would not generate an unneeded $50 million simply to support other government programs.  In the absence of any action on H.R. 3723, Congress had to include specific language in the continuing resolution signed by the President on September 25, 1998 addressing the level of patent fees that the PTO could charge. Section 117 of Public Law 105-240 provides that the PTO can continue to charge patent fees at the same level that existed on September 30, 1998 through October 9, 1998. As I previously noted, patent fees at this level are higher than they need to be to fully fund the PTO in fiscal year 1999. In a fiscal year when there are debates over how to use the billions of dollars of budget surplus, it is inappropriate for Congress to require the PTO to charge inventors more than the cost of rendering the services which they receive. By enacting H.R. 3723 we serve American inventors and provide them with the first real patent fee reduction in the history of the nation. This bill is good for American inventors and good for the United States.                          ____________________
