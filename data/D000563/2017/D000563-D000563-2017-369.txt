President, House Republicans have revived their efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.  As a reminder, the original effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act--characterized by some as the TrumpCare bill--was so unpopular that it had to be withdrawn from the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives. That is because, after the Congressional Budget Office took a look, it would have taken away health insurance from 24 million Americans.  Think about that for a moment. The Republican answer to ObamaCare--the Affordable Care Act--was to remove health insurance protection and coverage from 24 million Americans. It would have devastated the Medicaid Program. The Medicaid Program, of course, is one that is easily characterized as a health insurance program for those who are in low-income categories, but that statement doesn't tell the real story.  For example, in my State, half of the children who are born in Illinois are covered by Medicaid. Their mothers and the kids are covered by Medicaid. So when it comes to new babies, particularly in low-income families, Medicaid provides the prenatal care, delivery, and care after the child is born, but the most expensive part of the Medicaid Program is the help it gives to senior citizens--mothers and grandmothers who are in nursing homes who have only a little bit of savings, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid cover their medical expenses. The Republican plan to repeal the Affordable Care Act would have decimated the Medicaid Program across the United States. It would have increased costs for the average person for health insurance by $3,000, and particularly for people in upper ages--I guess I fit in that category--these folks would have seen a change in the calculation of premiums.  The Affordable Care Act protects premiums so they cannot be more than three times the lowest premium for any individual. The Republican approach said: Let's make that five times. If it goes up to five times, it can mean almost doubling the premiums paid by many senior citizens--those approaching, I should say, being senior citizens, from 50 to age 65.  It also would have cut off funding for women's health centers, all while providing a massive tax cut for upper income, wealthy people and big businesses, including tax cuts for drug companies. What a deal--to eliminate health insurance for 24 million Americans, to devastate the Medicaid Program, to increase the cost of health insurance for the average individual, to cut off funding for women's health centers in order to give a tax cut to wealthy people and drug companies.  The new bill does all those things as well--and then something I didn't think was possible. The new version of the Affordable Care Act repeal Republicans are now considering in the House allows insurance companies to impose--get this--an age tax and charge seniors significantly higher premiums than younger people. It says that insurance plans do not have to cover hospital visits, prescription drugs, maternity care, substance abuse treatment, or mental health services.  The Affordable Care Act defined these as essential services so, if you are buying health insurance, you know you are buying that kind of protection. Well, Republicans have said: That is too much insurance for people. We ought to let them buy stripped-down versions of health insurance that may be cheaper. The obvious question, What happens to those people when they need coverage for substance abuse treatment? What if that son or daughter in high school begins an addiction to opioids, leading to heroin, and now your health insurance plan saved you money by not covering it or didn't cover mental health counseling?  It guts protections for people with preexisting conditions. Is there a person alive who doesn't know someone or have someone in their family with a preexisting condition? That used to be grounds for denying insurance coverage or charging outrageous premiums. We did away with it with the Affordable Care Act.  It is back, my friends, with the new Republican approach to the repeal of affordable care. It allows insurance companies to once again charge unaffordable premiums if someone in your family has a history of asthma, cancer, high blood pressure, or diabetes.  Republicans made these changes to win the votes of the most extreme conservative Members of the U.S. House, the so-called Freedom Caucus. What they are fighting for is for freedom from individuals getting protection when it comes to healthcare. These changes may appeal to a handful of extreme people who conveniently see their health insurance policies--their personal policies--protected under their bill, but these sorts of approaches don't appeal to anyone in the medical community.  Who opposes the new Republican repeal of the Affordable Care Act? The American Medical Association--that would be the doctors--the American Heart Association, the American Nurses Association, the American Association of Retired Persons, as well as every major medical and patient group out there. Every one of them opposes the changes proposed by the Republicans in the House to our healthcare system.  Of course, we have a bottom line that we measure proposals against. We go to the Congressional Budget Office, and we say to them: What impact will this have?  No one has sent this bill to the Congressional Budget Office, and no report has been given. So we don't know the impact on premiums of this new version. What is going to happen to seniors, to middle-income families?  Ramming through a bad bill that will harm Americans just because the President wants to have something to say on the 100th day of his Presidency is a bad idea. It is time to stop thismadness. It is time for Democrats and Republicans to sit down and talk seriously about improving our current system.  The Presiding Officer is from the State of Louisiana and is a medical doctor. He has joined on the Republican side with Senator Collins of Maine to open this conversation. Thank you. We should have this bipartisan conversation--not about repeal but repair, what we can do to make this better and fairer and more affordable while preserving quality healthcare for Americans. Thank you for your leadership in this. We have talked about it, and I want to continue the conversation.  This notion coming over from the House is unacceptable. I hope that many people will tell the President and tell those who support it that this is no way to celebrate 100 days--by taking health insurance away from 24 million people.                  For-Profit Colleges and Universities  Mr. President, during the Senate's consideration of Betsy DeVos to be Secretary of Education, I asked a basic question: As Secretary of Education, would she side with corporate and other for-profit interests or would she be on the side of the students and their families?  I was concerned that the record of Secretary DeVos indicated that she was on the side of corporate interests, looking for opportunities to profit off of students and often exploiting them in the process.  Months into the job, now that she was approved by a historic tiebreaking vote by the Vice President, we are beginning to see which side the Secretary is on. A recent Chicago Tribune article entitled ``Targeted by Obama, DeVry and other for-profit colleges rebounding under Trump'' put it this way:       Less than 100 days into Trump's presidency, the Department      of Education under Secretary Betsy DeVos has delayed      implementation of gainful employment rules . . . withdrawn      key federal student loan servicing reforms . . . and signaled      a less onerous regulatory environment for the essentially      taxpayer-financed career education [or for-profit] sector.  A group of State attorneys general, including Lisa Madigan of Illinois, warned of a return to ``open season'' on students in a letter to Secretary DeVos if she rolled back all of these protections.  I ask unanimous consent that the full text of that letter from the State attorneys general be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               Office of the Attorney General,                                                February 22, 2017.     Re How For-profit Schools Have Harmed Student Borrowers: the          Need for the Gainful Employment Rule, Vigorous Federal          Oversight of Accreditors, and the Borrower Defense to          Repayment Rule     Hon. Elisabeth DeVos,     Secretary, U.S. Department of Education,     Washington, DC.     Speaker Paul Ryan,     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Senate Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,     House Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington,          DC.     Hon. Charles E. Schumer,     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary DeVos, Speaker Ryan, Senator McConnell,      Congresswoman Pelosi, Senator Schumer: We, the undersigned      Attorneys General of Illinois, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii,      Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota,      New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania,      Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of      Columbia, as well as the Executive Director of the Office of      Consumer Protection of Hawaii, write to express our support      for recent federal protections for students and taxpayers in      higher education. We are deeply concerned that rollbacks of      these protections would again signal ``open season'' on      students for the worst actors among for-profit post-secondary      schools. As the chief consumer law enforcement agencies in      our states, our offices handle thousands of complaints      concerning higher education every year. We also enforce laws      to protect consumers from unfair and deceptive practices      perpetrated by higher education providers.  I. Background: The Need for Rules to Protect Students and Taxpayers   from Unfair and Deceptive Practices by For-Profit Higher Education                                Providers       Over the last ten years, student loan debt has soared from      $450 billion to nearly $1.4 trillion. A major driver of this      increase has been for-profit colleges. Of the top 25 schools      where students hold the most student loan debt, over half      were for-profit schools in 2014. This is up from only one      for-profit institution in the top 25 in 2000.       In addition to driving the increase in student loan      borrowing, for-profit institutions also have significantly      more loan defaults than other types of institutions. Since      2013, for-profit institutions accounted for 35% of all      federal student loan defaults, but enrolled just 27% of all      borrowers. Many for-profit schools are almost entirely      dependent on federal grants and loans. In December 2016, the      U.S. Department of Education (``ED'') found that nearly 200      for-profit schools derive more than 90% of their income from      federal sources. The only reason that many of these      institutions are in compliance with the federal 90/10 Rule is      that certain categories of federal money, including GI Bill      money, are excluded from the rule and thus count toward the      10% that is supposed to be non-federal money.       Over the past fifteen years, millions of students have been      defrauded by unscrupulous for-profit post-secondary schools.      With accreditors asleep at the wheel, State Attorneys General      Offices have stepped in to stop some of the worst abuses. The      list of State Attorney General investigations and enforcement      actions against for-profit colleges is long, including      actions against: American Career Institute; Ashford      University/Bridgepoint Education, Inc.; Corinthian Colleges,      Inc.; Career Education Corporation; Education Management      Corporation; Daymar College; DeVry University; ITT Tech;      National College of Kentucky; and Westwood Colleges, among      others. These schools, and others like them, engaged in a      variety of deceptive and abusive practices. Some promised      prospective students jobs, careers, and further opportunities      in education that the schools could not provide. Many schools      inflated job placement numbers and/or promised career      services resources that did not exist. Many nationally-     accredited schools promised that their credits would      transfer, even though credits from nationally-accredited      schools often do not transfer to more rigorous regionally-     accredited schools. Many students were placed in loans that      the schools knew from experience their graduates could not      pay back. The schools were overseen by accreditors who failed      to take action to protect students or the taxpayers who      funded their federal student loans, despite ample evidence of      these and other problems. In short, the entire for-profit      education system was failing students and taxpayers. As      investigations and prosecutions initiated by our offices shed      light on these problems, ED began to take steps to remedy      these harms, issuing new regulations and reformulating      policies to help protect students and taxpayers.       Three of these recent steps--the Gainful Employment Rule,      the policy of vigorous federal oversight of accreditors, and      the Borrower Defense to Repayment Rule--are essential to      protect both consumers and taxpayers from fraudulent actors      in the for-profit education sector. The Gainful Employment      Rule is a measure of graduates' debt-to-income and is      designed to ensure that programs produce graduates that are      able to pay back their student loans. Prospectively, the      federal government recognizes accreditors who have standards      sufficient to show that the schools they accredit provide a      quality education and should have access to federal student      loans and grants. Finally, where other protections fail and      students are defrauded by bad actors, the Borrower Defense to      Repayment Rule provides a formal process for students to      assert a defense to repayment of their federal student loans. II. Corinthian Colleges: An Example of the Harm Faced by Students and                                Taxpayers       The egregious conduct of Corinthian Colleges illustrates      how each of these three policies is necessary to avoid harm      to both students and taxpayers. In March 2016, after an      extensive review of published job placement rates at      Corinthian campuses nationwide, the Department of Education      found that the job placement rates were fraudulent for      hundreds of cohorts from 2010-2014. Corinthian was telling      the world that far more of its students obtained jobs than      actually did, inducing students to enroll. Many of these      students were left without jobs in their field of study.      Without these jobs, many are saddled with debt they cannot      repay, defaulting on loans funded with taxpayer dollars.       Had the gainful employment regulations been in place,      Corinthian's programs that weren't producing jobs for      students would have been shut down because the median debt-     to-income ratio would have shown that students were not      making enough money to pay down their loans. Had Corinthian's      accreditors reviewed the school's self-reported job placement      data on a regular basis, the fraud would have been discovered      and stopped much earlier, saving students and taxpayers      billions of dollars.       The absence of policies in place to protect prospective      students from Corinthian's fraudulent practices also      demonstrates the     need for an effective process for students to assert a      defense to loan repayment. This defense was established in      the 1990s when Congress passed legislation allowing students      to assert claims against their schools as a defense to      repayment of their federal student loans. There was little      detail, however, on the process for asserting such claims.      The regulations set to take effect on July 1, 2017 give      borrower defense to repayment set processes so that students,      schools, and taxpayers have an orderly process, and a degree      of certainty, moving forward.       Without the Gainful Employment Rule, meaningful oversight      of accreditors, and an orderly borrower defense process, we      face the prospect of for-profit schools continuing to line      their pockets with taxpayer dollars while students and      taxpayers experience another crushing wave of defaulted      student loan debt.                    III. The Gainful Employment Rule       ED's gainful employment regulations are designed to further      a simple idea--that students who attend career training      programs should be able to repay their federal student loans      once they graduate. The Rule allows prospective students to      compare debt-to-income ratios across schools. By doing this,      the Rule creates an incentive for schools to make good on      their promises to students, and protects students from      programs that will leave them saddled with debt and without      job prospects in the careers for which they trained.       The Rule generally applies to vocational programs at for-     profit institutions and to non-degree programs at community      colleges. If graduates' annual loan payments exceed 30% of      discretionary income and 12% of total earnings in two out of      three consecutive years, the program loses access to Title IV      federal student loans and grants. A program can also lose      access if graduates' annual loan payments exceed 20% of      discretionary income and 8% of total earnings for four      consecutive years.       Data released on January 9, 2017 indicate that over 800      programs fail the Department's Gainful Employment metrics.      For-profit institutions are responsible for 98% of the      failing programs. But these 800 programs are only a portion      of the for-profit school programs that have failed their      students. With the Gainful Employment Rule pending, for-     profit institutions have already eliminated hundreds of      programs where students did not make enough money to cover      their debt obligations, sometimes closing entire institutions      that would have failed to provide students with gainful      employment under the regulations.       It is essential that the Gainful Employment Rule be kept in      place. Removing the Rule would open students and taxpayers up      to the worst excesses of the for-profit higher education      sector. It would greatly increase the regulatory and      enforcement burden on states and accreditors by removing a      central protection from the federal leg of the triad that      oversees higher education in the United States.              IV. Vigorous Oversight of Accreditors by ED       The federal government and states need strong partners with      specialized knowledge of higher education to provide      prospective quality assurance of schools in order to protect      students and taxpayers. Accreditors are the organizations      tasked with this role. Our experience, however, has shown      that without substantive oversight by the federal government,      some accreditors are negligent in their role.       The primary example of this dereliction of duty to students      and taxpayers is the Accrediting Council for Independent      Colleges and Schools (ACICS). As noted in our April 8, 2016      comment to the National Advisory Committee on Institutional      Quality and Integrity (NACIQI) opposing ACICS's application      for renewal of recognition, a recent study found that only      35% of students enrolled in ACICS accredited programs      graduate, the lowest rate for any accreditor.       NACIQI, a bipartisan panel, voted to revoke ACICS's      recognition in June 2016. The Senior Department Official at      ED agreed with NACIQI and revoked ACICS's recognition as an      accreditor in September, 2016. ACICS appealed the decision to      the Secretary of Education, and in December 2016, the      Secretary denied ACICS's appeal.       An accreditor's failure to verify program quality at its      accredited institutions jeopardizes the effectiveness of      state enforcement efforts and regulations, exposing each      state's students to subpar educational programs that provide      little value, but for which each student may borrow tens of      thousands of dollars in student loans, that are nearly      impossible to discharge in bankruptcy.       A prime example of the harm that stems from lax      accreditation was brought to light by state action against      Westwood College. The Illinois Attorney General's Office sued      Westwood College for systematically misrepresenting the      ability of its criminal justice graduates to pursue careers      in law enforcement. Thousands of Westwood students in      Illinois borrowed up to $75,000 each for careers they were      unable to pursue because many police departments in Illinois,      including the Chicago Police Department and the Illinois      State Police, did not accept credits from nationally-     accredited schools. Graduates of Westwood's criminal justice      program have a median salary below the median salary of a 25-     year old with a high school diploma, in part because they      were locked out of the career they had been promised. This      combination of high debt and limited job prospects is a      crushing blow not only to students, but to taxpayers who bear      the burden of defaults on these loans. Despite the Illinois      Attorney General's January 2012 suit against Westwood, ACICS      accredited Westwood up to the day it closed its doors in      March 2016.       Similarly, on September 8, 2016, a Hennepin County Court      found that the Minnesota School of Business and Globe      University systematically misrepresented their criminal-     justice program as allowing students to pursue careers as      Minnesota police officers or probation or parole officers.      The Minnesota School of Business and Globe University were      accredited by ACICS throughout the time period of the fraud      determined by the Court, and their Chief Operating Officer      during that time was in fact the Chair of ACICS's board of      directors. Terminating ACICS's recognition is a responsible      action that will protect students and taxpayers for years to      come.               V. The Borrower Defense to Repayment Rule       In order to fairly and efficiently redress the harms      suffered by for-profit college students, the borrower defense      to repayment rule promulgated by ED must be allowed to take      effect on July 1, 2017. As we noted in our August 1, 2016      comment to the proposed rule, students need a fair and      transparent process to apply for borrower defense to      repayment, and that process is missing from the existing      regulation. The regulation finalized by ED also contains      significant protections for taxpayers, including the      requirement that schools cannot use arbitration agreements to      bar students from bringing borrower defense claims directly      against the school in court.       It is important to note that these regulations do not      create a new defense to repayment. Congress established the      borrower defense to repayment in the 1990s. Furthermore, over      the last two years, ED has created substantial documentation      of what constitutes a valid borrower defense claim under the      existing regulation. Not only will the defense continue to be      available, but it is likely that claims will continue to be      asserted, particularly if regulations surrounding for-profit      institutions, such as gainful employment, are loosened,      allowing the bad practices of the past to return. Because the      defense will continue to exist, a formal, transparent process      to assert the defense, as reflected in the new repayment      rule, is essential.       A basic sense of justice requires that the borrower defense      to repayment rules be allowed to take effect. Millions of      students paid tens of thousands of dollars each in federal      student loan money to for-profit schools and received      worthless degrees in return. Federal student loan debt is      non-dischargeable in bankruptcy. These students cannot be      left without a clear recourse. The new borrower defense to      repayment regulations provide that recourse and should be      allowed to take effect.       Our extensive experience in the higher education field, and      our participation in the process of developing these recent      policies and regulations, gives us unique insight into the      abusive and deceptive practices of for-profit schools over      the last ten years. We cannot overemphasize the harm to      students and taxpayers that a rollback of federal protections      would cause. Our offices hear from former for-profit students      on a daily basis; sadly, many are hopeless. They have little      hope of paying off their student loans without the career      prospects promised by their schools. They have little hope of      continuing their educations without the ability to transfer      their credits from the many nationally-accredited for-profits      to more rigorous regionally-accredited schools. Allowing for-     profit schools unfettered access to federal student loan      money without reasonable oversight and accountability is a      mistake that American students and taxpayers should not be      made to pay for again.
