I ask the Chair to address the Senator from Utah as to how it is any different to have Enrique Moreno, with a well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association, nominated to the Federal judiciary, refused a hearing before then-Chairman Orrin Hatch, because two Republican Senators from Texas refused to approve him, thus, frankly, giving him less consideration than Miguel Estrada who is before us today.
