President, today is the first day since Hawaii became a State that it is not represented by Dan Inouye, either as a House Member or as Senator.  As I look at my dear friend's desk with the traditional white flowers, I can't tell you how much it pains me. He was one of the greatest Members of this body ever to have served and a dear friend to so many of us. He was perhaps the best role model for public service any American could ask for. Senator Inouye's story is one of great passion for his people, commitment to his calling of public service, and dedication to finding a better way forward for all Americans, a true patriot.  A soldier in World War II, a veteran of the Armed Forces, he fought for the freedom of the Nation he so loved and believed in. The Nation finally recognized that, making him a recipient of our Congressional Medal of Honor.  As a representative of Hawaii, he dedicated his career to establishing and solidifying a place for his State in Washington so generations of Hawaiians to come might know the benefits of what he did not have, Federal support for such important causes such as higher education, transportation, health care, and security. His advocacy was never in vain, and the people of Hawaii benefited immensely from his service.  But I think his efforts to bring people together is unmatched. The grace with which he conducted his work should inspire all of us, as it does me. He was the man who could reach out to both sides of the aisle, make friends and make peace. He poured his heart and soul into the Senate. He was first and foremost a person of the Senate, and we all felt his passion and concern for the work of this body. There is no doubt he is going to be greatly missed in these halls. He was a mentor. He was a friend. We traveled together. Our wives were friends.  The reason I didn't speak last night, I opened my desk and looked again--the desk I have now, this seat, I inherited from Dan Inouye--and his name is inscribed in it. As the distinguished Acting President pro tempore knows, we inscribe our names in our desks, and Dan Inouye's is there. When I looked at that last night I was overcome with emotion and so I did not speak then.  I realize I am delaying things a couple of minutes here, but when I think of my friend and I think of his name, I remember he said he wanted to be remembered as having represented his people and all Americans honestly and to the best of his ability. He filled that. He filled that. We all know he gave his everything to the Senate, and his legacy is for us to continue the work he has done.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
