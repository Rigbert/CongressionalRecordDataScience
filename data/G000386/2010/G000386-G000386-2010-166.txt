 President, let's wake up. This has to be passed. It has to be passed before the end. One of the problems we always have is that it is not offset. It was included in the Baucus-Grassley bill way back in February. The leader had the chutzpah to dump his own chairman aside and go ahead with a partisan bill. Then the other side complained about the Bunning filibuster, and we have an opportunity now to avoid all that. We ought to avoid it and move on.
