Speaker, my question is in light of the fact that general debate and most of the bill has been objected to or much it has been objected to, there are still pending amendments. At what time do we need to advise Members who have amendments that are pending that they must be here? Obviously we are starting at 2. There are suspension bills, but can we give them some perhaps target time that they should be here to protect themselves in the offering of those amendments?
