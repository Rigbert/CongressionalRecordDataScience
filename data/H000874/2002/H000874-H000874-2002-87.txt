Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I thank the distinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Crane) for reserving and giving me the opportunity to explain this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment frankly was brought to me just within the last 48 hours. It does, however, seem to raise an issue of significant importance and difficulty for a number of those in the shipping business.  The problem apparently is that if a person has a ship repaired while on the high seas, that is not within the territorial waters of any nation, and those repairs are effected using non-U.S.parts, then they must fill out very substantial paperwork, and very substantial reporting requirements are implicated in that instance, so that we are causing a great burden to shipping companies that are U.S.-flagged. Obviously, we want shipping to be U.S.-flagged. We know that that is a difficulty.  I have introduced this amendment to try to address that issue. Because I introduced the amendment as a ``none of the funds'' and it is, therefore, a very blunt instrument, I agree with the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Crane) that this amendment should not pass in its present form. Even if it were added to the bill, I would be in favor of dropping it in conference. Its purpose was solely to protect our ability to address this issue.  It is, however, my understanding from the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Crane) and his staff that they share the view that this is a problem and that they are going to look at that and look at it closely. I do want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Crane) for his attention to this matter and for his staff working with us to see if we can come to a resolution of this matter.
