President, I join the city of Providence and the State of Rhode Island in celebrating the 90th anniversary of the Loew's Theatre Building, home of the Providence Center for the Performing Arts. From silent films to the Mighty Wurlitzer to live concerts and Broadway productions, the Loew's Theatre Building has delighted, educated, and entertained generations of Rhode Islanders.  On October 6, 1928, the theater opened its doors to more than 14,000 people who came to see its splendor and the silent film ``Excess Baggage.'' Designed by the renowned theater architects George and C.W. Rapp, the Loew's Theatre featured marble columns, gilded plasterwork, and crystal chandeliers.  After early years of success, the theater saw a decline in its economic fortunes as movie attendance waned. The theater sustained damage during the hurricanes of 1938 and 1954 and barely escaped demolition in the 1970s. Fortunately, local leaders stepped in to save this landmark. In 1977, the Loew's Theatre Building was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and the following year, a nonprofit organization was founded to restore its luster and establish a performing arts center for the community to enjoy.  Today the Providence Performing Arts Center is a hub of cultural activity. It not only brings top-flight productions to town but also offers a broad selection of community outreach programs, fulfilling its mission of serving ``the entertainment needs of the State's various populations by presenting the widest possible variety of arts and cultural events.'' The center presents free, community concerts featuring the Mighty Wurlitzer, the rare 1927 pipe organ, one of only three ever made. There is a seats for servicemembers initiative that offers preferred orchestra seating to our military families. There are arts scholarships, summer theater programs, and special opportunities for students to experience live theater productions.  Ninety years ago, Rhode Islanders flocked to the Loew's Theatre Building to share in something grand. We are grateful for the steady leadership and many contributions of the board of directors, dedicated staff, and generous benefactors who have made this historic landmark a living institution that continues to enrich the cultural life of our community. The Providence Performing Arts Center is still grand. May it continue to be so for generations to come.                          ____________________
