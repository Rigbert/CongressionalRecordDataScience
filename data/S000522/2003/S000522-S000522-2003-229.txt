Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, on the first day of this session the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans) and I introduced, along with now more than three dozen of our distinguished colleagues, H.R. 100, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, as a top legislative priority of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. With the war on terrorism and hundreds of thousands of our servicemembers on active duty in Iraq, Afghanistan and around the world, it is important that we lessen the burdens that they and their loved ones may face at home as a direct result of their service.  H.R. 100 will strengthen the rights and protections afforded U.S. military personnel called to active duty so that they are not harmed in civil, financial or legal proceedings. I am pleased that this bipartisan legislation has attracted broad support from veterans groups, military associations and the legal community. H.R. 100 is a complete restatement of the law known as the Soldiers' and Sailors' Civil Relief Act of 1940. A ``restatement'' of a law has long been understood to mean a law that has been updated, clarified and strengthened, including a gathering of the relevant judicial interpretations and a measured casting aside of those few interpretations that do not comport with the author's understanding of the law's intent.  This revision of the act has been in the works for a number of years. The Committee on Veterans' Affairs originally held hearings on a similarly intended measure, H.R. 4763, in the 102ndCongress. Last year, the Subcommittee on Benefits held 2 days of hearings on an almost identical measure, H.R. 5111.  The need for a Federal law such as the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act goes back to at least the Civil War, and a State law in Louisiana was passed as far back as the War of 1812. The first modern relief law was enacted in 1918. While H.R. 100, the bill before us, retains the time-tested basic rights and protections of the 1940 version of the law and its 1942 amendments, it also reflects the evolution of our legal processes during the past 60 years. The Committee on Veterans' Affairs has filed a bill report which contains a detailed explanation of the restatement. I recommend the bill report to those who seek a more detailed understanding of H.R. 100, as amended.  The current law is potentially applicable to a large number of personal transactions and any civil legal proceeding involving a servicemember. The courts have generally been understanding of the situation of the servicemembers who invoke its protections. They understand that these servicemembers are absent because they are doing the most important work of all, defending our national interests, our freedoms and our way of life.  In explaining the act, countless authors have been quick to remind us that the act is intended to give a temporary reprieve to a servicemember and that it reflects the need to be fair to all parties by relying upon the courts to determine whether the servicemember's ability to protect his or her rights or to meet obligations has been materially affected by military service. Those purposes are faithfully carried forward in this restatement.  Many of the provisions in the act and in H.R. 100 would only be of interest to persons involved in legal proceedings. Let me outline some that apply more generally to all servicemembers. For example, servicemembers would be protected against what amounts to a clever evasion of the prohibition against double taxation of a servicemember's military income when they must live outside the State where they are legal residents. What is happening is that some States where nonresident military personnel are stationed are counting a servicemember's military pay on which income taxes are paid elsewhere for determining the service- member's graduated tax rate on family income earned within the State. This is an outrageous exploitation of servicemembers who cannot even vote against the politicians who are doing it, and H.R. 100 would put a stop to it.  Any servicemember whose military service materially affects his or her ability to pay a debt incurred before entering military service is entitled to have the interest rate on this debt reduced to 6 percent. There has been dispute whether interest in excess of the 6 percent was deferred or forgiven and whether the lender must reduce the monthly payment. H.R. 100 makes it clear that such interest is forgiven and the monthly payment is reduced in keeping with the act's policy objective of reducing monthly obligations at a time when mobilized National Guard or Reserve members are likely to have a reduced income.  Active duty servicemembers who have permanent change of station orders or who are being deployed for more than 90 days would be allowed to terminate housing leases. Right now, servicemembers can be forced to pay rent for housing they cannot live in because our government sent them somewhere else.  An eviction proceeding against a servicemember could be delayed for at least 90 days if he or she invokes the act.                              {time}  1030  Eviction protection would be updated to reflect the increase in the cost of rental housing. The current act only applies to leases of less than $1,200 per month. H.R. 100 would increase that amount to $1,700 per month, and the amount would increase each year in accordance with a housing rental index.  The act protects against the lapse of life insurance policies when an individual enters military service. The act's life insurance coverage would be raised from $10,000 to $250,000, or the SGLI maximum, whichever is greater.  All motor vehicles and other property would be included in the act's installment contract provisions so that in the case of a service member who, for example, has fallen behind on car lease payments, the lessor must obtain a court order before repossessing the car.  The current act does not clearly apply to simple administrative proceedings, which are far more common today than they were in 1940. H.R. 100 would include administrative proceedings, such as license and zoning manners, under the act's rights and protections.  There are, Mr. Speaker, many other provisions which affect particular rights or particular statutes such as Federal mining and reclamation acts. Many of the other changes in language and terms merely reflect the language of the law as it is practiced today.  Mr. Speaker, the actual preparation of this bill was a collaborative effort between our committee counsel, the Office of Legislative Counsel, and, most importantly, representatives of the judge advocates general of the military departments. The JAG officers played a crucial role in relating how the current law is understood by their fellow JAG advisors, who must often counsel servicemembers on their rights and obligations under the law and who have direct experience with the issues and the problems that arise under it.  I want to commend, Mr. Speaker, all of the dedicated and capable members of the various staffs who worked so hard to prepare this legislation. Beginning with H.R. 4763 back in 1992, the JAG officers who provided the technical services for the very important initial draft of H.R. 4763 were Commander Christopher Gentile, U.S. Naval Reserve; Lieutenant Colonel Amy J. Griese, U.S. Air Force Reserve; Gregory M. Huckabee, U.S. Army; and Major Teresa J. Wright, U.S. Marine Corps.  The JAG officers who provided the excellent technical services for the updated draft for H.R. 5111 were Lieutenant Colonel Patrick W. Lindemann, U.S. Air Force; Major Eugene J. Martin, U.S. Army; Mr. Eric C. Stamets, civilian employee from the U.S. Army. Lieutenant Colonel Griese returned to the restatement effort by providing extensive technical services on the bill report for H.R. 100. Colonel Steven T. Strong, U.S. Army; and Colonel Wanda Good, U.S. Army also provided highly effective services on H.R. 5111 and H.R. 100, the bill before the committee and the Department of the Defense.  The Committee on Veterans Affairs counsel who prepared the hearings in 1992 and 2000 and were the lead staff members on H.R. 4763, 5111, and the bill before us today, H.R. 100, are Patrick Ryan and Kingston Smith. Minority committee counsel also worked very hard in drafting these bills, Mary Ellen McCarthy and Geoffrey Collver. Committee staff assistants who helped with research and proofreading are Summer Larson and Devon Seibert. Also Robert Cover of the Office of Legislative Counsel performed invaluable drafting services on each of these three bills and the final product that is before the body today.  Most especially I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Evans). My good friend and colleague is the committee's ranking Democrat who has been my active partner on this legislation and many other bills that we have brought before the House and who proposed coverage for the act for certain National Guard members that became part of the law last year.  Although the revision of this law has been in preparation for more than 10 years, I cannot think of a better time for this body to be considering it than today. I urge all Members to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
