President, her rich Roman Catholic faith was enhanced by her son, Claude, a priest with the Holy Cross Order. Claude visited his mother, both as son and as a pastoral friend. Together they talked as only they could, of the day when she would leave us. After her death we were reminded of her faith and love of family when we found a note she had written to herself to ask Claude if she could still pray for all of us after she went on to the next life.  Claude said her funeral Mass, and spoke with love, humor, and compassion. His words were such a comfort that I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               [Greeting]       May the God of all mercy and consolation be with you all.                        [Sprinkling with water]       In the waters of baptism Cecile died with Christ and rose      with Him into new life. May she now share with Him eternal      glory.                            [Opening prayer]       O God, source of all mercy and forgiveness, hear our prayer      for Cecile whom You have called to the fullness of life.       Because she put her hope in you, may she be carried safely      home, to enjoy her eternal reward.       We ask this through God, the source of all being, eternal      word, and Holy Spirit, one God, forever and ever.                   [Final commendation (after mass)]       Trusting in God, we have prayed together for Cecile. And      now, we share a final prayer. There is sadness, but there is      also joy of knowing that one day we shall all gather with her      and sing to her accompaniment.       We may disperse in sorrow, but the mercy of God will gather      us together again in the joy of the Kingdom.       We pray for this to God, the source of all being, eternal      word, and Holy Spirit. God, forever and ever. Amen.                           [Song of farewell]                        [Prayer of commendation]       Into Your hands, O God of mercy, we commend our sister      Cecile in the sure hope that together, with all who have died      in Christ she will rise with Him.       Merciful Creator, turn toward us and listen to our prayers:      open the gates of paradise to your servant and help us who      remain to comfort one another with assurances of faith, until      we all meet in God's Kingdom, with great rejoicing.       Amen.                                 homily   (To Gary Moreau, musician, with whom Cecile collaborated for many                                  years)       Gary, I begin by telling you that Mom asked me to play my      clarinet with you at her funeral. When we talked about her      death and the funeral, Cecile considered cremation. But then,      she quickly realized that if I played my clarinet in front of      the urn with her ashes, I would look like an Indian snake      charmer trying to tame a cobra inside a basket. So, in order      to leave me that musical option, she decided to be buried in      a more conventional manner.       Recalling Cecile's sense of humor, we are gathered here in      sorrow. Still, she has also left us a rich legacy, filled      with joy and gratitude. These two virtues were an important      part of her life.       Our sorrow accompanies the joy. It is precisely that which      causes us sorrow that also becomes the fertile ground for our      gladness. In her memory, we all become close friends, giving      each other strength, and consolation, and expressing our      gratitude. Thanks to Cecile's death, we become angels to each      other.       ``Nothing can make up for the absence of someone whom we      love, and it would be wrong to try to find a substitute; we      must simply hold out and see it through.       ``That sounds very hard at first, but at the same time it      is a great consolation, for the gap, as long as it remains      unfilled, preserves the bonds between us, it is nonsense to      say that God fills the gap; God does not fill it, but on the      contrary, keeps it empty and so helps us to keep alive our      former communion with each other, even at the cost of      pain.''--Dietrich Bonhoeffer.       With Bonhoeffer's words, we also recall our communion with      family and friends who give meaning to our present lives,      Philippe (Cecile's husband, my dad), Howard and Alba      (Patrick's parents), Ellen Pomerleau, Ida and Eli Bushnell,      Henri Nouwen, Cecile's sister and brothers, Don and Kay      McNeill, and Jean Paul Gaudette.       ``Dying can become our greatest gift if we prepare      ourselves to die well.''--Rev. Henri J.M. Nouwen.       I recall these recent words of Henri Nouwen. We don't all      have such a gift. Cecile had it in abundance. She not only      prepared herself, but she helped me, and all those who spent      time with her in these last years to appreciate this gift.      The preparation for death was consistent and definite,      religious and secular; sometimes she was subtle, sometimes      she was not. Even today, in this sacrament, she helps us to      understand her death, and appreciate her life.       In a personal way, I thank you, Mom, for arranging this      particular day. The sun is shining through the cold and      bouncing off the snow. And, it may not be appropriate for      all, but you called me away from one of the busiest weekends      imaginable. And, everyone graciously agreed to replace me.      And they all said, of course, take the time off, all the time      that you need. So, for calling us all together, thanks Mom!       In this spirit, I'd like to talk about the gift that Cecile      left us, the gift of preparing well for death, by turning      life and its ending into a gift. This became especially      obvious during her sickness, as she learned to cope with her      physical limitations. This was not easy, and it challenged      her, at times, a lot.       This gift of preparing well for death can be seen in three      areas: In her family, in her music, and in her faith in God.                             In her family       When Cecile became sick, some 6 years ago, she was      gradually disabled, becoming increasingly dependent on her      daughter and son-in-law, Marcelle and Patrick. She had to      adjust, and so did they. It was difficult, it went against      her independent nature. But, she did it by keeping in touch      with all the family and many of her friends.       She continued to be a communications center for the family,      linking cities by letters and phone calls. Washington, DC,      Burlington, Montreal, Chicago, Portland, Mexico, Chile,      France. Friends that she had made during her visits to      Europe, to Mexico and to Chile from 1986 to 1989. Her dear      friends in Santiago, especially Walter and Bernardita, Juan-     Pablo, Berni and Teresita, and the Navarretes in Mexico City,      especially Tomas and all the brothers and sisters; Ellen      Marie and all the children of Tony and Rita.       As sickness closed in, Cecile's world should have too.      Instead she continued to force open the door. Friends in      Chile, politics and family in Canada, and the past became      present. Stories about her childhood and grandparents and      aunts and uncles were repeated and some stories were told      with much laughter and others with tears. Joseph Robert, an      uncle of her great grandmother's was hung by the British in      the Riel Rebellion in 1837. She translated most of the book      on this rebellion by Jules Verne's (Famille sans nom). Last      year, she also finished translating into English the history      of the Bouchards as told by her father, Arthur Bouchard.       As for her new living arrangement in Goodwin House, her      circle of friends was large--all the better to publicize the      talents and exploits of her children. And, of course, to      campaign for her favorite ``Senateur Leahy'', and the      Democratic Party. I'm not aware that she made any illegal      contributions to the campaign, but other dubious events were      noticed. To grumpy Republicans, especially those who treated      their wives with less than respect at games of bridge or      during physical therapy, she was known to have run over their      toes with her walker. Patrick and I took to calling her the      Dennis Rodman of the walker set.                              In her music       Soon after receiving her music diploma at 17, she began      teaching, and remained a music teacher to the end. During      that long and colorful career, she played the organ, the      piano, she sang, she directed choirs at church, at school and      for anyone who asked. She was president of the Athena Club,      representative in Vt. of the National Association of Piano      Teachers, a judge for piano auditions throughout the      Northeast, and travelled to workshops at Priinceton and yale.      Music was a remarkable area of gifts and generosity for      Cecile.       In Chile, she gave lessons to students and friends; at      Goodwin House, she continued to teach piano to the children      of her nurses and maids who came from Central America,      Africa, Vietnam. She sang in the house choir, and went to      operas and concerts until last year. For Cecile, music was      her first language, her contact with the divine, her      discipline for ecstasy. Beethoven was the expression of the      divine that she most enjoyed. She transcribed a Beethoven      sonata for piano and clarinet, and we played it at every      opportunity. While her own appreciation was specific (some      might even say narrow--I never heard her play jazz, much less      ``grunge,'' nor put ``rap'' to music), she still enjoyed      anyone who was sincere and knew music. She once played for a      wedding with a young rock guitarist. She improvished while he      played. Afterwards, she told us that she was a bit surprised      and annoyed by his lack of appreciation, because he had      commented to her: ``Lady, you play a mean organ.'' Marcelle      explained to her that this was really meant as a compliement.                          In her faith in God       The center of Cecile's spirituality consisted in making her      family and friends present through her rosary. When I said      mass in her room, she would insert a litany of intentions      that included all persons from the present to the 19th      century! But the rosary was her constant companion and her      favorite way of making her loved ones present to her, and      available to God. God was not a complicated and unknowable      source of transcending bliss and light, nor was God a      complicated web of metaphysical abstractions. God was someone      you spoke to, to whom you gave thanks for family and the gift      of friends, two-legged or four-legged ones.       After listening to the news and weather, she located every      religious program on the tube, including ``that Mother      Angelica'' (when she could remember her name). ``That nun''      she would say ``is racist, sexist and narrowminded. And,      those priests who say mass often don't know how to preach.      So, I turn down the volume and say my rosary for them.'' The      rosary, again. It was her instrument of theological reform      and renewal!       And she talked a lot about life after death, with longing      (especially last year), but also with curiosity. She often      asked me what heaven might be like after death. ``What new      things are they saying about death,'' she would ask. She      would laugh (at my sputtering), and then we'd have a cup of      tea.                               Conclusion       There's much to include in these three categories, but it      is clear that for her, they were sacramental categories, that      she came in contact with God in family, in music, and in      prayer, especially with the prayer of her rosary.       So, today, we too stay in communion with her, and with God,      through the sacrament we     are celebrating. Even though it is the middle of winter, cold      with snow (not weather that Cecile appreciated), we bless,      and offer up this bread and wine in memory of God's love and      compassion for us, and in memory of Cecile's presence, that      of death as well as life eternal.       We celebrate the death and resurrection of Jesus, knowing      that this gives special meaning to all our family reunions      and human relationships. God's presence is everywhere, giving      meaning to the presence of Cecile's absence. ``The presence      of that absence is everywhere,'' in the words of Edna St.      Vincent Millay.       We don't just use these humble gifts of bread and wine.      Rather we let them speak to us of joy and sorrow, of presence      and absence, of faithfulness and sacrifice. The Eucharist      reminds us that it is God's gift to us to be fruitful. It is      a human activity to be productive, a divine gift to be      fruitful. In this Eucharist/sacrament, we receive that gift      from God. For that gift, and for peace, we now give thanks.       In the words of the Kaddish, ``May God who establishes      peace in the heavens, grant peace unto us and unto all      Israel, And say yes, Amen.''
