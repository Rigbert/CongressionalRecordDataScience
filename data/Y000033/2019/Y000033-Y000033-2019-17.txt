Chair, I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentleman from California.  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chair, we know how to ecologically do it well. This isn't 1850. We are not going to go out and do horrible environmental damage. We know how to do this right and we will be responsible. When that resource is done being used someday, we are going to put it back how it was.  We need to develop within our own country under our own rules, instead of having the arrogance of relying on other countries who do it without rules, such as China, such as the Middle East, and others that don't haveour best interests or even the environment at heart.
