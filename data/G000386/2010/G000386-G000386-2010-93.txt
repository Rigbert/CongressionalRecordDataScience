 I ask unanimous consent that a public letter dated September 24, 2009, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               September 24, 2009.     Hon. Kathleen Sebelius,     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services,          Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Sebelius: America's 11 million seniors      enrolled in the Medicare Advantage program deserve to be      informed of any actions by the federal government that could      affect this program and its broad implications. Medicare      Advantage Plans and Prescription Drug Plans that provide      services through the Medicare program have a constitutional      right to provide information about these Medicare programs to      their customers. Therefore, I hope you can understand our      grave concern with the recent Centers for Medicare and      Medicaid Services directive barring all such providers from      any and all communications of this kind with America's      seniors. This gag order must be immediately lifted.       As the Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized, our      constitutional tradition is one of ``a profound commitment to      the principle that debate on public issues should be      uninhibited, robust, and wide-open.'' Health plans, of      course, have the right to speak on matters of public      concern--a fundamental principle that your Department, until      recently, had recognized and respected. Specifically, the      Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) previously      noted that there was no legal authority to justify      prohibiting a health plan ``from informing its members of      proposed legislation and exhorting them to express their      opinions'' about it. In fact, HHS had previously determined      that shutting down communication of this sort ``would violate      basic freedom of speech and other constitutional rights of      the Medicare beneficiary as a citizen.''       Now, the Obama administration has reversed this      longstanding HHS decision--in the midst of a critical debate      about the future of health care services in our country--to      shut down communication between private companies and      America's seniors on an issue that has a direct impact on      their health care. And your Department has done so by      imposing an industry-wide gag order without apparent      justification or basis in law and completely contradictory to      your past public guidance and the plain language and spirit      of the First Amendment, among the most sacred tenets of our      democracy.       America's seniors and the health plans that serve them      deserve to have their free speech rights respected. Their      rights should not be subject to the whims of any      Administration, and the health plans that serve them should      not be threatened with punishment if they speak out on a      matter of public concern simply because the Administration      disagrees with their position.       Until your Department rescinds its gag order and allows      seniors to receive information about matters before Congress,      we will not consent to time agreements on the confirmation of      any nominees to your Department or associated agencies.       Thank you for your consideration of this matter of such      great importance to America's seniors.           Signed,     Mitch McConnell.     Jon Kyl.     Lamar Alexander.     John Cornyn.     Lisa Murkowski.     John Thune.     Michael B. Enzi.     Chuck Grassley.                          ____________________
