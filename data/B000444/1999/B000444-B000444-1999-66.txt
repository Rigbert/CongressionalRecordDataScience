 President, I will take a minute to respond. I understand the point made. We have 6,000 intercontinental ballistic missiles that are on line right now. The Russians have a similar number. After you get by that, the numbers drop off precipitously. China is down in the teens. This unilateral disarmament notion or, as explained by the distinguished Senator from Arizona, I understand his point, but what are we doing? Are we going to give up? Are we freezing in place the fact that we stay at 6,000, and if they take the worst case of a stockpile that is in atrophy versus the dozen or more that the Chinese have? I mean, come on. Come on. You know, if you told me the Chinese had 6,000 nuclear weapons, MIRV capability, thermonuclear yield, or if you told me the Koreans and Libyans had that and the Russians had that, then you would have an argument. After the Soviet Union and then our allies, it drops off precipitously into double digits, max--max.  Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Massachusetts.
