I note that the distinguished Presiding Officer, my colleague, the senior Senator from Maine, is also a strong supporter and cosponsor of our effort.  This provision, which amounts to a $50 billion giveaway to big tobacco, has generated justifiable outrage across the country and fueled the tremendous cynicism that already colors the American public's view of politics and politicians.  Now, Madam President, where did this tax break come from? It was not in the Senate tax bill. It was not in the House version of the bill. There was never any public debate. The one-sentence provision just magically appeared at the end of a 327-page conference report tucked into a section entitled ``Technical Amendments Relatedto Small Business, Job Protection, and Other Legislation.''  No one claimed parentage. Like Harriet Beecher Stowe's Topsy, ``She wasn't born, she just was.''  While no one has officially spoken up to claim this orphan, it turns out, according to press reports, that the provision was written not by Members of Congress, but by the tobacco industry.  Madam President, this is outrageous. It is backroom politics at its worst, and represents the kind of abuse of the legislative process that the American public is rightfully sick and tired of--a secret agreement, negotiated behind closed doors, by powerful tobacco industry lobbyists, in the closing hours of consideration of a massive tax bill.  Congress is currently considering the proposed $368.5 billion global settlement negotiated between 40 attorneys general and the tobacco industry. As we review this settlement, one of our primary objectives is to ensure that the tobacco industry has negotiated in good faith and is held fully accountable for their past misconduct.  Many of us have harbored suspicions about the tobacco companies' supposedly good intentions during these negotiations. We have been concerned that the tobacco companies would simply raise prices and write off the settlement payments, effectively passing on the costs of the settlement to the taxpayer and the tobacco consumer.  Well, Madam President, worst suspicions confirmed. Not only can the tobacco companies write off the entire $368 billion as a business expense, which means that 30 to 40 percent of the tobacco settlement costs will be subsidized by the taxpayers, but now the Congress, in a moment of midnight madness, has carved out a brand-new tax break for these companies that effectively reduces the costs of the settlement by $50 billion.  It is outrageous that we should even consider approving this tax break and passing on these costs to the American taxpayer. Tobacco is the No. 1 preventable cause of death in the United States. It accounts for approximately 500,000 deaths a year and billions of dollars in health care costs. The tobacco companies have agreed to the settlement as a means of reducing their future liability and are providing some compensation to States and individuals for the costs they face because of the disease and addiction associated with their products.  Regardless of our position on the proposed tobacco settlement, we should all agree to reject this $50 billion special tax break for the industry.  Now, some would have us believe that the $50 billion tax credit is part of the tobacco settlement. This is simply not true. In fact, this concept was discussed and soundly rejected during the negotiations between the attorneys general and the tobacco industry. In fact, the States attorneys general strongly oppose this new tax credit.  I have a letter from the States attorneys general. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         State Attorneys General, (a Communication From the Chief            Legal Officers of the Following States,                                                   August 6, 1997.     Hon. Phil Carlton,     Carlton Law Firm,     Pinetops, NC.       Dear Mr. Carlton: We are writing to inform you that the      recent action by Congress to use revenues raised by new taxes      as a credit toward our settlement is unacceptable. Apparently      this action was taken with approval by or at the urging of      representatives of the industry. As you know, this concept      was discussed and rejected by us during our negotiations. The      industry has agreed to specific dollar amounts in the      settlement, and we will not agree to any diminution of those      amounts not specifically set forth in the agreement.       We have continued our support for this settlement because      we believe it to be in the best interest of the American      public. We have always made it clear, however, that should      Congress substantially alter material terms of the agreement,      the States would exercise the option of rejecting the      settlement and continuing the prosecution of their lawsuits.      We regard this action as a substantial alteration of a      material term. We ask your immediate agreement that this must      be eliminated from any final resolution of this matter.           Sincerely,     Mike Moore,                                     Mississippi Attorney General.     Grant Woods,                                         Arizona Attorney General.     Christine O. Gregoire,                                      Washington Attorney General.     Robert A. Butterworth,                                         Florida Attorney General.     Richard Blumenthal,                                     Connecticut Attorney General.     Dennis C. Yacco,                                        New York Attorney General.
