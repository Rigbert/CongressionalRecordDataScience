President, this House bill is identical to S. 1580, the Religious Workers Act of 2003, of which I am a proud cosponsor. The bill extends for 5 years provisions of our immigration law that provide for special immigrant visas for religious workers sponsored by religious organizations in the United States. These visas allow religious denominations or organizations in the United States to bring in foreign nationals to perform religious work here. This modest program--which provides for up to 5,000 religious immigrant visas a year--was created in the Immigration Act of 1990, and has been extended ever since.  These religious workers contribute significantly not just to their religious communities, but to the community as a whole. They work in hospitals, nursing homes, and homeless shelters. They help immigrants and refugees adjust to the United States. In other words, they perform vital tasks that all too often go undone.  I have worked on this issue over the years, and cosponsored bills in 1997 and 2000 that would have made this program permanent. I still believe that it should be permanent but fully support a 5-year extension as the next best thing. Time is now of the essence as we have entered Fiscal Year 2004 and allowed this program to lapse.  The House passed this bill last month by voice vote. I urge the Senate to follow suit by approving this extension and sending it to the President without further delay.
