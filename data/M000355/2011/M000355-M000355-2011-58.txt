 President, I would like to recognize Eastern Kentucky University, located in Richmond, KY, for all the school has done on behalf of Kentucky's Veterans. EKU has been named one of the top two universities in the Nation for veterans for the second consecutive year. The recognition was given to EKU by the Military Times EDGE magazine for the university's commitment to helping military veterans advance their education.  EKU has made a concerted effort over the past several years to make the institution more hospitable to America's brave veterans. These initiatives include dropping admission fees for undergraduate veterans, granting in-state tuition to all out-of-State veterans, giving priority registration to veterans, designating housing specifically for student-veterans, and creating a helpful withdrawal and readmission process for veterans.  EKU's commitment to better education for our Nation's heroes has, by all accounts, been a huge success.  In addition to receiving national recognition from the veterans community, the university has seen its veteran population grow by some 40 percent in the last year.  So today, on the eve of Veterans Day, I wish to honor Eastern Kentucky University for its dedication to better serving our country's brave veterans, and to congratulate the university and President Doug Whitlock on this well-deserved recognition.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
