 President, today Senators Hollings, Inouye, and I are introducing a bill to create a demonstration grant program to help school districts create master teacher positions.  Our bill authorizes $50 million for a five-year demonstration program under which the Secretary of Education would award competitive grants to school districts to create master teacher positions. Federal funds would be equally matched by states and local governments so that $100 million total would be available. Under the bill, 5,000 master teacher positions could be created, or 100 per State, if each master teacher were paid $20,000 on top of the current average teacher's salary.  As defined in this amendment, a master teacher is one who is credentialed; has a least five years of teaching experience; is judged to be an excellent teacher by administrators and teachers who are knowledgeable about the individual's performance; and is currently teaching; and enters into a contract and agrees to serve at least five more years.  The master teacher would help other teachers to improve instruction, strengthen other teachers' skills, mentor lesser experienced teachers, develop curriculum, and provide other professional development.  The intent of this bill is for districts to pay each master teacher up to $20,000 on top of his or her regular salary. Nationally, the average teacher salary is $40,582. In California, it is $44,585. Elementary school principals receive $64,653 on average nationally and $72,385 in California. The thrust of the master teacher concept in this bill is to pay teachers a salary closer to that of an administrator to keep good teachers in teaching.  The bill requires State and/or local districts to match federal funds dollar for dollar. It requires the U.S. Department of Education to give priority to school districts with a high proportion of economically disadvantaged students and to ensure that grants are awarded to a wide range of districts in terms of the size and location of the school district, the ethnic and economic composition of students, and the experience of the districts' teachers.  There are several reasons we need this bill.                       new teachers need support  First, new teachers face overwhelming responsibilities and challenges in their first year, but in the real world, they get little guidance. When first-year teachers enter the classroom, there is typically little help available to them, in a year that will have a profound impact on the rest of their professional career. They are ``out there alone,'' virtually isolated in their classroom, thrown into an unfamiliar school and classroom with a room full of new faces. By the current sink-or-swim method, new teachers often find themselves ill equipped to deal with the educational and disciplinary tasks of their first year.  In California, 23 percent of teachers in kindergarten through the third grade are novices. Furthermore, we have 30,000 inexperienced teachers on emergency credentials in California, over ten percent of our teaching workforce.  A new teacher can get experienced guidance from a master teacher who is paired with the new teacher. The master teacher can help plan lessons, improve instructional methods, and deal with discipline problems. ``If you're [a master teacher] teaching a class, then you can say, `last week I handled a discipline problem this way.' It's much more credible.'' said Carl O'Connell, a New York mentor teacher.                   enhancing the teaching profession  Second, master teacher programs can bring more prestige to teaching as a profession, by increasing the teacher's salary, by rewarding experience, and by giving teachers opportunities to supervise others. A master teacher designation is a way to recognize outstanding ability and performance. A master teacher position can give teachers a professional goal, a higher level to pursue. A 1996 report by the National Commission for Teaching and America's Future said that creating new career paths for teachers is one of the best ways to give educators the respect they deserve and to ensure that proven teaching methods spread quickly and broadly.  In one survey of teachers which asked which factors make teachers stay in teaching, 79 percent of teachers said that respect for the teaching profession is needed in order to retain qualified teachers. Eighty percent said that formal mentoring programs for beginning teachers is key (Scholastic/Chief State School Officers' Teacher Voices Survey, 2000). Over 70 percent of teachers said that more planning time with peers is needed to keep teachers in the classroom. This amendment should help.                 improving retention, reducing turnover  Because of the higher pay and enhanced prestige, a master teacher program can help to recruit and retain teachers. Mentor systems provide new teachers with a support network, someone to turn to. Studies indicate higher retention rates among new teachers who participate in mentoring programs. According to Yvonne Gold of California State University-Long Beach, 25 percent of beginning teachers do not teach more than two years and nearly 40 percent leave in the first five years. In the Rochester, New York, system, the teacher retention rate was nearly double the national average five years after establishing a mentoring program.  As Jay Matthews wrote in the May 16 Washington Post, programs like this ``can provide a large boost to the profession's image for a relatively small amount of money.'' These programs can keep good teachers in the classroom, instead of losing them to school administration or industry. Larkspur, California, School Superintendent Barbara Wilson says she is ``witnessing a steady exodus to dotcom and other, more lucrative industries.'' (San Francisco Chronicle, March 26, 2000).  Higher salaries and prestige for master teachers could deter the drain from the classrooms.                      holding teachers accountable  Another reason for this amendment is that teacher mentoring programs can make teacher performance more accountable. A master teacher can help novice teachers improve their teaching and get better student achievement. ``Teachers cannot be held accountable for knowledge based, client-oriented decisions if they do not have access to knowledge, as well as opportunities for consultation and evaluation of their work,'' said Adam Urbanski, President of the Rochester, New York, TeachersAssociation. He went on: ``Unsatisfactory teacher performance often stems from inadequate and incompetent supervision. Administrators often lack the training and the resources to supervise teachers and improve the performance of those who are in serious trouble.''  Good teachers are key to learning. Lower math test scores have been correlated with the percentage of math teachers on emergency permits and higher math test scores were linked both to the teachers' qualifications and to their years of teaching experience, according to ``Professional Development for Teachers, 2000.''                        california would benefit  This bill could be very helpful in California where one-fifth of our teachers will leave the profession in three years, according to an article in the February 9, 2000, Los Angeles Times.  California will need 300,000 new teachers by 2010. ``More students to teach, smaller classes, teachers leaving or retiring means that California school districts are now having to hire a record 26,000 new teachers each year,'' says the report, ``Teaching and California's Future, 2000.'' California's enrollment is growing at three times the national rate. With these kinds of demands, understaffing often leads to under qualified and new teachers entering the classroom. We have to do all we can to attract and retain good teachers.                  examples of master teacher programs  California has instituted several programs along these lines. California has a program to help beginning teachers. It has grown from $5 million (supporting 1,100 new teachers in 1992) to nearly $72 million (serving 23,000 new teachers in 1999-2000). But even with this increase, the program still does not serve all new teachers,'' according to the report, Teaching and California's Future, 2000.  The Rochester City, New York, school system has a Peer Assistance and Review Program, begun by the schools and the Rochester Teacher Association. The Rochester program is working. ``The evaluation is absolutely spectacular. The program has been a terrific success. It has been deemed a success by mentors, by the panel, by the district, by the union, and, most importantly, by the interns themselves,'' reported the newspaper, New York Teacher.  Delaware provides mentors for beginning teachers. ``Not only are beginning teachers receiving the support they need, but the mentoring program is also developing networks among teachers within districts and across the state, and the mentors have `a new enthusiasm' for teaching,'' as reported in ``Promising Practices'' in 1998.  Columbus, Ohio, schools instituted a Peer Assessment and Review program similar to Rochester's. It has two components: the intern program for all newly hired teachers and the intervention program for teachers who are having difficulties in the classroom teaching. According to the State Education Agency, ``the district has a lower rate of attrition than similar districts because of PAR.'' (Promising Practices, 1998).  The funds provided in this bill can supplement and expand existing State programs and help other States start new programs.                        students are the winners  The true beneficiaries of master teacher programs are the students and that is, or course, our fundamental goal. As stated in Rochester's teaching manual, the goal is ``to improve student outcomes by developing and maintaining the highest quality of teaching, providing teachers with career options that do not require them to leave teaching to assume additional responsibilities and leadership roles.''  I believe this bill can begin to provide teachers the real professional support they need, can attract and retain teachers and can bring to the profession the prestige it deserves.  I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this bill.                                 ______                                       By
