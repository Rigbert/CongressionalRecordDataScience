Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding this time to me.  The distinguished gentleman from Wisconsin is the cochairman of the Rural Health Care Coalition. I had the privilege only a session ago, and I was going to rise in support of his amendment; I do, and it simply has been described by the gentleman very well.  The problem is this bill includes only $4 billion for the rural health outreach grants. This is $27.3 million below the level of last year. As the gentleman has indicated, in the committee report we were supposed to get the full funding. This funding will provide support only for the continuation of grants that were funded before this year. As to the transition grants, and as the gentleman has indicated, both of these programs are vital to the rural health care delivery system, this bill simply zeros out all of the transition grant funding.  Now, what the gentleman was trying to do and what I certainly was going to support him doing is that we are increasing the social services block grant $99 million. We were simply going to ask for an additional $20 million of restoring that funding that would be under last year's level.  And so I guess I would ask the distinguished chairman of the full committee whether or not it is his intent when we go to conference, since I think, obviously, he is going to object when we offer this amendment, but could I have the assurance of the distinguished gentleman and the chairman, who I know has worked very hard, so that at least in conference we could restore these funds and we could restore a vital part of the rural health care delivery system?
