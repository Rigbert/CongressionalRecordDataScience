Levi to be a member of the Board of Directors of the Legal Services Corporation. His nomination has been pending on the Senate Executive Calendar since October 21 when reported favorably by the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.  Mr. Levi is a partner in the Chicago office of Sidley Austin LLP where he has spent more than 25 years specializing in employment litigation, executive compensation, and labor-management relations. Despite the demands of his legal practice, he has always found time to give back to the community.  In addition to leading his law firm's adopt-a-school program, where he oversees lawyers and staff involved in mentoring activities in public schools, Mr. Levi has been involved in juvenile justice and access of justice issues, serving on both the Cook County Citizens' Committee for the Juvenile courts, and the board of the Jane Addams Juvenile Court Foundation. He also serves on the advisory board for the Northwestern University Law School Center on Wrongful Convictions. He is the immediate past president and longtime trustee of the Francis W. Parker School in Chicago. He is the recipient of the 2004 Abraham Lincoln Marovitz ``Lend A Hand'' volunteer award, and was awarded a honorary diploma by the Parker School in 2003.  Considering Mr. Levi's strong commitment to public service, it is not surprising that President Obama has appointed him to the Board that oversees the vital work of the Legal Services Corporation, LSC. The LSC is the Federal agency that coordinates provisions to ensure that low-income Americans have access to adequate legal representation. The corporation employs lawyers who are experts in areas such as health care, housing, Social Security, consumer problems, welfare, and employment. These immensely important issues affect millions of Americans each year; many of whom are unable to afford legal assistance when they need it most. I know that in my own State of Vermont, LSC has provided legal assistance to many low income people in such matters and that local legal aid lawyers rely extensively on their national support centers.  The Legal Services Corporation plays a critical role in ensuring that justice is carried out in a manner consistent with the Constitution's promise, and when justice is served fairly, it benefits us all and strengthens the integrity of our legal system.  I will always remember the important service to the country provided by his father, Attorney General Edward H. Levi, at a difficult time in our Nation's history. His is a family of outstanding lawyers. They have made a significant contribution and make a significant difference to the people who need the protection of the law. John Levi is a strong addition to LSC's board of directors. I congratulate him and his family on his confirmation. I look forward to working with him.                          ____________________
