Chairman, I recognize and support the need for a right size law enforcement presence wherever people visit Federal lands, but this amendment would implement the budget request to hire 16 more Federal wildlife fire officers primarily in urban areas.  Urban areas already have a strong local law enforcement presence, so the Federal Government should first look to contract with local law enforcement before deciding to hire more Federal officers. Furthermore, of all the law enforcement responsibilities covered in this bill, the biggest gap exists on Indian reservations, where 911 response times are often measured in hours and days instead of minutes.  Before we pull more money out of the account that pays unsung civil servants to carry out the most fundamental functions of the department, let's make sure we are putting the dollars where they are needed the most. I encourage the rest of my colleagues to oppose the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
