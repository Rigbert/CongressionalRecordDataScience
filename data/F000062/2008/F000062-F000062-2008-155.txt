 President, if I may, I very much would like to thank a few people who have been very helpful in this whole thing. The first is David Grannis, my intelligence liaison, who has been with me all the way. I thank the Partnership for a Secure America and the 18 former national security officials who wrote in support of the Army Field Manual.  I thank Senators Hagel and Snowe for taking a stand for what is right for America in the Intelligence Committee. I thank our chairman, Senator Rockefeller, for being willing to risk the passage of this legislation by supporting this very important amendment.  I also thank Senator Whitehouse. He offered this amendment when it was in the Senate Intelligence Committee. I thank him for his tireless efforts in support of this conference report. I have seen him on the Senate floor at least twice today. He was a cosponsor of the amendment I offered in the conference, and I know his staff has been very effective in working on this amendment.  I thank Senator Tom Carper of Delaware who has done a lot of work on this issue on the telephone.  I thank my colleague and friend, Senator Ron Wyden, who came earlier to the floor to speak on this issue.  So there have been many people working toward this vote, and it looks as if it may just happen. I would like them to know that we are very grateful for their support.  Oh, one more: Senator Feingold. Senator Feingold was a cosponsorwhen I offered the amendment in the Intelligence Committee. I very much thank him for his steadfastness.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
