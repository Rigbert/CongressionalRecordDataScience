Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the County of Riverside are exceptional. Riverside County has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give time and talent to making their communities a better place to live and work. Stuart Glickman is one of these individuals. On January 10, 2003, Stuart was honored as he retired as a Riverside Superior Court Commissioner.  A native born Southern Californian, Stuart was born and raised in Los Angeles. He was educated by Los Angeles public schools and was admitted to the State Bar in 1971. He went on to serve as Deputy District Attorney for Riverside County from 1971 to 1988. He was the Deputy in charge of the Corona Branch Office for ten years and assisted the Corona Police Department with training in the areas of search warrants and report writing. He also conducted courtroom training for police officers. He worked in the Riverside Superior and Municipal Courts, Corona Municipal Court and Hemet Municipal Court, handling both felony and misdemeanor cases.  In 1988 he was appointed a Municipal Court Commissioner in the Corona Municipal Court. In 1992 he was appointed a Superior Court Commissioner and oversaw assignments that included criminal, civil, family law, traffic, small claims, and unlawful detainers.  Stuart currently lives in Corona, California with his wife Ann of 43 years. He has two daughters, Marsha and Deborah, and is a proud grandfather of five.  Stuart has been actively involved in the community as a member and past president of the United States Navy League of Corona. He is also a member and past president of the Corona Breakfast Lions Club and a member of the Temescal Palms Masonic Lodge in Corona.  Stuart's tireless work as a Deputy District Attorney and a Superior Court Commissioner has contributed unmeasurably to the betterment of Riverside County. His involvement in the community makes me proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that the residents of Riverside County are grateful for his service and salute him as he retires. I look forward to continuing to work with him in the future for the good of our community.                          ____________________
