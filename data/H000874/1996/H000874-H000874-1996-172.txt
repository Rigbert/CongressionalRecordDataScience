Chairman, I yield myself 18 minutes.  Mr. Chairman, before launching into a statement on the Treasury-Postal appropriations, I want to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, the gentleman from Iowa [Mr. Lightfoot], the chairman of the subcommittee. As all of us know, he is running for the Senate and will not be with us next year in the House. I would like to thank him and the staff for the diligent work that they have done on this bill.  I also want to reiterate what I said in committee. I want to thank the chairman and the committee for the openness with which they have dealt with us on the legislation before us, particularly as it relates to preceding the initial subcommittee markup. I appreciate it and it was helpful.  Mr. Chairman, the Treasury-Postal bill has been a hard bill to put together for fiscal year 1997, based in part on the deck we have been dealt by the budget resolution and the committee's 602(b) allocation, or more plainly, the money that we were given by the full Committee on Appropriations to carry out our responsibilities.  For fiscal year 1997, the 602(b) allocation requires an overall reduction of $130 million in budget authority and a half a billion dollars in outlays from the 1996 appropriation level, a half a billion dollars below what was a very tight budget in 1996. We simply do not have enough money to fund all the requirements of this bill. Once again, there is another illustration of why we should have adopted the coalition budget.  Overall, this bill provides $11.1 billion in discretionary funding, which is about $130 billion below the amount we appropriated last year and $1.7 billion below the amount requested by the administration.  On the good side, Mr. Chairman, within the limit of resources available, this committee's commitment to law enforcement is evident. Funding for law enforcement agencies totals $3.5 billion, an increase of $408 million, or 14 percent, over the 1996 levels and $155 million above the administration's request.  We have funded law enforcement initiatives, including $800,000 for the Treasury Recipient Integrity Program, the TRIP Program, the Secret Service Program to stop fraud in benefit payments so that the beneficiaries are protected and the taxpayer is protected; $12 million supplemental this year and $12 million in 1997 to help ATF stop arson at American churches and do research on arson; continued full funding for Hill Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas, HIDTA's, and the addition of three new HIDTA's; $28 million for Custom's Operation Gateway to cut drug traffic through the Caribbean; $300,000 for FINCEN, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a critically important agency to enhance interaction and effectiveness between law enforcement agencies to stop money laundering and the use of billions of dollars for criminal enterprise and the profits of criminal enterprise.  Programs like these provide a secure environment for the vast majority of Americans who are law-abiding citizens. Ongoing initiatives like HIDTA and the Gang Resistance Education and Training Program, the GREAT Program, make our streets safer for those who would work at school and at home. Just as ATF and the Secret Service provide vital protection in communities across the country, the Customs Service secures our borders from those who would seek to bring harm to our citizens, especially from the ongoing threat of illegal drugs.  In addition to law enforcement, this bill fully funds the Archives and OPM and includes very limited buyout authorities for Customs, ATF, and the IRS. I should note that this buyout authority must be significantly adjusted if it is to save the taxpayers money in avoiding RIF's, as GAO has indicated.  On the negative side, these increases in law enforcement have been made at the expense of the Internal Revenue Service, a critically important agency when it comes to deficit reduction and funding every priority of this Government. This bill cuts over $800 million from the amounts IRS needs just to maintain current levels of taxpayer service and revenue collection. Overall funding cuts to IRS would result in a decrease of some 7,500 FTE's and, to the extent these reductions cannot be accomplished by October 1, even more FTE's would have to be cut.  The reductions in this bill to the IRS are so unwise that the Committee on Ways and Means concluded in its June 26, 1996 letter to Chairman Livingston that this bill will not work for the IRS.  Specifically, Mr. Chairman, the bill will impair the IRS' ability to perform its core responsibilities. Its cuts to information systems will endanger IRS' ability to collect taxes and process returns in 1997 as well as provide efficient customer services to the Nation's taxpayers.  These budget cuts could create a very significant risk that substantial Federal revenues could be lost, thereby exacerbating our Federal budget deficit problems. That comes from the letter signed by the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Archer, and the gentlewoman from Connecticut, Mrs. Johnson, not by a Democrat, not by Steny Hoyer, a ranking Member, but by the Republican oversight leaders of this House.  Specifically, Mr. Chairman, the bill will impair the IRS's ability to perform its core responsibilities; cuts in information systems will hurt their ability to collect taxes and process returns in 1997, as well as provide efficient customer services to the Nation's taxpayers. We all lament when our taxpayers complain that they do not get speedy response. They cannot get such response if the ability to do so is not funded.  These budget cuts could, and I think will, pose a risk of creating a very significant risk that substantial Federal revenues could be lost, thereby exacerbating our Federal budget deficit problems.  Mr. Chairman, this third conclusion of the Committee on Ways and Means should not, cannot be ignored by those Members of this House who take deficit reduction seriously. In other words, supporting this bill with its cuts to the IRS means you are putting at risk a balanced budget.  The problem is really very simple. This bill cuts IRS funding and staffing so much that it will not be able to collect the revenue that the rest of the Government depends upon and that deficit reduction depends upon.  If this bill were to become law, the 1997 filing season would be impacted adversely with taxpayer services jeopardized, revenue losses of over $1 billion would occur, adding to the Federal deficit, and IRS' computer modernization efforts would be crippled, leading to significant problems in the near future.  Not only does this bill halt the compliance initiative found to enhance revenues so successfully in prior years, but it cuts into the base funding of IRS' tax enforcement program, reducing tax law enforcement to $44.7 million below the current level, and would result in an estimated annual revenue loss of well over $640 million. Cuts like this will cost, not save, money in the long run.  With respect to TSM, let me call attention to the provisions of the June 26 letter, which says, and I would quote, ``We strongly oppose a number of TSM management actions recommended by the subcommittee, in particular the fencing of all TSM funds, until the IRS establishes a restructured contractual arrangement with the private sector to develop and deliver effective TSM programs.''  They do so because on page 5 of that letter, Mr. Chairman, they say ``The IRS on TSM is clearly moving in the right direction.'' In other words, what the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer], the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Mrs. Johnson], the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Gibbons], and the gentleman from California [Mr. Matsui] are saying is that from 1988, under President Reagan, from 1989 to 1992 under President Bush, from 1993 to 1996 under President Clinton, there were very substantial problems in the tax systems modernization program. I agree with that. Our committee agrees with that.  Our committee has taken action to try to correct that, and in fact we have been heard because the Treasury Department, under Secretary Rubin, has taken action to ensure that TSM is done and done right.  Now, Mr. Chairman, we do not have an alternative but to do tax systems modernization as we look into the next century. The committee clearly believes, again I say not the Democrats looking at a Democratic administration, but the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer] and the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Mrs. Johnson] in their letter clearly says, ``The IRS is clearly moving in the right direction.'' Therefore, this action is a dollar short and a day late because we have gotten a handle on the program.                              {time}  1730  But it does make, I suppose, for good debate.  This bill would, in addition, Mr. Chairman, set aside $26 million of IRS's limited funds to double the scope of the current pilot project on using private collection agencies to collect overdue taxes. I personally believe that, until the results of the first project are complete, this $26 million would be better spent in IRS telephone collection systems which could generate an additional $665 million in revenue.  This bill, in addition, cuts in half funding for tax systems modernization and ties the hands of the Treasury Department such that even the operational projects that GAO believes should be funded are halted. I am pleased that we are going to speak to that issue, and I want to say that the chairman, as he said in his opening statement, has been very willing to discuss problems that might exist and to indicate a willingness to look at these and try to correct them.  I think that is a very positive step and it does not surprise me, because that has been the Chairman's continuing pattern throughout my relationship with him. He is a person who wants to make sense and to do the right thing.  The bill zero funds, in addition, the automated underreporter document matching systems, which will result in the loss of jobs for 88 people, a savings of $9.4 million in budget costs, but the potential loss of a billion dollars. Saving $9.4 million and putting at risk a billion dollars does not seem to me to make common sense.  Zero funding of the electronic filing operating systems that were used by over 14,000,000 taxpayers in 1996 will cost 251 people their jobs and set back all filing to pen and paper operations. Zero funding for corporate files on line will make resolving taxpayer inquiries much more difficult. I do not think that is what we want to do for our taxpayers.  Zero funding for the print systems that generate millions of taxpayer notices each year would create chaos, frankly, in the revenue system. Even the Detroit computing center, which processes all currency transaction reports and administration information, would be zero funded as well.  The committee has simply gone too far, in my opinion, Mr. Chairman, in its zeal to punish the IRS for its lack of success with tax systems modernization. We all recognize that this broad effort to update all aspects of IRS' computer and processing systems, known as TSM, is a high priority that is critical as the agency prepares for the 21st century. We are also concerned about the lack of results from IRS' efforts on TSM.  TSM has had problems for many years, through three administrations, as I previously said. I am glad that Secretary Rubin agrees that we are on the right track and that the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer] agrees with the Secretary.  The Committee on Ways and means, as I quoted before, on page 5 of its letter said, and I quote, ``We believe it makes little sense, at a time when the IRS is finally making progress in its efforts to implement necessary changes in its TSM management processes, to hamstring the IRS's ability to complete its task.''  My colleagues, particularly on the other side of the aisle, the majority side of the aisle, the Committee on Ways and Means leadership, the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer] and the gentlewoman from Connecticut [Mrs. Johnson] say we strongly encourage the Committee on Appropriations to delete the funding restrictions on TSM and allow responsibility for execution of problems by micromanaging the Department and using DOD as a procurement agent for all TSM contractors.  The fact of the matter is neither the Department of Defense nor the Committee on Ways and Means nor the Treasury Department nor IRS agree with that proposal.  Mr. Chairman, I disagree with the bill's restrictive TSM language, as does the Committee on Ways and Means. The IRS is not, Mr. Chairman, and never has been and probably never will be a popular agency. We all know that. but it has a job that must be done, and this bill does not provide the IRS with adequate tools to accomplish its mission. It is a pyrrhic position, I believe, to stand and say we want to cut the deficit, cut spending, but to cut IRS spending to the extent that the deficit will be made higher.  Now, Mr. Chairman, in conclusion, moving on to the Postal Service, I am disappointed we are not fulfilling our agreement with the U.S. Postal Service which we agreed to some years ago and fully funding what we owe them. Now, it is a very small portion of the postal budget, but we ought to meet our own responsibilities. We are not doing it in this bill.  Finally, Mr. Chairman, this bill unduly restricts the operations of our newly invigorated office of National Drug Control Policy. I know my friend, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hastert], has discussed this with the chairman and will be speaking to this issue.  The President has appointed, in my opinion, a true leader in Gen. Barry McCaffrey. Here is a man who began his distinguished career as a 17-year-old cadet at West Point and retired from active duty as the most highly decorated officer and the youngest four-star general in the U.S. Army. Most recently he was the commander in chief of the U.S. military's Southern Command, from which a lot of our drugs come, where he saw firsthand the efforts of all U.S. agencies involved in counternarcotics.  As President Clinton said when he announced General McCaffrey's nomination, ``I am asking that he lead our Nation's battle against drugs at home and abroad.'' To succeed, Mr. Chairman, he needs a force far larger than he has ever commanded before. He needs all of us. Every one of us has to play a role.  I believe we ought to give General McCaffrey the staff he needs and the opportunity to lead this Nation in our battle against drugs.  The good news is I understand that we are going to be doing that and I will certainly support that.  The bill before us demonstrates the continuing balance between personal and governmental responsibility. Yes, we each must pay taxes to the IRS, but, in turn, we expect good service and timely refund checks. The committee's bill cuts so much from IRS that I question whether or not the IRS can meet its basic responsibility as does the gentleman from Texas, Chairman Archer.  On a much more macro level, every American must be involved in stopping gang violence, ending illegal drug use, and halting the burning of churches, black and white. Yet this bill reminds us that Government can and does play a role in many of these important fights. Those that choose to level criticism on the Government and on those they call bureaucrats ought to review the important work and incredible accomplishments of the men and women that work at the Department of the Treasury and other agencies included in this bill.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
