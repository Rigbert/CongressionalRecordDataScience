 President, I say to my good friend from Oregon, there were 4 days of hearings on the bill in committee with the committee report sent out at least 2 weeks ago. I am totally confident our friends on the other side are fully familiar with almost all aspects of this. He will certainly have an opportunity to read the final version, but he is very familiar with the various parts of this.
