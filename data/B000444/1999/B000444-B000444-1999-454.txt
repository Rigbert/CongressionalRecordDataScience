 President, I rise today to recognize a man who has been a pillar of loyalty, integrity and continuity in Delaware's U.S. Attorney's office for the past 15 years.  We all know men and women who are the pillars of federal government offices--people who keep the wheels of government turning as changes occur around them. Richard G. Andrews is that pillar who keeps Delaware's U.S. Attorney's Office standing tall and strong. I respect his legal talents, professionalism, work ethic and people skills. And I recognize this dedicated public servant today, not because he's retiring--fortunately he's still working as hard as ever--but simply because he deserves the recognition.  As an Assistant U.S. Attorney since 1983, and Chief of the Criminal Division for the past five years, Rich has earned a reputation as a tough, fair prosecutor in the nearly 40 felony jury cases he has tried. He was involved with the most far-reaching FBI undercover sting operation in Delaware history that sent several top State and County officials to prison for bribery convictions. He also sent the Vice President of the Pagan Motorcycle Club to jail for 25 years for running a drug distribution ring. And he prosecuted the men convicted of bilking the federal government and taxpayers out of nearly half-a-million dollars in a student loan scam.  Rich Andrews started his legal career learning from the best--he was law clerk to the late U.S. Court of Appeals Judge for the Third Circuit, Chief Judge Collins J. Seitz.  It's no wonder that distinguished experience marked the beginning of many more honors to come. In 1996, FBI Director Louis Freeh issued a commendation to him for the convictions of three top officials of Madison & Co. in $1 million securities fraud case. In 1993, he was commended for prosecuting ocean dumpers off the Delaware coast.  Rich continues to pass on his craft to young attorneys, teaching Criminal Trial Advocacy courses. And he goes the extra mile for victims, serving as Chairman of Delaware's Criminal Justice Council's Victims' Subcommittee.  Delaware and our country's U.S. Department of Justice are better for the continued service of Rich Andrews. He is an honest, down-to-earth, tough prosecutor and dedicated public servant. It is my pleasure to recognize this second-in-command as he continues to serve as the Chief Criminal prosecutorfor Delaware's U.S. Attorney's Office. It's a simple thank you for a job well done.                          ____________________
