Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I was in the Cloakroom when I heard him reference my previous 1-minute, which, of course, was in response to a line of new Members on the gentleman's side of the aisle getting up and pounding their chest about the balanced-budget amendment and how irresponsible the previous 40 years of Democratic leadership in the Congress had been. I think it is appropriate, as the gentleman says, that the American people have the facts and have the truth.  First, let me say to my friend--and I mean that sincerely; Mr. Weldon and I are close friends; we work closely together on a number of issues--that I think my portrayal was accurate.  First, I would ask my friend if he knows that the President--forget about continuing resolutions, forget about the actions of the House, forget about the actions of the Senate--if my friend is aware of the fact that in the budgets that Presidents Reagan and Bush transmitted to Congress their administrations wrote, untouched by Democrats, and asked for more spending than the Congress appropriated. Is my friend aware of that?
