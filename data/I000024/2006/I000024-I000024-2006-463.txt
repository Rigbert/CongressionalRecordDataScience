President, first of all, I thank the minority leader for that quick response to my request. I know we are all anxious to get as many amendments up and taken care of as possible.  I know we cannot do this until probably tomorrow sometime, and it is our understanding there is now a unanimous consent for Senators Kyl, Obama, Sessions, a Democrat, and then me. With that, if no others want to be heard on the amendments, I would like to visit about the amendment we will take up tomorrow.
