 President, I rise today to speak on an amendment I have filed regarding the Air Force's KC-135 Tanker Replacement Program.  Like my colleagues in the Senate, one of my top priorities is to keep our Nation safe. I am working to ensure that our servicemembers have the best equipment possible.  Our Air Force has a fleet of aging refueling tankers that are currently experiencing problems. I simply do not believe we can wait 35 years to replace them.  While I understand the fiscal constraints the Defense Subcommittee was under, I believe that the KC-X, the airframe that will replace our nearly 40-year-old fleet of KC-135 tankers, is vital to our national security and to the success of our servicemembers fighting abroad.  This acquisition effort is likely one of the most important ones we will execute for many years to come. Whether the objective is to respond to military aggression or to provide humanitarian relief, the combination of distance and time can pose a significant challenge. When we need to respond quickly and in force, tankers allow us to project globally.  With our current military commitments abroad, our national security has become dependent upon the tanker force. It is the way we deter, deploy, and fight. We cannot achieve our decisive range capabilities without the air refuelers.  The Air Force's current schedule is to award a contract for the new KC-X aircraft in 2007. However, that award could be indefinitely postponed if funding is not restored in the 2007 Defense appropriations bill.  While I have filed an amendment, I do not plan to call it up because, as a member of the Appropriations Defense Subcommittee, I understand the problem between the authorizers and the appropriators who may be receiving different information regarding the necessity for funding in fiscal year 2007. I have a letter from the Air Force Deputy for Budget, dated August 2, 2006, stating that the Air Force needs a minimum of $70 million in research and development, test and evaluation funds for the year 2007, in addition to the funds remaining in the tanker transfer fund. I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Department of the Air Force,                                   Washington, DC, August 2, 2006.     Hon. Richard Shelby,     Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Shelby: On behalf of the Secretary of the Air      Force, thank you for your inquiry on the Air Force's tanker      replacement program (KC-X). The KC-X budget request for RDT&E      in fiscal year 2007 was $203.9M. However, the submitted      budget did not account for the full extent of the program      pause, which started in September 2005 to allow for      additional analysis and review. In April 2006, the SECAF took      the program off pause and traditional program activities      resumed.       To properly re-phase the program to account for the delay,      with contract award scheduled for August 2007, the Air Force      needs a minimum of $70M in RDT&E funds for fiscal year 2007.      This is in addition to the funds remaining in the Tanker      Transfer fund. These funds are needed to allow the program      office to obligate commercial long lead items for four test      aircraft and engines, as well as mitigate the risk associated      with the competition, since there is a wide variance between      the levels of effort required and the cost of potential      airframes among the various competitors.       To answer your specific funding questions, we provide the      following table:                                              [Dollars in millions]----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                               Proposed for                                        RDT&E funding          Issued         reprogramming        Remaining----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Tanker Transfer Fund................               $100              $10.2  .................              $89.8FY06................................               97.9               19.7               78.2                  0FY07................................              203.9                  0                  0                  0                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  Total.............................              401.8               29.9               78.2               89.8----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------* Requested in FY07PB, subject to enactment.       We agree that recapitalizing our aging tanker fleet is      vital to our national security and appreciate your support in      moving this program forward.           Sincerely,                                         Patricia J. Zarodkiewicz,                                                Deputy for Budget.
