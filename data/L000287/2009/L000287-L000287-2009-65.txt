Thank you for yielding again.  We have not had any discussion about benchmarks in the bill. We will wait to hear from the Chair of the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey, and his members.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank the gentleman.  Knowing the debate that we had a week ago with all of the hearings in Energy and Commerce and knowing what the schedule said that this week would be the markup of the cap-and-trade bill but this week being canceled in the markup, does the gentleman see Energy and Commerce bringing up cap-and-trade or that coming to the floor within the next 3 weeks before we go on recess?  I yield to the gentleman from Georgia.
