Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would simply conclude our side of the debate, Mr. Chairman, by indicating that I respect the gentleman from New Jersey and those who have spoken on his side very much, both in terms of their intelligence, their passion on the issue, and their commitment for their constituents. I happen, in this instance, however, to seriously disagree with them. I believe that we have an authorized program, the procedures and laws of this country have been followed; and I do think that we ought to proceed. I do oppose the Andrews amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
