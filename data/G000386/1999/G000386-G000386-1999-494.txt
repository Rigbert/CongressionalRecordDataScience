 President, today I am introducing legislation to expand the tax deduction for student loan interest. Senators Baucus, Jeffords, Collins, Cochran and Abraham are joining me in introducing this legislation.  Under the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the tax deduction for student loan interest was eliminated. This action, done in the name of fiscal responsibility, blatantly disregarded the duty we have to the education of our nation's students. This struck me and many of my colleagues as wrong. Since 1987, I have spearheaded the bipartisan effort to reinstate the tax deduction for student loan interest. In 1992, we succeeded in passing the legislation to reinstate the deduction, only to have it vetoed as part of a larger bill with tax increases. Finally, after ten long years, our determination and perseverance paid off. Under the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, we succeeded in reinstating the deduction. In our success, we sent a clear message to students and their families across the country that the Congress of the United States understands the financial hardships they face, and that we are willing to assist them in easing those hardships so they can receive the education they need.  In 1997 we took steps in the right direction, and did what had to be done. Regrettably, due to fiscal constraints, we were not able to go as far as we wanted to go. The nation was still in a fiscal crisis at that time. In order to control costs, we were forced to limit the deductibility of student loan interest to only sixty loan payments, which is equivalent to five years plus time spent in forbearance or deferment.  This restriction hurts some of the most needy borrowers. Many of these borrowers are students who, due to limited means, have borrowed most heavily. The restriction discriminates against those who have the highest debt loads and lowest incomes. It makes the American dream harder to achieve for those struggling to pull themselves up--for those who started with less. It is unjust.  Today, our situation is vastly different. In these times of economic vitality and budget surplus, we have a responsibility to do what we were unable to do before. Student debt is rising to alarming levels, and additional relief must be provided. We must eliminate the sixty month restriction on the deductibility of student loan interest and show that the United States Congress stands behind all of our nation's students in their endeavors to better themselves.  Eliminating the sixty payment restriction will bring needed relief to some of the most deserving borrowers. The restriction weighs heavily on those who, despite lower pay, have decided to dedicate themselves to a career in public service. We will be rewarding civic virtue as we provide relief to these admirable citizens.  Additionally, eliminating this restriction will eliminate difficult and costly reporting requirements that are currently required for both borrowers and lenders. In supporting our nation's students, we will also be cutting costly bureaucracy.  Currently, to claim the deduction, the taxpayer must have an adjusted gross income of $40,000 or less, or $60,000 for married couples. The amount of the deduction is gradually phased out for those with incomes between $40,000 and $55,000, or $60,000 and $75,000 for married couples. Additionally, the deduction itself was phased in at $1000, and will cap out at $2500 in 2002.  Many in our country are suffering from excessive student debt. More can and must be done to help them. In this time of economic plenty, it is our duty to invest in our students' education. Doing so is an investment in America's future. To maintain competitiveness in the global marketplace, America must have a well-educated workforce. By eliminating the sixty payment restriction on the deductibility of student loan interest we recommit ourselves to education and to maintaining the position of this country at the pinnacle of the free world.  The administration supports this direction as well. In his 2000 budget, President Clinton has proposed to eliminate the sixty payment restriction on the deductibility of student loan interest, starting after 1999. Our legislation takes a more fair and inclusive approach by including payments between 1997 and 1999, which the administration leaves out.  I urge members to join us in this effort to relieve the excessive burdens on those trying to better themselves and their families through education by expanding the tax deduction for student loan interest payments.                                 ______                                       By
