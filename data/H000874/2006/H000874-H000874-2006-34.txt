BOEHNER. I would expect that we would have votes all that week, including the 17th. But once you get beyond there, it really is unclear as to when we will be back. I have been working with the Senate leadership trying to come to some understanding. We have not come to any agreement or understanding. But I can say this. If we cannot complete our work by Thanksgiving, which in my view is doubtful, that the House would be off the week of Thanksgiving and the following week and would come back the week of December 4 for a week or two to finish our business.  I think that is the most realistic schedule that I see. Is it firm? Nowhere close. But in terms of trying to be helpful to Members as they plan, that is as helpful as I can be with the knowledge that I have today.
