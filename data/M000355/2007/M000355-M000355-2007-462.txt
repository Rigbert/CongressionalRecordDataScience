 President, I especially want to commend, once again, as I did at the outset of my remarks, my good friend from the neighboring State of Tennessee, Senator Alexander, for his extraordinary leadership in building the case for this legislation, helping to craft its various components, and shepherding it through each stage of the process to this point.  It was Senator Alexander who, 2 years ago, along with Senator Bingaman, asked the National Academy of Sciences the question that led to their recommendations, and sparked this entire process.
