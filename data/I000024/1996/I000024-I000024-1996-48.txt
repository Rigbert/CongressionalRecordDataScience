President, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues for including language in last year's report that accompanied the VA, HUD, and independent agencies appropriations bill, encouraging the ground-water quality and remediation procedure research at the Kerr Environmental Research Laboratory in Ada, OK. I would like to particularly thank Subcommittee Chairman Bond and ranking member Senator Mikulski. I would also like to thank my colleagues for including the reauthorization of the Kerr Laboratory and University Consortium in the Senate-passed Safe Drinking Water Act. The Kerr Environmental Research Laboratory is a vital component of our country's environmental research. The laboratory is the premier ground water research facility in the United States and the world. The work accomplished atthis facility is vital to both the Drinking Water and Superfund programs.
