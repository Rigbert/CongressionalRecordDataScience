Speaker, it has been reported that JPMorgan Chase has agreed to a $13 billion settlement of the civil suit filed by the United States Department of Justice and the Federal Housing Finance Agency in order to resolve several investigations into their mortgage securities finagling. JPMorgan and it affiliates knowingly misrepresented the value and quality of the mortgage bonds that it sold to the housing finance agency. Compared to the trillions that Wall Street banks have extracted in home equity from the American people, a $13 billion settlement with JPMorgan Chase doesn't come close to repaying the American people what they are owed back. More cases need to be filed to mete out justice and recoup what has been wrongly taken.  Of the $13 billion settlement, $4 billion will be for the Federal Housing Finance Agency which will go to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. How that filters down to the street, to the ordinary homeowner, we can't predict. Two billion will be credited through JPMorgan's reduction of principal on mortgages in areas hardest hit by foreclosures like Detroit and cities like Cleveland and Toledo in Ohio.  JPMorgan Chase currently holds--get this--nearly 1 million mortgages: 208,000 mortgages considered seriously delinquent and an excess of 700,000 which are underwater. That's too much power over our marketplace in too few hands.  Five hundred million of the settlement will be credited for the removal of blight from neighborhoods through demolition, reducing interest rates, and offering new loans to low-income borrowers. My goodness, every community in America could use some of that. That's very little money for a very big hole.  This settlement may appear like a big step. It's a small step in the right direction. However, let me put these figures on the record. Last year, JPMorgan Chase made $21.3 billion in profits--and that doesn't count what's in their reserves. A settlement of $13 billion therefore is barely half of what JPMorgan made in all of last year after expenses. In fact, this settlement of $13 billion is equal to exactly half of what they had already set aside, $26 billion, for legal fees since 2010. By the way, they make their money by charging all of us high fees, or paying us nothing on our savings accounts and certificates of deposit.  Moreover, the settlement will also be largely tax deductible for the bank, as well. Although the tax law does not allow fines or penalties paid to the Federal Government to be tax deductible, that only accounts for $2 billion of the settlement that the bank has to pay in civil penalties to settle their legal claims. That leaves $7 billion in compensatory damages that the bank could claim, for guess what? In tax deductibles. Imagine that. This greatly reduces the impact this settlement has on correcting their bad behavior and mitigating the damages it has to pay in the lawsuit. Imagine if homeowners were allowed to deduct the damages they have incurred as a result of Wall Street's misbehavior. Now, there's an idea.  Here are some figures to ponder: Over the last couple years, the CEO of JPMorgan has taken home anywhere from $23 million plus bonuses, plus stock options, on an annual basis. Mary Erdoes, the CEO of their asset management division, last year it was reported was paid $15 million plus $5 million in bonuses--bonuses. This is before they have settled all of these mortgages that they hold belonging to the American people.  Matthew Zames, their co-chief CEO, $17 million plus $6 million in bonuses, and Daniel Pinto $17 million in salary alone plus $8 million in bonuses, not counting all their stock options, cars, you know, all those things that they're given in their privileged positions.  The American people are really sick of this. They really want justice. We need more legal cases filed, and Congress should reinstate the Glass-Steagall Act by passing H.R. 129, the Return to Prudent Banking Act of 2013. This will end what caused the financial crisis--too much power in too few hands, and the power to create money irresponsibly. Our country should never again have to endure this kind of collapse because of the mistakes that they made.  Mr. Speaker, I think it's time for community after community to replicate those legal cases that have been successful in extracting repayment to communities and to harmed families across our country.                              {time}  1030  Our U.S. Attorney, our housing organizations across this country, those Attorneys General who are awake in our 50 States, we need to go after the source, the source that created the collapse that our communities are still suffering from. They must be held accountable for the mortgages they still hold, and recoup for millions and millions of our people the home equity that was taken from them so cruelly.                          ____________________
