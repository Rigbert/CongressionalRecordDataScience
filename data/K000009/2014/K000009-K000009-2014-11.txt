Thank you for the respect you show them and for the amount of time that you devote to Make It In America and toward manufacturing in America. Thank you so very, very much.  Mr. Speaker, we have marvelous leaders who have joined us tonight from across the country, obviously, from our sister State of Minnesota, a Great Lakes State that has received its fair share of battering over the years, and a great, great Member, Keith Ellison, the leader in our Progressive Caucus, as well as, obviously, a leader in the Minnesota delegation.  Thank you so very much for being with us this evening.  I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).
