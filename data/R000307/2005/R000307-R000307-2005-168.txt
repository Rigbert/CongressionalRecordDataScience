President, I am pleased and honored today to introduce the ``Caring for Children Act''--a bill designed to help meet the child care challenges facing families, child care providers and small businesses around the Nation.  Child care, in the home when possible and outside the home when both parents work, goes right to the heart of keeping families strong. Unfortunately, finding quality, affordable child care is one of the most pressing problems for families in Kansas and around the country. It is estimated that quality child care can cost as much or more than college tuition in some areas.  The ``Caring for Children Act'' takes the first steps in addressing this challenge through a responsible approach. This legislation expands child care opportunities without unnecessary government intervention or mandates. This legislation will help working families who want quality child care for their children, child care providers who aim to provide the highest quality of care, and small businesses who currently may not have the resources to provide child care for their employees.  The ``Caring for Children Act'' recognizes that small businesses play a critical role in providing child care options to millions of working parents. Unfortunately, small businesses generally do not have the resources required to start up and support a child care center. This legislation includes a short-term, flexible grant program to encourage small businesses to work together or with established local child care organizations to provide child care services for employees. This program is more of a demonstration project that will sunset at the end of five years. In the meantime, small businesses will be eligible for grants up to $250,000 for start-up costs, training, scholarships, or other related activities. Businesses, however, will be required to match Federal funds to encourage self-sustaining facilities well into the future. Business must continue to meet State quality and health standards. In essence, this grant program takes the necessary steps to ensuring small businesses and other local organizations are able to work together to provide child care for employees.  The ``Caring for Children Act'' also addresses another key component of quality child care: child care training. My bill creates a new grant program to allow organizations to develop and operate distance learning child care training infrastructures and to develop model technology-based training courses for child care providers. These infrastructures and courses will enable child care providers to receive the training, education and support they need to improve the quality of child care. The ``Caring for Children Act'' encourages grantees to work with secondary schools, institutions of higher education, state and local governments, and child care organizations to promote networking, information sharing, and resource sharing. These grants will be targeted to those areas with the fewest training opportunities for child care providers.  Child care is an issue that impacts each and every one of us. While parents continue to struggle to meet the constant demand of work and family, we must continue to do our part to expand child care options and protect our nation's most valuable resource, our children. I look forward to working with all of my colleagues in this important effort.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 233       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
