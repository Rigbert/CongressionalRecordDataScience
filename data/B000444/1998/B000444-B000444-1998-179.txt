 President, I will be necessarily brief because I have over the years learned to count, and I do not believe I have the votes for this amendment, but I want to make two relatively brief points.  First of all, in 1970, the Congress greatly assisted the fight against organized crime by adopting the Racketeering Influence and Corruption Organizations Act. We know it as RICO.  RICO included a private civil enforcement provision with enhanced penalties, including triple damages for racketeering behavior in furtherance of a criminal enterprise engaged in certain, what they call predicate offenses, including murder, arson, bribery, wire fraud, bankruptcy fraud, and securities fraud--securities fraud.  At the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the industry, though against the wishes of law enforcement and State regulators, in 1995, the Securities Litigation Act effectively eliminated securities fraud as a grounds for private civil RICO proceedings. Many of us disagreed with carving out the securities fraud for special status, Mr. President, and protection from application of the civil RICO statute. In fact, my amendment was intended to preserve many civil RICO securities fraud claims and was accepted last time by the full Senate. Unfortunately, it was dropped in committee.  Last November, the Federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted 19 individuals, including two reputed mob chieftains known as ``Rossi'' and ``Curly,'' for their role in the alleged plot to manipulate a thinly traded stock, so-called penny stocks, and for threatening brokers to drive up the prices.  There is an article that was published that says ``The Mob on Wall Street.'' I ask unanimous consent that an except from this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the excerpt was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From Business Week, Dec. 16, 1996]                         The Mob on Wall Street                            (By Gary Weiss)       In the world of multimedia, Phoenix-based SC      International Inc. has carved out a small but significant      niche. SC's products have won raves in the trade press, but      working capital has not always been easy to come by. So in      December, 1995, the company brought in Sovereign Equity      Management Corp., a Boca Raton (Fla.) brokerage, to manage an      initial public offering. ``We thought they were a solid      second- or third-tier investment bank,'' says SC Chief      Executive James L. Copeland.       But there was much about Sovereign that was known to only a      very few. There were, for example, the early investors,      introduced by Sovereign, who had provided inventory financing      for SC Most shared the same post office box in the      Bahamas. ``I had absolutely no idea of who those people      were,'' says Copeland. He asked Sovereign. ``I was told, `Who      gives a s--. It's clean money.' '' The early investors cashed      out, at the offering price of $5, some 1,575 million shares      that they acquired at about $1.33 share--a gain of some $5.8      million.       By mid-June, SC was trading at $8 or better. But for SC      shareholders who did not sell by then, the stock was an      unmitigated disaster. Sovereign, which had handled over 60%      of SC's trades early in the year, sharply reduced its      support of the stock. Without the backing of Sovereign and      its 75-odd brokers, SC's shares plummeted--to $2 in July,      $1 in September, and lately, pennies. The company's capital-     raising ability is in tatters. Laments Copeland: ``We're in      the crapper.''       A routine case of a hot stock that went frigid. Or was it?      Copeland didn't know it, but there was a man who kept a very      close     eye on SC and is alleged by Wall Street sources to have      profited handsomely in the IPO--allegedly by being one of the      lucky few who sold shares through a Bahamian shell company.      His name is Philip Abramo, and he has been identified in      court documents as a ranking member, or capo, in the New      Jersey-based DeCavalcante organized crime family.       James Copeland didn't know it. Nobody at SC could have      dreamed it. But the almost unimaginable had come true:      Copeland had put his company in the hands of the Mob.       Today, the stock market is confronting a vexing problem      that, so far, the industry and regulators have seemed      reluctant to face--or even acknowledge. Call it what you      will: organized crime, the Mafia, wiseguys. They are the      stuff of tabloids and gangster movies. To most investors,      they would seem to have as much to do with Wall Street as the      other side of the moon.       But in the canyons of lower Manhattan, one can find members      of organized crime, their friends and associates. How large a      presence? No one--least of all regulators and law      enforcement--seems to know. The Street's ranking reputed      underworld chieftain, Abramo, is described by sources      familiar with his activities as controlling at least four      brokerages through front men and exerting influence upon      still more firms. Until recently Abramo had an office in the      heart of the financial district, around the corner from the      regional office of an organization that might just as well be      on Venus as far as the Mob is concerned--the National      Association of Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory      organization that oversees the small-stock business.       A three-month investigation by Business Week reveals that      substantial elements of the small-cap market have been turned      into a veritable Mob franchise, under the very noses of      regulators and law enforcement. And that is a daunting      prospect for every investor who buys small-cap stocks and      every small company whose stock trades on the NASDAQ market      and over the counter. For the Mob makes money in various      ways, ranging from exploiting IPOs to extortion to getting a      ``piece of the action'' from traders and brokerage firms. But      its chief means of livelihood is ripping off investors by the      time-tested method of driving share prices upward--and      dumping them on the public through aggressive cold-calling.       In its inquiry, Business Week reviewed a mountain of      documentation and interviewed traders, brokerage executives,      investors, regulators, law-enforcement officials, and      prosecutors. It also interviewed present and former      associates of the Wall Street Mob contingent. Virtually all      spoke on condition of anonymity, with several Street sources      fearing severe physical harm--even death--if their identities      became known. One, a former broker at a Mob-run brokerage,      says he discussed entering the federal Witness Protection      Program after hearing that his life might be in danger. A      short-seller in the Southwest, alarmed by threats, carries a      gun.       Among Business Week's findings:       The Mob has established a network of stock promoters,      securities dealers, and the all-important ``boiler rooms''--a      crucial part of Mob manipulation schemes--that sell stocks      nationwide through hard-sell cold-calling. The brokerages are      located mainly in the New York area and in Florida, with the      heart of their operations in the vicinity of lower Broad      Street in downtown Manhattan.       Four organized crime families as well as elements of the      Russian Mob directly own or control, through front men,      perhaps two dozen brokerage firms that make markets in      hundreds of stocks. Other securities dealers and traders are      believed to pay extortion money or ``tribute'' to the Mob as      just another cost of doing business on the Street.       Traders and brokers have been subjected in recent months to      increasing levels of violent ``persuasion'' and punishment--     threats and beatings. Among the firms that have been subject      to Mob intimidation, sources say, is the premier market maker      in NASDAQ stocks--Herzog, Heine, Gedule Inc.       Using offshore accounts in the Bahamas and elsewhere, the      Mob has engineered lucrative schemes involving low-priced      stock under Regulations S of the securities laws. Organized      crime members profit from the runup in such stocks and also      from short-selling the stocks on the way down. They also take      advantage of the very wide spreads between the bid and ask      prices of the stock issues controlled by their confederates.       The Mob's activities seem confined almost exclusively to      stocks traded in the over-the-counter ``bulletin board'' and      NASDAQ small-cap markets. By contrast, New York Stock      Exchange and American Stock Exchange issues and firms      apparently have been free of Mob exploitation.       Wall Street has become as lucrative for the Mob that it is      allegedly a major source of income for high-level members of      organized crime--few of whom have ever been publicly      identified as having ties to the Street. Abramo, who may well      be the most active reputed mobster on the Street, has      remained completely out of the public eye--even staying      active on the Street after his recent conviction for tax      evasion.       Mob-related activities on the Street are the subject of      inquiries by the FBI and the office of Manhattan District      Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau, which is described by one      source as having received numerous complaints concerning      mobsters on the Street. (Officials at both agencies and the      New York Police Dept. did not respond to repeated requests      for comment.)       Overall, the response of regulators and law enforcement to      Mob penetration of Wall Street has been mixed at best. Market      sources say complaints of Mob coercion have often been      ignored by law enforcement. Although an NASD spokesman says      the agency would vigorously pursue reports of Mob      infiltration, two top NASD officials told Business Week that      they have no knowledge of Mob penetration of member firms.      Asked to discuss such allegations, another high NASD official      declined, saying: ``I'd rather you not tell me about it.''       The Hanover, Sterling & Co. penny-stock firm, which left      12,000 investors in the lurch when it went out of business in      early 1995, is alleged by people close to the firm to have      been under the control of members of the Genovese organized      crime family. Sources say other Mob factions engaged in      aggressive short-selling of stocks brought public by Hanover.       Federal investigators are said to be probing extortion      attempts by Mob-linked short-sellers who had been associated      with the now-defunct Stratton Oakmont penny-stock firm.       Mob manipulation has affected the markets in a wide range      of stocks. Among those identified by Business Week are      Affinity Entertainment, Celebrity Entertainment, Beachport      Entertainment, Crystal Broadcasting, First Colonial Ventures,      Global Spill Management, Hollywood Productions, Innovative      Medical Services, International Nursing Services, Novatek      International, Osicom Technologies, ReClaim, SC, Solv-Ex,      and TJT. Officials of the companies deny any knowledge of Mob      involvement in the trading of their stocks, and there is no      evidence that company managements have been in league with      stock manipulators. These stocks were allegedly run up by      Mob-linked brokers, who sometimes used force or threats to      curtail short-selling in the stocks. When support by      allegedly Mob-linked brokerages ended, the stocks often      suffered precipitous declines--sometimes abetted, traders      say, by Mob-linked short-sellers. The stocks have generally      fared poorly (table, page 99).       Not all of the stocks were recent IPOs, and they were often      taken public by perfectly legitimate underwriters.      International Nursing, for example, went public at $23 in      1994 and was trading at $8 in early 1996 before falling back      to pennies. Short-sellers who attempted to sell the shares      earlier this year were warned off--in one instance by a Mob      member--market sources assert. International Nursing Chairman      John Yeros denies knowledge of manipulation of the stock.       What this all adds up to is a shocking tale of criminal      infiltration abetted by widespread fear and silence--and      official inaction. While firms and brokerage executives who      strive to keep far afield of the Mob often complain of NASD      inaction, rarely do such people feel strongly enough to share      their views with regulators or law enforcement. Instead, they      engage in self-defense. One major brokerage, which often      executes trades for small-cap market makers, keeps mammoth      intelligence files--to steer clear of Mob-run brokers. A      major accounting firm keeps an organized-crime expert on the      payroll. His duties include preventing his firm from doing      business with brokerages linked to organized crime and the      Russian Mob.
