President, last year, when Senator McConnell and I included language in the fiscal year 2001 Foreign Operations bill to condition United States assistance in Serbia on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia's cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal, we could not predict what the effect of our provision would be. While we both wanted to support democracy and economic reconstruction in Serbia, we also felt strongly that if Serbia's leaders wanted our assistance they should fulfill their international responsibility to apprehend and surrender indicted war criminals to The Hague.  I am very grateful for the way Senator McConnell and his staff have worked closely with me and my staff on this. It has been a classic case of how conditioning our assistance and working together, with the Administration, can achieve a result that significantly advances the cause of international justice. Milosevic's transfer to the War Crimes Tribunal should bring hope to millions of people throughout the former Yugoslavia.  Above all, as Senator McConnell has already noted, we should congratulate Prime Minister Djindjic and other Serb leaders who have risked their lives and their careers for their country's future. It is a legacy that few people in history can claim. Those who have criticized Prime Minister Djindjic for surrendering Milosevic should be aware that for the United States there is no alternative. We will not support a Serb Government that does not cooperate with the War Crimes Tribunal. We expect the apprehension and transfer to The Hague of the other publicly indicted war criminals who remain at large in Serb territory, and the release of the remaining political prisoners in Serbia's jails.  I also want to recognize the Serb people who suffered terribly under Milosevic's disastrous policies, and who increasingly saw that in order to rebuild their country and establish democracy and the rule of law on a solid footing, it was necessary to bring to justice the people who devastated the former Yugoslavia in their names. We submit this resolution on their behalf, and on behalf of Milosevic's other victims, dead and alive, in Kosovo, Bosnia, and Croatia.                          ____________________
