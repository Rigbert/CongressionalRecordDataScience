Chairman, the money is authorized. The point of order does not lie against the first sentence. In fact, I have raised the point of order as to the proviso that is added, starting with page 28, line 2 through line 11. I would oppose the point of order as it relates to the first part of that provision because a point of order does not lie against it.
