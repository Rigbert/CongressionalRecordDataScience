 President, I rise to introduce legislation to correct a longstanding flaw in the Medicare Geographic Practice Cost Index, GPCI, system that negatively impacts physicians in California and several other states.  This legislation will base California physician payments on Metropolitan Statistical Areas, MSAs. Hospital payments are developed this way, and it makes sense to pay our doctors in the same manner.  It holds harmless the counties, predominately rural ones, whose locality average would otherwise drop as other counties are reclassified.  Congressman Sam Farr, along with several California colleagues, is introducing companion legislation.  The Medicare Geographic Practice Cost Index measures the cost of providing a Medicare covered service in a geographic area. Medicare payments are supposed to reflect the varying costs of rent, malpractice insurance, and other expenses necessary to operate a medical process. Counties are assigned to ``payment localities'' that are supposed to accurately capture these costs.  Here is the problem. Some of these payment localities have not changed since 1997. Others have been in place since 1966. Many areas that were rural even 10 years ago have experienced significant population growth, as metropolitan areas and suburbs have spread. Many counties now find themselves in payment localities that do not accurately reflect their true practice costs.  These payment discrepancies have a real and serious impact on physicians and the Medicare beneficiaries they are unable to serve. My home State of California has been hit particularly hard.  San Diego County physicians are underpaid by 4 percent. A number of physicians have left the county and 60 percent of remaining San Diego physicians report that they cannot recruit new doctors to their practices.  Santa Cruz County receives an 8.6 percent underpayment, and as a result, no physicians are accepting new Medicare patients. Instead, they are moving to neighboring Santa Clara, which has similar practice cost expense, but is reimbursed at a much higher rate. This means that seniors often need to travel at least 20 miles to see a physician.  Sacramento County, a major metropolitan area, is underpaid by 2.7 percent. The county's population has grown by 9.6 percent, while the number of physicians has declined by 11 percent.  Sonoma County physicians are paid at least 6.2 percent less than their geographic practice costs. They have experienced at 10 percent decline in specialists and a 9 percent decline in primary care physicians.  Health care coverage is not the same as access to health care. Seniors' Medicare cards are of no value if physicians in their community cannot afford to provide them with health care.  Physicians deserve to be fairly compensated for the work they perform. California doctors simply want to be compensated at the correct rate for the practice expenses they face.  This is not too much to ask.  The underpayment problem grows more severe every year, and the longer we wait to address it, the more drastic the solution will need to be. This legislation provides a common sense solution, increasing payment for those facing the most drastic underpayments, while protecting other counties from cuts in the process.  This is an issue of equity. It costs more to provide health care in expensive areas, and physicians serving our seniors must be fairly compensated.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1236       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``GPCI Justice Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) From 1966 through 1991, the Medicare program paid      physicians based on what they charged for services. The      Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1989 required the establishment      of a national Medicare physician fee schedule, which was      implemented in 1992, replacing the charge-based system.       (2) The Medicare physician fee schedule currently includes      more than 7000 services together with their corresponding      payment rates. In addition, each service on the fee schedule      has three relative value units (RVUs) that correspond to the      three physician payment components of physician work,      practice expense, and malpractice expense.       (3)(A) Each geographically adjusted RVU measures the      relative costliness of providing a particular service in a      particular location referred to as a locality. Physician      payment localities are primarily consolidations of the      carrier-defined localities that were established in 1966.       (B) When physician payment localities were redesignated in      1997, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &      Medicaid Services acknowledged that the new payment locality      configuration had not been established on a consistent      geographic basis. Some were based on zip codes or      Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) while others were based      on political boundaries, such as cities, counties, or States.       (C) The Medicare program has not revised the geographic      boundaries of the physician payment localities since the 1997      revision.       (4) Medicare's geographic adjustment for a particular      physician payment locality is determined using three GPCIs      (Geographic Practice Cost Indices) that also correspond to      the three Medicare physician payment components of physician      work, practice expense, and malpractice expense.       (5) The major data source used in calculating the GPCIs is      the decennial census which provides new data only once every      10 years.       (6) This system of geographic payment designation has      resulted in more than half of the current physician payment      localities having counties within them with a large payment      difference of 5 percent or more. A disproportionate number of      these underpaid counties are located in California, Georgia,      Minnesota, Ohio, and Virginia.       (7) For purposes of payment under the Medicare program,      hospitals are organized and reimbursed for geographic costs      according to MSAs.       (8) Studies by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission      (MedPAC) in 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO)      in 2007, the Urban Institute in 2008, and Acumen LLC in 2008      have all documented this physician GPCI payment discrepancy--     specifically that more than half of the current physician      payment localities had counties within them with a large      payment difference (that is, a payment difference of 5      percent or more) between GAO's measure of physicians' costs      and Medicare's geographic adjustment for an area. All these      objective studies have recommended changes to the locality      system to correct the payment discrepancies.       (9) A common recommendation among the GPCI payment      discrepancy studies referred to in paragraph (8) is to      eliminate the county-based locality and replace it with one      determined by Metropolitan Statistical Area.     SEC. 3. REDESIGNATING THE GEOGRAPHICAL PRACTICE COST INDEX                    (GPCI) LOCALITIES IN CALIFORNIA.       (a) In General.--Section 1848(e) of the Social Security Act      (42 U.S.C.1395w-4(e)) is amended by adding at the end the      following new paragraph:       ``(6) Transition to use of msas as fee schedule areas in      california.--       ``(A) In general.--       ``(i) Revision.--Subject to clause (ii) and notwithstanding      the previous provisions of this subsection, for services      furnished on or after January 1, 2010, the Secretary shall      revise the fee schedule areas used for payment under this      section applicable to the State of California using the      Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) iterative Geographic      Adjustment Factor methodology as follows:       ``(I) The Secretary shall configure the physician fee      schedule areas using the Core-Based Statistical Areas-     Metropolitan Statistical Areas (each in this paragraph      referred to as an `MSA'), as defined by the Director of the      Office of Management and Budget, as the basis for the fee      schedule areas. The Secretary shall employ an iterative      process to transition fee schedule areas. First, the      Secretary shall list all MSAs within the State by Geographic      Adjustment Factor described in paragraph (2) (in this      paragraph referred to as a `GAF') in descending order. In the      first iteration, the Secretary shall compare the GAF of the      highest cost MSA in the State to the weighted-average GAF of      the group of remaining MSAs in the State. If the ratio of the      GAF of the highest cost MSA to the weighted-average GAF of      the rest of State is 1.05 or greater then the highest cost      MSA becomes a separate fee schedule area.       ``(II) In the next iteration, the Secretary shall compare      the MSA of the second-highest GAF to the weighted-average GAF      of the group of remaining MSAs. If the ratio of the second-     highest MSA's GAF to the weighted-average of the remaining      lower cost MSAs is 1.05 or greater, the second-highest MSA      becomes a separate fee schedule area. The iterative process      continues until the ratio of the GAF of the highest-cost      remaining MSA to the weighted-average of the remaining lower-     cost MSAs is less than 1.05, and the remaining group of lower      cost MSAs form a single fee schedule area, If two MSAs have      identical GAFs, they shall be combined in the iterative      comparison.       ``(ii) Transition.--For services furnished on or after      January 1, 2010, in the State of California, after      calculating the work, practice expense, and malpractice      geographic indices described in clauses (i), (ii), and (iii)      of paragraph (1)(A) that would otherwise apply through      application of this paragraph, the Secretary shall increase      any such index to the county-based fee schedule area value on      December 31, 2009, if such index would otherwise be less than      the value on January 1, 2010.       ``(B) Subsequent revisions.--       ``(i) Periodic review and adjustments in fee schedule      areas.--Subsequent to the process outlined in paragraph      (1)(C), not less often than every three years, the Secretary      shall review and update the California Rest-of-State fee      schedule area using MSAs as defined by the Director of the      Office of Management and Budget and the iterative methodology      described in subparagraph (A)(i).       ``(ii) Link with geographic index data revision.--The      revision described in clause (i) shall be made effective      concurrently with the application of the periodic review of      the adjustment factors required under paragraph (1)(C) for      California for 2012 and subsequent periods. Upon request, the      Secretary shall make available to the public any county-level      or MSA derived data used to calculate the geographic practice      cost index.       ``(C) References to fee schedule areas.--Effective for      services furnished on or after January 1, 2010, for the State      of California, any reference in this section to a fee      schedule area shall be deemed a reference to an MSA in the      State.''.       (b) Conforming Amendment to Definition of Fee Schedule      Area.--Section 1848(j)(2) of the Social Security Act (42      U.S.C. 1395w(j)(2)) is amended by striking ``The term'' and      inserting ``Except as provided in subsection (e)(6)(C), the      term''.                                 ______                                       By
