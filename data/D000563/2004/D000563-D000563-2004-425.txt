I think that is the reason, I would say to my colleague, why once this bill is defeated--and I hope it is defeated--once it is defeated, we really have a responsibility here.  We come from different sides of the political spectrum. We are about as far apart as they come in this Chamber in terms of our political philosophy, but I think we both can see there has a been problem. The medical malpractice premiums in parts of your State and parts of my State have reached record high levels. These premiums are forcing my good doctors in Illinois to retire, move away to another State or to an area that is friendlier when it comes to the cost of the premiums. There is a denial of coverage. There is a denial of services to a lot of poor people in Texas, Illinois, and a lot of other States.  Shouldn't we come together instead of a take it or leave it bill that has never been referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee, never been the subject of a hearing, does not address issues of medical safety and other issues we can agree should be part of this conversation? Shouldn't we at the end of this debate on this bill sit down and honestly try, on a bipartisan basis, to find common ground and compromise that would serve the goal the Senator is suggesting, the greater good, to make sure these good doctors across America will be there when we need them?  I thank the Senator from Texas.
