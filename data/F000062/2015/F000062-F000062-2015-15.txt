 My thoughts are with the victims and their families. To experience such violence in a place dedicated to saving lives is unthinkable.  I would also like to thank the staff of the clinic in Colorado Springs--and all Planned Parenthood clinics across the country. The health care services you provide are invaluable. You help so many people, and you do it in the face of so many challenges. I am grateful for your bravery and your compassion.  Following last week's attack, the media reported that staff rushed to the clinic's safe room with their patients. Let me repeat: a health clinic with a safe room. That a clinic dedicated to helping women--many of whom have no other option for health care--needs a safe room is unbelievable.  I have been deeply troubled over the years by the toxic rhetoric targeted at Planned Parenthood--and this dangerous rhetoric has only increased in recent months. It sends a signal that using violence to intimidate health care professionals and shut down clinics is somehow acceptable.  Let me be clear: these actions are not acceptable. It is shameful and disgusting and should be universally condemned. I do believe there is a link between the poisonous rhetoric directed at these health care providers and the violence used against them.  And I hope all of my colleagues in Congress--and every public official around the country--thinks carefully about the effects their words can have.  An FBI intelligence assessment from September said, ``It is likely criminal or suspicious incidents will continue to be directed against reproductive health care providers, their staff and facilities.'' These incidents aren't new.  Over the last 40 years, there have been more than 200 arsons and bombings at women's health care clinics. Doctors and health care staff have been murdered. Since July, four Planned Parenthood facilities have been set on fire, including one in my home State of California. This type of violence is simply abhorrent.  And I strongly believe these aren't just attacks on Planned Parenthood and women's health; they are attacks on our way of life. This isn't what our country stands for.  The individuals who carry out these crimes have one goal: to terrorize doctors, nurses, and clinic staff; to make them quit their jobs; to force these health care clinics to close. They want to make it harder and harder for women to access reproductive health care and make their own health care choices.  In the wake of the Colorado Springs shooting, a former Planned Parenthood worker from Kansas shared some of her experiences. In the 3 years she worked at Planned Parenthood, there were four attempts to burn her clinic to the ground. Two cherry bombs were left at the door after hours. They exploded and forced the clinic to close temporarily. Windows were shot out on three occasions. And butyric acid--essentially a stink bomb--was put in the clinic's ventilation system numerous times. These aren't acts of political protest. These are serious crimes, and the perpetrators must be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.  Before I close, I would like to reiterate just how important Planned Parenthood is for our country. Planned Parenthood serves some of the most vulnerable women in our society. It cares for 2.7 million patients in the United States. Ninety-seven percent of Planned Parenthood services carried out by its 700 clinics involve basic health care.  This includes breast exams, cervical cancer screenings, testing for sexually transmitted diseases, and contraception. One in five women will use Planned Parenthood as their primary health care provider at some point in their lives. Nationwide, 80 percent of Planned Parenthood patients make less than $18,000 per year. And Planned Parenthood is often the only health care option for low-income women and women in rural communities.  Simply put, Planned Parenthood is vital for the women of this country. It is bad enough that some politicians want to limit women's health care options by defunding Planned Parenthood. It is even more inexcusable that violence is being used to achieve what my Republican colleagues have failed to do.  I stand with Planned Parenthood now more than ever. And I call for an end to the sickening campaign of violence against clinics nationwide. Thank you.                          ____________________
