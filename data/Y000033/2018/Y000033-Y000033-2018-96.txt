Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman. Again, I understand why the chairman is against this, but we have no cases where there has been any food hazards, food abuses, or anything like that. And I have to describe one thing to my colleagues.  I am 85 years old. I am an Alaska Native. I have lived in one of the villages up north. My diet has consisted of seal meat, seal oil, whale meat, whale oil, and berries. I am an older man. I am in a hospital in Anchorage, Alaska, or I am in a long-term care facility to take care of me, and they serve me, of all things, a chicken, or they will serve me some salty Spam.                              {time}  1715  That is not too bad by the way.       But things that will not make me well. And in my mind I      desire and my body craves what I have eaten during the      history of my life. And that keeps me weller. In fact, I      might be able to go home and be able to harvest those things      that I love.  This is all I am trying to do in facilities. This is a good amendment. I know there has been opposition from some of the Federal agencies: Oh, this is a safety issue. Keep in mind, this is an issue that takes care of that person who is receiving that food.  Mr. Chairman, I would urge a ``yes'' vote on this legislation. It should happen for those people, my Alaskan Natives. It is important.  Mr. Chairman, I don't have any other speakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).  The amendment was agreed to.     Amendment No. 15 Offered by Miss Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 15 printed in House Report 115-679.

The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 900, the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico (Miss Gonzalez-Colon) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Puerto Rico.  Miss GONZALEZ-COLON of Puerto Rico. Mr. Chairman, I spoke about the two amendments before, so I am going to be brief now in speaking about this amendment, not without thanking Chairman Conaway for helping us out to get this amendment through.  Amendment No. 15 will just request an update on the survey in the request of data for the island. This second amendment requests the Secretary of Agriculture to produce an update on the 2010 report previously generated by the Food and Nutrition Service Agency at the USDA. That report will indicate the percentage of households that will receive nutritional assistance and what the average monthly benefit to their household will be if Puerto Rico were treated equally under the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, SNAP. We don't receive that.  As approved in the 2014 farm bill, Puerto Rico's cash portion of the benefit obtained through the NAP program will gradually be reduced by 5 percent each year through 2021. Of course, that situation, that 5 percent reduction has been waived since last year by the administration because of the hurricane situation, but all NAP benefits would then be available through the electronic benefit transfer system, the EBT.  In view and in preparation for this, we are beginning to consider the transition to SNAP, if it is feasible or not, and I do think it is feasible. So we are looking forward to having a report that will allow us to know what kind of benefits my constituents will be receiving.  An updated study will allow us to have recent data to properly consider making this decision, along with the Government of Puerto Rico. My amendment will essentially seek better facts and better data on the nutritional benefits my constituents, the people of Puerto Rico, receive and depend on. For many families on the island, as you may know, this is the main source of nutritional assistance.  I am the only representative of the people of Puerto Rico here and in the Senate, and it is my responsibility to make sure we receive that kind of data. The last time was in 2010. We are in 2018 without an update of that report.  So we look forward to having the tools and information we need at hand to collaborate with State officials and the Federal Government to enable those families to continue to receive those kinds of services and the island to maintain a proper access to a quality diet and, therefore, a proper quality of life. Those decisions need to be made by updated facts and not subjected to guesswork by some officials.  I do believe that this amendment, as drafted, does not increase mandatory spending, so it will require just data. That is what we need.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR.
