Mr. Speaker, the Republican assault on education is nothing new. The gentleman from Georgia [Mr. Gingrich] and the radical Republican right have a plan to dismantle public education, abolish the Department of Education, cut the school lunch program, cut funding for safe and drug-free schools, for teacher training, for Head Start. To these attacks on our children, Democrats have said ``no.''  Now Republicans have a new scheme: Drain funding from public education and give it to a privileged few to attend private school. Reward the few and punish the many. That is the Republican plan. To that I say ``no'' and Democrats say ``no.'' Democrats believe in investing in education for all of our children, improving, reforming, and strengthening our public schools.  Mr. Speaker, 99 percent of our children attend public school. We need to work to improve our public schools. Stop attacks on public education, Mr. Speaker. Our children deserve better.                          ____________________
