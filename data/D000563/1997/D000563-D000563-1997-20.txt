President, our friend and former colleague in this body, Paul Simon, has always been a man of exceptional integrity who has demonstrated exemplary leadership on national issues. He continues to contribute to the national debate as the director of the Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale.  Paul recently authored the foreword for the Loyola University of Chicago Law Journal on the subject of ethics in law and politics. While the Senate continues to investigate and debate the conduct of our federally elected officials, Paul's foreword to this journal provides valuable insight about political ethics and the public trust which I would like to share with my colleagues.  I ask that Senator Simon's foreword be printed in the Record.  The forward follows:  [From the Loyola University of Chicago Law Journal, Volume 28, 1996]                  Foreword--Ethics in Law and Politics                        (By Senator Paul Simon)       Paul Simon was a Democratic member of the United States      Senate from the State of Illinois from 1985 to 1996. He has      also served as member of the United States House of      Representatives (1975-1984), Lieutenant Governor of Illinois      (1969-1972), member of the Illinois Senate (1963-1968), and      member of the Illinois House of Representatives (1955-1962).      In addition to his extensive years of service in the      political arena, Senator Simon is the author of numerous      works, including Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness (1965),      The Once and Future Democrats (1982), and The Glass House,      Politics, and Morality in the Nation's Capitol (1984).                            I. Introduction       I am pleased to introduce Loyola University of Chicago Law      Journal's special symposium issue on Legal Ethics. I may not      be the obvious choice for this honor since I am not a lawyer.      I am, however, the husband of an attorney and the father of      another; moreover, I work everyday with lawyers and have      drafted far more legislation than most attorneys in the      profession.       My years in state and federal politics have also provided      me with empathy for the legal profession. After all,      politicians and lawyers share at least one uneviable      distinction--they are both roundly criticized in America      today for their ethical shortcomings. The public's distrust      of lawyers and politicians can be traced to a common cause--     to a perception that both professions have failed to live up      to the full range of their responsibilities, and particularly      to a sense that both too often see their obligations in terms      of temporarily pleasing constitutents or clients and not      enough in terms of serving the national interest and the      public good. This pervasive attitude is harmful, not only to      the public standing of lawyers and politicians, but--more      importantly--to the well-being and moral strength of the      nation itself.                 ii. public trust and political ethics       For many years, I have warned of the increasing influence      of public opinion polls, focus groups, and political      consultants in Washington. Office-holders have become too      quick, when faced with issues of immense public importance,      to stick their finger to the wind to see which way the public      passions are blowing. It is easy to understand this      temptation. As a Senator, I know how appealing it is to do      the popular thing. Most elected officials enjoy their jobs.      We are treated with respect; we are listened to and      applauded; and we make decisions about matters which effect      the lives of thousands, if not millions, of people.      Naturally, we dislike casting votes that might jeopardize our      positions. And so political self-interest makes the office-     holder excessively sensitive to his constitutents' desires.       Certainly, the desire to please one's constituents is not a      bad thing in and of itself. Public accountability and      constituent service are a vital part of the democratic      process. But the legislator's duty is greater than simply      serving his or her constituents' immediate interests. A      representative also has an obligation, as James Madison      wrote, to ``refine and enlarge the public views,'' to use      independent judgment, and to serve the public good.\1\ Edmund      Burke declared, in his famous speech to the electors at      Bristol, that ``[y]our representative owes you, not his      industry only, but his judgment; and he betrays, instead of      serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.'' \2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------     Footnotes at end of article.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Burke sometimes spoke as if he believed elected officials      should concern themselves solely with the national interest      and not at all with local affairs.\3\ I certainly would not      go that far. Rather, I believe representatives have two      principal obligations--one to their constituents and one to      the broader public good. Fortunately, those obligations do      not generally conflict, and especially in matters of vital      national significance, they are often closely aligned.      Nonetheless, when they diverge, as they inevitably do at      times, conscientious politicians face an ethical dilemma--how      to balance the voice of their constituents with the call of      the conscience.       Representatives must resolve this tension as best as they      can. It is reasonable, in my opinion, for representatives to      defer to their constituents' desires when an issue is not      clear-cut and the stakes are not vital. But in fundamental      cases where justice is clear, politicians must have the      courage to vote their conscience. The lawmaker must recognize      this simple truth--that some things are more important than      being reelected.       The obligation to exercise independent judgment--rather      than to blindly follow public opinion--is strong in cases      affecting citizens marginalized by society, such as the poor      or minorities. These are people whom the general public is      prone to ignore; they are often powerless to defend      themselves in the ``court'' of public opinion. Frequently,      the legislator's independent sense of justice is all that      protects the underprivileged members of society from neglect      or isolation. If representatives are to be worthy of their      positions, they must have the courage to fight for the least      fortunate, even when doing so in unpopular.       The passage of the new welfare bill is only the most recent      and egregious illustration of Congress' increasing tendency      to choose expediency over principle. To be sure, the      political calculus in favor of the bill was clear. Welfare      has become a dirty word in America today. Proportionately few      welfare recipients vote, and the cases where welfare is      abused are highly publicized. President Clinton certainly      knew which way the political winds were blowing when he      signed the bill.       But ``ending welfare as we know it'' is not a noble goal.      ``Ending poverty as we know it'' is, and the latter goal      requires genuine welfare reform. But that cannot be achieved      without jobs for people with limited skill, without day care      for single mothers with small children, and without job      training for those who need it. We are pursuing ``welfare      reform on the cheap''--but the next generation will find it      very expensive. Real welfare reform will take an additional      initial investment but, in the long term, will save money,      reduce crime, and make America a more productive society.       The dangerous consequences of the ``welfare reform''      measure have been well publicized. According to the Urban      Institute's estimates, the bill will push a million more      children into poverty. It will cut food stamps--basic      nutrition for the poor--by nearly 20% from already low      levels.\4\ This is an unconscionable act, a failure by      Congress to meet its essential obligation to protect those      who are neglected by society.       Candidates who yield to public passions and vote for this      kind of measure may gain some temporary increase in      popularity. But in the long run, citizens perceive the truth.      They come to view Washington as an arena for dividing spoils      among powerful factions and interest groups rather than as a      proper forum for deliberating over the common good. When      elected officials follow public opinion at the expense of      justice, they ultimately discredit themselves and their own      institutions.       By contrast, candidates who act against public opinion may      find themselves penalized in the polls. But my experience is      that over time the public comes to respect those men and      women of principle who vote their conscience. These      politicians gain an unexpected reward: a deep kind of public      respect. I had a small taste of this type of reaction in      1990, when I was running for reelection to the Senate.      Although I voted against the death penalty and spoke about      the need to raise revenues--two very unpopular positions--I      won the election by the largest margin of any seriously      contested campaign for Senator or Governor. Once, in Chicago,      a man approached me and said, ``Senator Simon, I don't think      I agree with you on anything. But I trust you, and I'm going      to vote for you.'' Citizens yearn for candor and for      officials they can trust. If all we can give them is blind      obedience to current polls, we as public officials have      failed our public duties.       Politicians should be distinguished by their willingness to      meet the full ethical obligations of their position--to      exercise independent judgment in matters of justice and     to act on that judgment, even when it leads to unpopular      decisions. Walter Lippmann once wrote that a statesman      emerges whenever a politician ``stops trying merely to      satisfy or obfuscate the momentary wishes of his      constituents, and sets out to make them realize and assent to      those hidden interests of theirs which are permanent. . . .      When a statesman is successful in converting his constituents      from a childlike pursuit of what seems interesting to a      realistic view of their interests, he receives a kind of      support which the ordinary glib politician can never hope      for. . . . [O]nce a man becomes established in the public      mind as a person who deals habitually and successfully with      real things, he acquires an eminence of a wholly different      quality from that of even the most celebrated caterer of the      popular favor. . . .''\5\       Ultimately, the political profession will not redeem itself      in the public's eyes until a larger number of its      representatives begin to heed the call of their conscience      over the call of the polls.                  iii. ethics and the legal profession       Unlike the political realm, the legal profession has not      always been viewed with the scorn reserved for it today. in      words that may seem strange to us now, Alexis de Tocqueville      wrote that ``people in democratic states do not mistrust the      members of the legal profession, because it is known that      they are interested to serve the popular cause; and the      people listen to them without irritation because they do not      attribute to them any sinister designs.'' \6\ During the last      century, however, this picture of the legal profession has      too often been replaced by an entirely different one--a      picture of lawyers as parasites, hired-guns of large      corporations or grasping clients, motivated by greed and      neglectful of the public good. The legal industry--and it is      an industry--has become increasingly commercialized, with too      much emphasis on profits and the bottom line.       Paralleling this development has been the growth of a new      ideology within the legal culture itself, which one observer      has called the ``ideology of adversarial zeal.'' \7\ It is      more prevalent than it should be. This ideology tells lawyers      that they need not concern themselves with the public good or      the ordinary obligations of justice. Rather, their ethical      obligations are simply to serve their clients' desires and      commands.       When unrestrained, this ideology puts few ethical burdens      on the legal profession. Simply stated, it affirms that:      ``[l]awyers should not commit crimes or help clients to plan      crimes. They should obey only such ethical instructions as      are clearly expressed in rules and ignore vague standards.      Finally, they should not tell outright lies to judges or      fabricate evidence. Otherwise, they may, and if it will serve      their clients' interest must, exploit any gap, ambiguity,      technicality, or loophole, any not-obviously-and-totally-     implausible interpretation of the law or facts.''\8\       Like the norm of constituent service through polling in the      political realm, the ideology of adversarial zeal panders to      the lawyer's own self-interest. It enables lawyers to ignore      the effects of their work on the rest of society--     considerations that may detract from their profits but should      bother their conscience.       To be fair, the ideology of adversarial zeal may have value      in some contexts. For example, in criminal trials, there is a      strong temptation to pre-judge a defendant who stands before      the court of law, who often is a marginalized member of our      society, and who faces the awesome power of the state's legal      machinery. Public norms that encourage a fervent defense may      help to counteract this pressure and ensure that the      defendant has at least one committed defender. That defender      may be all that stands between the innocent individual and      the loss of his or her liberty.\9\       The finest legal traditions are followed when attorneys use      their zeal and skills in pro bono work, but today the      combination of federally assisted legal aid and pro bono work      still leaves far too many unserved or under served. In all      cases, there is a strong ethical argument for encouraging      lawyers to weigh the broader implications of their work for      society. Just as the politician must balance his      constituent's interests with the public interest, so too must      a lawyer balance client service with public service.       I do not know precisely how that balance should be drawn      today in the legal profession. But it certainly means that      lawyers--like candidates and office-holders--should hold      themselves to a higher standard of conduct than they      sometimes do now. It often means that lawyers should resist      the temptation to exploit loopholes in the law and instead      seek to ensure compliance with the spirit of the law. It      certainly means that a lawyer should not engage in a scorched      earth approach to discovery in order to overwhelm a less      resourceful opponent, even if that means sacrificing a      strategic edge in litigation. And it surely means working      with the political branches to improve and strengthen our      legal system, even if that effort may temporarily work to the      detriment of existing clients or the attorney's pocketbook.      Self-restraint is essential for a free society to function      effectively. We as a society should set our ethical goals      high, even the likelihood that many will inevitably fall      short.       We need, in other words, to revive an old ideology that      once permeated the legal profession, which Dean Kronman of      Yale Law School called the ideology of the ``lawyer      statesman.'' \10\ The lawyer statesman understands that      professional obligations extend far beyond the client's      interests to those of the nation at large, and that the Bar's      enormous power in American society comes with a great      responsibility to protect the common good. This is vital, in      part, because the legal profession plays such a basic role in      maintaining the nation's ideals. Professor George Anastaplo      has rightly spoken of the Bar's obligation: ``to mediate      between popular passions and informed and principled men,      thereby upholding republican government. Unless there is this      mediation, intelligent and responsible government is unlikely      . . . . The bar is, in short, in a position to train and lead      by precept and example the American people.'' \11\ Similarly,      Justice Louis Brandeis, who lived the noble ideal of the      lawyer statesman in his own life, spoke of lawyers ``holding      a position of independence, between the wealthy and the      people, prepared to curb the excesses of either.'' \12\       Not least of all, a resurgence in the ideal of the lawyer      statesman is important to our nation's future because, in the      United States, the legal profession has traditionally been a      training ground for many political aspirants. We will have      little hope of finding statesmen in the political arena, if      we are unable to cultivate statesmen in the legal sphere.       This is an extraordinarily difficult challenge. To change      the culture of the legal and political professions will      require a partnership among law schools, bar leaders, schools      of political science, and the public at large. But before we      can begin this task, we need to understand the reasons an      ideology of self-interest has too extensively replaced a      commitment to the public interest in both of our professions.      We need creative suggestions about how to reverse that trend.      For this reason, a symposium issue such as this one is so      timely and important to our national welfare. I congratulate      the Loyola University of Chicago Law Journal for taking on      this fundamental issue.                               footnotes     \1\ The Federalist No. 10 (James Madison).     \2\ Edmund Burke, Election Speech at Bristol (Nov. 3, 1774),      reprinted in Burke's Politics 115 (Ross J.S.

You choose a member, indeed; but when you have chosen him he      is not a member of Bristol, but he is a member of Parliament.      If the local constituent should have an interest or should      form a hasty opinion evidently opposite to the real good of      the community, the member for that place ought to be as far      as any other from any endeavor to give it effect.
