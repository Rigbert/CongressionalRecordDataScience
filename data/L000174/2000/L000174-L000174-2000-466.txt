I would like to see us move forward. The bill we put together passed 83-14. The distinguished leader is right; it was in excess of 80 votes. There was a tremendous amount of work on both sides of the aisle. Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, Senator Torricelli, and I were the four floor leaders on this, working with others--Senator Reid, Senator Daschle--to get people to take away hundreds of amendments. We got rid of those, and we got down to several on which we voted and passed in a good package. I would advise the two leaders, I have been working with Senator Torricelli, Senator Hatch, Senator Grassley, and Senator Sessions to try to whittle it down even further, but to have a packet, one that could be acceptable on both sides of the aisle and also could get signed down at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
