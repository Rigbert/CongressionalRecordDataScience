 President, I rise today with Senator Chafee to introduce a bill to give States the flexibility to provide family planning services to low-income women who do not qualify for Medicaid.  Under current law, in order to qualify for family planning services provided by the Medicaid program, a women would either have to have children and an income level below a threshold set by the State, ranging from 15-86 percent of the Federal poverty level, or be pregnant and have an income up to 133 percent of the poverty level; Federal law allows States to raise this income eligibility level to 185 percent, if they desire.  If a woman qualifies because of pregnancy, she is automatically eligible for family planning services for 60 days following delivery. After those 60 days, the woman's Medicaid eligibility expires.  If a State wants to provide Medicaid family planning services to additional populations of low-income women, they must apply to the Federal Government for a waiver. Currently, 18 States have waivers approved by the Federal Government. The waiver process is extremely cumbersome and time consuming, often taking up to three years to receive approval from the Federal Government.  This bill would once and for all allow States to provide crucial family planning to low-income women under the Medicaid program. It would eliminate the waiver process for these services and would give authority back to the States to determine what populations of low income women they want to provide family planning services to.  California currently receives $100 million annually, until 2004, as part of its five-year waiver to provide family planning services to low income women. with these funds, California provides services to more than 900,000 women each year.  The State estimates that because of these services, at least 50,000 unintended pregnancies are prevented each year.  In addition to contraceptives, the family planning funds are used for sexually transmitted disease screening and treatment, HIV screening and counseling, basic infertility services and pregnancy testing and counseling.  Officials involved in the program estimate that for every $1 invested in family planning, $3 are saved in pregnancy and health-care related costs.  In California, it is estimated that providing low-income women with access to family planning will save the State more then $900 million over the course of the five-year waiver.  I believe this legislation is more important now than ever.  Each year, approximately 3 million pregnacies, or about half of all pregnancies, are unintended. Increasing access to family planning services could help avert these 3 million unintended pregnancies and all the decisions and costs associated with either continuing or terminating a pregnancy.  Family planning services give women the necessary tools to space the birthsof their children, which improves women's health and reduces rates of infant mortality.  Medicaid family planning is also cost effective. For every $1 invested in family planning, $3 are saved in pregnancy and health care-related costs.  Family planning and reproductive health services are much more than just accessing contraceptives. Services provided include screening and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases and HIV, basic inferility services and pregnancy testing and counseling. Women can receive pap smears and breast exams, which are crucial to detecting cervical and breast cancer.  Low income women deserve access to family planning and reproductive health services. And States should not have to ask the Federal Government for permission to use Medicaid funds to provide these essential services.  We can afford to shut the door on those who cannot otherwise afford family planning and reproductive health services.  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
