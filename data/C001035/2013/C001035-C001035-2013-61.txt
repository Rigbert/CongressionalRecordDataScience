The fact is that 25 percent of our Nation's bridges are either structurally deficient or functionally obsolete, as described by the Senator from Ohio.  In my home State of Maine, nearly a third of our 2,408 bridges are deficient. Senator Portman's amendment targets these funds to ensure that they are awarded to structurally deficient or functionally obsolete projects in an effort to respond to our Nation's crumbling infrastructure.  Like Senator Murray, I support this amendment, and I too am prepared to accept it on a voice vote.
