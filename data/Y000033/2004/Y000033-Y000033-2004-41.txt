I thank the gentleman for bringing this to our attention. I was unaware of this problem. I do appreciate his suggestions. We will look into it.  Concerning the previous conversation, in this legislation there is a provision in the bill to tell the Coast Guard to get off their you-know-what and get busy and finish that problem that the gentleman from Michigan was talking about, and we are going to take care of that.  With respect to the gentleman from Ohio's issue, I now will be contacting the pilots association to find out what is the problem. I was reading with dismay the amount of delays that did occur because there were no pilots available. I cannot quite understand that myself because these are fine-paying jobs; and very honestly, the revenue is quite attractive. I am anticipating my career, and I am really shocked. Maybe there is a place for me, after all, if I get out of this position. I will be working with the gentleman very closely to see if we can do it.
