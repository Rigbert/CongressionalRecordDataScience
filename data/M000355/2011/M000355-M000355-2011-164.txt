 President, if I may elaborate further, we have had a request from the President on multiple occasions to vote on what he calls his jobs bill and to vote on it now. Just to count again, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11--12 times the President has asked us, over the last few weeks, to vote on what he calls his jobs bill now. I don't think the President is saying he wants an extensive debate about it; I think he is saying he wants a vote on it. I wanted to disabuse him of the notion that somehow we are unwilling to vote on his proposal. We are more than happy to vote on it.  I understand why my friend the majority leader may have some reservations about going forward. I have read a number of critiques of this legislation by Democratic Senators, one part of it or another. But even though there is bipartisan opposition to the President's jobs proposal, I think he is entitled to a vote. So I am sorry it appears we will not be able to achieve this vote the President has repetitiously asked for over the last few weeks. I would like to give him that vote, and we will be talking to the majority leader about when we might have an opportunity to vote on his proposal, the President's proposal which the majority leader introduced, which he has been requesting us to vote on.
