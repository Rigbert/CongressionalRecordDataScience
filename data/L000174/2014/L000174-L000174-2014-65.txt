President, I know the distinguished Senator from Louisiana has the majority of votes in this body for the Keystone Pipeline, and that is a compliment to her hard work in getting from a minority of votes to a majority of votes.  I will not be one of them, as she knows, because I represent what is the view of my fellow constituents in Vermont. I strongly oppose the fast-tracking of this process.  This pipeline poses considerable safety and environmental risks here in the United States, and it threatens the natural landscapes that are in the heartland of America. We feel this pipeline is one of the most striking examples of the unquenchable thirst for oil that is destroying our environment. We feel that destruction is going to move forward unless and until we get a comprehensive national energy plan. This pipeline will not lead us towards that. It leads us to an energy policy of the past instead of a sustainable energy future, while simultaneously accelerating our impact on the climate. These tar sands require an energy-intensive process, complete with pollutants and harmful emissions to get them out of the ground, to extract them, and to refine them.  We should not rubberstamp a project like this that poses such serious risks to the Nation's and the world's environment, and to our communities' safety. I was astounded by the fact that in its first year of operation the existing Keystone Pipeline--billed as you recall as the safest pipeline in history when it was built just a few years ago in 2010--spilled 12 times in its first year of operation. That is more than any other pipeline in U.S. history.  The worrisome part about these spills is that tar sands oil is harder to clean up. Ask the communities along the Kalamazoo River in Michigan. It has cost more than $1 billion so far--$1 billion so far--to clean up a tar sands spill in 2010. Now, more than 4 years later, it is still a mess, and landowners continue to wait for help in restoring their property and to rebuild the ravaged pipeline.  We do not need more empty assurances from the oil industry. Before the Valdez spill in Alaska, Exxon executives told us their oil tankers were safe. We heard similar promises from BP, which insisted that it could handle an oil spill in a deep-water drilling operation. The images from both of those spills are still fresh in our memories.  I realize that proponents argue that this pipeline will create jobs and willhelp our energy security here in the United States. But this pipeline will bypass refineries in the Midwest instead of heading to American gas stations to help lower the price of gas here at home. It will head straight for the coast so the oil can be used in export markets, pumped onto ships headed for China. That may be good news for the Chinese, but it is not good news for the American people who are stuck with the safety risks, the health challenges, future environmental disasters, and the rapid acceleration of our contribution to climate change.  These facts are clear: The Keystone pipeline significantly worsens the problem of carbon pollution, and it is not in our national interest. The Presidential Permit should be denied, not fast-tracked by Congress here today.  So I will not be among the majority who will vote for it today.                            USA Freedom Act  On another matter, while I have the floor, the distinguished Republican leader spoke against the USA FREEDOM Act earlier this morning. Unfortunately, he was too busy to respond to a couple of simple questions, even though he was asked to. But I would note that last year, Americans learned that section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act had been secretly interpreted for years to allow the bulk collection of telephone records. Unlike the comments made earlier that there were no hearings on this, the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014 came about after numerous congressional hearings, including six--six--public hearings in the Senate Judiciary Committee.  At least two panels of independent experts have concluded that the bulk collection program has not been essential or even a key part of keeping our country safe. We now have wide bipartisan agreement in the Senate and the House that the bulk phone records collection program is not essential, it violates Americans' privacy, and it has to end. So the question before Congress is not whether to end the program, but when and how.  The USA FREEDOM Act of 2014 ends the NSA's bulk collection program, but does so responsibly. The bill contains key reforms to safeguard Americans' privacy by prohibiting the indiscriminate collection of their data. It also provides for greater accountability and transparency of the government's surveillance programs, and it improves the FISA Court. The bill also ensures that the intelligence community has the tools it needs to keep our country safe.  This legislation is the result of several months of intense discussions and deliberations with the intelligence community and stakeholders across the political and economic spectrum. It has the unprecedented support of the Director of National Intelligence, the Attorney General, American technology companies, and privacy and civil liberty groups ranging from the ACLU and EEF to the NRA and TechFreedom, as well as the Director of NSA and lawmakers from all parts of the political spectrum who support it.  We cannot afford to delay action on these reforms any longer, as the American people continue to demand stronger protections for their privacy. Unfortunately, some would rather use scare tactics than legislate. Some would have us wait while American businesses continue to lose tens of billions of dollars in the international marketplace. Or we could even wait until we are facing down the expiration of Section 215 in a matter of months, thereby creating dangerous uncertainty and risk for the intelligence community.  The American people have had enough delay; they want action and real reform. It is time to get back to work, to show leadership, and to govern this country responsibly. The USA FREEDOM Act of 2014 is an opportunity to do just that.  Let us get it done now, when it can be done.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record several letters and editorials in support of the USA FREEDOM Act of 2014.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Office of the Director of National Intelligence,            Department of Justice,                                Washington, DC, September 2, 2014.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: Thank you for your letter of August      19, 2014, asking for the views of the Department of Justice      and the Intelligence Community on S. 2685, the USA FREEDOM      Act. We appreciate your extensive efforts to develop a bill      in coordination with the Administration, privacy and civil      liberties advocates, and representatives from the      communications providers that builds upon the good work done      by the House in its bill passed on May 22, 2014. As discussed      below, the Intelligence Community believes that your bill      preserves essential Intelligence Community capabilities; and      the Department of Justice and the Office of the Director of      National Intelligence support your bill and believe that it      is a reasonable compromise that enhances privacy and civil      liberties and increases transparency.       The USA FREEDOM Act bans bulk collection under a variety of      authorities. In particular, the bill permits collection under      Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act using a specific selection      term that narrowly limits the scope of the tangible things      sought to the greatest extent reasonably practicable,      consistent with the purposes for seeking the tangible things.      Recognizing that the terms enumerated in the statute may not      always meet operational needs, the bill permits the use of      other terms, provided there are court-approved minimization      procedures that prohibit the dissemination and require the      destruction within a reasonable period of time of any      information that has not been determined to satisfy certain      specific requirements. We believe that this approach will      accommodate operational needs while providing appropriate      privacy protections.       The bill also provides a mechanism to obtain telephone      metadata records in order to identify potential contacts of      suspected terrorists inside the United States. The      Intelligence Community believes that, based on communications      providers' existing practices in retaining metadata, the bill      will retain the essential operational capabilities of the      existing bulk telephone metadata program while eliminating      bulk collection.       The bill also increases transparency by expanding the      amount of information communications providers can disclose      and increasing public reporting by the government. Although      balancing national security and the public's legitimate      interest in additional transparency can be difficult, we are      comfortable with the transparency provisions in this bill      because, among other things, they recognize the technical      limitations on our ability to report certain types of      information.       We note that, consistent with the President's request, the      bill establishes a process for the appointment of an amicus      curiae to assist the FISA Court and FISA Court of Review in      matters that present a novel or significant interpretation of      the law. We believe that the appointment of an amicus in      selected cases, as appropriate, need not interfere with      important aspects of the FISA process, including the process      of ex parte consultation between the Court and the      government. We are also aware of the concerns that the      Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts expressed in a      recent letter, and we look forward to working with you and      your colleagues to address those concerns.       The USA FREEDOM Act represents the result of extensive      discussions and deliberations and has the support of a wide      range of interests. Admittedly, it is possible that there are      additional impacts that we will be able to identify only      after we start to implement the new law. You have our      commitment to notify Congress if we determine that the new      law is impeding the Intelligence Community's ability to      protect national security. Overall, the bill's significant      reforms should provide the public greater confidence in our      programs and the checks and balances in the system.           Sincerely,     Eric H. Holder, Jr.,       Attorney General.     James R. Clapper,       Director of National Intelligence.                                  ____                     Reform Government Surveillance       Open Letter to the Senate: The Senate has an opportunity      this week to vote on the bipartisan USA Freedom Act. We urge      you to pass the bill, which both protects national security      and reaffirms America's commitment to the freedoms we all      cherish.       The legislation prevents the bulk collection of Internet      metadata under various authorities. The bill also allows for      transparency about government demands for user information      from technology companies, and assures that the appropriate      oversight and accountability mechanisms are in place.       Since forming the Reform Government Surveillance coalition      last year, our companies have continued to invest in      strengthening the security of our services and increasing      transparency. Now, the Senate has the opportunity to send a      strong message of change to the world and encourage other      countries to adopt similar protections.       Passing the USA Freedom Act, however, does not mean our      work is finished. We will continue to work with Congress, the      Administration, civil liberties groups and governments around      the world to advance essential reforms that we set forth in a      set of principles last year. Such reforms include: preventing      government access to data without proper legal process;      assuring that providers     are not required to locate infrastructure within a country's      border; promoting the free flow of data across borders; and      avoiding conflicts among nations through robust, principled,      and transparent frameworks that govern lawful requests for      data across jurisdictions.       Now is the time to move forward on meaningful change to our      surveillance programs. We encourage you to support the USA      Freedom Act.         AOL, Apple, Dropbox, Evernote, Facebook, Google,            LinkedIn, Microsoft, Twitter, Yahoo.                                  ____                                                November 14, 2014.     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Leahy and Grassley: The USA Freedom Act, now      under consideration in the Senate, is broadly consistent with      the recommendatins we made last year in our report on how to      safeguard both liberty and security in a rapidly changing      world.       Specifically, we note the close similarity of the bill with      our first recommendation, that orders under Section 215      should be issued by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Court about particular individuals and only where there are      reasonable grounds to believe that the particular information      sought is relevant to an authorized investigation.           Sincerely,     Richard Clarke,     Michael Morell,     Cass Sunstein,     Geoffrey Stone,     Peter Swire.                                  ____               [From the Washington Times, Nov. 14, 2014]             Bipartisanship in Defense of the Constitution     Reining in the NSA is something that all Americans can embrace                    (By Chris Cox and Laura Murphy)       Washington politicians are squaring off for another round      of confrontation following an election in which millions of      American voters demanded an end to the squabbling and a      commitment to actually solving the many problems facing the      country. There are, of course, issues on which agreement      shouldn't be expected, but there are others on which there      should be broad agreement, regardless of party and ideology.       As representatives of two organizations, the National Rifle      Association (NRA) and the American Civil Liberties Union      (ACLU), with very different perspectives on some issues, we      are joining together today because of our belief in the      constitutional guarantees of free speech and privacy and our      concern that both could be lost unless we rein in      governmental surveillance and monitoring that characterizes      life in this country.       The NRA last year joined the ACLU in court proceedings      aimed at limiting the surveillance of private citizens in the      name of national security. While we agree that government      should have the power it needs to protect the American people      from terrorist threats, those charged with doing so must be      accountable and play by the rules set down by the Founders in      the Constitution and its Bill of Rights.       Our lawsuit involved the National Security Agency's program      to collect what the government likes to call ``metadata,''      including records of phone calls made by every single      American. That data can paint an intimate portrait of      someone's life--who they talk to, the organizations they      support and who their friends are. However, that same      information can be used to target innocent Americans involved      in perfectly legal activities that our government doesn't      happen to like.       For example, by using metadata, the government can identify      and track most gun owners by tracing contacts with gun      ranges, firearms retailers and the like, facilitating the      establishment of the national firearms registry that gun      owners fear and federal law prohibits. It can also be used by      government officials to get information on journalists or any      activists that are critical of government policies.       In our view, current surveillance practices violate the      First and Fourth Amendments and threaten other rights, such      as those guaranteed by the Second Amendment, and they are not      making us any safer. President Obama's own review panel and      the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board have found      that these call-records programs have not provided any      crucial information in even one terrorism case. Even James R.      Clapper, the nation's director of national intelligence,      supports legislation known as the USA Freedom Act, a modest      reform proposal that brings current practices more in line      with what the Constitution requires.       While there is much the Senate shouldn't or needn't do      during the ``lame-duck'' session, the USA Freedom Act is      badly needed legislation that has bipartisan support and will      protect the rights of all Americans. The NRA and the ACLU,      along with many members of Congress from both parties,      support these reforms and they should be enacted, without      weakening amendments, by the Senate and sent to the White      House as soon as possible.       Public frustration with Congress is heightened when      essential and widely supported legislation such as the USA      Freedom Act languishes and dies for reasons that defy common      sense. It's happened before. After all the rhetoric and after      the case is made, nothing happens. If the Senate can't pass      and the president can't sign a widely supported package of      reforms to protect the basic constitutional rights of the      American people, is it any wonder that Americans of both      parties conclude that Washington is simply dysfunctional?       Every day that the Senate fails to vote on these reforms is      a day in which law-abiding citizens have reason to fear that      the constitutional protections so dear to the Founders and so      crucial to the functioning of a free society no longer apply.      That is a fear the Senate can begin to correct by passing the      USA Freedom Act before the end of this year.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 17, 2014]   The Senate Should Approve a Bipartisan Proposal to Reform the NSA                              (Editorial)       The Senate is set to vote Tuesday on the USA Freedom Act,      the most promising National Security Agency reform proposal      before Congress. Neither national security hawks nor civil      libertarians get everything they want from the legislation,      which means it could fail to get the 60 votes it needs to      advance, or it could get pulled too far in one direction or      another during an open amendment process after that. Either      road to demise would be unfortunate: The bill deserves to be      approved, reconciled with a House-approved version and sent      to President Obama.       The headline of the Senate's bill, sponsored by a varied      group of Democrats and Republicans with Sen. Patrick Leahy      (D-Vt.) in the lead, is that it would end the government's      bulk collection of so-called metadata--phone calling records,      for example. In its place, the bill would give the government      authority to demand calling records from phone companies in      specific cases, if the collection is ``narrowly'' limited.      Even then, the government would have to discard information      lacking bona-fide intelligence value, and its metadata      collection operations would be subject to more oversight.       That's fine, but bulk metadata collection is not the most      important issue the bill addresses. The act would bring      change to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which      helps oversee the NSA's activities. The court, which      generally hears only the government's side of any issue,      would get balance from a panel of advocates tasked with      arguing for civil liberties when the judges are considering      important questions of law. The proposal also foresees      appeals courts reconsidering more FISA cases, and the bill      would press for major court decisions to be released.       The bill would enable a more orderly and informed debate on      NSA activities as well. It would require the government to      release much more information on how much it is using various      authorities and, crucially, on how many people's information      it has swept up in the process. It also harmonizes the      expiration of many surveillance authorities. Americans, then,      would have more information to assess surveillance activities      and a single date on which surveillance policy will be up for      debate.       Technology companies have come out strongly in favor of the      plan, as have many--though not all--civil liberties      advocates. So, too, has the Obama administration. Though the      intelligence community would have to change its behavior--     significantly in certain programs--it would get clear legal      authorities that it wants and an extended expiration timeline      for some of them. It would also maintain its core, foreign-     focused surveillance authorities without much change. Therein      lies the bill's careful balance. As the Senate works on the      proposal over the coming days, it should preserve that      delicate and authentic compromise.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, Nov. 17, 2014]                A Crucial Vote on the Surveillance Bill                              (Editorial)       The Republican Party is so badly fractured that it is      impossible to tell what steps it will take on domestic      surveillance once it assumes control of Congress in January.      Its rising libertarian wing wants to crack down on abuses of      Americans' privacy, but many of its leaders express full      support for any action the intelligence agencies want to      take.       That's why it's important that the Senate break a      filibuster on the USA Freedom Act, which would reduce or end      the bulk collection of telephone records, in a vote scheduled      for Tuesday afternoon. If the bill doesn't pass in the      current lame-duck session of the Senate, still controlled by      Democrats, it may never get past the 60-vote hurdle in the      next session of Congress.       The bill, sponsored by Senator Patrick Leahy, Democrat of      Vermont, would require the National Security Agency to ask      phone companies for the records of a specific person or      address when it is searching for terrorists, instead of      scooping up all the records in an area code or city. It would      force the agency to show why it needs those records, and to      disclose how much data is being collecting.       The bill would also create a panel of advocates to support      privacy rights and civil liberties in arguments before the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court; currently, there is      no one to offer opposition to government requests before the      court. The government would have to issue clear summaries of      the court's most significant rulings.       Not every potential surveillance abuse is addressed in the      measure. For example, it leaves open the possibility of      ``backdoor'' searches of American data that investigators      come across when searching for the communications of      foreigners. It exempts the F.B.I. from transparency on      searches. And it is not clear whether the government believes      there is some other hidden legal authority for bulk      collection other than the one addressed in the USA Freedom      Act.       Nonetheless, the bill is a good way to begin restoring      individual privacy that has been systematically violated by      government spying, revealed through the leaks provided by      Edward Snowden. It has been supported by the American Civil      Liberties Union, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, and      other privacy watchdogs. On Sunday, a group of the biggest      technology companies--including Google, Microsoft, Facebook      and Twitter--endorsed the bill because it allows more      disclosure of the demands for information made of them by the      government.       In addition to Senate Democrats, the bill is supported by      some hard-right Republicans, including Ted Cruz of Texas and      Mike Lee of Utah. But Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, who will      soon be the Senate majority leader, has supported the      N.S.A.'s spying on Americans. That's a good a reason to pass      it before a new Senate can water it down.
