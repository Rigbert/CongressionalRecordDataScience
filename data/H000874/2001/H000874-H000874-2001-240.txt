He and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Ford) have two fathers who are very, very proud, and I know mothers, as well, proud of their sons who are serving so ably and following their fathers' footsteps so appropriately. I thank the gentleman for his comments.  Mr. Speaker, I said earlier that on Sunday I would be marching across the Edmond Pettis Bridge. One of the people that I am sure will be walking with us is a great fighter for civil rights who was there during the darkest days, most difficult days of the struggle for, as Martin Luther King, Jr., said, America to live out its promise. He represents Birmingham, the city of Bull Connor, one of the examples of how hate and racism can inflict a community like a cancer. The gentleman was perhaps not as famous, but a giant himself of the civil rights movement.  I am very proud to yield to my friend, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Hilliard), formerly a member of the Alabama Senate and chairman of one of its most important committees.                              {time}  1430
