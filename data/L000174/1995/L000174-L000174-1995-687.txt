President, I am pleased to cosponsor S. 10. This bill could be called the Golden Rule bill because its premise boils down to Congress doing unto ourselves as we do unto others. I would be tempted to say that this is a reform whose time has come, if it were not already so painfully overdue.  When I first arrived in Washington as a newly elected Senator from Vermont, I was struck by the double standard of rights. Congress passed laws that applied to employers in this country--except Congress. It was alien to anything I had ever experienced.  Contrary to advice from older and far more senior Members of the Senate, in 1978 I introduced a bill that would extend coverage of several important civil rights and labor laws to Congress. It was a simple bill, founded on a simple premise: Congress, like everyone else in the country, must be governed by the law.  Congress was not the last plantation, where everyone except the master was subject to the master's rules. The Senate represented the very seat of our democracy--and it was imperative that it act like one.  I introduced the bill, explaining on the Senate floor why Congress must set an example to the public. The reaction of other Senators was not entirely friendly. As I was leaving the Senate floor, a senior Senator stopped to ask where I was rushing off to. I explained that I had a plane to catch back to Vermont. The Senator remarked, ``Good, I hope you stay there.''  My efforts to apply laws to Congress did not get much support in 1978. But I believed in it, and have continued to introduce it in the years since then. Now, almost 17 years after I first introduced congressional coverage legislation, we seem finally ready to act.  [[Page S165]] We have passed landmark legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, to protect the civil, social, physical, and economic working rights for American workers. What we failed to do each time we passed legislation was make sure that Congress was covered. By exempting itself from important civil rights and labor laws, Congress denied to the men and women who serve us every day the rights and protections afforded to other American workers, simply because of the place of their employment.  The result has come home to roost. The American people question whether Congress understands their problems in part because Congress does not have to live under the same rules as other Americans. This bill is a step toward regaining the confidence of the American people.  Congress cannot be above the laws it passes. It must provide to all its employees the same protections it requires other employers to give. The American people want this body to play by the same rules and observe the same laws that we impose on everyone else.  Unlike the Republican version of the congressional coverage bill, the Democratic alternative (S. 10), which I am glad to cosponsor, contains provisions for lobbying reform, and limits on gifts to Members and congressional staff. The Republican version is called the Congressional Accountability Act, even though it fails to address matters that are necessary for it to amount to true accountability to the American people. In fact, that bill is limited to extending only a few employment laws to Congress but not other critical measures that we were stopped from approving last year by our Republican colleagues. That bill does not address the key issues needed for accountability that we have been trying to act on for some time.  In particular, I refer to lobbying reform, the gift ban and campaign finance reform legislation that was bottled up again last year. We should be moving on these important fronts if we are serious about accountability. The Republican bill merely lends some institutional responsibility to our remaining employees. Accountability should include responsibility to the rest of the American people, as well. That means reforming the way money can affect the legislative process. I am supporting S. 10 because it goes further than the Republican alternative and takes affirmative steps to provide that accountability.  I must observe, however, that this effort is deficient in one key regard for its failure to increase sunshine and public information about Congress. I have previously pressed to have principles of the Freedom of Information Act and Privacy Act apply to Congress. We need to have more open processes if we hope to restore Americans' belief in our representative legislative bodies. While it is true that simply applying FOIA questions, this bill does nothing to begin answering those questions and makes no effort toward increasing sunshine in our institutions of government.  I have no doubt that giving people greater access to information on how decisions are made in Congress would go a long way to reducing the cynicism that the American people have about what we do here. We must work to find ways to increase our openness and accessibility to the public.                                 ______      By
