Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remaining time.  In closing, I reluctantly oppose the amendment, but I understand why it should be defeated, and I urge the defeat of the amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson).  The question was taken, and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.
