It is wrong because distinguished Latino leaders, who have spent their lives seeking justice and greater representation of Hispanic lawyers as judges, have been attacked by Republicans for showing courage and honesty in their judgment that this nomination is wanting. Joining the League of United Latin American Citizens, which previously wrote to the Senate disassociating itself with Republican attacks on Democratic Senators, yesterday the National Council of La Raza issued a statement condemning the treatment of Congressional Hispanic Caucus by Republicans. The NCLR statement notes how ``deeply offended'' it is by Mr. Estrada's supporters calling Congressional Hispanic Caucus members ``tyrannical,'' ``racist,'' and ``anti-Latino''.  Moreover, the Republican approach and the President's approach have been to divide the Senate, to divide the American people--may I have order, Mr. President? May I have order?
