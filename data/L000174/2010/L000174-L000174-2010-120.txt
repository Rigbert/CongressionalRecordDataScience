President, I would like to mark the coming retirement of a legend in the Department of Justice--John C. ``Jack'' Keeney.  As a former prosecutor, and through decades of oversight of the Department of Justice on the Judiciary Committee, I have developed an immense appreciation for the dedication and skill of the Department's career prosecutors and attorneys. When politics have threatened to infect the good work of the Department in the past, I have emphasized the importance of the Department's career professionals. I know Attorney General Holder shares my regard for the Department's hardworking career prosecutors. With more than 6 decades of Federal Government service and well over a half century of pioneering work in the Department's Criminal Division, Jack Keeney has come to embody the ideal of a career Justice Department attorney.  Jack Keeney served in the Army Air Corps in World War II, during which his plane was shot down. He survived a Nazi POW camp. He went to college and law school under the GI Bill and joined the Justice Department in 1951. He has diligently served every administration since President Truman.  At the Justice Department, Jack Keeney worked on internal security matters in the 1950s, prosecuted organized crime in the 1960s under Attorney General Robert Kennedy, and helped to expand the Department's white collar prosecutions as Chief of the Criminal Division's Fraud Section beginning in 1969.  In 1973, he was appointed Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division, a position he has now held for close to 4 decades. He has on numerous occasions served as Acting Assistant Attorney General and has long been the senior career official supervising some of the Justice Department's most important and most sensitive matters, including organized crime, public corruption, and electronic surveillance.  Jack Keeney has received almost every conceivable honor for exceptional government legal work, including the Attorney General's Award for Exceptional Service, the District of Columbia Bar's Beatrice Rosenberg Award for Outstanding Government Service, and the Presidential Rank Award for Distinguished Service.  The Department of Justice is defined by the career professionals who, day in and day out, exemplify dedication, integrity, and a commitment to justice. Jack Keeney has personified these qualities for the past 6 decades. The Department and the country are better for his exceptional service. I thank him for his service and wish him well in his well-deserved retirement. I hope that generations of lawyers at the Justice Department will be inspired by his example and seek to follow in his footsteps.                          ____________________
