Chair, I am happy to rise in support of the gentleman's amendment. This is another example of EPA overreach. It is my hope that my colleagues from Virginia and Pennsylvania can continue to work with the administration to find common ground on approaches that will improve water quality in a more flexible manner. I certainly support this amendment and I urge an ``aye'' vote.  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.
