No, none whatsoever. The oil men in the White House and the vice president, the oil man, their political appointees at the Federal Trade Commission finds no price gouging. The American people aren't going to believe this.  Now, let's just take one little example with Katrina. I live on the west coast of the United States; none of our oil refined products come from the southeastern United States, yet on Labor Day weekend in Oregon the prices were identical and they had gone up by 60 cents a gallon in one day. Now, isn't that interesting.  Now, how does that work? That is not price gouging? That is market-based? So they were going to build a pipeline that day and start shipping it to the southeast, or they were going to truck it across the country? Come on. Totally separated markets. Unbelievable increase in profits. $100 million a day for ExxonMobil, the most profitable day in the history of the world, and there was no price gouging going on.  Now, there is one commissioner who has a shred of integrity left, Commissioner John Leibowitz. He issued a sharp statement. He said a handful of refiners more than doubled operating margins in ways not attributable to increased costs after the hurricanes.  Sounds like price gouging to me. No, the entire Commission determined that the firm's conduct in response to hurricane-induced reductions was consistent with competition, adding that the Bush-appointed Federal Trade Commission doesn't back proposals to create Federal price gouging laws. There is no price gouging.  So then why wouldn't we create price gouging laws? If there isn't any, there hasn't been any, we could prevent it in the future. Or maybe there really was a little teeny bit of price gouging and the Bush appointees don't want us to be able to prosecute that in the future. I think we could substitute the word consistent with business as usual.  This is not a competitive market. There is collusion. It is organized. It has been going on for more than a decade when the American Petroleum Institute suggested to Big Oil that they shut down refineries to squeeze down capacity so that they could drive up refinery margins. And, guess what. On average they are up 255 percent in 5 years. Now, this is competition according to the Bush-appointed Federal Trade Commission. The rest of us might call it collusion, market manipulation, and price gouging. The American people are seeing it.  Now, if we took two simple steps. They say, oh, there is nothing Congresscould do anyway, don't worry about it. That is what the President says. Yeah, there are a couple things we could do. The experts say that 75 percent of the crude oil market is unregulated. It is traded in ways that would be illegal if it was controlled by the Commodities Future Trading Commission, like all other commodities and a quarter of the oil market. Traders swap back and forth, back and forth, back and forth just to drive up the price, no intention of actually taking a contract or taking delivery. They say we could squeeze 20 to 25 percent out of today's cost at the pump if we just regulated that market with the same rules as any other traded commodity and part of the oil market today.  Well, that would take us from $3.20 down to $2.56 a gallon. Not bad. I think the American people and American businesses would think that was pretty good.  And then we have the collusion to shut the refineries. Now, if we just took the refineries back to their previous margins, that was the historic margin that they got per gallon, that would knock another 50 cents a gallon off. But let's say we have got to give them an inducement to reopen the refineries that they shut, or build new ones because they tore down the ones that they shut to restrict the market to drive up the price. So with a little windfall profits tax that says these are windfall profits unless and until you invest in production and refining capacity; and if you do that, then you won't have to pay this confiscatory tax, that would take us down to somewhere around $2.26 a gallon. Now, that would be quite a gift for the American economy, American consumers, people who live in the rural parts of my district who have to commute long distances to work.  But the Republican Congress is silent and complicit with the oil men at the White House who have manipulated the Federal Trade Commission into trying to fool the American consumers and say, oh, that wasn't price gouging, that was a market at work.  Yeah. Give me a break.                          ____________________
