 Speaker, today, I recognize the outstanding work done by participants in my Student Congressional Town Meeting held this spring at the University of Vermont. These participants were part of a group of high school students from around Vermont who testified about the concerns they have as teenagers, and about what they would like to see government do regarding these concerns.                     Regarding Necessity of Amtrak                           (By Joseph Ferris)       Thank you for allowing me to speak here.       In the winter of 1997, Congress withheld $2.2 billion from      Amtrak, that had already been promised. Eventually, Congress      allocated the money to Amtrak, with the stipulation that      Amtrak achieve self-sufficiency by 2002. It is now 2002, and      Amtrak has yet to attain self-sufficiency, and several      congressional leaders, as well as the Amtrak Reform Council,      are calling for the privatization. In the following minutes,      I will explain to what the failures of achieving self-     sufficiency can be attributed, and why such a radical idea      such as privatization is unnecessary for Amtrak.       First, the costs to run Amtrak are astronomical. It costs      $3 million a year to maintain stations, tunnels and rails at      operational conditions. Since 1997, there has been a $5.8      billion backlog in work, in yards, equipment and technology.      Also, Amtrak pays $400 million to $600 million a year to      freight rail companies to use their tracks outside of the      northeast corridor.       The funds Amtrak needs are $20 billion to repair the      century-and-a-half old East River and Hudson River tunnels      that enter into Penn Station. Also, several billion dollars      to implement the security systems necessary after September      11th. And also, in the fiscal year of 2003, Amtrak needs $1.2      billion to operate long-distance trains along with other      routes.       Now the money Amtrak is actually given over their 31 years      history is trifling compared to the money that government      doles out to airports and roads in a singular year. Over 30      years, Amtrak has been given a total of $23 billion. last      year Amtrak got $560 million, compared to 13 billion for      airports and 33 billion for roads. Airlines received massive      bailouts after September 11th. Amtrak was given only a token      $100 million for security.       Amtrak right now is caught in catch-22. It needs money to      fix rails and crumbling infrastructure, but Congress won't      give money to something they don't think will be around in a      few years. Therefore, the following happens. Even though new      trains, such as the Excel Express, are running, old rails      only allow it to run at top speed for 18 miles of the 452-     mile run from Boston to DC. Amtrak could be making money if      the 2001 High-Speed Rail Initiative had not been killed in      Congress. And also, a bill allowing for tax-exempt bonds, and      loan guarantees for construction was pushed through the House      and Senate.       Also, there is a severe philosophical and policy planning      issue in Washington, DC right now. Though several national      agencies are involved, none has ever set a policy path for      Amtrak. Second, Amtrak has never had a dedicated source of      funding that they could build around. Also, Congress expects      Amtrak to make a profit, while history clearly indicates the      exact opposite. Passenger rail was never a moneymaker. Even      the New York Central in its heyday, with the Twentieth      Century Limited, lost money on each passenger per mile. Even      the European high-speed lines, which are heralded as      blueprints for privatization, are money-losers. Thus, it      would be ludicrous for Amtrak, which suffers from a      fundamental problem--underinvestment--to then be expected to      turn a tidy profit. Even though Amtrak's funding has been      severely reduced, there are many positive signs that need to      be highlighted before a decision about Amtrak's fate is made.       But first, right now, the status quo: We have wing-lock,      gridlock, air congestion, rising gas prices, and in some      major metropolitan cities, six-hour long rush hours. Also,      airplanes release poisonous toxins into the upper atmosphere      at rates astronomical compared to what trains release.       Also, rail works. It's the safest and most reliable      transportation system during     storms. In the past decade, light rail and freight expansion      have worked. Also, passenger trains are two to eight times      more fuel-efficient than planes, and much more economical.       The Pacific Northwest Corridor, which is run by Amtrak and      the state governments of Oregon and Washington, has seen a      dramatic increase over the past decade, after infusion of      state money was allowed to build a high-speed rail corridor.      Also, sleeping cars, which are often referred to as archaic,      and for train-bus alone, experienced an increase of 19      percent over last year's statistics. February of 2002 was the      sixth straight month that rail ridership was up and air      ridership went down.       Amtrak handles 40 percent of all traffic in the New York-     Washington, DC, corridor. If high-speed rail corridors were      developed in Florida, the southeast and Texas, per se, they      could garner up to 20 to 30 percent of all traffic in that      area. Ridership from 1978 to 2001 increased 24 percent, while      funding was drastically cut by almost 80 percent.       What should be done? I believe a one-cent tax should be      instituted on all gasoline purchases, as well as a one-and-a-     half cent tax on all domestic airplane tickets, which would      give Amtrak a sustained source of income coming out to about      $3.1 billion a year.       Also, Amtrak should be given $50 billion grants spread over      two years to replace antiquated signals, rails, equipment and      technology. Congress shall reintroduce the $12 billion high-     speed rail initiative, and will follow the DOT's report on      high-speed rail corridors, which indoctrinated eleven      corridors in 33 states. A system of 80 percent matching funds      will be established to match funds invested by state and      local government; because, right now, states and local      governments get zero percent matching funds, while for      highway they get almost a hundred percent.       An independent committee will be formed to find timesaving      and performance-enhancing changes, such as customs agents      will be put aboard international trains, and will check      passenger IDs at each respective station that the passenger      gets on, instead of at the border, which causes a backlog of      about three hours.       Also, mail cars, which in the status quo are put on after      the train is boarded in the yard, which costs another two      hours for each train, will now be added to the train when it      is put together in the yard, so there will be a flow from the      station to point B.       Thank you very much.                         Regarding Child Labor   (By Colin Robinson, Marcia Lo Monoco, Sarah Kunz, and Delia Kipp)       COLIN ROBINSON. Good morning, Congressman Sanders and      Professor Gutman.       Our testimony is going to begin with a description of the      problem of child labor, and then we're going to move on to an      explanation of the causes of child labor, then possible      solutions, and wrapping up with what the Child Labor      Education Act, CLEA, has done in Guatemala.       MARCIA LO MONOCO. Exploitative child labor is when children      work under conditions that are hazardous to their physical      and/or mental health, when they are deprived of an      opportunity to get an education, and not paid a liveable      wage. Once children begin to work, sometimes as early as the      age of 4, their chances to change the future are very small.       It is common to think that child labor is a problem in      Third World countries, but it is also a very real problem in      the United States. One million children in the U.S. pick the      produce we eat every day. There are an estimated 250,000      sweat shops in American cities. But child labor is a global      problem.       The most prevalent type of child labor is agricultural      work. Children work in fields for long, hard hours, and are      exposed to hazardous chemicals. Children also work in      manufacturing, construction, mining, the sex trade, and      bonded labor. Bonded labor is when children are sold by their      parents to manufacturers, where they are sometimes chained to      their machines or locked in workrooms. Child labor is a      global problem which prevents educational opportunities and      continues the cycle of poverty and deprivation.       SARAH KUNZ. Child labor is one of the most heinous human      rights violations occurring today. It can be thought of as a      fire sparked by the oppressive cyclical nature of capitalism      and fueled by corporate greed and corporate imperialism.      American megacorporations such as Nike, Disney and      Universityware exploit Third World economies through promises      of mass employment. Instead, mass poverty ensues, due to      subpoverty wages.       The frightening phenomenon that is globalization creates      homogenous global markets driven by low wages and high profit      margins. New global trade agreements and organizations such      as NAFTA, WTO, the IMF, and pending free-trade areas of the      Americas in effect declare labor laws barriers to trade.      Union-busting in sweat shops, mines and fields all around the      world destroy democratic principles at their roots.       The oppressive nature of capitalism inherently creates such      conditions as poverty and inopportunity. The child population      is easily manipulated and often exemplifies the most      desperate of the human condition. Due to the plight of the      economically distressed, many children have no other choice      than to work.       COLIN ROBINSON. The issue of a solution to child labor is      one that is intimately intertwined with the global economy.      However, the exploitation and abuse of innocent children      cannot be outrightly ignored. A solution will come out of      hard work and education. We must educate people about the      human rights abuses, about the four-year-olds carrying twenty      pounds of bricks, about the young boys and girls forced to      work the streets, selling their bodies for sex. We need to      create a conscious consumer, starting at a young age, a      consumer who will think twice before buying goods made by      children.       Furthermore, we must appeal to lawmakers, lobbyists and      corporate officers to instate rules giving children their      rights. Through letters, we have a voice. The 1998 bonded      labor act, written by you, Congressman Sanders, was the first      step in this branch of change. Finally, the fortunate youth      of the industrialized world can unite to help their distant      peers. Through student organizations like ours, CLEA, Child      Labor Education in Action, the youth have a voice. It gives      them a pulpit from which would be heard.       The child laborers of our world need a voice. So educate      yourself and speak out.       DELIA KIPP. In April of 2001, sixteen students from Child      Labor Education in Action traveled to Pasac Segundo in      western highlands of Guatemala. The people of the Pasac      Segundo are Mayans and victims of extraordinary poverty. This      is an agricultural community, and here is where the children      work, in the fields surrounding their homes. This is a place      where the land is rich and the people are poor.       The children of the Pasac Segundo had no way of breaking      the vicious poverty cycle until two years ago, when their      parents and other community members joined together to start      a school. We went to Pasac Segundo to help them build a new      school. Alongside adults and children of the village, we      cleared the land of stone and leveled the ground. We dug      foundations and constructed rebar frames to reinforce cement      and bricks.       We left with unbreakable ties and eagerness to continue to      support the school. We have continued to fund-raise during      the past school year. We held concerts, a benefit dinner, as      well as many other successful activities. In total, we have      given Pasac Segundo over $6,000. In conjunction with many      area elementary and high schools, we have collected school,      health supplies, and shoes for children of Pasac Segundo. We      are extremely excited and proud to announce that the school      in Guatemala should be finished by the end of this month. We      also invite students to learn more about our building project      in Guatemala and our organization by visiting table in lobby      or http://www.clea.sit.edu.       COLIN ROBINSON. And I'd like to thank you, Congressman      Sanders, for allowing us to be here.                               ____________________
