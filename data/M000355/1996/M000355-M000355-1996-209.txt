 I do not remember whether she was there--she may have been--the day that Col. Billie Bobbitt, retired U.S. Air Force officer, testified before the committee in opposition to this bill. I want to take a minute to quote some of her observations. She is a member of EMILY'S List, which would effectively be put out of business by this legislation, as the Senator from California has, I believe, acknowledged. That might have been one of the amendments she would offer were she in a parliamentary position where that were permissible. But, in any event, Colonel Bobbitt, retired Air Force officer, said, ``I'm in one of the organizations,'' referring to EMILY'S List, ``35,000 active members from all 50 States, and along with voting, I haven't missed an election,'' she said, ``in 51 years. EMILY'S List is the primary means through which I participate,'' said Colonel Bobbitt, ``in the electoral process.''  She goes on in her testimony, ``In the decade since EMILY'S List began, more women than ever have been elected to Congress, and EMILY'S List is a big reason why. EMILY'S List has allowed women to compete and win.''  She went on to say, with regard to the bundling, in effect, that EMILY'S List does--she describes it. She says, ``This is what's called bundling, which I know Common Cause and some others have criticized, but to me it's just good old American democracy at work.'' So said Colonel Bobbitt.  She goes on to say, ``That's not bad for the system. That's good for the system. Thousands of small contributions are able to offset the big money coming from the rich and powerful. We are making the system more participatory and more competitive,'' said Colonel Bobbitt.  Then she concluded by saying, ``My membership in EMILY'S List is a way for me to be connected to the political life of the Nation and to my fellow citizens. It allows me to band together with others who share my views and work toward a common end. I do not pretend to be a constitutional scholar,'' she says, ``but like most Americans, I carry within me an almost innate knowledge of the first amendment rights of citizenship--freedom to practice religion, freedom to speak my mind, freedom to assemble with fellow citizens in support of a common goal. I believe without a doubt that any membership in EMILY'S List is secured by such rights, and I believe that organizations like EMILY'S List, which encourage political participation by average citizens, are in the best tradition of American democracy.''  I just wanted to quote what Colonel Bobbitt, an active member of EMILY'S List, had to say about the underlying legislation, which she obviously believes would greatly restrict her rights to participate in the political process.  Mr. President, I wanted to take a moment here to make some observations about the injunctive authority that I view in this bill as provided to the Federal Election Commission. As I read the underlying bill which we are debating, section 306, ``Authority to Seek an Injunction,'' basically, what this section does is give to the Government, the Government of the United States, the right to step in and, prior to the issuance of speech, restrain it. It gives the Government the authority to engage in prior restraint of political speech by stepping in and getting a temporary injunction. This is but one of a number of clearly unconstitutional measures granted to the Government by this bill.  In addition, obviously, if this bill were somehow to pass constitutional muster, which is extremely unlikely, the Federal Election Commission, which today has great difficulty in auditing the races of the candidates running for the one race in America at the Federal level where we have, arguably, spending limits--it takes 5, 6 years to audit those few races that they have to audit--it is just, I think, reasonable to ask the question: How big would the Federal Election Commission be if it had to regulate the speech of 535 additional races as well as engage in the injunctive relief powers apparently given to it by the bill, as well as whatever additional regulatory authority it might be able to assert over independent expenditures?  In short, I think it is reasonable to assume, Mr. President, that we would have an FEC the size of the Veterans Administration. If there is anything this Congress is about, it seems to this Senator it is not building more large Federal bureaucracies.  We have been trying to balance the budget, to downsize the Government, to restrain our appetite for not only spending but for regulation, and, clearly, this is a regulatory power grab of enormous proportions, I would say, Mr. President--of enormous proportions. It could well be that is one of the reasons an awful lot of the groups in this country this time, across the ideological spectrum, have decided to get off of the sidelines and into the game and stand up for their rights to participate in the political process.  This bill is not just about us, that is, the candidates for office; it is also about all the groups organized that, under the first amendment, have a constitutional right to participate in the political process.  Let me just go down some of the letters that I have received on this bill,first from the Christian Coalition, a letter dated yesterday, June 24, 1996, in response to an effort to modify this bill, which was agreed to, and we do have a modified version in the Chamber today.  The Christian Coalition says it strongly urges a no vote on cloture.       Contrary to the letter sent out by Senators McCain,      Feingold, and Thompson on June 19, the amended version of S.      1219 still contains the flawed provisions that seriously      threaten voter guides. The voter guide problem has NOT been      corrected.  According to the Christian Coalition.  The letter goes on:       The amended S. 1219 continues to place the First Amendment      right to educate the public on issues in serious jeopardy. It      redefines ``express advocacy'' so that for the first time      ever the Federal Elections Commission would regulate issue      advocacy by citizen groups.       The Supreme Court has repeatedly protected voter education      from Government regulation unless it expressly advocates the      election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.  The letter goes on:       This interpretation ensures that the First Amendment right      of like-minded citizens to discuss issues is not infringed by      federal campaign law. But under S. 1219, this free speech      would be subjected to great uncertainty, and as it is likely      to be interpreted by the FEC, possible illegality. S. 1219      could effectively cripple the Christian Coalition's voter      education activities, including the distribution of voter      guides.  I will not read further from that letter, but I ask unanimous consent the entire letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Christian Coalition,                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1996.     Vote No on Cloture on the McCain-Feingold Campaign Finance          Bill.       Dear Senator: Tomorrow the Senate will vote on whether to      invoke cloture on S. 1219, the McCain-Feingold campaign      finance bill. Christian Coalition strongly urges you to vote      NO on cloture. Contrary to the letter sent out by Senators      McCain, Feingold, and Thompson on June 19, the amended      version of S. 1219 still contains the flawed provisions that      seriously threaten voter guides. The voter guide problem has      NOT been corrected.       The amended S. 1219 continues to place the First Amendment      right to educate the public on the issues in serious      jeopardy. It redefines ``express advocacy'' so that for the      first time ever the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) would      regulate issue advocacy by citizens groups.       The Supreme Court has repeatedly protected voter education      from government regulation unless it ``expressly advocates''      the election or defeat of a clearly identified candidate.      This interpretation ensures that the First Amendment right of      like-minded citizens to discuss issues is not infringed by      federal campaign law. But under S. 1219, this free speech      would be subjected to great uncertainty, and as it is likely      to be interpreted by the FEC, possible illegality. S. 1219      could effectively cripple the Christian Coalition's voter      education activities, including the distribution of voter      guides.       Although the sponsors of this legislation have amended the      bill to exempt the distribution of elected officials' voting      records (vote ratings and congressional scorecards), the new      provision still threatens the distribution of candidates'      positions on the issues (voter guides).       This new definition of express advocacy is but just one of      the bill's many egregious provisions. Under subsection (a) of      Section 241, the expenditures made by a Christian Coalition      chapter leader for voter education could be considered      contributions to a candidate if that same chapter leader      happened to merely retain the same lawyer or accountant as      a candidate, even though the chapter leader did not      cooperate or consult with the candidate at all.       Section 211 is so broadly written that it could prevent a      Christian Coalition chapter leader from also holding a local      party position even though the two activities are separate      and not interrelated.       Section 306 would give the FEC the authority to seek      injunctions if it believes ``there is a substantial      likelihood that a violation . . . is about to occur.'' Such a      prior restraint of free speech is unconstitutional. It is      only justified in weighty cases such as national security      concerns, but should never be permitted to prevent core      political free speech. The free speech rights of citizen      organizations should not be infringed by the FEC at the      eleventh hour of an election.       The Christian Coalition does not have a political action      committee. However, as a free speech issue, we believe      citizens should be able to pool resources to form political      action committees under reasonable restrictions. We therefore      object to section 201.       On behalf of the members and supporters of the Christian      Coalition, we strongly urge you to vote on the side of the      First Amendment and free speech. Please vote NO on cloture.      Thank you for your attention to our concerns.           Sincerely,                                                 Brian Lopina,                                                         Director,                                      Governmental Affairs Office.  Mr. McCONNELL. In addition to that, the National Right to Life Committee, in a letter dated June 22, says that it has ``* * * analyzed the new substitute and finds that, to an even greater degree than the original bill, it rides roughshod over the First Amendment.'' The National Right to Life Committee also opposes this bill.  I will not read further from that letter, but I ask unanimous consent the entire letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 National Right to                                         Life Committee, Inc.,                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 1996.     Re In opposition to McCain-Feingold substitute (S. 1219) to          regulate and restrict political speech.     Senator Mitch McConnell,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On June 18, we sent you a letter      expressing the strong opposition of the National Right to      Life Committee (NRLC) to the McCain-Feingold ``campaign      reform'' bill (S. 1219). Since then, the sponsors have      produced a new substitute amendment, on which the Senate will      conduct a cloture vote on Tuesday, June 25, at 2:15 p.m.       NRLC has analyzed the new substitute and finds that, to an      even greater degree than the original bill, it rides      roughshod over the First Amendment. Through multiple overt      and covert devices, the substitute attempts to suppress      advertisements, publications, and other forms of speech on      federal public policy issues, including but not limited to      speech that refers to candidates for federal office.      Therefore, NRLC again urges you to vote No on the motion to      invoke cloture on S. 1219, which will be scored as a key pro-     life vote for the 104th Congress.       The substitute bans PACs and therefore bans independent      expenditures--except for political parties and rich      individuals. [Sec. 201] This ban would prevent citizens of      ordinary financial means from effectively expressing their      political viewpoints.       If the PAC ban is declared unconstitutional, the substitute      contains ``backup'' provisions to suppress independent      expenditures by requiring advance notice of intended      expenditures--even though some of those expenditures will      never actually occur [Sec. 242(3)]--and by rewarding      candidates who are thought to be disadvantaged by independent      expenditures [Sec. 101].       In addition, the substitute [Sec. 241] says that an      independent expenditure can no longer be conducted at all by      anyone who ``has played a significant role in advising or      counseling the candidate's agent at any time on the      candidate's plans, projects, or needs relating to the      candidate's pursuit of nomination for election, or election,      to Federal office, in the same election cycle, including any      advice relating to the candidate's desision to seek Federal      office.'' [emphasis added] In other words, any person or      group that remarked to a potential candidate, ``We'd like      you to consider running for Congress,'' would thereby      trigger a ``gag rule'' under which any subsequent      independent expenditure on behalf of that candidate would      be illegal. Moreover, this clause could be triggered by      even one-sided communication from an interest group to an      incumbent, discussing (for example) public opinion in a      given state regarding a piece of pending legislation.       The substitute [Sec. 241(a)] seeks to broaden the      definition of ``express advocacy'' far beyond the definition      enunciated by the Supreme Court in Buckley v. Valeo (1976).      The bill would enact the ``taken-as-whole' test that has been      rejected by the federal courts on constitutional grounds.      Under this expansive definition, the bill would restrict the      distribution of issue-oriented material that does not, in      fact, urge the election or defeat of any candidate.       In a June 19 ``Dear Colleague'' letter Senators McCain,      Feingold, and Thompson said that they added a provision to      exempt ``voting guides'' from the bill's restrictions, but      the actual provision in the substitute is vastly narrower      than what is described in the ``Dear Colleague'' letter. The      purported ``exemption'' [see Sec. 241(a)] applies only to ``a      communication that is limited to providing information about      votes by elected officials on legislative matters.'' On its      face, this ostensible ``exemption'' does not apply to      information regarding the public policy positions of non-     incumbents, or to dissemination of any information on      candidates' positions obtained from press accounts, candidate      questionnaires, speeches, interviews, or a host of other      sources. Moreover, even the purported exemption for      information on ``votes'' is effectively meaningless because      of other provisions and definitions in the bill, such as the      definition of what constitutes a ``contribution'' to a      candidate (see below).       The substitute [Sec. 241(b)(3)] would restrict ads and      other forms of speech that contain no reference whatever to      an election or even to any candidate, by defining certain      speech on legislative issues as a contribution to a like-     minded candidate with whom there has been communication      regarding those issues. For example, if NRLC communicated      with a senator regarding the merits of a certain abortion-     related bill, which the senator     later voted for, and if NRLC later ran advertisements in that      senator's state discussing that bill, this could be regarded      as a ``contribution'' to the incumbent (even if the senator      is not mentioned in the ad), and therefore subject to all of      the other restrictions and penalty clauses in the bill. The      costs of non-partisan voter guides that contain information      obtained from candidate questionnaires or other      communications with an incumbent or a challenger could also      be regarded as ``contributions'' under this provision.       The substitute [Sec. 306] explicitly authorizes the Federal      Elections Commission, if it believes ``there is a substantial      likelihood that a violation of this Act is occurring or is      about to occur,'' to obtain a temporary restraining order or      temporary injunction to prevent publication, distribution, or      broadcast of material that the FEC believes to be outside the      bounds of the types of political speech that would be      permitted under the law. This authorization for prior      restraint of speech violates the First Amendment.       The overall effect of the bill would be to greatly enhance      the already formidable power of media elites and of very      wealthy individuals to ``set the agenda'' for public      political discourse--at the expense of the ability of      ordinary citizens to make their voices heard in the political      process.       Therefore, the National Right to Life Committee urges you      to vote No on cloture on S. 1219. Because S. 1219's      restrictions on independent expenditures and voter education      activities would ``gag'' the pro-life movement from      effectively raising right-to-life issues in the political      realm, NRLC will ``score'' this vote as a key pro-life vote      for the 104th Congress.       Thank you for your consideration of NRLC's concerns      regarding this legislation.           Sincerely,     David N. O'Steen, Ph.D.,                                               Executive Director.     Douglas Johnson,                                             Legislative Director.     Carol Long,                                                Director, NRL-PAC.  Mr. McCONNELL. Interestingly enough, a group with which I have not frequently been allied, and not many Members of this side of the aisle have been allied, the National Education Association, sent a letter to me dated yesterday, June 24, in which the NEA stated it opposed this bill and called upon all Senators to vote against cloture. The NEA pointed out, in referring to the ban on political action committees, that ``The average contribution of NEA members who contribute to NEA-PAC is under $6.'' So, their question is, How in the world is that bad for the political process. So they, too, oppose this legislation and urge a vote against cloture.  I will not read further from that letter, but I ask unanimous consent the entire letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                               National Education Association,                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1996.     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: The National Education Association (NEA)      opposes S. 1219, the Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act of      1996, sponsored by Senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Russell      Feingold (D-WI). This measure would hamper the ability of      citizens to participate in the political process in a      meaningful way and limit the ability of organizations to make      their voices heard in an open, democratic process.       Political action committees have encouraged millions of      Americans to become involved in the political system, many      for the first time. Many Americans are able to make small      political contributions that serve as entree into greater      political participation. Individuals are more likely to work      for a candidate or issue when they have contributed money,      and they are more inclined to make a contribution when they      know it will make a difference in the outcome.       Political action committees stimulate small, individual      donations. The average contribution of NEA members who      contribute to NEA-PAC is under $6. These small contributions      from middle-income citizens help counterbalance the ability      of wealthy individuals to influence policymakers. Eliminating      political action committees would not reduce the importance      of money in politics. It would reduce the importance of      working people in politics.       Political action committees also play an important role in      communicating with members of organizations about issues that      affect them. NEA would resist any effort to constrain the      ability of the Association--or any other organization--to      communicate with members and candidates about issues      affecting children, public education, and education      employees.       NEA strongly supports campaign finance reform that      encourages participation and requires full disclosure of all      sources of political financing. Moreover, we support partial      public financing of election campaigns as a means of leveling      the playing field for challengers and incumbents. S. 1219      would weaken efforts to increase voter participation, limit      the involvement of low- and middle-income citizens in the      political process, and discourage efforts to educate and      engage the electorate. We urge you to oppose cloture on S.      1219, and should the Senate vote on the measure, to oppose it      and its substitute.           Sincerely,                                           Mary Elizabeth Teasley,                                 Director of Government Relations.  Mr. McCONNELL. The National Rifle Association, in a letter dated yesterday, said:       We have examined the draft text of that possible substitute      [the bill that is actually before us today] and our      opposition . . . is not only unabated--it is, if anything,      stronger than before.  So the National Rifle Association also urges a vote against cloture because they believe it adversely affects their ability to participate in the political process.  I will not read further from that letter, but I ask unanimous consent the entire letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        National Rifle Association                                                   of America,                                       Fairfax, VA, June 24, 1996.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: We understand that an amendment in      the nature of a substitute may be offered during this week's      debate on S. 1219, the Senate campaign finance bill. As you      know, we have repeatedly expressed our opposition to S. 1219,      as we believe it unjustifiably and unconstitutionally      restricts the First Amendment right of organizations to      communicate with their members and the general public in the      political process.       We have examined the draft text of that possible substitute      amendment and our opposition to S. 1219 is not only      unabated--it is, if anything, stronger than before. The ban      on activities of political action committees remains in the      substitute, and would have a devastating effect on the      ability of ordinary citizens such as our members to act      jointly in support of candidates.       Additionally, the new proposed reporting requirements for      independent expenditures, and the provisions intended to      dilute the effect of such expenditures, would have a chilling      impact on the effectiveness of such communications. Coupled      with the continuing effort to broadly redefine ``express      advocacy,'' Sections 241 and 242 represent one of the      broadest attacks on free speech rights seen in years,      affecting not only electoral but other legislative      communications. Giving the Federal Election Commission a      power to engage in prior restraint makes the attack even more      serious.       We appreciate the support for the right to free speech      which you've shown in your opposition to S. 1219, and we urge      you to continue your work on this very important issue. If      there is anything we can do to be of assistance to you,      please don't hesitate to call.           Sincerely,                                                 Tanya K. Metaksa,                                               Executive Director.  Mr. McCONNELL. Also, obviously the National Association of Business PAC's, NAB-PAC, which would essentially be put out of business and lose their ability to participate in the political process, opposes the bill.  The American Conservative Union and the Conservative Victory Fund oppose it as well. I will not read from those letters, but I ask unanimous consent the letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      The American                                           Conservative Union,                                    Alexandria, VA, June 25, 1996.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: On behalf of the one million      members and supporters of the American Conservative Union, I      urge you to oppose S. 1219, the McCain-Feingold campaign      finance reform act.       As a party to the seminal Buckley v. Valeo decision, ACU      has had a long-standing interest in our nation's campaign      finance system. Over the years, we have worked with many      Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to try to      reform the system in a manner consistent with constitutional      guarantees of free speech--even as we have opposed efforts to      change the system in a manner which abridges those freedoms.       McCain-Feingold does just that. Its fundamental reliance on      spending limits--whether ``voluntary'' or otherwise--is      merely the worst of its many wrong-headed provisions. The      problem with our current system is not that too much money is      raised and spent; as countless studies have shown, we spend      as a nation far more to advertise products such as soft      drinks and potato chips in a given year than we do on all      campaign spending combined. Do you really want to vote for      spending limits and in effect tell your constituents that as      far as you're concerned, their decision over which soft drink     to purchase is more important than which leaders to choose?       Rather, the problem in our current system of campaign      financing is that too much time is spent collecting the      amounts of money needed to compete effectively in a      competitive marketplace. Because of the contribution limits      enacted in the Federal Election Campaign Act, too many      candidates spend too much time chasing too few dollars--which      is what gives special interest groups a disproportionate      influence over legislators. If what you are really seeking is      a way to reduce the influence of the special interests,      simply lift the contribution limits.       But McCain-Feingold's reliance on spending limits is not      its only fault. Other wrong-headed provisions include      taxpayer subsidization of both print and broadcast      communications, and the bill's outright abolition of      political action committees. Public subsidies amount to      partial taxpayer financing of politicians--something      overwhelmingly opposed by the American people. Nor should      PACs be abolished; to do so would be an unconstitutional      infringement on the rights of free association and free      speech.       McCain-Feingold is a bad bill. Kill it and start over.           Yours sincerely,                                                   David A. Keene,     Chairman.                                                                    ____                                    Conservative Victory Fund,                                    Washington, DC, April 2, 1996.     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman: I want to bring to your attention a bill      that would bring irreparable damage to the political process.      Congresswoman Linda Smith has introduced HR 2566 which bans      contributions from political action committees to individuals      running for Congress. I'm deeply concerned about this.       In 1976, the Supreme Court ruled in Buckley v. Valeo that      campaign finance restrictions burdened First Amendment      rights. The only purpose recognized by the Supreme Court to      justify restrictions on PAC contributions is the prevention      of real or apparent corruption.       Most of the arguments used for additional limits on      political contributions from political action committees do      not stand up under scrutiny. Originally, the goal of campaign      finance reform was to reduce the influence of money, to open      up the political system, and to lower the cost of campaigns.      Since the 1974 amendments to the Federal Election Campaign      Act, which were done in the name of ``campaign finance      reform'', spending has risen sharply and incumbents have      increased both their reelection rate and the rate at which      they outspend their challengers.       As you know when you first ran for Congress, money is of      much greater value to open-seat candidates or challengers      than to incumbents. Studies show that added incumbent      spending is likely to have less effect on vote totals than      the challenger's added spending. Limits on political      contributions hamper challengers from getting their voice      heard while incumbents have significant advantages in name      recognition. Campaign finance laws lock into place the      advantages of incumbency and disproportionately harm      challengers.       We oppose HR 2566 and any other such bills. The First      Amendment is based on the belief that political speech is too      important to be regulated by the government. The Conservative      Victory Fund has helped you and hundreds of other      conservatives since its creation in 1969. HR 2566 would      eliminate the Conservative Victory Fund.           Sincerely,                                                Ronald W. Pearson,                                               Executive Director.  Mr. McCONNELL. So there are a number of groups who, in the past, have largely not been heard from during these debates who have decided to take a position, to get interested, and to express their views. This is, of course, something we greatly welcome since--the point I would like to make--obviously this bill not only affects candidates for office, it affects everybody's ability to participate in the political system. These groups do not like our effort to push them out of the process. They do not feel that their involvement in politics is a harmful thing. They think it is protected by the first amendment, and I think they are right.  Also, just in closing, I see the Senator from Utah is ready to take a few moments or more, if he would like. One of my biggest adversaries on this issue, over the last decade, has been my hometown newspaper, the Louisville Courier-Journal, which is the largest newspaper in our State. I was amazed to pick up the paper this morning and read an editorial in which they even think this is a bad bill. They even think this is a bad bill. This is the most liberal newspaper in Kentucky. I was astonished. Obviously, it made my day.  I would like to read a couple of comments. They are predicting the cloture will not be invoked. They say, ``This outcome would be more regrettable if the bill were better.'' They go on to say:       [Most] . . . of the rest of the package would be a step      back from real reform, while making the election finance      regulatory effort more complex and of less service to the      public.  Further, they say:       The abolition of those endlessly maligned PAC's would make      special interest money harder to trace while denying small      givers a chance to participate. A limit on out-of-state      contributions sounds good, but it could cut two ways. Indeed,      it would probably be more damaging to candidates who      challenge the local powers-that-be than one who thrives on      special interest support. Anyway, both provisions are surely      unconstitutional.  They are right about that.       As for a scheme to lure candidates to limit spending by      offering them free TV time contributed by the networks, it's      simply wrong to foist the cost of cleaner government on a      handful of businesses--and their advertisers, stockholders      and viewers. If there's a cost to election reform, it should      be borne by all taxpayers.  It is a curious ally but I am proud to have them on board.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that other letters of opposition in addition to those I referred to a few moments ago, as well as the editorial of today in the Louisville Courier-Journal, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                         Reform's Tired Refrain       As the U.S. Senate convenes today for yet another vote on      election finance ``reform,'' the setting is all too familiar.       The measure is backed by liberal and conservative members      of Congress--including Republicans who, in response to public      disgust with incumbent Democrats, promised to change the      money system. Good government and citizens groups complain--     legitimately--that the national legislature is awash in vast      sums of money given by favor seekers.       The likely result? That's expected to be a rerun, too.      Barring unexpected strength among the reformers, a filibuster      organized by Mitch McConnell will halt Senate action. In any      event, the House probably won't find time to act this year.       This outcome would be more regrettable if the bill were      better. Sadly, it has only one good provision--an end to the      ``soft money'' scam that allows corporations and labor unions      to give political parties millions of dollars, purportedly      for vague ``party-building'' activities. If this reform alone      survives, Congress could claim some progress.       But much of the rest of the package would be a step back      from real reform, while making the election finance      regulatory effort more complex and of less service to the      public.       The abolition of those endlessly maligned PACs would make      special interest money harder to trace while denying small      givers a chance to participate. A limit on out-of-state      contributions sounds good, but it could cut two ways. Indeed,      it would probably be more damaging to a candidate who      challenges the local powers-that-be than to one who thrives      on special interest support. Anyway, both provisions are      surely unconstitutional.       As for a scheme to lure candidates to limit spending by      offering them free TV time contributed by the networks, it's      simply wrong to foist the cost of cleaner government on a      handful of businesses--and viewers. If there's a cost to      election reform, it should be borne by all taxpayers.       It may be, indeed, that Congress is incapable of devising      workable change. And that may matter less and less.       The good news is that Kentucky and other states are      experimenting with new approaches to paying for campaigns. To      the extent that states are also developing solutions to      welfare and other national problems--a positive trend in our      view--a national political establishment wallowing in dollars      showered on it by Philip Morris, RJR Nabisco and others      becomes increasingly irrelevant.                                                                    ____                                        National Rifle Association                                                   of America,                                       Fairfax, VA, June 24, 1996.       Dear Senator: We understand that an amendment in the nature      of a substitute may be offered during this week's debate on      S. 1219, the Senate campaign finance bill. As you know, we      have repeatedly expressed our opposition to S. 1219, as we      believe it unjustifiably and unconstitutionally restricts the      First Amendment right of organizations to communicate with      their members and the general public in the political      process.       We have examined the draft text of that possible substitute      amendment and our opposition to S. 1219 is not only      unabated--it is, if anything, stronger than before. The ban      on activities of political action committees remains in the      substitute, and would have a devastating effect on the      ability of ordinary citizens such as our members to act      jointly in support of candidates.       Additionally, the new proposed reporting requirements for      independent expenditures, and the provisions intended to      dilute the effect of such expenditures, would have a chilling      impact on the effectiveness of such communications. Coupled      with the continuing effort to broadly redefine ``express      advocacy,'' Sections 241 and 242 represent one of the      broadest attacks on free speech rights     seen in years, affecting not only electoral but other      legislative communications. Giving the Federal Election      Commission a power to engage in prior restraint makes the      attack even more serious.       We urge you to oppose S. 1219's attack on the right of free      political speech. If there is anything we can do to be of      assistance to you, please don't hesitate to call.           Sincerely,                                                 Tanya K. Metaksa,     Executive Director.                                                                    ____         Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 1996.       Members of the U.S. Senate: The Senate will soon be asked      to consider S. 1219, the ``Senate Campaign Finance Reform Act      of 1995.'' The United States Chamber of Commerce Federation      of 215,000 businesses, 3,000 state and local chambers of      commerce, 1,200 trade and professional associations, and 76      American Chambers of Commerce abroad urges your opposition to      this legislation, which would restrict the participation by      Political Action Committees (PACs) and individuals in the      political process.       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has long promoted individual      freedom and broad-scale participation by citizens in the      election of our public officeholders. In this regard, we      oppose efforts to eliminate or restrict the involvement of      PACs in our political process. We believe that PACs are a      critical tool by which individuals voluntarily participate in      support of their collective belief.       In addition, there are other proposals contained in the      bill that would greatly inhibit long-standing protected      freedoms. These attempts to further limit the ability of      individuals or collective political participation should be      defeated as an infringement on the basic principle of free      speech. Further, a public mandate on the private sector to      subsidize the election of public officials without regard to      support for a candidate also must be defeated.       We believe that an indispensable element of our      constitutional form of government is the continued power of      the people to control, through the elective process, those      who represent them in the legislative and executive branches      of government. Any attempt to reform the system through      eliminating PACs or further restricting contribution levels      has the consequence of unreasonably restricting the rights of      American citizens. Rather, we support a system that relies on      accountability through public disclosure, voluntary      participation without government mandates, and confidence in      the electorate to make sound decisions through the free      exchange of ideas and information.       Therefore, we urge your opposition to S. 1219, as well as      your opposition to invoking cloture on such legislation,      which seeks to restrict the participation of individuals or      PACS in the political process.           Sincerely,     R. Bruce Josten.                                                                    ____                                        National Rifle Association                                                   of America,                                       Fairfax, VA, June 19, 1996.       Dear Senator: It is our understanding that a cloture vote      has been scheduled for June 25, 1996 on S. 1219, the Senate      Campaign Finance Reform Act. We believe this will be the most      critical vote that you will cast this year in protecting the      constitutional rights of your constituents. Speaking for the      more than three million members of the National Rifle      Association (NRA), we strongly urge you to vote against      bringing this measure, or this issue, before the Senate in      any form. S. 1219 is a misguided attempt to limit      participation in the political process, and represents a      direct challenge to the right of free speech which we all      should cherish and strive to protect.       Those who support S. 1219 have suggested that it will      enlarge or enhance participation in the political process. We      believe those who promote this view are either misinformed or      unaware of the consequences of this legislation. In fact, S.      1219 will not level the political playing field, but will      rather increase opporunities for political manipulation by      those who have access to national media outlets, at the      expense of those who do not.       The main focus of the NRA is in protecting the right to      keep and bear arms. However, we believe that our system of      government depends on preserving all of our Constitutional      protections. Associations like the NRA facilitate      participation by concerned citizens who otherwise would not      have the resources to speak out on a national level. By      removing their ability to offer their views in independent      forums by combining their individual resources you would, for      all intents and purposes, eliminate their First Amendment      rights.       As we have noted in previous correspondence (letters dated      01/25/96 and 05/7/96), in the Buckley v. Valeo decision of      1976, the Supreme Court stated that ``* * * legislative      restriction on advocacy of the election or defeat of      political candidates are wholly at odds with the guarantees      of the First Amendment.'' S. 1219 contains the same kind of      legislative restrictions, and we believe therefore that it is      clearly unconstitutional.       Again, I urge you to reject S. 1219, and all other ill-     conceived attempts at limiting free speech and participation      in the political process.           Sincerely,                                                 Tanya K. Metaksa,     Executive Director.                                                                    ____                                                 National Right to                                         Life Committee, Inc.,                                    Washington, DC, June 18, 1996.       Dear Senator: We understand that the Senate is likely to      vote on or about June 25 on whether to invoke cloture on the      McCain-Feingold bill (S. 1219), which would make sweeping      changes in federal election laws.       The National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) is strongly      opposed to S. 1219. In banning PACs, the bill also bans      independent expenditures--except by wealthy individuals. This      provision would flagrantly violate the First Amendment right      of individual citizens who share a common viewpoint on an      important public policy issue, such as abortion, to pool      their modest financial resources in order to participate      effectively in the democratic process. The average donation      to NRL-PAC is $31.       The bill would also place severe new limitations even on      issue-oriented voter education materials that do not urge the      election or defeat of any candidate. This, too, violates the      First Amendment. The overall effect of S. 1219 would be to      greatly enhance the already formidable power of media elites      and of very wealthy individuals to ``set the agenda'' for      public political discourse--at the expense of the ability of      ordinary citizens to make their voices heard in the political      process.       Therefore, the National Right to Life Committee urges you      to vote No on cloture on S. 1219. Because S. 1219's      restrictions on independent expenditures and voter education      activities would ``gag'' the pro-life movement from      effectively raising right-to-life issues in the political      realm, NRLC will ``score'' this vote as a key pro-life vote      for the 104th Congress.       A vote in opposition to S. 1219 is consistent with the      position taken by the U.S. Supreme Court in its 1976 Buckley      v. Valeo decision: ``In the free society ordained by our      Constitution, it is not the government, but the people--     individually as citizens and candidates and collectively as      associations and political committees--who must retain      control over the quantity and range of debate on public      issues in a political campaign.''       Moreover, the overwhelming majority of Americans oppose the      concept embodied in S. 1219. The Wirthlin Worldwide firm      conducted a nationwide poll on May 28-30, which included this      question:       ``Do you believe that it should be legal for individuals      and groups to form political action committees to express      their opinions about elements and candidates?''       Yes, should be legal: 83%.       No, should not be legal: 13%.       Thank you for your consideration of NRLC's concerns      regarding this legislation.           Sincerely,     Douglas Johnson,                                             Legislative Director.     Carol Long,     Director, NRL-PAC.                                                                    ____                                                 National Right to                                         Life Committee, Inc.,                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 1996.       Dear Member of Congress: The House Oversight Committee will      soon mark up some form of ``campaign finance reform''      legislation. The committee will consider, among other things,      proposals to either (1) ban PACs and thereby also ban      independent expenditures, or (2) not ban PACs, but place new      restrictions on independent expenditures.       National Right to Life Committee (NRLC) is strongly opposed      to any legislation that would further restrict independent      expenditures, whether by banning PACs or in any other      fashion. Such proposals would infringe on the First Amendment      rights of individual citizens, sharing a common viewpoint on      an important public policy issue, to pool their modest      financial resources in order to participate effectively in      the democratic process.       As you review various ``campaign reform'' proposals during      the weeks ahead, please keep in mind the words of the Supreme      Court in its 1976 Buckley v. Valeo decision:       ``In the free society ordained by our Constitution, it is      not the government, but the people--individually as citizens      and candidates and collectively as associations and political      committees--who must retain control over the quantity and      range of debate on public issues in a political campaign.''       The Wirthlin Group conducted a nationwide poll on May 28-     30, which included this question:       ``Do you believe that it should be legal for individuals      and groups to form political action committees to express      their opinions about elections and candidates?''       Yes, should be legal, 83%.       No, should not be legal, 13%.       Thank you for your consideration of NRLC's concerns      regarding this legislation.           Sincerely,     Douglas Johnson,                                             Legislative Director.     Carol Long,     Director, NRL-PAC.                                                                    ____                                                 National Right to                                         Life Committee, Inc.,                                                   April 30, 1996.       Dear Senator: You are being pressured by so-called ``public      interest'' groups to pass campaign finance reform measures      under the guise of ``cleaning up the system.'' More      specifically, you are being asked to support a floor vote on      S. 1219, the McCain-Feingold-Wellstone bill.       We urge you to oppose S. 1219. Attorneys that span the      ideological spectrum agree that S. 1219 would destroy free      speech and grievously injure both the right to association      and the right to petition government.       It is a myth that the American public is clamoring for      campaign finance reform. In a recent poll conducted by the      Tarrance Group, only one person, out of 1000, volunteered      campaign finance reform as the biggest problem facing the      country. When the poll respondents were given a list of 10      problems and asked to rank them, campaign finance reform came      in last, with only 1% selecting that topic.       Under S. 1219, an individual would be able to make      independent expenditures, but because of the ban on political      action committees, a group of individuals would be forbidden      to organize, pool their resources, and coordinate their      activities. This would leave the political process open to      very wealthy individuals and the media, but would prohibit      the vast majority of citizens from effectively making their      voices heard.       S. 1219 defines ``express advocacy'' so broadly as to sweep      in ``issue advocacy.'' Thus, citizens' groups would, in      effect, be prohibited from publishing voter guides or giving      candidates' voting records. Several federal courts have      already struck down attempts by the Federal Election      Commission to do the same thing.       Free speech is essential to democracy. It is important not      only for the press and wealthy individuals, but also for      ordinary citizens. We urge you to take any steps necessary,      including opposing cloture, to prevent S. 1219 or any similar      measure that infringes upon the First Amendment rights of      citizens from being approved by the Senate.       We also oppose the appointment of any unelected commission      that has the authority to issue a final report on campaign      finance reform that would not be subject to the regular      amendment process on the Senate floor.

Senator Mitch McConnell,     Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator McConnell: Campaign finance ``reform'' that      destroys the freedom of speech is not reform.       Current measures under consideration in the Senate would      largely prevent citizen involvement in the political process.      We realize there is a lot of pressure from the press to      ``reform'' the election process. However, limiting free      speech for citizens, while it may please some elements in the      press because it greatly increases their own power, is      neither politically wise nor constitutional.       We have the three major objections to S. 1219, the ``Senate      Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1995'' as sponsored by      Senators McCain and Feingold, and therefore will vigorously      oppose this measure.1. S. 1219 would almost eliminate involvement in the political process         for ordinary citizens who are not independently wealthy       S. 1219 would permit only individuals, or political      committees organized by candidates and political parties, to      solicit contributions or make expenditures ``for the purpose      of influencing an election for Federal office.''       Many political action committees (PAC), such as the      National Right to Life PAC, exist because their members want      to work together to elect candidates who share their views      and beliefs. Under the current system, citizens are free to      coordinate activities through PACs in order to discuss      issues, express their views on positions taken by candidates,      and urge voters to support or oppose certain candidates. This      dialogue is very important to the political process and very      important to the American system.       Under the Act, an individual can make independent      expenditures, but a group of individuals cannot organize and      coordinate their activities. This opens the political process      to wealthy individuals, but prohibits the vast majority of      citizens from pooling resources to make their voices heard.       If citizen groups and their political action committees are      eliminated, the only entities left that are freely able to      discuss candidates and the issues, except the candidates      themselves, are a few wealthy individuals and the news media.      That is not the intention of the First Amendment.       Another problem for you to consider is that many in the      media have a bias against pro-life and pro-family candidates.      If the media is allowed free speech and citizens groups are      not, that will be a real disadvantage for pro-life and pro-     family candidates. 2. the new definition of ``express advocacy'' is unconstitutional and                  represses the free speech of citizens       Section 251 of S. 1219 attempts to ``clarify'' Independent      Expenditures, However, it redefines ``express advocacy'' to      now include protected ``issue advocacy.''. This extremely      broad new definition of express advocacy would sweep in      protected issue advocacy, such as voter guides which state      the positions candidates have taken on issues or give      candidates' voting records.       The new definition goes far beyond what the United States      Supreme Court said was permissible to regulate as      electioneering in the case of Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1      (1976). In Buckley, the Supreme Court held that, in order to      protect issue advocacy (which is protected by the First      Amendment), government may only regulate election activity      where there are explicit words advocating the election or      defeat of a clearly identified candidate.       This new definition would expand the umbrella of ``express      advocacy'' so broadly that citizen groups other than PACs      would also be effectively prohibited from informing the      public about candidates' positions on issues as well as      voting records. This curtailment of citizens' freedom of      speech would not affect the major media whose political power      would be vastly enhanced, since one balancing force currently      in the public forum would be eliminated.       The Supreme Court would, again likely find this new      definition of ``express advocacy'' unconstitutional, and      voters would find it exceedingly repressive.         3. s. 1219 authorizes unconstitutional prior restraint       Section 306 of the Act authorizes an injunction where there      is a ``substantial likelihood that a violation . . . is about      to occur.'' The FEC would be authorized to seek injunctions      against expenditures which, in the FEC's expansive view,      could influence an election. Such a preemptive action against      the freedom of speech is unconstitutional except in the case      of national security or similarly weighty situations. Prior      restraint should never be allowed in connection with core      political speech. There simply is no governmental interest of      sufficient magnitude to justify the government stopping      persons from speaking.       This country's open system of representative democracy is      the envy of the world. If you try to ``fix'' it by limiting      people's voices, then you head towards totalitarianism.      Whatever its flaws, democracy is the best system the world      has seen to date.       Free speech is essential to democracy. It is important not      only for the press and wealthy individuals, but also for      ordinary citizens. The only way ordinary citizens can have      any meaningful opportunity to exercise their right of free      political speech in modern America is if they are allowed to      pool their funds in PACs. For the record, the average      donation from National Right to Life members to its PAC is      $31.       The status quo on speech by membership organizations and      independent expenditures by political action committees      works. Disclosure laws governing PACs already provide      detailed information on where the money came from and how it      was spent. The current process allows citizens to be involved      in their government. That it how it should be.
