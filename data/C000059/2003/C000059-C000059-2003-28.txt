Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2040, introduced by the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Osborne), extends specific water contracts between the Bureau of Reclamation and water contractors in Nebraska and Wyoming. This legislation responds to continuing work on a multiparty agreement aimed at restoring habitat for endangered species on the Platte River.  While these good-faith efforts take place, the irrigators have asked for repayment certainty until a clear regulatory water-use road map is put in place. This is a good bill, and I urge my colleagues to support this consensus-based bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
