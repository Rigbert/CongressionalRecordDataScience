 President, let me wrap it up for myself by saying that we will be staying on this bill. We will not leave this bill.  Secondly, this is a bipartisan compromise that came out of the Intelligence Committee by a vote of 13 to 2, the Rockefeller-Bond bipartisan bill, which is supported by the President of the United States. That is the Senate at its best--a bipartisan bill. The President is willing to sign it. Our efforthere is to get it to him for his signature. He awaits our action.  I yield the floor.
