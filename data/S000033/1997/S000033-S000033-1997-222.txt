 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Enosburg High School in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Ms. Ludlum: Good afternoon, Congressman Sanders. It is      generally acknowledge that an educated citizenry is a desired      thing for the United States. It is needless to say that it is      imperative in this age of globalization. Through it the      skills, knowledge and value of our democratic capitalistic      system are imparted to the next generation, thus enabling us      to better compete globally. However, many American public      schools are not adequately preparing their students. Too many      graduates of American high schools are ill prepared to      compete in the global marketplace. The question is how best      to fix this?       Ms. Stanley: There are many educational models, theories      and philosophies to make public schools more effective. While      educational theorists, politicians and practitioners are      locked into a constant tug of war over the most effective      practices to follow. Students needs and wants are not being      met. Without a school choice most students are simply along      for the ride. Those who wish to get a education which meets      their needs and wants must wait until they graduate from high      school. At that point they can, within the limits of their      financial needs, attend the school of their choice. But why      wait until then? why not extend school choice to all high      school students or for that matter to all students?       Mr. Whitehead: To an extent we in Vermont are afforded      school choice. The current practice of some communities of      paying tuition for their students to attend middle and high      schools elsewhere is defacto school choice. Unfortunately,      that is only available for students who do not have a middle      or high school in their own communities.       We know that for many of these communities it was      originally a decision driven by economics. However, some of      these communities have since grown, yet have chosen not to      build their own middle and high schools. Why not? To do so      would mean giving up school choice. So now the question is      how could making school choice available to all students help      public schools better accomplish their missions? What else      would be needed to make it work?       Ms. Repstead: Enosburg Junior and Senior High School      benefits from this kind of school choice. Our high school is      a small, rural middle and high school which serves 475      students from six nearby communities. Approximately one-     fourth of the student body is in the middle school and the      remainder of the student body is almost evenly split between      resident and tuition students.       We recently conducted a random study on the question of      school choice. We asked 64 students in grade 6 through 12 to      rank how they felt about school choice and in what grade or      grades that should be an option and what form it should take.      The results were overwhelmingly in favor of school choice by      a margin of 95 percent to 5 percent. When we exclude the      middle grades from the survey the approval rate was even      higher, 98 percent to two percent. The few students who did      not favor school choice were from the community of Enosburg.      The most obvious explanation is loyalty. Tuitioned students      unanimously supported school choice. When considering      responses concerning the grade level in which school choice      would be an option we noted that most students felt it should      be available beginning the year they were in.       Ms. Ludlum: We feel that a voucher program is the only      choice to makes school possible, affordable and effective. We      should extend to all Vermont the option of school choice.      Families can make the types of educational choices they need      and want. It would force public schools to be more      competitive as well as stimulate the development of magnet      and charter schools. Each of the latter two makes it possible      through a variety of educational models to be tested in the      marketplace. They would essentially function as working      models that public schools could emulate.       The people that are supporting it would have to say that      the public schools would have to get better, individual      public schools would have to get better because if they      didn't nobody would attend the schools that weren't up to the      higher standards. Some people say that if public money is      going to private schools then the private schools would lose      control and the government would be able to issue mandates on      them.       In support of school choice people say the competition will      make public schools improve because if they do not improve      they wouldn't get any money from those students who attend,      but in opposition, some people say that private schools      receiving governmental funds would not be a good thing      because the government might then issue mandates and then      would lose what makes them private schools.       Mr. Whitehead. A student who chooses not to go to Enosburg      whether they are from Enosburg or not, if they are from a      different town from Enosburg their town would pay for it and      they would pay as much or roughly as much as they would pay      for a public education to Enosburg.                               ____________________
