 Be aware, if certain key decisionmakers in our own government as well as Baghdad's didn't recognize that Mosul could be taken by ISIL, why depend on those same advisers to plot a forward strategy now? Our policy should be to leave no chessmen off the table.  Today, very, very, very reluctantly, I will support this resolution, but with great misgivings. I hold the sincere hope the administration will hear my pleas to measure up to the full task at hand. Leave no major Sunni interests absent from the daunting political and military coalition that must be forged to be successful in this venture.                              {time}  1730  Mr. McKEON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. McAllister), my friend and colleague.  Mr. McALLISTER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for all his hard work on getting this amendment before us today.  Mr. Speaker, I am very frustrated that I stand before you today and we can wage a war on Ebola, yet we sit back for hours and allow ISIL to wage a war against us.  A ``no'' vote is the easiest vote to cast. We cannot stand back and do nothing while ISIL continues to threaten our national security and terrorizes the Middle East.  Everyone wants to be a general, but now is not the time to argue amongst ourselves. Back home, people think all we do is argue about petty politics and get nothing accomplished. Now is the time to take action and stand unified behind House leadership and deal with this serious threat.  We are dealing with one of the most barbaric terrorist organizations we have seen in years and the American people cannot afford to have Congress go home without authorizing an effective strategy to annihilate ISIL.  This resolution does not appropriate new funding; it simply gives congressional approval to act in the best interest of our national security without acting unilaterally.  It would be a disservice to American citizens and our allies if we continue bickering while ISIL mobilizes and recruits new members. Destroying ISIL requires a coordinated effort to arm and train those fighting our enemies.  As a veteran, I do not want to see my brothers in arms' blood shed and them die in vain for where we have not completed a mission.  Mr. Speaker, 9/11 is a reminder that terrorism does not recognize boundaries. We are the United States. We must stand united to defeat all enemies, both foreign and domestic, when appropriate, on their soil and not ours.  I urge my colleagues to act now and pass this amendment.
