 President, I would just say what we have just done is lock in a vote on the North Korea sanctions bill that has been crafted by Chairman Corker and Senator Gardner, a very important piece of legislation that I am pleased to say the whole Senate thinks ought to be taken up, voted on, and passed. It will be an important change in our policy toward this rogue regime.                          ____________________
