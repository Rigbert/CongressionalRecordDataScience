President, on February 1, I went to the funeral mass for Robert F. Drinan, SJ. Rarely have I been so moved at such at a solemn occasion. This was a joyous celebration of a wonderful man's life.  I knew Bob Drinan before he was a Member of Congress and was referred to as the ``conscience of the Congress.'' I was a young college student when he recruited me to go to Boston College Law School. To make it better, he even offered a scholarship, and as a student with absolutely no money, this was most appealing. I finally called Father Drinan and told him I was going to Georgetown Law School because I especially wanted to be in Washington. He chuckled and said he was giving me absolution, insofar as it was a Jesuit institution.  Throughout the more than 40 years since then, he and I talked often and had some of the most wonderful visits. His interests in life, the United States, the Jesuit mission, and his friends never faded. The last time we saw each other was when I gave a speech in December at the Georgetown Law School, and he came by to hug and greet both Marcelle and me.  I will not try to repeat all of the wonderful things said about him, but I do ask unanimous consent that a tribute to him by Colman McCarthy be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 Father Drinan, Model of Moral Tenacity                          (By Colman McCarthy)       If you've ever wondered whether God laughs, think back to      1980, when the Rev. Robert Drinan was ordered by Pope John      Paul II to get out of politics and leave Congress. The Jesuit      priest, who died on Sunday, was finishing his fifth term      representing a suburban Boston district that included      Cambridge and Brookline. The pope had been hearing from      rankled conservative American Catholics--the Pat Buchanan,      William F. Buckley Jr., William Bennett wing of the church--     that Father Drinan, a purebred Democrat, was a dangerous      liberal. His voting record on abortion was seen as too pro-     choice.       Father Drinan's presence in the House of Representatives      had been sanctioned by the previous pope, Paul VI, as well as      by the U.S. episcopate, the cardinal of Boston, his own      Jesuit superiors and emphatically by the voters in his      district.       No matter.       John Paul, knowing that Jesuits take a vow of loyalty to      popes, had his way. And who replaced the dangerously liberal      Father Drinan? The more dangerously liberal Barney Frank--as      ardent an advocate for abortion rights and as he was for gay      rights. If there is a God, the Frank-for-Drinan trade surely      had Him laughing at the Vatican's expense.       From Congress, Bob Drinan went a few blocks to Georgetown      University Law Center.       It was a natural transition, from practicing the politics      of peace and justice to teaching it. His classes on human      rights law, constitutional law and legal ethics were      routinely oversubscribed. Though I had met him before his      days in Congress, when he served as dean of Boston College      Law School, it was at Georgetown Law that our friendship      grew. My classes there for the past 20 years have attracted      the same kind of students that his did--future public-     interest lawyers, poverty lawyers, human-rights lawyers, and,      in good years, a future Jack Olender or William Kunstler.       After my Tuesday afternoon class, I would often go by Bob      Drinan's fourth-floor office to get energized. I saw him as a      towering moral giant, a man of faith whose practice of      Christianity put him in the company of all my Jesuit heroes--     Daniel Berrigan, Horace McKenna, Teilhard de Chardin, John      Dear, Francis Xavier, the martyred Jesuits of El Salvador and      the priests who taught me in college. In his office,      ferociously unkempt and as tight as a monk's cell, our      conversation ranged from politics to law to the morning's      front pages. He was as knowledgeable about the Torture Victim      Protection Act of 1991 as he was about the many allegations      of international lawbreaking by the current Bush      administration. Bob Drinan had mastered the art of being      professionally angry but personally gentle.       As a priest, he was a pastor-at-large. He was at the altar      at journalist Mary McGrory's funeral Mass. He celebrated the      Nuptial Mass at the marriage of Rep. Jim McGovern (D-Mass.)      and his wife, Lisa. And always, there were plenty of      baptisms. As a writer, he produced a steady flow of books on      human rights, poverty and social justice. He saved his most      fiery writing for the National Catholic Reporter, the      progressive weekly to which he contributed a regular column.      His final one appeared on Dec. 15, a piece about the 26th      anniversary of the martyrdom in El Salvador of Maryknoll      Sister Ita Ford.       The column began: ``In the 1980s I gave a lecture at Jesuit      Regis High School in New York City, where the students are      all on scholarship. I spoke about the war being waged by the      Reagan administration against the alleged communists of El      Salvador.       ``In the discussion period, three students took issue with      my remarks, making it clear that they and their families      agreed with the U.S. policy of assisting the Salvadoran      government. The atmosphere was almost hostile until one      student stood and related that his aunt, Maryknoll Sister Ita      Ford, had been murdered by agents of the government of El      Salvador. I have seldom if ever witnessed such an abrupt      change in the atmosphere of a meeting.''       One of my students at Georgetown Law last semester was also      one of Father Drinan's: Chris Neumeyer, a former high school      teacher from California. His father, Norris Neumeyer, was in      town earlier this month and wanted to meet his hero, Father      Drinan. The two lucked out and found the priest in his      office. Yesterday, Norris Neumeyer, after learning of the      priest's death, e-mailed his son and recalled asking if      Father Drinan knew his often-jailed fellow Jesuit Daniel      Berrigan and his brother Philip. He did. The difference      between himself and the Berrigans, Father Drinan believed,      was that they took action outside the system while he took      action inside.       Papal meddling aside, it was enduring action.                                 ____________________
