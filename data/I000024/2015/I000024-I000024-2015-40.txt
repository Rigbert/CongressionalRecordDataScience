I am going to put myself at the end of the line so that everyone else can get in there first. The order is going to be Senator Boxer, and I understand she might want to share a little time with the Senator from Florida. Then Senator Lee from Utah, Senator Enzi after that, and then whoever else wants to talk. If nobody else wants to talk, then I will wind it up.  Before I turn it over to Senator Boxer, I am going to tell a story because I want to make sure that Senator Sullivan doesn't have to wait for 2 hours to hear it. Ten years ago, in 2005, we had the last bill of this nature. It was a bill that we passed. I was an author of it, and I was very proud. That was 10 years ago. That was the last time we did a bill like this. I remember standing here, as I am standing today. The chairman of that committee wanted to talk about what a great bill thatwas--the Transportation reauthorization bill--and all of a sudden the alarms went off. They said: The bombs are coming. Everybody run. Evacuate, evacuate.  I wasn't through talking. I talked for about 15 minutes. It is very eerie when you are standing here and are the only one in the U.S. Capitol making a speech with the TV going but no other people are around. I made my speech. Afterward I started going down, and I saw a great big guy walking down the steps very slowly. I went up to Ted Kennedy. I said: Ted, you better get out of here; this place is going to blow up.  He said: Well, these old legs don't work like they used to.  I said: Let me help you.  I put my arm around his waist. Some guy had a camera. The front page of the cover of that magazine said: Who says that conservatives are not compassionate?  That is my story. We will go on to Senator Boxer.
