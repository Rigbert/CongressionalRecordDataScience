When I return home and meet with people in grocery store chains that serve his State and mine, they have raised some legitimate questions, as far as I am concerned, about how much is required. It seems to me to be not a great burden to ask them to put some notice, for example, that the bananas are from Costa Rica or from some other country. Most of their concerns seem to be directed toward meat and whether or not they can legitimately trace the meat, and through all the requirements of the legislation and how much time is involved. I come to this issue realizing that whenever regulation is proposed, it is usually the first defense of the opponents to say it is going to cost 10 times as much as you would imagine to implement it.  I ask the Senator from Missouri--and this is an honest question, and I have no predisposition on his position on this issue--can he say, as he is standing there in opposition to this, that the cost estimates coming out are reasonable, in light of what is being asked of these grocery chains?
