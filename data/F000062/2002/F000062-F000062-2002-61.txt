 Leahy) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:       Expressing the sense of Congress that the United States      should not use force against Iraq, outside of the existing      Rules of Engagement, without specific statutory authorization      or a declaration of war under Article I, Section 8, Clause 11      of the Constitution of the United States.       Whereas, in accordance with United Nations Security Council      Resolution 687 (1991), Iraq--       (1) agreed to destroy, remove, or render harmless all      chemical and biological weapons and stocks of agents and all      related subsystems and components and all research,      development, support, and manufacturing facilities related      thereto;       (2) agreed to destroy, remove, or render harmless all      ballistic missiles with a range greater than 150 kilometers,      and related major parts and production facilities;       (3) agreed not to acquire or develop any nuclear weapons,      nuclear-weapons-usable material, nuclear-related subsystems      or components, or nuclear-related research, development,      support, or manufacturing facilities; and       (4) agreed to permit immediate on-site inspection of Iraq's      biological, chemical, and missile capabilities, and assist      the International Atomic Energy Agency in carrying out the      destruction, removal, or rendering harmless of all nuclear-     related items and in developing a plan for ongoing monitoring      and verification of Iraq's compliance;       Whereas the regime of Saddam Hussein consistently refused      to comply with United Nations Special Commission weapons      inspectors in Iraq between 1991 and 1998 by denying them      access to crucial sites and documents;       Whereas on October 31, 1998, Iraq banned the United Nations      weapons inspectors despite its agreement and obligation to      comply with United Nations Security Council Resolution 687      (1991);       Whereas Congress declared in Public Law 105-235 that ``the      Government of Iraq is in material and unacceptable breach of      its international obligations, and therefore the President is      urged to take appropriate action, in accordance with the      Constitution and relevant laws of the United States, to bring      Iraq into compliance with its international obligations'';       Whereas, in his State of the Union Address on January 29,      2002, the President of the United States stated that the      ``Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas,      and nuclear weapons for over a decade'';       Whereas it is believed that Iraq continues in its efforts      to develop weapons of mass destruction, in violation of      United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 (1991) and      subsequent resolutions, and that the regime of Saddam Hussein      has used weapons of mass destruction against its own people;       Whereas the development of weapons of mass destruction by      Iraq is a threat to the United States, and its friends and      allies in the Middle East;       Whereas Public Law 107-40 authorizes the President to use      United States Armed Forces against ``those nations,      organizations or persons he determines planned, authorized,      committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on      September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons      in order to prevent any future acts on international      terrorism against the United States by such nations,      organizations, or persons'';       Whereas no such evidence has been forthcoming linking Iraq      to the September 11, 2001 attacks; and       Whereas Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution      of the United States confers upon Congress the sole power to      declare war: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That (a) it is the sense of Congress that--       (1) the United States and the United Nations Security      Council should insist on a complete program of inspection and      monitoring to prevent the development of weapons of mass      destruction in Iraq;       (2) Iraq should allow the United Nations weapons inspectors      ``immediate, unconditional, and unrestricted access to any      and all areas, facilities, equipment, records and means of      transportation which they wish to inspect'' as required by      United Nations Security Council Resolution 707 of August 15,      1991, and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1284 of      December 17, 1999; and       (3) the United States should not use force against Iraq      without specific statutory authorization or a declaration of      war under Article I, Section 8, Clause 11 of the Constitution      of the United States, except as provided in subsection (b).       (b) Subsection (a)(3) does not apply to any use of force in      compliance with the existing Rules of Engagement (ROE) used      by coalition forces to exercise the right of self-defense or      under the National Security Act of 1947.
