President, today I hope we pass a bipartisan bill that will go a long way in reducing the costs of litigating disputes in our civil justice system. This bill creates a new Federal Rule of Evidence regarding electronic disclosure of privileged material that would limit the consequences of inadvertent disclosure. The new rule would provide predictability and uniformity in a discovery process that has been made increasingly difficult with the growing use of e-mail and other electronic media. This legislation contains the full text of Judicial Conference recommendations and is supported by all sectors of the legal community.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Judicial Conference's Committee Note to illuminate the purpose of the new Federal Rule of Evidence and how it should be applied.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 Explanatory Note on Evidence Rule 502       This new rule has two major purposes:       (1) It resolves some longstanding disputes in the courts      about the effect of certain disclosures of communications or      information protected by the attorney-client privilege or as      work product--specifically those disputes involving      inadvertent disclosure and subject matter waiver.       (2) It responds to the widespread complaint that litigation      costs necessary to protect against waiver of attorney-client      privilege or work product have become prohibitive due to the      concern that any disclosure (however innocent or minimal)      will operate as a subject matter waiver of all protected      communications or information. This concern is especially      troubling in cases involving electronic discovery. See, e.g.,      Hopson v. City of Baltimore, 232 F.R.D. 228, 244 (D.Md. 2005)      (electronic discovery may encompass ``millions of documents''      and to insist upon ``record-by-record pre-production      privilege review, on pain of subject matter waiver, would      impose upon parties costs of production that bear no      proportionality to what is at stake in the litigation'').       The rule seeks to provide a predictable, uniform set of      standards under which parties can determine the consequences      of a disclosure of a communication or information covered by      the attorney-client privilege or work-product protection.      Parties to litigation need to know, for example, that if they      exchange privileged information pursuant to a confidentiality      order, the court's order will be enforceable. Moreover, if a      federal court's confidentiality order is not enforceable in a      state court then the burdensome costs of privilege review and      retention are unlikely to be reduced.       The rule makes no attempt to alter federal or state law on      whether a communication or information is protected under the      attorney-client privilege or work-product immunity as an      initial matter. Moreover, while establishing some exceptions      to waiver, the rule does not purport to supplant applicable      waiver doctrine generally.       The rule governs only certain waivers by disclosure. Other      common-law waiver doctrines may result in a finding of waiver      even where there is no disclosure of privileged information      or work product. See, e.g., Nguyen v. Excel Corp., 197 F.3d      200 (5th Cir. 1999) (reliance on an advice of counsel defense      waives the privilege with respect to attorney-client      communications pertinent to that defense); Ryers v. Burleson,      100 F.R.D. 436 (D.D.C. 1983) (allegation of lawyer      malpractice constituted a waiver of confidential      communications under the circumstances). The rule is not      intended to displace or modify federal common law concerning      waiver of privilege or work product where no disclosure has      been made.       Subdivision (a). The rule provides that a voluntary      disclosure in a federal proceeding or to a federal office or      agency, if a waiver, generally results in a waiver only of      the communication or information disclosed; a subject matter      waiver (of either privilege or work product) is reserved for      those unusual situations in which fairness requires a further      disclosure of related, protected information, in order to      prevent a selective and misleading presentation of evidence      to the disadvantage of the adversary. See, e.g., In re United      Mine Workers of America Employee Benefit Plans Litig., 159      F.R.D. 307, 312 (D.D.C. 1994) (waiver of work product limited      to materials actually disclosed, because the party did not      deliberately disclose documents in an attempt to gain a      tactical advantage). Thus, subject matter waiver is limited      to situations in which a party intentionally puts protected      information into the litigation in a selective, misleading      and unfair manner. It follows that an inadvertent disclosure      of protected information can never result in a subject matter      waiver. See Rule 502(b). The rule rejects the result in In re      Sealed Case, 877 F.2d 976 (D.C.Cir. 1989), which held that      inadvertent disclosure of documents during discovery      automatically constituted a subject matter waiver.       The language concerning subject matter waiver--``ought in      fairness''--is taken from Rule 106, because the animating      principle is the same. Under both Rules, a party that makes a      selective, misleading presentation that is unfair to the      adversary opens itself to a more complete and accurate      presentation.       To assure protection and predictability, the rule provides      that if a disclosure is made at the federal level, the      federal rule on subject matter waiver governs subsequent      state court determinations on the scope of the waiver by that      disclosure.       Subdivision (b). Courts are in conflict over whether an      inadvertent disclosure of a communication or information      protected as privileged or work product constitutes a waiver.      A few courts find that a disclosure must be intentional to be      a waiver. Most courts find a waiver only if the disclosing      party acted carelessly in disclosing the communication or      information and failed to request its return in a timely      manner. And a few courts hold that any inadvertent disclosure      of a communication or information protected under the      attorney-client privilege or as work product constitutes a      waiver without regard to the protections taken to avoid such      a disclosure. See generally Hopson v. City of Baltimore, 232      F.R.D. 228 (D.Md. 2005), for a discussion of this case law.       The rule opts for the middle ground: inadvertent disclosure      of protected communications or information in connection with      a federal proceeding or to a federal office or agency does      not constitute a waiver if the holder took reasonable steps      to prevent disclosure and also promptly took reasonable steps      to rectify the error. This position is in accord with the      majority view on whether inadvertent disclosure is a waiver.       Cases such as Lois Sportswear, U.S.A., Inc. v. Levi Strauss      & Co., 104 F.R.D. 103, 105 =========================== NOTE ===========================     On page S1275, February 27, 2008, the Record shows the printing of S. 1200.    The online Record has been corrected to show the printing of S. 1200, as amended. ========================= END NOTE ========================= (S.D.N.Y. 1985) and Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. Garvey, 109 F.R.D. 323, 332 (N.D.Cal. 1985), set out a multi-factor test for determining whether inadvertent disclosure is a waiver. The stated factors (none of which is dispositive) are the reasonableness of precautions taken, the      time taken to rectify the error, the scope of discovery,      the extent of disclosure and the overriding issue of      fairness. The rule does not explicitly codify that test,      because it is really a set of non-determinative guidelines      that vary from case to case. The rule is flexible enough      to accommodate any of those listed factors. Other      considerations bearing on the reasonableness of a      producing party's efforts include the number of documents      to be reviewed and the time constraints for production.      Depending on the circumstances, a party that uses advanced      analytical software applications and linguistic tools in      screening for privilege and work product may be found to      have taken ``reasonable steps'' to prevent inadvertent      disclosure. The implementation of an efficient system of      records management before litigation may also be relevant.       The rule does not require the producing party to engage in      a post-production review to determine whether any protected      communication or information has been produced by mistake.      But the rule does require the producing party to follow up on      any obvious indications that a protected communication or      information has been produced inadvertently.       The rule applies to inadvertent disclosures made to a      federal office or agency, including but not limited to an      office or agency that is acting in the course of its      regulatory, investigative or enforcement authority. The      consequences of waiver, and the concomitant costs of pre-     production privilege review, can be as great with respect to      disclosures to offices and agencies as they are in      litigation.       Subdivision (c). Difficult questions can arise when 1) a      disclosure of a communication or information protected by the      attorney-client privilege or as work product is made in a      state proceeding, 2) the communication or information is      offered in a subsequent federal proceeding on the ground that      the disclosure waived the privilege or protection, and 3) the      state and federal laws are in conflict on the question of      waiver. The Committee determined that the proper solution for      the federal court is to apply the law that is most protective      of privilege and work product. If the state law is more      protective (such as where the state law is that an      inadvertent disclosure can never be a waiver), the holder of      the privilege or protection may well have relied on that law      when making the disclosure in the state proceeding. Moreover,      applying a more restrictive federal law of waiver could      impair the state objective of preserving the privilege or      work-product protection for disclosures made in state      proceedings. On the other hand, if the federal law is more      protective, applying the state law of waiver to determine      admissibility in federal court is likely to undermine the      federal objective of limiting the costs of production.       The rule does not address the enforceability of a state      court confidentiality order in a federal proceeding, as that      question is covered both by statutory law and principles of      federalism and comity. See 28 U.S.C. 1738 (providing that      state judicial proceedings ``shall have the same full faith      and credit in every court within the United States . . . as      they have by law or usage in the courts of such State . . .      from which they are taken''). See also Tucker v. Ohtsu Tire &      Rubber Co., 191 F.R.D. 495, 499 (D.Md. 2000) (noting that a      federal court considering the enforceability of a state      confidentiality order is ``constrained by principles of      comity, courtesy, and . . . federalism''). Thus, a state      court order finding no waiver in connection with a      disclosure made in a state court proceeding is enforceable      under existing law in subsequent federal proceedings.       Subdivision (d). Confidentiality orders are becoming      increasingly important in limiting the costs of privilege      review and retention, especially in cases involving      electronic discovery. But the utility of a confidentiality      order in reducing discovery costs is substantially diminished      if it provides no protection outside the particular      litigation in which the order is entered. Parties are      unlikely to be able to reduce the costs of pre-production      review for privilege and work product if the consequence of      disclosure is that the communications or information could be      used by non-parties to the litigation.       There is some dispute on whether a confidentiality order      entered in one case is enforceable in other proceedings. See      generally Hopson v. City of Baltimore, 232 F.R.D. 228 (D.Md.      2005), for a discussion of this case law. The rule provides      that when a confidentiality order governing the consequences      of disclosure in that case is entered in a federal      proceeding, its terms are enforceable against non-parties in      any federal or state proceeding. For example, the court order      may provide for return of documents without waiver      irrespective of the care taken by the disclosing party; the      rule contemplates enforcement of ``claw-back'' and ``quick      peek'' arrangements as a way to avoid the excessive costs of      pre-production review for privilege and work product. See      Zubulake v. UBS Warburg LLC, 216 F.R.D. 280, 290 (S.D.N.Y.      2003) (noting that parties may enter into ``so-called `claw-     back' agreements that allow the parties to forego privilege      review altogether in favor of an agreement to return      inadvertently produced privilege documents''). The rule      provides a party with a predictable protection from a court      order--predictability that is needed to allow the party to      plan in advance to limit the prohibitive costs of privilege      and work product review and retention.       Under the rule, a confidentiality order is enforceable      whether or not it memorializes an agreement among the parties      to the litigation. Party agreement should not be a condition      of enforceability of a federal court's order.       Under subdivision (d), a federal court may order that      disclosure of privileged or protected information ``in      connection with'' a federal proceeding does not result in      waiver. But subdivision (d) does not allow the federal court      to enter an order determining the waiver effects of a      separate disclosure of the same information in other      proceedings, state or federal. If a disclosure has been made      in a state proceeding (and is not the subject of a state-     court order on waiver), then subdivision (d) is inapplicable.      Subdivision (c) would govern the federal court's      determination whether the state-court disclosure waived the      privilege or protection in the federal proceeding.       Subdivision (e). Subdivision (e) codifies the well-     established proposition that parties can enter an agreement      to limit the effect of waiver by disclosure between or among      them. Of course such an agreement can bind only the parties      to the agreement. The rule makes clear that if parties want      protection against non-parties from a finding of waiver by      disclosure, the agreement must be made part of a court order.       Subdivision (f). The protections against waiver provided by      Rule 502 must be applicable when protected communications or      information disclosed in federal proceedings are subsequently      offered in state proceedings. Otherwise the holders of      protected communications and information, and their lawyers,      could not rely on the protections provided by the Rule, and      the goal of limiting costs in discovery would be      substantially undermined. Rule 502(f) is intended to resolve      any potential tension between the provisions of Rule 502 that      apply to state proceedings and the possible limitations on      the applicability of the Federal Rules of Evidence otherwise      provided by Rules 101 and 1101.       The rule is intended to apply in all federal court      proceedings, including court-annexed and court-ordered      arbitrations, without regard to any possible limitations of      Rules 101 and 1101. This provision is not intended to raise      an inference about the applicability of any other rule of      evidence in arbitration proceedings more generally.       The costs of discovery can be equally high for state and      federal causes of action, and the rule seeks to limit those      costs in all federal proceedings, regardless of whether the      claim arises under state or federal law. Accordingly, the      rule applies to state law causes of action brought in federal      court.       Subdivision (g). The rule's coverage is limited to      attorney-client privilege and work product. The operation of      waiver by disclosure, as applied to other evidentiary      privileges, remains a question of federal common law. Nor      does the rule purport to apply to the Fifth Amendment      privilege against compelled self-incrimination.       The definition of work product ``materials'' is intended to      include both tangible and intangible information. See In re      Cendant Corp. Sec. Litig., 343 F.3d 658, 662 (3d Cir. 2003)      (``work product protection extends to both tangible and      intangible work product'').
