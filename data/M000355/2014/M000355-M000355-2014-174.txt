 President, reserving the right to object, it has been my position since late last week that it would be appropriate for the minority--not having had but eight rollcall votes since July--to have five amendments of our choosing on this bill, and therefore I am going to propose a counter consent request at this time.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 368, S. 2262; that the only amendments in order be five amendments to be offered by myself or my designee related to energy policy, with the first amendment being my amendment No. 2982 on saving coal jobs, and with a 60-vote threshold on adoption of each amendment; that following the disposition of these amendments, the bill be read a third time and the Senate proceed to a vote on passage of the bill, as amended, if amended.
