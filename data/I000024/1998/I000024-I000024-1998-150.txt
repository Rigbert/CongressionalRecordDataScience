President, while debating my amendment, amendment number 1687, to S. 1173, the ISTEA Reauthorization Act, on Wednesday March 4, I referred to five letters and entered them into the Record. Two of those letters were inadvertenly omitted from the Record.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the letters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         State and Territorial Air Pollution Program            Administrators/Association of Local Air Pollution            Control Officials,                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 1998.     Hon. James M. Inhofe,     Chairman, Subcommittee on Clean Air Wetlands, Private          Property, and Nuclear Safety, U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate          Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Inhofe: On behalf of the State and Territorial      Air Pollution Program Administrators (STAPPA) and the      Association of Local Air Pollution Control Officials      (ALAPCO), we wish to express our support for a particular      provision of your proposed amendment to ISTEA legislation      that calls for full federal funding for fine particulate      matter (PM2.5) air monitoring.       STAPPA and ALAPCO are the national associations of state      and local air quality agencies in the states and territories      and over 165 metropolitan areas across the country. The      members of STAPPA and ALAPCO have primary responsibility for      implementing our nation's air pollution control laws and      regulations. As such, we believe it is essential that EPA      provide full funding for the PM2.5 monitoring      network, as the agency has indicated it would.       In its final PM2.5 monitoring regulation (July      18, 1997), EPA estimated that $98.3 million is needed to      deploy a national PM2.5 monitoring system      comprising 1,500 sites (including the purchase of equipment      and the costs of operating and maintaining the system and      analyzing data). On many occasions, the agency committed to      providing full funding over a two-year period for this new      program and indicated that this would be new money.      Unfortunately, this has not happened.       In FY 1997, EPA allocated $2.7 million for state and local      air grants for PM2.5 monitoring activities. In FY      1998, EPA earmarked $35.6 million for those activities but,      rather than providing full funding, the allocation included      only $28.7 million in new money, while the remaining $6.9      million was diverted from other, non-PM2.5      monitoring activities that state and local agencies must      perform. The proposed FY 1999 budget earmarks $50.7 million      for the PM2.5 monitoring network. However, this      includes only $43.9 million in new funds for PM2.5      monitoring activities and again proposes to reprogram funds--     $6.8 million--away from other extremely important and grossly      underfunded state and local air program activities. Thus,      instead of providing $98.3 million over two years to fund the      PM2.5 monitoring effort, EPA has in fact only      allocated $75.3 million in new money, which falls $23 million      short of the amount EPA has repeatedly stated is needed and      would be provided. Although state and local air agencies      remain concerned that $98.3 million may not be sufficient to      fully fund the PM2.5 monitoring network, we      commend your effort to ensure that EPA at least fulfills its      commitment.       While we are not commenting on any other provisions of your      amendment, we are very pleased with the component of it that      calls for full funding under Section 103 of the Clean Air Act      for PM2.5 monitoring. Moreover, we applaud that      the amendment both restores to state and local air grants      under Section 105 of the Clean Air Act the $13.7 million that      EPA has inappropriately diverted from other important      underfunded state and local air quality activities and      ensures that the balance of the funds EPA estimated were      necessary for the complete fine PM2.5 monitoring      network is provided with additional monies.       Thank you again for your concern about this important      issue. Please contact us if we can answer any questions or      provide additional information.           Sincerely,     Timothy J. Method,       President of STAPPA.     Bruce S. Andersen,       President of ALAPCO.                                  ____                                                     American Farm                                            Bureau Federation,                                    Washington, DC, March 2, 1998.     Hon. Spencer Abraham,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Abraham: Senator James Inhofe will be      introducing an amendment to the Senate Highway Bill (ISTEA)      on Tuesday, March 2, 1998. The amendment is offered to ISTEA      in order to avoid the risk of states' losing highway funds as      a sanction under the Clean Air Act for failure to demonstrate      attainment. It is also designed to ensure that EPA provides      states with the necessary funding to construct and operate a      new nationwide PM 2.5 monitoring network that the EPA      Administrator says is needed without states having to take      funds away from other important state programs.       Further, the amendment will ensure that states collect      three full years of fine particulate monitoring data, which      the President has called for, before deciding which areas of      the country will be subject to new stringent requirements.       The agriculture community continues to be concerned over      the accuracy of EPA's fine particulate measurements,      especially in regard to agriculture emissions. Testimony has      been given in both the Senate and House Agriculture      Committees indicating concern that agriculture would be      ``misregulated'' due to inaccurate fine particulate      measurements. This amendment will allow a comparison of EPA's      approved method used to measure fine particulate and the new      monitors to find if both adequately eliminate those particles      that are larger than 2.5 micrograms in diameter.       The Inhofe amendment will provide states, small business,      agriculture and consumers greater certainty that control      strategies for particulate matter compliance are based on      reliable data. The amendment is consistent with the timelines      set forth in the President's Memorandum on Implementation and      is a moderate, common sense approach to making sure the      necessary PM 2.5 monitoring data is available to EPA in order      to make scientifically sound decisions regarding state      compliance designations.       Farm Bureau urges you to vote for the Inhofe amendment to      ISTEA when it comes to the floor for a vote on Tuesday.           Sincerely,                                                    Dean Kleckner,                                                        President.
