President, In the autumn of 2001, while the Nation was still reeling from the reality of our airplanes being turned into weapons of terror, someone, somewhere, launched another deadly terrorist attack using our postal system to deliver their weapon of choice--anthrax. Those anthrax-laced letters targeting several journalists and public officials, among them Senator Daschle and myself, jarring an already fearful Nation.  Receiving that letter was a chilling and personal reminder that the threat of terrorism was not temporary, nor was it an ocean away. Thankfully, my staff and I were unharmed, but others were not so lucky. The terrorists who sent these letters struck 22 people ranging in age from 7 months to 94 years, and the attacks resulted in the deaths of five Americans. They were people who died by simply touching an envelope--in some cases the mail was addressed to them, and in other instances, it was an envelope meant for someone else. Yet all of these people died as a result of doing what so many of us do every day--our jobs.  Five years after those attacks and 5 years into the global war on terror, there is still no perpetrator who has been arrested or convicted for these attacks. Every year around the time of the anniversary--we learn that the FBI is still working on this case and that it remains a high priority for the Bureau. Many skilled and talented people have worked diligently on this case, bringing to bear some of the most advanced forensic technology in the world.  The victims of the anthrax attacks varied in gender, race, religion, age, economic status and locale, but they all shared in the suffering. The victims who suffered the most were employees of the U.S. Postal Service, of the Department of State, of news organizations and of the Senate, and the aides, the children, and the senior citizens whose mail came in contact with the anthrax-laden letters.  Robert Stevens, a photo editor at The Sun newspaper in Boca Raton, Florida, died on October 5, 2001, at the age of 63. Thomas Morris, Jr., a Washington, DC, postal worker, died on October 21 at the age of 55. Joseph Curseen, also a Washington, DC, postal worker, died on October 22 at the age of 47. Kathy T. Nguyen, a New York City hospital worker, died on October 31 at the age of 61. And Ottilie Lundgren, a 94-year-old Connecticut retiree, died on November 21.  Many of those who survived anthrax exposure remain severely debilitated, suffering from chronic cough, fatigue, joint swelling and pain, and memory loss. Several victims have been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and are still tormented by nightmares. Many cannot return to work, and some of those who have returned are unable to do even routine tasks without difficulty. Victims say they communicate very little with one another, mostly fighting their battles alone.  On October 16, 2003, I introduced a bill to amend the September 11th Victim Compensation Fund of 2001 to provide compensation for anthrax victims on the same basis as compensation is provided to victims of September 11. The bill never made it out of the Judiciary Committee. Without this appropriate help, the surviving victims struggle to pay their medical bills and get by on worker's compensation, and many report feeling like they have borne the brunt of the anthrax attacks alone. This surely exacerbates the emotional and psychological difficulties that many anthrax victims experience. Congress should act to help these people, who are victims of the national experience of these terrorist attacks, and they should be treated accordingly.  Congress and the American people hope for answers and for a resolution of this case. We hope that lessons have been learned from it that will help prevent or minimize future biological attacks. In the meantime, let us remember the loss and the suffering of those who fell victim to this deadly episode of terrorism on our soil.                          ____________________
