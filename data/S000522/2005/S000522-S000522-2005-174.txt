With all due respect to my friend and colleague from California, I know that the gentleman from New York (Mr. Fossella), who is really the prime sponsor of this amendment, had prior knowledge of that potential language that you just offered and he did not want to accept it. So on his behalf and my own I would have to reject it regrettably.                              {time}  1645
