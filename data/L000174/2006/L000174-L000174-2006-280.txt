President, I strongly oppose the amendment offered by Senator Menendez to drastically cut the base allocation of Homeland Security grants for all States.  I heard the statement of the distinguished Senator from Maine, Senator Collins. I associate myself with her words. She has stated it far more eloquently than I as to why this amendment should be defeated.
