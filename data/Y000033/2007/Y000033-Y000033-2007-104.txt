Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor Daniel V. Kish and the 28 years of service he has provided to the State of Alaska and the Nation.  In the summer of 1978, a young long-haired college student dressed in muddy work boots wandered into my office looking for an internship. Why he chose my office in particular, I do not know, though I suspect it had something to do with an attractive young lady working at the front desk, but he appeared willing and eager to work. Thus, after telling him to get a haircut and a pair of loafers, I put him to work.  My staff and I were immediately impressed by Dan's strong work ethic, his innate understanding of even the most complex issues, and his natural ability to communicate to my constituents--both in writing and in spoken word--the practical impacts of the various legislative proposals before the Congress.  In fact, when Dan returned to Indiana's Wabash College at the end of that summer to finish his studies, he left our office with an unexpected void to fill. The following year Dan had completed his undergraduate degree, and we had an open position to fill. Thanks to the good judgment and recommendation of the young woman who drew Dan into our office the previous summer, I tracked him down and asked him to come to work for me full-time. In the years since then, Dan has earned himself a well-deserved reputation as one of the most talented, dedicated, and knowledgeable staffers on the Hill.  Dan has stuck with me through thick and thin. He has always kept my best interests, and the best interests of the State of Alaska, at heart. His devotion to me, the State of Alaska, and the Nation has been unparalleled. Dan's unwavering commitment to and understanding of strong Republican ideals, free market policies, and responsible development of our Nation's resources have been an inspiration to hundreds of Hill staffers and Members alike, and he has served as the moral compass by which the Resources Committee has sailed throughout his tenure.  Dan's writing throughout the years has been equally inspiring. He is by far the single most impressive writer I've come across in 35 years. His talent and ability to get to the root of an issue in two or three eloquent sentences is unmatched. While Dan's use of words has always been powerful, it has often been humorous as well. A strong supporter of a free market economy, Dan once wrote a letter to the Secretary of the Treasury recommending that the $1 coin bear the likeness of Dolly Arthur--the owner of a historic bordello in Ketchikan, Alaska--suggesting that unlike Susan B. Anthony, she ``was truly a woman who knew the value of a dollar.'' This unique sense of humor has brought smiles to my face and many others for nearly three decades.  But most of all, Dan Kish will be remembered for the genuine respect and appreciation he has always had for what he called ``the Working Man.'' Although his mind was often occupied in debates over esoteric federal policies, his heart has always belonged to thefight for the working men and women of America who get dirt under their fingernails rather than paper cuts on their pinkies. Dan tirelessly reminded us that American prosperity, national defense, and world leadership depend on the working men and women who operate the drill rigs, mine metals and minerals, harvest trees and crops, raise livestock, and pull the levers and press the buttons that control the dams responsible for irrigating the land and powering our communities.  God has blessed our country with a bounty of resources, and Dan was always ready with a sermon to remind us that His gifts are there for us to use wisely. Dan's wise words will not be forgotten.  While hiring Dan was one of the best decisions I've made in my 35 years in Washington, I think Dan would agree that coming to work for me was the most important decision of his life. After all, it's where he met his beautiful wife, Pam, the young lady who lured the long-haired college student into my office 29 years ago. I would be remiss if I did not also thank Pam Kish for everything she has done over the years, not only as a former staffer, but as a loving wife.  The State of Alaska and the Nation as a whole owe a debt of gratitude to Dan Kish for his 29 years of service, and this House is a better place because of his good work. Ronald Reagan once wrote, ``Some people work an entire lifetime and wonder if they've ever made a difference.'' I know I speak for many in this body when I say there is no question that Dan Kish has made a tremendous difference during his tenure and will be sorely missed.  While Dan is moving on, his impact on and contribution to our work in Congress is timeless. I can think of no one who is more widely respected and admired for his intrinsic understanding of and devotion to the things that make this Nation so great.  I am forever grateful that Dan's path crossed with mine that day, 29 years ago so, while I stand here today honoring Daniel V. Kish for his years of service, his departure is bittersweet. Words cannot express my personal gratitude to Dan for his work, his counsel, and most importantly, his friendship. Thank you, Dan. I wish you and Pam the best in the next chapter of your life together.                          ____________________
