Speaker, kids deserve a chance to succeed. An environment free of crime--and the gun violence that claims the lives of thousands of our Nation's children every year--provides this opportunity.  Recent events are a painful reminder of the devastation that firearms cause for children in every part of our country. Last month, 4-year-old Marimal Colon was playing in front of her house in my home State of Rhode Island. As she prepared to accompany her siblings to a candy store, she was hit in the back by a stray bullet, fired in an exchange between two cars passing her home.  Since coming to Congress, I have worked hard to stop this violence by enacting tough new laws, like the Brady bill and the assault weapons ban, that keep guns out of the hands of criminals.  These laws are making an impact, but we must do more to stop the plague of gun violence. We must stop criminals from obtaining their weapons of choice: junk guns.  These firearms, also known as Saturday night specials, are cheap, small, easily concealable, made of cheap materials, and lack adequate safety devices.  Junk guns are not hunting weapons, but they are 3.4 times as likely to be used in crime as are other firearms. Indeed, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms reports that 8 of the 10 firearms most frequently traced at crime scenes in 1995 were junk guns.  The Junk Gun Violence Protection Act that I am introducing today takes a stand against junk guns. This bill and Senator Boxer's companion legislation ban the junk guns that criminals prefer.  In the past, Congress has recognized the danger of junk guns, and taken bipartisan action to combat the abuse of these weapons. In 1968, Congress passed the Gun Control Act to prohibit the importation of junk guns. This measure unintentionally led to the creation of a vast domestic junk gun industry. In 1972, the Senate passed a bill to apply the import standards to domestically produced guns by a vote of 68 to 25.  The Reed-Boxer bill is modeled after this impressive example. The measure, which at last closes the deadly loophole that protects domestic junk guns, is an important step toward safe communities.  I look forward to working with Senator Boxer, our colleagues, and the millions of Americans committed to reducing the toll of gun violence to ensure that this critical goal becomes a reality.                          ____________________
