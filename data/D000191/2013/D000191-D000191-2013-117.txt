Speaker, on November 30, 2012 I sent a letter to the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Vilsack, requesting an investigation into Wildlife Services and the conduct of its employees. Mr. Vilsack responded to my letter on February 1, 2013 and my office received this letter on February 13, 2013. I intend to monitor this situation closely and look forward to seeing the results of the internal investigation that is currently taking place of WS employees and their compliance with state and federal anti-cruelty and animal protection laws.                                                November 30, 2012.     Thomas Vilsack,     Secretary of Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture,          Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Vilsack: We are writing to request a      thorough audit of Wildlife Services, especially its lethal      predator control program, by the USDA Office of Inspector      General (OIG) regarding the culture within Wildlife Services.       As you know, recent news reports indicate that Jamie P.      Olson, a Wildlife Services employee working in Wyoming, may      have apparently committed acts of animal cruelty that appear      to violate Wildlife Services' Directives and Wyoming state      law. If it is found that Mr. Olson committed these acts, it      would bring disrepute to the Wildlife Services' program and      the federal government at a time when Wildlife Services, and      in particular its lethal control of predators to protect      livestock, labors under heavy criticism for unnecessarily      killing wild animals and lacking transparency and      accountability. We urge you to be thorough in your      investigation because these alleged acts clearly violate      standards of human decency.       However, we are gravely concerned that photographs,      published on Mr. Olson's Facebook in an album labeled      ``work'' and since removed, do not represent an isolated      occurrence, but may reflect a deep-rooted problem within the      Wildlife Services program that allows for, and encourages,      inhumane lethal methods of predator control. According to a      recent Sacramento Bee article, Gary Strader, a former      Wildlife Services trapper in Nevada, ``was not surprised to      learn about the controversial photos. 'That is very common,'      Strader wrote in an email.'' (Toni Knudson, U.S. wildlife      worker's online photos of animal abuse stir outrage.      Sacramento Bee, Friday, November 2, 2012).       We look forward to seeing the results of your      investigation, and thank you for your attention in this      important matter.           Sincerely,                                                    John Campbell,                                               Member of Congress.                                                    Peter DeFazio,     Member of Congress.                                  ____                                   U.S. Department of Agriculture,                                      Office of the Secretary,                                     Washington, DC, Feb. 1, 2013.     Hon. Peter DeFazio,     U.S. House of Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman DeFazio: Thank you for your letter of      November 30, 2012, regarding allegations of animal cruelty by      an employee with the Department of Agriculture's (USDA)      Wildlife Services (WS) program. I apologize for the delayed      response.       I, and other USDA officials, take this matter very      seriously. USDA does not condone any form of animal cruelty      and holds all employees responsible for adhering to      Departmental and Agency standards and directives. WS      personnel are expected to use approved and humane methods to      euthanize captured or restrained animals whenever      practicable, and in accordance with American Veterinary      Medical Association guidelines. WS employees are also      required to comply at all times with applicable State and      Federal laws.       At this time, the Administrative Investigations and      Compliance Branch (AICB) of USDA's Animal and Plant Health      Inspection Service is engaged in an ongoing investigation of      this matter. In response to a previous request to initiate an      investigation into these allegations, USDA's Office of the      Inspector General (OIG) has deferred to AICB's active      investigation. However, OIG officials have requested that      AICB report its findings to them once the investigation has      been finalized. In the meantime, WS officials are also taking      this opportunity to reaffirm to program staff their ethical      obligation to uphold professional standards and their      responsibilities to the American public.       I appreciate the opportunity to address your concerns. I      assure you that USDA remains steadfast in its commitment to      responsible oversight and stewardship with regard to the WS      program. I am sending a similar letter to Congressman      Campbell.           Sincerely,                                                Thomas J. Vilsack,                                                        Secretary.
