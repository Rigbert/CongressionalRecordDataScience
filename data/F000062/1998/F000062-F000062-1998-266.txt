 President, I will follow on the comments of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, since the Senate is scheduled tomorrow to vote on a cloture motion, whether to move Senate bill 1601, a bill that prohibits the cloning of human beings. I will clarify where we are and what the issues really are.  Let me be clear at the outset: I support a ban on the cloning of human beings. There is widespread agreement that the cloning of a human being should be prohibited. That agreement, I believe, exists in the Congress. It clearly exists in the scientific community. It exists in the medical community, in the religious community, and it exists in virtually every patient and health group that I know of.  I submit, Mr. President, that the cloning of human beings is scientifically unsafe; it is dangerous; it is morally unacceptable; and it is ethically flawed. We should enact a ban. We should pass a law that establishes the illegality of human cloning and sets forth appropriate penalties.  The argument I make today is not the ban, but how the bill before the Senate tomorrow, the Bond-Frist bill, would affect scientific research. I introduced identical bills with Senator Kennedy, Senate bills 1602 and 1611 which would protect research that someday, we believe, is likely to provide cures for many of the most dreaded diseases.  Some examples are treatments for damaged nerve cells, for spinal cord injuries, blood cell therapies for leukemia and sickle cell anemia, liver cell transplants for liver damage, cartilage cells for reconstruction of joints damaged by arthritis or injuries, the creation of stem cells to treat burn victims, and the creation of cells to treat some 5,000 different genetic diseases.  The bill that the leadership is trying to rush through the Senate, Senate bills 1599 and 1601, would make it a crime with up to 10 years in prison to conduct that kind of research--research that someday will save lives and suffering.  Those bills, because they don't have clear scientific terms, they don't have definitions of critical words which are part of somatic cell nuclear transfer technology, would submit scientists to prison terms for treatments using this technique. These penalties would have a serious, chilling effect on promising scientific research.  Somatic cell nuclear transfer--and I am a newcomer to this so I have had a crash course, and I still have an awful lot to learn--this transfer process is its own science. It has a lexicon all of its own. Scientists tell us that the traditional definitions of reproductive health--the traditional definitions of reproductive health--do not fit somatic cell nuclear transfer. There is the rub.  S. 1601 uses these terms but doesn't define them. The bill doesn't define somatic cell, for example. Now, what I know a somatic cell to be is a cell in your body. You can take a cell from a mammary gland. In Dolly's case, the cell was taken from the udder.  Additionally, the bill does not define embryo or preimplantation embryo. It does not define oocyte. Without clear, scientifically accurate definitions, we don't know what we are talking about and scientists will be reluctant to conduct research that might save lives and alleviate human suffering.  That is the bottom line of asking for a delay, of asking that the Senate's proper procedures be employed so that the scientific community can come forward, provide their definitions, explain them, we can debate them and clearly understand what we are doing.  My father used to tell me that the first tenet of medicine is ``Do no harm.'' We can do great harm by proceeding without a full understanding of what this is all about.  According to the Biotechnology Industry Association, Senate bill 1601 would go beyond the issue of human cloning and would outlaw research to create stem cells. It would make it a crime for doctors to use a currently effective treatment for mitochondrial disease. The Biotechnology Industry Association says, ``In this treatment, women who have this disease have an extreme and tragic form of infertility. The disease is a disease of the mitochondria an essential element of any egg. The treatment for this disease involves the use of a fertilized nucleus which is transferred through the use of somatic cell nuclear transfer to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed. The new egg is a fresh, endocyst egg. The current Bond bill would make it a crime to provide this treatment even though the nucleus which is transferred is the product of fertilization and not cloning.''  So there is no need to rush. The bill we are asked to vote on is one week old--one week. It was introduced February 3, brought to the full Senate 48 hours later, on February 5. Now we are asked to vote on whether to continue consideration and have a vote of the bill. It has not been referred to committee. There have been no hearings. It has not gone through the normal deliberative process.  We should not be ramrodding a bill with this potential for harm through the Senate. It is one of the most profound issues of our time. This is a difficult area of science. It involves terminology and technologies few Americans have ever studied, let alone fully understand, terminology and technologies that few Senators understand. It poses very serious and fundamental moral, ethical and scientific questions.  We need not rush a bill to the floor without committee consideration. That is the other point. The scientific community has imposed a voluntary moratorium. The Food and Drug Administration has said they will assert jurisdiction. Many organizations have written urging caution.  Let me go into some of them right now. Let me begin with the American Cancer Society, in a letter dated February 9, and I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                      American Cancer Society,                                                 February 9, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: The American Cancer Society has      called for your commitment for a renewed war on cancer      through a national investment in biomedical research and      cancer prevention and control programs. The sustained      downturn in cancer mortality and incidence--for the first      time ever--is evidence that our investment in this war is      beginning to make a difference.       The current opportunities in cancer research, including our      understanding of the molecular nature of the disease, are      bringing us closer to the answers we need to prevent and cure      cancer. Congress and the Administration are calling for      unprecedented increases in funding for biomedical and cancer      research which will allow us to exploit scientific knowledge      and bring answers more quickly to the American people.       The American Cancer Society urges you to oppose S. 1601,      legislation that would prohibit the use of somatic cell      nuclear transfer. The American Cancer Society agrees with the      public that human cloning should not proceed at this time.      However, the legislation as drafted would have the perhaps      unintended effect of restricting critical, legal scientific      research. The ability to create therapeutically valuable stem      cell lines from oocytes, therefore promoting genetic      reprogramming of cells to prevent and cure cancer exemplifies      the type of research that could be hindered with overly      restrictive regulations. The current language in S. 1601      could hamper or punish scientists who contribute to our      growing knowledge about cancer.       We urge you to carefully consider all aspects of this      legislation to ensure the continued support for all legal and      ethical modalities of cancer research.           Sincerely,                                           David S. Rosenthal, MD,                                                        President.
