 President, with that, I would like all Members to know that what we have just agreed to is the final amendments of this bill. If any Senator would like to speak on any of them, they are welcome to come to the floor to do so this evening. But with this agreement, all those amendments will be voted on tomorrow morning, as will be announced at the end of the session today.  Mr. President, just to let all Senators know, with this agreement, there will be no further rollcall votes tonight.                          ____________________
