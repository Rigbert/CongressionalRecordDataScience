 Warner, Mr. Burns, Mr. Robb, Mrs. Murray and Mrs. Boxer) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Labor and Human Resources:                               S. Res. 51       Whereas the children of the United States deserve the      finest preparation possible to face the demands of this      Nation's changing information-based economy;       Whereas in the year 1996, NetDay succeeded in bringing      together more than 100,000 volunteers nationwide to install      the wiring infrastructure necessary to connect classrooms,      from kindergarten to the high school level (K-12), to the      Information Superhighway and bring them the educational      benefits of contemporary technology;       Whereas NetDay succeeded in wiring 25,000 K-12 schools      nationwide efficiently and cost-effectively, while      establishing and improving classroom information      infrastructure;       Whereas NetDay organizers created a World Wide Web site      (http://www.netday96.com/) with an on-line database of all      public and private K-12 schools, where individuals with a      shared interest in upgrading technology in their schools can      locate each other and form communities with a lasting      interest in their schools;       Whereas NetDay stresses educational opportunity for      everyone by reaching out to rural and lower income      communities to equalize access to current technology;       Whereas the relationships formed through NetDay activities      and initiatives between schools and their communities will      last well beyond 1996 into the 21st century, and other      communities are already planning to organize future NetDay      projects that build and expand upon the initial achievements      of NetDay in 1996;       Whereas NetDay has substantially increased the visibility      of educational technology issues;       Whereas NetDay enables K-12 schools to move into the      information age through community and cyberspace-based      action;       Whereas students and schools benefited from significant      NetDay corporate sponsorship and donations from hundreds of      companies and organizations throughout the nation who      contributed by sponsoring individual schools, providing      wiring kits, and helping to design and test the networks;       Whereas NetDay will help facilitate the placement of      educational technology, such as computer hardware, software,      Internet and technical services, and teaching aids and      training material, in the hands of schools through NetDay      activities nationwide; and       Whereas both past and future NetDay activities across      America will save schools and taxpayers millions of dollars      in technology startup costs: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) the organizers, coordinators, and volunteers of NetDay      throughout the United States should be commended for their      actions;       (2) NetDay's success should be used as a positive model in      other communities throughout the United States, this year and      in future years;       (3) NetDay activities should continue to expand nationwide      to assist students, parents, and schools across the country,      so that they may obtain the full benefits of computer      equipment and networks, strengthen their educations, and      begin careers with more skills and opportunities in order to      help them compete more successfully in the global economy;       (4) businesses, students, parents, educators, and unions      throughout the country should consider organizing NetDay      activities in their communities to provide similar      opportunities for their schools; and       (5) the Senate affirms its support of NetDay's commitment      to have classrooms of K-12 schools fitted with the needed      technological infrastructure for the 21st century.
