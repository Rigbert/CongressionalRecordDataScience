President, I am pleased to cosponsor S. 830, a bill introduced by Senator Specter to amend the Federal Criminal Code to prohibit the making of false statements, misrepresentations or false writings to Congress or to any congressional committee or subcommittee. Until the Supreme Court decided Hubbard versus United States in May of this year, that had been the law of the land for 40 years.  In the Hubbard case, the Supreme Court decided that section 1001 of title 18, United States Code, prohibits the making of false statements only to executive branch agencies, and not to the courts or Congress. This decision overturned a 1955 Supreme Court case, which squarely held that ``one who lied to an officer of Congress was punishable under Sec. 1001 . . .'' Hubbard, 131 L.Ed. 2d 779, 798.  S. 830 would make clear that the courts, Congress and ``any duly constituted committee or subcommittee of Congress'' are covered by the prohibition in section 1001 against false statements. It would restore the clear message to all who may appear before a committee or subcommittee of the Senate or House: Do not lie to us.  Although various other laws criminalize false statements to Congress, none of those statutes reaches the breadth of misrepresentations and false statements prohibited by section 1001. For example, a perjury prosecution under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1621 requires that the false statement be made under oath, while section 1001 does not. Likewise, a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 287 requires that the false statement be made in connection with a claim for payment, while section 1001 does not. Finally, an obstruction prosecution under 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1505 requires that the obstruction be effected ``corruptly or by threats or force,'' which section 1001 does not. Indeed, section 1505 has specifically been held not to prohibit lying to Congress. U.S. v. Poindexter, 951 F.2d 369 (D.C. Cir. 1991).  I recognize that extension of section 1001 to the courts must be done delicately so as not to impinge upon responsible advocacy. I look forward to working with my friend from Pennsylvania on refining this bill, and urge its passage in this Congress.  We should all be aware that until S. 830 is passed, witnesses may lie with impunity at congressional hearings, unless they are placed under oath.  Senator Specter has meticulously administered oaths to every witness who has appeared at the extensive and ongoing Ruby Ridge hearings before the Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information, which he chairs. We have heard from current and former law enforcement personnel from four Federal agencies, including the Marshals Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the FBI, and the Justice Department. We have also heard from Randy Weaver and his daughter, Sara, Kevin Harris, their neighbors and their friends.  Sorting out what happened 3 years ago at Ruby Ridge, and then its aftermath, has proven to be no simple task. This was a tragedy, resulting in the deaths of Deputy Marshal William Degan, a 14-year-old boy, Sammy Weaver, and his mother, Vicki Weaver. Figuring out what went wrong at Ruby Ridge and what can be done to make sure those events are never repeated, is the challenge the subcommittee is facing on a bipartisan basis.  Fulfilling our important oversight responsibility at these hearings, and in future hearings on other matters, requires that we seek the truth and base our findings on facts. Witnesses, who are interviewed, called to testify, and asked to provide documentary material relating to matters under consideration by Congress, should be given the message loudly and clearly that if they lie or purposely mislead us, they will be sanctioned with criminal penalties. This bill would put that message in the law, and I am glad to cosponsor it.                          ____________________
