Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Solis) for bringing us together this evening so all of us coast to coast can express our union and solidarity with the women of Afghanistan, with those who are in country with their children, for those who have fled and are fleeing and are in refugee camps in Iran, in Pakistan, in Tajikistan, and God knows where else.  As I have read the press reports and I have been watching television and reading the newspapers and looking at the demonstrators and thinking about our role in the world and that region of the world, I keep looking for women and every picture only has men. Men fighting, men drinking tea, men demonstrating, and I keep saying, where are the women? Where are the women? Knowing that war has ravaged through that region for many, many years; and obviously there are more women than men. The demographics alone, because of war, would attest to that. So where are they?  In coming here to this chamber this evening I kept thinking about the words of the great Negro national anthem, and the words that ring in my ears tonight, ``God of our silent tears, God of our weary years,'' a song borne of the great struggle for freedom in our own land and across the world, of those who were placed in slavery and whose heroic history has been so much part of America's own struggle for liberty.  I kept thinking about the silent tears of the women of Afghanistan and so many women of the Middle East and Central Asia. I thought about their silent tears. I thought most of the world never sees those tears because we do not see them, and under that burqa you cannot see anything.  In fact, I tried to look out of it as I handled it on the floor, and one cannot really see very well out of it. It looks like you are looking through a multi-screened door where so much of the light is shut out. Truly you feel like a prisoner. It is a visible symbol of the abysmal human rights record of the Taliban regime and the fact that women have no official dignity. In fact, they are beasts of burden. They are there to cook. They are there to carry their children and to bury their children. And they have absolutely no moment, no moment, no place, no home. No place of comfort. No place to hide, no place just to be.  They are in our hearts this evening because many of us understand some of the tinges of oppression, but nothing like what they are living through.                              {time}  2300  Others this evening have talked about their lack of access to health care and the fact that they can receive no health services. I can remember Congresswoman Pat Schroeder on this floor one evening talking about the fact that during World War I, more women died in childbirth than people were killed in the war. This is before health services were available to people. Can you imagine the struggle of bearing a child in Afghanistan?  God of our silent tears; God of our weary years. We think of them especially tonight. I learned from the world food program last week that, of course, the United States has provided some of the meager food sustenance that has kept that population alive over the last several years. Over 257 bakeries havebeen started inside Afghanistan just to make use of the raw wheat, and the diet basically is a piece of wheat bread that looks like pita and tea, that is about what the average person eats every day. But the Taliban had ruled that because women, the mothers, the widows, were feeding the people and working in those bakeries, that they would shut those bakeries down because, in fact, women were doing the work and women were not allowed to be seen in public.  And there was such civil unrest across that country that the Taliban reversed its own ruling because the people were fighting for their own survival in a country that is now prefamine and the world community is desperately trying to find ways to move donkey trains in there with wheat bags and trying to move product in any way that we can in order to help the civilian populations. We know the majority of people trying to feed the desperate are women and many of them are widows.  Tonight, I know that every single woman here thinks about the future, and every man and woman in our country wants to help those who are in dire need. I know that in the weeks ahead, this Women's Caucus through the leadership of the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Millender-McDonald), who has just been fantastic in her leadership on this issue, and so many others is going to make sure that our Women's Caucus keeps in sight, in fact right in the bull's-eye of U.S. policy in that region of the world humanitarian assistance and food programs, in fact, linking our food programs to education wherever we can possibly do it and that America's true greatness and the generosity of its people will be seen extending a hand across the ocean and a hand across a forgotten part of the world. We want every life that can be saved to be saved, and we know that our first partners in this effort will be the women of Afghanistan who know the price of life and the price of death.  This evening, we rise in their honor. Those of us who are wearing these little squibs of cloth cut from the burqa, we will not forget them. We ask the God of silent tears and God of weary years to be with them, to protect them and to know that we are in sisterhood and brotherhood with them.
