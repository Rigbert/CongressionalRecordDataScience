Speaker, I am pleased to recognize the sesquicentennial of the Academy of Medicine of Toledo and Lucas County in my district. The organization celebrates this anniversary on June 22, 2001.  Eight Toledo physicians originally came together in 1851 to form the Toledo Medical Association, founded ``for the cultivation of the science of medicine and the promotion of public health, the advancement of the character and honor of the profession, and the elevation of the standards of the medical education.'' From the outset, the organization was aggressive in its efforts to raise the standard of medicine. This goal was accomplished by fighting quackery, stopping advertising by physicians, introducing professional standards and across-the-board fees for physicians, sharing knowledge of difficult cases and medicate advancements, and improving the quality of medical education by promoting a medical school. The Toledo Medical Society played an integral role in the development, birth, and growth of the former Toledo Medical College which was established in 1882.  Following the Civil War, the Toledo Medical Association pioneered efforts in the new field of public health. The association worked to insure a safe milk and water supply, advocated for state-of-the-art treatment of tuberculosis, and promoted immunizations against devastating contagious disease. During this time the organization also helped the establishment of Toledo's hospitals.  As the Toledo metropolitan area grew by the turn of the century, the Toledo Medical Association merged with the Lucas County Medical Society to form the current Academy of Medicine of Toledo and Lucas County. This combined organization enabled the medical profession to unite in a larger, more effective, political force and stronger advocates.  As physicians in record numbers enlisted in the battle of World War I, the Academy supported their families and maintained their practices. At the end of the war during the influenza epidemic of 1918, many Academy members lost their lives including its first President, Dr. Julius Jacobson. In the decades between the two World Wars, the Academy continued to expand its outreach, forming a physician answering service--the first medical society to do so--and further developing effort to address diseases scourging the population like tuberculosis. Many society members answered the call during World War II, and in response to the Cold War which followed the Academy aided in the area's civil defense response. Public health initiatives continued, with the Academy focusing on public education in the 1960s and 1970s.  As the nation reached a critical shortage of physicians in the 1970s, the Academy again spearheaded the establishment of a medical school. The Medical College of Ohio was established in Toledo in 1976 and trains physicians yet today. The Academy provides financial scholarships to outstanding students, and more than one-third of the school's graduates remain in the Toledo area.  Meeting the challenges of the times, the Academy has been a driving force behind HIV/AIDS education, smoking prevention and cessation programs, childhood immunization programs, the battle against environmental degradation, and it has sought to find a role in the development of HMOs and other government health initiatives. Even while serving the Toledo area population, the Academy has also sponsored several medical missions promoting international health to the most impoverished of our world.  From its beginning 150 years ago, the Academy of Medicine has been an organization at the forefront of quality health care, evolving as the times demand so that the organization and its members remain effective. I know it will continue to be a viable force for decades to come. I join with our community in recognizing the Academy of Medicine's achievements in the past 150 years, and look forward with anticipation to its future. No community in America could be served by a finer organization than ours. Onward.                          ____________________
