Speaker it is with great remorse that I rise today to pay tribute to one of Gary, Indiana's most dedicated and caring citizens, Dr. YJean Chambers. YJean passed away on Wednesday, November 12th at Methodist Hospital after a longtime illness. Her efforts as a distinguished educator as well as her numerous contributions to her community are worthy of the highest commendation and recognition.  YJean and her family moved to Gary, Indiana from Kentucky when she was a young girl, seeking a better life for themselves. In 1939, she graduated from Gary Roosevelt High School ranking second in her class, and then went on to earn her Bachelor of Education degree from Illinois State University. She also went on to earn her Master of Arts degree from Purdue University, where she received Purdue University's highest award, Doctor of Humane Letters in 1993.  YJean knew how important education was to all members of her community and therefore shared her gift of knowledge and enthusiasm for learning by becoming a teacher in Madison, Illinois. After two years she began teaching speech and drama at her alma mater, Gary Roosevelt High School. In 1971, YJean became a full time professor at Purdue Calumet in Hammond, Indiana where she taught communications and was appointed Assistant Professor of Communications in 1973.  YJean gave selflessly to her community in so many ways, including being a member of several volunteer and service organizations. She served as President of the Steel City Hall of Fame, sat on the Service Academies Nomination Board, was a member of the Board of Trustees of the Gary Community Schools, and was also a member of the Board of Directors of the Indiana School Board Association. YJean made history in Northwest Indiana by becoming the first African American woman elected to the Northwest Indiana Crime Commission and the first woman to serve on the Advisory Board of the Bank of Indiana.  Although she dedicated her life to serving her community, YJean never limited the time she gave to her loving family. She is survived by her husband Mr. Herman Chambers, and their son Lanel.  Mr. Speaker, YJean Chambers was a caring and committed woman who gave of herself in so many ways to her community. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in paying tribute to Dr. YJean Chambers, she will be remembered honorably and truly missed.                          ____________________
