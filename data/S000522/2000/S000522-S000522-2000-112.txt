Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words, and I rise in support of passage of the Wu-Smith-Udall amendment which shifts $14.7 million to the fish and wildlife habitat conservation line item from the forest products line item within the budget of the U.S. Forest Service.  Let me just say that I do believe that the chairman, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula), has tried very hard within the budget constraints to allocate sufficient monies for programs within the jurisdiction of his subcommittee. It is a very tough balancing act--as chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations I found how hard it was to write our bill. Last year the Congress passed my State authorization bill which is now law and it too was a balancing act--287 pages of desperate provisions and allocations. So I emphasize.  But in response to my good friend, the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar), there is more money not less, but more federal dollars, as my friend, the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Wu), just pointed out. The pending legislation includes an additional $10 million more than the President's request for the Forest Service line item, the timber sales management program. Our amendment retains that plus up but shifts another $14.7 over to the fish and wildlife programs. It is a reasonable and environmentally sound redirection of scarce resources. It is fiscally prudent. And it deserves support.                              {time}  2100  Mr. Chairman, the Forest Service through their fish and wildlife conservation program manages 192 acres of public lands, ensuring that animals such as elk, bighorn sheep, mountain goat, waterfowl, and song bird enjoy the habitat they need to remain viable and productive. Over 360 threatened and endangered species live in National Forests and the Forest Service works in this program to provide ecological conditions that provide for the plant and animal community diversity which will allow these species to survive and to thrive.  Mr. Chairman, yes, this a difficult choice, but, again, we are talking about redirecting a modest amount of resources from this account that has already been plussed up, and we are looking to take some of that and put it in the area where we think it will do the greatest good. I urge support for this amendment.
