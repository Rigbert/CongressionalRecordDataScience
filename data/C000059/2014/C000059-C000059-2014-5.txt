PILT has been a mandatory program under the jurisdiction of authorizing committees since fiscal year 2008. Fiscal year 2007 was the last year that PILT was funded with discretionary funds. In fact, funding for PILT last year was provided within the MAP-21 transportation bill.  Had PILT funding been provided in the Interior division of the omnibus, the committee would not have been able to adequately address other critical issues important to the western Members.  PILT is very important to my own State of California, which is the largest recipient of PILT payments, with over $41 million received in fiscal year 2013. Like my good friend, I am absolutely committed to securing PILT funding for our counties in fiscal year 2014.  It is my understanding that Chairman Lucas has agreed to carry PILT funding in the farm bill in the conference report.  Chairman Lucas, do you concur?
