I certainly would rise in support of it and certainly think it is acceptable to the committee.  I would point out to my colleagues though that, if you would, your view has been anticipated. I would draw my colleagues' attention to section 8113 of the underlying legislation, as well as section 9013.  So I do not want anyone to think that the committee itself, including the chairman, was inattentive to the points you raise.
