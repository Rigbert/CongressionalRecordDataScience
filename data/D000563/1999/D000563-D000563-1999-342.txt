What a giveaway this is--$2.50 an acre. They can literally mine millions of dollars' worth of minerals. The amazing thing is, they do not pay the taxpayers of this country any percentage for what they bring out.  I would like to ask the Senator from Washington to compare the mining of coal on Federal lands when it comes to royalties to mining under the hard rock provisions.
