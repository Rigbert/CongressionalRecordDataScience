Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I know I asked unanimous consent that all Members be able to revise and extend their remarks, but I particularly want to note and request the addition for the Record of the statement by the vice chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Stearns), who is chairing an important hearing on airline mergers now and was not able to come over and engage in the debate.  The other thing I would just like to point out is that my district in particular, though it is certainly not as rural as the State of Wyoming, is very much what I consider a microcosm of the country. We have good pockets of urban and rural, farms, businesses large and small, and I know that, particularly as chairman of this new subcommittee, we have two outstanding small telephone services, one in Bloomingdale, Michigan, in Van Buren County, and Climax Telephone Company in Kalamazoo County that will benefit from this legislation, as we will see through the rest of the country as well.  We do not need burdensome regulation imposed by anyone on small companies like these that provide really the only service, whether it be high-speed digital fiber to those communities, whether cable, all of those different things. These companies are there and they are the only ones there. In fact, their prosperity will only grow because of this legislation.  I would note that last year we passed this legislation without dissent. I would think that again this year we will pass it without dissent as well. I ask all my colleagues to vote in support of this legislation.
