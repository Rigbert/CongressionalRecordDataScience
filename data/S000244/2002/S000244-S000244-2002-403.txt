Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, I would like to express my appreciation to all of the members of the committee, to the bipartisan committee staff, to the ranking member, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), to the ranking subcommittee member, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) in putting together a bill which has huge bipartisan support.  I also express my thanks to the President and the Attorney General for recognizing the need for legislative action and restructuring the Immigration Service so that it can be functional.  I think we all recognize that this bill is not a panacea. The problems that we have heard about for the last 2.5 hours have taken years to develop: the 5 million backlog in processing applications for immigration services; the over 300,000 people who have had their day in court and have been ordered deported, that the INS has no idea where they are except that they are still in the United States of America.  So should this bill pass and be signed into law, which I earnestly hope that it will before this Congress expires, it will take a long time for us to put our immigration affairs back in order. But this is the essential first start, because if we do not restructure the INS, telling them that they are supposed to adjudicate millions more applications when they are 5 million behind is just going to mean that new immigrants will be at the bottom of the pile and will have to wait much longer.  To tell the current INS that they have to do a better job of enforcing against the Mohammed Attas that may still be in the country, when they have over 300,000 people already ordered deported and are still here, is going to complicate this system and have a further backlog. By restructuring the INS, we are on a good start. I urge Members to support this legislation.
