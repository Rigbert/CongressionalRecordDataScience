 Because if you put together a basic syllogism, the basic premise is what? There is no military solution; only a political solution.  So what yields that political solution? Can I guarantee the Senator from Minnesota, the Presiding Officer, that my solution will work? No. But I can guarantee--I will rest my career on what I am about to say--that there is no other political solution being proffered that has any--period; not one ``being offered''--and none of the tactical solutions offered will, in fact, solve this problem, none.  I know you are all afraid. I know everybody who is running is afraid to sign onto a specific proposal. ``Afraid'' is the wrong word--reluctant. Because then you become the target. You become the target. You offer a specific alternative, and it is easy to focus on whether your solution can work. If it is tried and failed, then you made a mistake. As the old saying goes: What do they pay us the big bucks for? Why are we here? Why are we here?  Let's stop pussyfooting around. Either vote for this political solution or offer another one or say you think there is a military solution or say you think it is totally hopeless, there is no resolution. Let's leave and hope for the best. But don't tell me you have a plan if it does not fall in one of those four categories. Don't tell me. That is disingenuous.  So, again, can I guarantee this will work? No. Every single day that goes by, absent an attempt to implement what I am proposing, or something similar to it, without it being attempted, makes it harder. Look, it is not often that Thomas Friedman, David Brooks, Charles Krauthammer, Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Les Gelb--I will go down the list--agree on the same principle about the most fundamental, immediate foreign policy issue facing the United States of America.  I am open--I have no pride of authorship--I am open to amending, tweaking, changing, but I will end where I begin. The central, fundamental, animating principle of this concurrent resolution is: Iraq will not be governed from the center anytime soon, and I am not prepared for my son and his generation to continue to shed their blood in an effort to do that. I will not do that.  As we leave--and we will leave, as my friend from Virginia knows--as we leave, the only honest question that any President or Senator must ask himself or herself is: Do we have any ability to affect what we leave behind? If we do, we have a moral overriding, overarching obligation to the next generation to try to do it.  Because let me tell you something, I am out there, as the old saying goes, on the trail. The easiest thing to say is: I wash my hands, man. Out. It is--let me choose my words correctly--it is not an answer. It is not an answer. It is not an honest answer.  So I ask unanimous consent that recent supporting ideas relating to federalism--whether or not they use the Biden language--be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 Recent Support for Federalism in Iraq       The Kurdish autonomous zone should be our model for Iraq.      Does George Bush or Condi Rice have a better idea? Do they      have any idea? Right now, we're surging aimlessly. Iraq's      only hope is radical federalism--with Sunnis, Shiites and      Kurds each running their own affairs, and Baghdad serving as      an ATM, dispensing cash for all three. Let's get that on the      table--now.--Thomas Friedman, New York Times, August 29, 2007       Most American experts and policy makers wasted the past few      years assuming that change in Iraq would come from the center      and spread outward. They squandered months arguing about the      benchmarks that would supposedly induce the Baghdad      politicians to make compromises. They quibbled over whether      this or that prime minister was up to the job. They      unrealistically imagined that peace would come through some      grand Sunni-Shiite reconciliation.       Now, at long last, the smartest analysts and policy makers      are starting to think like sociologists. They are finally      acknowledging that the key Iraqi figures are not in the      center but in the provinces and the tribes. Peace will come      to the center last, not to the center first. Stability will      come not through some grand reconciliation but through the      agglomeration of order, tribe by tribe and street by street.       The big change in the debate has come about because the      surge failed, and it failed in an unexpected way. The      original idea behind the surge was that U.S. troops would      create enough calm to allow the national politicians to make      compromises. The surge was intended to bolster the      ``modern''--meaning nonsectarian and nontribal--institutions      in the country. But the surge is failing, at least      politically, because there are practically no nonsectarian      institutions, and there are few nonsectarian leaders to      create them. Security gains have not led to political      gains.--David Brooks, New York Times, September 4, 2007       A weak, partitioned Iraq is not the best outcome. We had      hoped for much more. Our original objective was a democratic      and unified post-Hussein Iraq. But it has turned out to be a      bridge too far. We tried to give the Iraqis a republic, but      their leaders turned out to be, tragically, too driven by      sectarian sentiment, by an absence of national identity, and      by the habits of suspicion and maneuver cultivated during      decades in the underground of Saddam Hussein's totalitarian      state. . . .       We now have to look for the second-best outcome. A      democratic, unified Iraq might someday emerge. Perhaps      today's ground-up reconciliation in the provinces will      translate into tomorrow's ground-up national reconciliation.      Possible, but highly doubtful. What is far more certain is      what we are getting: ground-up partition.--Charles      Krauthammer, Washington Post, September 7, 2007       It is possible that the present structure in Baghdad is      incapable of national reconciliation because its elected      constituents were elected on a sectarian basis. A wiser      course would be to concentrate on the three principal regions      and promote technocratic, efficient and humane administration      in each. The provision of services and personal security      coupled with emphasis on economic, scientific and      intellectual development may represent the best hope for      fostering a sense of community. More efficient regional      government leading to substantial decrease in the level of      violence, to progress towards the rule of law and to      functioning markets could then, over a period of time, give      the Iraqi people an opportunity for national reconciliation--     especially if no region is strong enough to impose its will      on the others by force. Failing that, the country may well      drift into de facto partition under the label of autonomy,      such as already exists in the Kurdish region.--Henry      Kissinger, Washington Post, September 16, 2007
