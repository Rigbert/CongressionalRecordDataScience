 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Texas for her remarks. I think, indeed, they were very interesting. I had no idea about her family lineage and her interest in the particular day. I salute her for her comments on the floor.          Fraud and Manipulation In the Western Energy Market  Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes, if I may, to make some informal comments on something that has happened today. Today was the deadline for California to submit to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission the evidence of fraud and manipulation in the western energy market after a 100-day discovery period.  In fact, about 1,000 pages of evidence were submitted to the Commission. The problem is that evidence is not released to the public. This is a real problem.  I serve on the Energy Committee, and have served there since the crisis in 2000 and 2001 in California. The Energy Committee provides oversight to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The Federal Power Act mandates that the FERC must ensure that rates for power are just and reasonable throughout the United States.  It is very difficult to know whether the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is in fact ensuring that rates are just and reasonable if one can never view the evidence.  I happen to believe that the FERC has greatly improved. Patrick Wood, Bill Massey, Nora Brownell have been very strong in making change. That change is welcomed. It was on May 6 of last year that the major change began. It was then that the FERC ran on its Web site internal memos detailing some of the schemes Enron used in defrauding the marketplace. Get Shorty, Ricochet, Death Star, all became known to the general public directly following the posting of these memos. Since that time, several people have been indicted and pled guilty to fraud.  Additionally, more recently, one company, Reliant, was before the Commission. The Commission put on their Web site the transcript of tape recordings between Reliant managers. Those transcripts indicated instances where Reliant's plant manager and operations manager talked about holding power offline in California to drive prices up.  The operations manager--and this is not a direct quote, it is a paraphrase--said, in so many words: We are going to be manipulating the market tomorrow. So we are going to close down one plant at least for a day and perhaps more.  And the plant manager said: Oh, yes.  Well, that was sort of a dead bang admission of market manipulation. FERC, much to their credit, at the very least, fined Reliant $13.8 million. But they could have sent a much stronger message to the entire energy sector by withdrawing Reliant's ability to sell power at market-based rates. That would have sent a clear and definitive message, yet instead FERC gave Reliant a slap on the wrist.  In California, we have a real problem. One year, the entire cost of energy for the entire State was $7 billion. The next year, it was $28 billion; in other words, a 400-percent increase in 1 year's time of the cost of energy. The following year, it was $27 billion.  I remember when John Bryson, the CEO of Southern California Edison, told me that when they were forced to divest themselves of their plants, the energy generator that came in and bought one of their plants, to which they were one day selling energy at $30 a megawatt-hour, once it went to the other generator, the other generator charged $300 a megawatt-hour. When I heard that, I knew it was a real danger signal that something had really gone wrong. Well, we are a long way down the pike since then.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter I wrote this morning to the chairman of FERC, Pat Wood, in which I followed up on an earlier letter of February 6, to which I have not had a response, asking the FERC to lift the protective order that currently prevents the public from learning about evidence of fraud and manipulation in the western energy marketplace. I point out that now that the 100-day discovery period has ended, ``I write to reiterate this request and ask the commission to make all evidence public.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2003.     Hon. Pat Wood,     Chairman, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to follow up on my letter      of February 6, 2003 to ask the Federal Energy Regulatory      Commission (FERC) to immediately lift the ``Protective      Order'' that currently prevents the public from learning      about evidence of fraud and manipulation in the Western      Energy Market. Now that this 100-day discovery period has      ended, I am writing to reiterate my request and to ask the      Commission to make all evidence public--even information FERC      has obtained itself.       I would also appreciate the opportunity to review the      filing submitted today by California parties detailing new      evidence of fraud and manipulation in the Western Energy      Market. As a member of the Senate Energy Committee and the      senior Senator from California. I believe I have a duty and      responsibility to have a full working knowledge of the      evidence submitted to FERC.       I also believe that the evidence collected by FERC should      not remain confidential. Since most of the information is      over two years old, it no longer has any proprietary value.      The widespread nature of abuse of the Western Energy Markets      and its resulting economic damage on families and businesses      require the Commission to allow the public to immediately      review all evidence obtained by FERC.       As I stated in my letter last month, I also believe FERC      must carefully review all the evidence presented by the      California parties and hold hearings if necessary. How can      the Commission attempt to remedy the harm done to families      and businesses during the energy crisis if FERC cannot      determine the extent of abuse in the Western market and its      effect on energy prices and supplies?       Thank you for your consideration of this request and your      continued attention to energy problems on the West Coast.           Sincerely yours,                                                 Dianne Feinstein.
