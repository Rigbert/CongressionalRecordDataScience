 President, this Senator would always wish to correct the record of any proceedings of the Senate, or any of the committees of the Congress, when failure to do so might do an injustice.  Today it is appropriate to correct such a record, having to do with information presented to the Subcommittee on National Security Economics of the Joint Economic Committee, meeting at 10 a.m. on Wednesday, December 21, 1988. The record of the hearing was published in a collection of hearings of subcommittees of the Joint Economic Committee, Senate Hearing 100-1059 beginning at page 559.  The hearing in question concerned trafficking in classified documents of the Department of Defense, and how the Department of Defense and the Department of Justice dealt with those problems during the period 1983-88.  A staff report prepared by the staff of the Joint Economic Committee Subcommittee on National Security Economics and the investigative staff of my office was included in the hearing. The staff report contains some information, supplied by officials of the Defense Criminal Investigative Service, which is not correct.  It has been brought to my attention that some of that information may have cast an undeserved cloud upon one of the persons named in the report. Two individuals are named in this information, on page 2 of the staff report, in the following paragraph:       The Ohio investigation revealed evidence of widespread      trafficking in classified documents, involving at least ten      contractors and 30 Pentagon officials, including high level      civilian and military officials. The investigation resulted      in the indictments of two officials, John McCarthy, who was      then director of NASA Lewis Research Center, and James R.      Atchison, an Air Force employee at the Wright-Patterson Base      in Dayton, Ohio. McCarthy plead guilty in 1983 to a charge of      filing false claims in connection with travel to Washington,      D.C. Atchison resigned from the government and was not      brought to trial.  Mr. President, I would like to correct several of the statements about Mr. James R. Atchison.  Mr. Atchison has never been indicted on any charges. This is confirmed in a letter to the Joint Economic Committee of October 6, 1992, from Mr. Derek J. Vander Schaaf, Deputy Inspector General of DOD.  Mr. Vander Schaaf notes that the focus of the investigative effort that led to Mr. Atchison was the unauthorized trafficking in classified documents. But there was no evidence resulting from any DOD or NASA investigation involving Mr. Atchison in any wrongdoing relating to classified documents. The Air Force took an adverse employee action against Mr. Atchison for other reasons.  Mr. Atchison has asked that the statements about him be corrected in the record, to the extent possible. I agree, Mr. President, that the record must be corrected, and that is what I have attempted to do here today.                           ____________________
