Chairman, if the gentleman will continue to yield, the gentleman is correct. Anybody who last year voted in the majority to not appropriate further funds for Animas-La Plata will want to vote against Fazio, I know this is a little confusing, and then vote for DeFazio-Petri, Petri-DeFazio.  This obfuscation, the wording of the Fazio amendment is obfuscation. It starts out with a limitation but it limits nothing. Having the gentleman from California [Mr. Fazio] be the principal sponsor is even more confusing, and Members should in principle vote ``no'' on the Fazio amendment.
