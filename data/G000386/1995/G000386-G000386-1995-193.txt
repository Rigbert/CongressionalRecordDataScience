 I have one other question for my colleague, regarding the Commission membership requirements. I understand that the membership provision of the Commission was intended to preclude from continued membership a person who had been appointed to that position due to his or her capacity as an officer or employee of a government. Would the Senator from Alabama explain to me who this provision is meant to preclude from membership on the Commission?
