 President, I ask unanimous consent that at 10 a.m. on Thursday, September 16, the Senate proceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2490, the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill.  I further ask consent that the reading be waived and that there be 10 minutes of debate equally divided in the usual form.  I finally ask consent that following the debate, the Senate proceed to a vote on the adoption of the conference report with no intervening action or debate.
