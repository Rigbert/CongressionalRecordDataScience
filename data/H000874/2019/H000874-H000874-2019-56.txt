 But having said that, we hope we can move forward. But to absolve the United States Senate, led by Republicans, have a majority of Republicans controlling the Senate Committee on Appropriations and controlling what goes on the floor--Democrats don't control that; the Republicans control it--they didn't bring a single appropriations bill to the floor.

I will leave it to the American public, Madam Speaker, to determine who is being partisan on this issue and who is not.
