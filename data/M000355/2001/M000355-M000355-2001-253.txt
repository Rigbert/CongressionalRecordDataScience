 According to your own chart, which I have in front of me, that remains unchanged from current law.  Let me repeat the question. Everyone agrees that the abolition of soft money, which this bill will accomplish based upon the Hagel vote yesterday, will take away 40 percent of the budgets of the two big national committees and 35 percent of the budgets of the two senatorial committees--gone. Your bill does not change what an individual can contribute in hard dollars to a party; it does not change that from current law.  Thus my question: How does the Senator envision that her proposal would help in any way the national party committees compensate in hard dollars for the loss of soft dollars?
