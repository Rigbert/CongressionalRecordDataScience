. 3326, the Department of Defense Appropriations Bill for fiscal year 2010.  1. Advanced Digital Hydraulic Drive Systems  Account: Research, Development, Test and Evaluation--Army  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: Eaton Corporation  Address of Requesting Entity: 26201 Northwestern Highway, Southfield, MI  Amount: $2,500,000  Description of Request: The objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate a hybrid hydraulic drive system on military 4x4 vehicles, This compact drive system will enable vehicles to be operated more safely and effectively on even the harshest terrains, and also save a substantial amount of fuel. Having seen firsthand the challenges vehicles currently face with respect to immobilization, roll-over or forced-slow speeds due to weight, the value of such a system is very apparent. The additional weight of important armor results in increased problems with maneuverability, so the reduced weight of the new hybrid system addresses this problem. In addition to reducing the weight of the drive system, this project will also increase fuel efficiency by roughly 60 percent. The increased fuel efficiency will provide clear logistical benefits by increasing vehicle range and decreasing vehicle re-fueling requirements. This is not at the expense of vehicle performance, however, as the reduced weight will actually add to vehicle traction and performance.  Funding Breakdown: Funding for Phase III funding of this program will be used specifically to (1) develop and demonstrate a laboratory-scale advanced digital hydraulic system and (2) create and demonstrate a retrofit-kit prototype inserted onto a demonstrator vehicle. Approximately 10 percent of the funds will be use for high pressure component and system reliability testing, 10 percent will be used to develop drivetrain-specific parametric models from vehicle drive-test data, 35 percent to develop the retrofit kit and 45 percent to develop the lab-scale system integrating advanced components.  Justification for the use of taxpayer dollars: This project will dramatically increase fuel efficiency in military vehicles, and hence, provide logistical benefits as well as preserve fuel. The new hybrid system will also reduce vehicle weight, which will add to vehicle performance and allow for vehicles to carry increased armor or supplies.  2. University of Michigan Center for the Genetic Origins of Cancer  Account: Research, Development, Test and Evaluation--Army  Legal Name of Requesting Entity: The University of Michigan Comprehensive Cancer Center  Address of Requesting Entity: 1500 E Medical Center Drive, Ann Arbor, MI  Amount: $2,500,000  I am supporting Rep. John Dingell's request for funding for the University of Michigan's Center for the Genetic Origins of Cancer. The goal of the Center for Genetic Origins of Cancer is to accelerate the discovery of molecular signatures of cancers and rapidly develop personalized treatments for cancer patients. This initiative's purpose is to deliver the right treatment to the right patient at the right time. Specifically, the funding will be going to three things integrative oncogenomics, which would identify novel gene fusions in tumors of the breast, prostate, lung, and colon; unique animal models, which would use recent breakthroughs in gene fusion research in animals to mimic tumors in humans; and lastly, to study the functional genomics of cancer stem cells, which are believed to be the cells that actually start the growth of tumors. This is very exciting research, and it could very soon benefit thousands of my constituents, and millions of folks across the country.  Funding Breakdown: The DOD funding will account for roughly 18 percent of funds forthis program. 36 percent of the funding will go toward research costs, 30.5 percent of this funding will go toward equipment and cores, 23.5 percent will go to miscellaneous needs, including a sequencing machine, cell sorter, and auto starter.                          ____________________
