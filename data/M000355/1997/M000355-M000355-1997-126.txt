 President, before the Senator from New Jersey leaves, if I might just impose upon him for a few moments. I was listening to his comments and his enthusiasm for the portions of the McCain-Feingold bill that seek to make it more difficult for citizens to engage in issue advocacy and to change the rules with regard to independent expenditures.  I make reference to a letter I received from the American Civil Liberties Union earlier this year discussing those two types of citizen expression. Quoting from the letter:       Two basic truths have emerged with crystal clarity after 20      years of campaign finance decisions.  That is after a whole string of cases, beginning with Buckley.       First, independent expenditures for ``express electoral      advocacy'' by citizens groups about political candidates lie      at the very core of the meaning and purpose of the first      amendment.       Second, issue advocacy by citizen groups lies totally      outside the permissible area of Government regulation.  I say to my friend from New Jersey, on what basis does he reach the conclusion that there is any chance whatsoever that these portions of the McCain-Feingold, since there is no hint that the courts are ever going to tamper with express advocacy--there is a whole line of cases, the most recent one about 3 months ago--does my friend from New Jersey think there is going to be some revelation in the courts? Are they going to rethink 20 years of decisions in this area? Or does he think we ought to just pass, blatantly, unconstitutional legislation regardless of what the Supreme Court says?
