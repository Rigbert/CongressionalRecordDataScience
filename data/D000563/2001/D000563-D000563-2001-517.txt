The Senator from Vermont understands, as I do, that occasionally people find themselves in a difficult position where they can only make the minimum monthly payment in a given month. They have bad circumstances and they are having a tough time of it. I understand that. I think that is something that may happen to any family. But you ought to do it with your eyes wide open, so you realize if you do this repeatedly, making the minimummonthly payment month after month, you will never get out of the hole; the hole may be there for 7 or 8 years.  Now, why is the credit card industry so reluctant to tell consumers the truth? There was a law passed several decades ago called Truth in Lending. This credit card provision that I am supporting is ``truth in credit cards,'' so they will at least give consumers the information so they can decide what is best for them and their families. They may decide they had better pay off all the balance. Maybe they do not need an extra credit card. They can make a responsible decision.  This whole debate about bankruptcy got started when the credit industry came to my office and said they thought bankruptcy had lost the moral stigma it once had: Too many people are flooding the bankruptcy courts, and they are not very embarrassed by it.  I can tell you, the attorneys and the trustees and the judges to whom I have spoken dispute that. They find people showing up in these courts very sad about the circumstances that surround them. They have done their level best with small businesses and their families, and they are in over their heads and have nowhere to turn. They have a family tragedy they didn't anticipate--usually a medical bill they can't pay--and they wish they never had to be in bankruptcy court.  I also turned to the credit card industry and said: If we are talking about a moral stigma, what is your moral responsibility when it comes to flooding America with credit card applications? When it comes to young people in America, who do not have any source of income, receiving solicitation after solicitation for credit cards, don't you have some responsibility to make sure you are not extending credit beyond a person's ability to pay? They will not accept that responsibility.  Why is it that they focus on college students, for example? They believe in brand loyalty. They think if you are in college and you decide to take a Visa card, or a MasterCard, or a Discover card, or an American Express card, that is going to be your favorite brand of credit. They want to get you early. And some sad things have resulted.  Senator Feinstein of California and I are going to offer an amendment a little later. The amendment is going to set a cap on the total amount of credit available to young people through their credit cards. It is a sensible measure that protects college students and other young adults who are at an age when many are getting their first taste of personal and financial independence. It protects the companies issuing the credit cards from having their customers assume far more debt than they are able to handle.  I do not need to tell you there is an epidemic of credit card default among young people today, especially on college campuses. I can go to a University of Illinois football game in Champaign. I go into the stadium, go up the ramp, and at the top of the ramp someone is waving a T-shirt at me that says ``University of Illinois.'' And I can say: What is this all about? They say: If you will sign up for a University of Illinois credit card, we will give you a free T-shirt. They are doing everything they can to lure students to these credit cards.  Then you go to places such as the University of Indiana, and the dean of students says more students drop out due to credit card debt than to academic failure.  What are the statistics on young people filing bankruptcy in America? In the early 1990s, only 1 percent of all personal bankruptcies were filed by people under the age of 25. By 1996--just a few years later--that figure increased to 8.7 percent--more than an eightfold increase in the proportion of young, college-age people filing for bankruptcy.  Remember, my friends, student loans are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. So if you go into a bankruptcy court because you are in over your head with a credit card, you still have your student loan hanging after you have left the court. That, to me, says we have a scandalous situation on our hands that the credit card industry is exploiting. The amendment Senator Feinstein will offer a little later addresses it.  Let me give you one illustration. Sean Moyer got his first credit card at age 18, when he was a student at the University of Texas. Sean committed suicide at age 22, after he ran up more than $14,000 in debt on his credit cards. His mother told CBS News the following:       It just did not occur to me that you . . . would give a      credit card to an 18-year-old, who was . . . making minimum      wage [at a job]. I never thought that he would end up with, I      think it was two Visas, a Discover, a MasterCard. When [Sean]      died, he had 12 credit cards.  Sean was a smart kid, a National Merit Scholar winner. He was on his way to law school. But in many ways he was a young boy who succumbed to the temptation of easy credit.  As his mother went on to say:       Anybody that has 18-year-olds knows they are not adults      [many times]. I don't care what the law says. They are 18 one      minute. They are 13 the [next]. Here they are in college,      their first time away from home. They're learning to [try to]      manage their money.  We ought to keep people such as Sean Moyer and these young men and women in our mind as we talk about bankruptcy reform. That is why Senator Feinstein's amendment makes so much sense. It sets a reasonable credit cap for all credit cards. We are not saying a young person can't have a credit card. We are talking about unlimited credit, that we get a young person with literally no job with debt of $14,000 or more. This is a reasonable extension of credit for these young credit card holders. It is indexed to the consumer price index to adjust to inflation.  As a further protection, we have in the amendment the statement that if you happen to have the cosignature of your parent or guardian, you might have more credit offered to you.  These simple measures would protect our young people from getting in over their heads with multiple credit cards. It is no surprise that the credit industry hates this like the Devil hates holy water. The idea that they can't go out and lure and hook in all of these young people at a vulnerable point in their lives is something of which they are frightened. They are going to oppose the Feinstein amendment.  Let me talk for a moment about moral stigma, the moral stigma of people with an average income of $22,000 a year going to bankruptcy court, heartbroken over medical bills or divorce or loss of job. How about the moral stigma of these credit card companies, wallpapering college campuses with credit cards the kids just can't keep up with. I know Senator Feinstein plans to reoffer her amendment on the floor. Senator Jeffords and I are cosponsors of this sensible, bipartisan amendment. I urge my colleagues to support it.  Balance is certainly the order of the day in this debate. We are a new Congress with a balanced 50/50 Senate. We have a new President, faced with the challenge of uniting an evenly divided electorate. We have a new and real opportunity to work together to pass genuine bankruptcy reform, reform that is balanced, meaningful, and fair.  In a few moments I will send to the desk an amendment to the bankruptcy bill aimed at another area of abuse which should be resolved. It is directed particularly to what is known as predatory lending practices. Much of our discussion concerning reform of the Nation's bankruptcy laws is focused on the perceived abuses of the bankruptcy system by consumers and debtors. Much less discussion has occurred with regard to abuses by creditors who help usher the Nation's consumers into bankruptcy.  I believe there are abuses on both sides and that bankruptcy reform is incomplete if it does not address both sides. Studies have identified a host of predatory financial practices directed at the Nation's financially vulnerable. These studies suggest that many low-income Americans participate in a virtual fringe economy. They may lack access to mainstream banks and financial institutions. They may lack the collateral or the credit rating needed to secure loans for a home, to buy a car, pay for home repairs, or other essential needs. This vulnerable segment of our economy is at the mercy of a variety of credit practices by a variety of offerors that can lead to financial ruin.  High-pressure consumer finance companies have bilked unsophisticated consumers out of substantial sums by aggressively marketing expensive loan insurance products, charging usurious interest rates, urging repeated refinancing, and loading their productswith hidden fees and costs. High cost mortgage lenders have defrauded millions of older Americans with modest income but substantial home equity of their lifelong home ownership investments. Senator Grassley of Iowa, who has been the chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, has held hearings, heartbreaking stories of elderly people, usually women living alone, who are preyed upon by these companies that come in and lure them into signing documents they barely understand for repair of their homes with terms and conditions that are unfair by any standard.  Some auto lenders in the used car industry have gouged consumers with interest rates as high as 50 percent, with assessments for credit insurance, repair warranties, and hidden fees, adding thousands of dollars to the cost of an otherwise inexpensive used car. Pawnshops in some States have charged annual rates of 240 percent or more to customers who have nowhere else to turn for small short-term loans. Abusive credit practices of every stripe harm millions of older and low-income Americans every single year.  During the committee debate on S. 1301, I offered an amendment designed to address and curtail just one bad practice among many predatory high-cost mortgage loans targeted at the low-income elderly and the financially unsophisticated. This amendment was adopted unanimously on a previous bill and was stripped out in conference. The credit industry did not want us to even go after the bottom feeders in their business, the people who prey on the elderly and uninformed.  I will reoffer this language today as an amendment to this bankruptcy bill. This is the exact same language that was in the 1998 bankruptcy bill that passed the Senate 97-1. It is also the same language that many of my colleagues, including Senator Grassley and Senator Specter, voted for in the 106th Congress. It is my hope that they will join me in supporting this amendment again.  In recent years there has been an explosion on the market for this type of home mortgage, generally for second mortgages that are not used to fund the purchase or construction of a home. The market is known as the subprime mortgage industry. The subprime mortgage industry offers home mortgage loans to high-risk borrowers, loans carrying far greater interest rates and fees than conventional loans and carrying extremely high profit margins for the lenders.  According to the Mortgage Market Statistical Annual for the year 2000, subprime loan originations increased from $35 billion in 1994 to $160 billion in 1999.  As a percentage of all mortgage originations, the subprime market share increased from less than 5 percent in 1994 to almost 13 percent in 1999. This is not an isolated incident. This is a trend, a trend where people are preying on vulnerable consumers across America, usually widows, usually elderly women, ultimately trying to take away their homes in bankruptcy court.  We are considering a bankruptcy reform bill where we are supposed to be eliminating abuses? For goodness' sake, should we not eliminate the use of the predatory lending which we see is growing by leaps and bounds in this country?  By 1999, outstanding subprime mortgages amounted to $370 billion. Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data shows a substantial growth in subprime lending. The number of home purchase and refinance loans reported under HMDA by lenders specializing in subprime lending increased almost tenfold between 1993 and 1998, from 104,000 to 997,000. I will relate a few stories in a moment that will illustrate the kinds of loans, the kinds of, what I consider, extremely corrupt practices by the credit industry that are rewarded in bankruptcy court.  You will see when this amendment comes up for a vote if the credit industry itself, which prides itself on being a major financial institution in America, is willing to step forward and point out the wrongdoers within its own ranks. Sadly we have seen over the last several years they were not.  The growth of the subprime lending industry is of concern to us for two reasons: First, because of their reprehensible practices called predatory lending practices, which some of these companies use to conduct their business; second, because of the vulnerable people involved, senior citizens, low-income people, the financially unwary to whom they often target their loans.  According to 1998 Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, low-income borrowers accounted for 41 percent of subprime refinance mortgages. African-American borrowers accounted for 19 percent of all subprime refinance loans. In 1998, when Senator Grassley held the hearing I referred to earlier with the Special Committee on Aging, several people came forward to tell their stories.  William Brennan, director of the Home Defense Program of the Atlanta, GA, Legal Aid Society, put a human face on this issue and this amendment. He told us of the story of Genie McNab, a 70-year-old woman living in Decatur, GA.  Mrs. McNab is retired. She lives alone on Social Security and retirement. In November of 1996, a mortgage broker contacted her and, through this mortgage broker, she obtained a 15-year mortgage loan for $54,000 from a large national finance company. Her annual percentage rate was 12.85 percent. Listen to the terms of the mortgage. She will pay $596.49 a month until the year 2011, when she will be expected, and required, to make a final payment of $47,599.14--a balloon payment for an elderly lady living on Social Security. By the time she is finished with this mortgage that this fellow convinced her to sign for, her $54,200 loan will have cost her $154,967, and she faces a balloon payment of almost $48,000 at the end.  When Ms. McNab turns 83 years old, she will be saddled with this balloon payment that she will never be able to make. She will face foreclosure of probably the only real asset in her life--something she has worked for her entire life--and she will be forced to consider bankruptcy. She will face the loss of her home and her financial security, not to mention her dignity and sense of well-being. Ironically, she had to pay this mortgage broker a $700 fee to find her this ``wonderful'' loan--a mortgage broker who also collected a $1,100 fee from the mortgage lender.  Unfortunately, Ms. McNab is a typical target of the high-cost mortgage lender--an elderly person, living alone, on a fixed income. She is just the kind of person who may suddenly have encountered the death of a spouse and the loss of income, a large medical bill, an expensive home repair, or mounting credit card debt. All of these things could push her over the edge, just making regular monthly payments, not to mention a $48,000 balloon payment, at the age of 83.  These are all real-life circumstances which make her an irresistible target for some of the most unscrupulous members of the mortgage industry in America.  According to a former career employee of this industry who testified anonymously at a hearing before Senator Grassley's committee, ``My perfect customer would be an uneducated woman who is living on a fixed income--hopefully from her deceased husband's pension and social security--who has her house paid off, is living off credit cards but having a difficult time keeping up with her payments, and who must make a car payment in addition to her credit card payments.''  This industry professional candidly acknowledged that unscrupulous lenders specifically market their loans to elderly widowed women, people who haven't gone to school, who are on fixed incomes, have a limited command of the English language, and people who have significant equity in their homes.  They targeted another such person right here in Washington, DC, by the name of Helen Ferguson. She also testified before Senator Grassley's committee. She was 76 years old at the time. This is what she told us: As a result of predatory lending practices, she was about to lose her home. In 1991, she had a total monthly income of $504 from Social Security. With the help of her family, she made a $229 monthly mortgage payment on her home. However, on a fixed income she didn't have enough money for repairs. She started listening to radio and TV ads about low-interest home improvement loans. She called one of the numbers. She thought she had signed up for a $25,000loan. In reality, the lender collected over $5,000 in fees and settlement charges for a $15,000 loan.  Again, describing the predatory cases, Ms. Ferguson decided she needed to take out a loan. She thought she was borrowing $25,000. After the fees, she was borrowing $15,000. She was living on $500 a month in Social Security. The interest rate the lender charged her was 17 percent. Her mortgage payments went up to $400 a month--almost twice her original payment. Over the next few years, this lender repeatedly tried to lure Ms. Ferguson into more debt. He called her at home, called her sister at home and at work, and he sent her letters, and, God bless him, he even sent a Christmas card. In March of 1993, she gave in to this lender, borrowing money to make home repairs.  By March of 1994, she could not keep up with her mortgage payments. She signed for a loan with another lender, unaware that it had a variable interest rate and terms that caused her payments to rise to $600 a month and eventually to $723 a month. Remember, $500 a month was her Social Security income. She is now up to $723 a month in mortgage payments. For this loan, she paid $5,000 in broker fees and more than 14 percent in total fees and settlement charges. The first lender also continued to solicit her. She eventually signed up for even more loans. Each time, the lender persuaded her that refinancing was the best way out of her predicament.  Ms. Ferguson was the target of a predatory loan practice known as loan flipping.  Why is this an important discussion in the middle of a bankruptcy bill? Because, frankly, these bottom feeders make terrible loans to vulnerable people who ultimately end up in bankruptcy court, taking away the homes of people such as Ms. Ferguson.  I have tried to convince my colleagues on the committee that if we are going to reform the bankruptcy code, for goodness' sake, why would we reward people who are making these terrible arrangements with elderly, low-income people, with limited education, and taking away the only thing they have on Earth--their homes?  When I say this to the financial industry and the credit card industry, they say, ``You just don't understand the free market.'' The free market? This isn't a free market. This is some of the worst corruption, worst credit practices in America. We are about to protect them with this bill.  Let me tell you what Senator Grassley said about it when he held this hearing back in 1998. My colleague from Iowa has a lot of Midwestern wisdom to share here:       What exactly are we talking about when we say that equity      predators target folks who are equity rich and cash poor?      These folks are our mothers, our fathers, our aunts and      uncles, and all people who live on fixed incomes. These are      people who often times exist from check to check and dollar      to dollar, and who have put their blood, sweat, and tears      into buying a piece of the American dream and that is their      own home.  He goes on to say:       Before we begin this hearing, I want to quote a victim--a      quote that sums up what we are talking about here today. She      said the following: ``They did what a man with a gun in a      dark alley could not do: they stole my house.''  That is Senator Grassley talking about predatory lenders, who are protected by this bankruptcy bill. That is why I am offering this amendment. They don't deserve this protection. Ms. Ferguson was eventually obligated to make more than $800 monthly payments, although her income was $500--and the lenders knew it from the start. In 5 years, the debt on her home--this elderly lady living on Social Security--increased from $20,000 to over $85,000.  She felt helpless and overwhelmed. It was only after contacting AARP that she realized these lenders were violating the Federal law.  Lump-sum balloon payments on short-term loans, loan flipping, the extension of credit with a complete disregard for the borrower's ability to repay--these aren't the only abusive mortgage practices. Lenders on these secondary mortgages sometimes include harsh repayment penalties in the loan terms, or rollover fees and charges into the loan, or negatively amortize the loan payment so the principal actually increases over time--all of which is prohibited by law, although ordinary homeowners are unlikely to even know that. Some of these homeowners will make it to a lawyer and get help before it is too late. Many of them will be forced into bankruptcy court. They will walk into that court, and this slimy individual and his company, which has given them this terrible loan that violates the law, will stand up proudly, through his lawyer, and take it all away.  This bill will not even address that issue unless the Durbin amendment is adopted.  On March 5, US News & World Report featured a telling article in their business & technology section entitled: ``Sometimes a deal is too good to be true: Big-bank lending and inner-city evictions.'' In the article Jeff Glasser describes two cases that originate from my home state of Illinois that I want to share with you.  The first involves Goldie Johnson. The lender was Equicredit, a subsidiary of Bank of America:  Goldie Johnson is a 71-year-old homeowner who lives on the Westside of Chicago with her daughter and 4 grandchildren. Her income is $1,270 a month from Social Security and pension. Between June 1996 and March 1999, Ms. Johnson entered into at least three refinancing agreements with various subprime lenders and brokers.  In March, Ms. Johnson was contacted through a phone solicitation by a mortgage broker, who promised Ms. Johnson that she could get a new loan that would refinance her two existing mortgages, provide her with $5,000 in extra cash and lower her monthly mortgage payments. Ms. Johnson was in desperate need of cash to repair her kitchen. She agreed to meet with the broker.  She met with broker twice. On second visit she was presented with a myriad of papers to sign.  Ms. Johnson, who suffers from glaucoma was not able to read the documents carefully. In fact, after looking over only a few of the papers she stopped because her eyes became too tired to continue.  Nonetheless, based on the broker's promises and representations that the loan would provide her with cash to repair her kitchen and lower her mortgage payments, Ms. Johnson signed the loan documents. She was not provided with copies of any of the documents.  The mortgage documents created a loan transaction between Ms. Johnson and Mercantile for the principal amount of $90,000 with an annual percentage rate of 14.8 percent.  The transaction created a 15-year loan with monthly mortgage payments of $994.57, excluding taxes and insurance, with a balloon payment on the 180th month of $79,722.61.  The monthly mortgage payment was 80 percent of this retired lady's income.  The final balloon payment--the amount of principal owed after Ms. Johnson pays the lender approximately $1,000 a month over 15 years--was greater than the secured debt on her home before she entered into this agreement.  Ms. Johnson received no proceeds from the transactions. The broker and lender received at least $9,760 in points and fee from the loan. Equicredit is now attempting to foreclose on Ms. Johnson's home.  Then the case of James and Clarice Mason, the lender was Fieldstone, then Household.  James Mason, age 62, with his wife Clarice who died on June 8, 1999, owned and lived in his home on the west side of Chicago since 1971.  In 1991, the Masons successfully paid off the original mortgage on their home.  In 1993, Mrs. Mason became disabled due to diabetes and arthritis.  In 1995, Mr. Mason became disabled due to a stroke. The stroke has left Mr. Mason with brain damage that has impaired his memory and thinking.  In November 1998, Mr. and Mrs. Mason's home was free and clear of all liens.  On or about the end of November 1998, they were repeatedly solicited for home repair work. Mrs. Mason eventually agreed to meet with home repair company and later mortgage broker. They promised the necessary repairs would cost $15,000 and that the broker would help them find financing.  On December 6, 1998, about a week after completing the loan application, Mrs. Mason was hospitalized for complications arising from her diabetes.  On December 7, 1998, Mrs. Mason was visited at the hospital by a broker who explained that he had come to visit Mrs. Mason and to help her complete her loan transaction. What a wonderful person. He then present Mrs. Mason with numerous documents and told Mrs. Mason to sign them. The agent of the company provided Mrs. Mason with no opportunity to review the documents, but assured her that this was the loan she had ``discussed'' with New Look that would allow her home to be repaired.  Mrs. Mason, although unclear about what she was signing, signed all the documents provided by the agent because she trusted him. She believed he was trying to help.  At the time she signed the loan documents, Mrs. Mason was in a disoriented state due to her severe illness. At the time she signed the loan documents, Mrs. Mason's vision was impaired because of a cataract on one of her eyes. At no time was Mr. Mason, co-owner of the home, asked to sign any of the loan documents. Nonetheless, Mr. Mason's forged signature appears on the mortgage agreement. The documents that were ``signed'' created a 30-year loan agreement, with a principle of $70,000.  Under the terms of the loan, Mr. and Mrs. Mason's monthly mortgage payment was to start at $601.41 and adjust upward to $697.  Remember, this is an elderly couple retired with their home all paid for, and to get $15,000 worth of repairs on their home, they signed on to a mortgage that cost them about $700 a month.  Under the terms of the loan, Mr. and Mrs. Mason were charged at least $7,343 in prepaid finance charges.  The home contractor received $35,000.  The Masons received no money.  Work was barely started and never completed.  A suit was filed against the home repair company, broker, and two lenders.  After the suit, the home was severely damaged by a suspicious fire.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this US News & World Report article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From U.S. News & World Report, March 5, 2001]                Sometimes a Deal Is too Good To Be True                           (By Jeff Glasser)       Chicago.--One day in March 1999, mortgage broker Mark      Diamond arrived on Goldie Johnson's west-side doorstep, his      portable photocopier in tow. Here's the 72-year-old retiree's      version--from court papers and interviews--of how Diamond's      promise to save her thousands of dollars may end up costing      Johnson her home: He told her that if she refinanced her      mortgage, he could cut her debts and get her up to $8,000 in      cash. With the money, she could fix her rotting kitchen      floors and replace the rickety basement beams. But to get the      cash, she had to act fast. (She believed him. He said he was      ``in the business of helping senior citizens.'') He handed      her a thick stack of loan papers. Johnson, who suffers from      glaucoma, says she could barely read them. ``Don't worry      about it,'' he said. So she signed, 13 times.       Johnson says she never saw any cash. The loan she signed      saddled her with monthly payments of $994.57--about $200 more      than she had been paying--and consumed about 80 percent of      her fixed income. A balloon payment of $80,000 would be due      the year Johnson turns 86. Meanwhile, Diamond's company fee      for selling the loan came to $9,010. ``I've heard of sticking      people up with guns, not with pens,'' says Johnson, who      cannot pay the mortgage and is fighting to save her home from      foreclosure in court. Diamond disputed her account and denied      wrongdoing through his lawyer.       What's unusual about the case of Goldie Johnson is that she      wasn't simply the alleged victim of a fast-talking predator.      Her loan was sold to a company called EquiCredit, a      subsidiary of the Bank of America, a prestigious institution      not often linked to inner-city evictions. But Bank of America      is one of a number of the nation's top commercial banks,      including Citigroup and J. P. Morgan Chase, that have      recently inked deals with subprime lenders--companies that      offer loans to people with less than perfect credit. Subprime      loans promise profit margins far greater than do low-interest      conventional mortgages.       This foray by the big banks coincides with a surge in the      number of subprime loan defaults. Certainly not all subprime      loans are predatory. But foreclosures in the Chicago area by      subprimes have risen from 131 in 1993 to 4,958 in 1999,      according to the National Training and Information Center, a      watchdog group. Consumers in other areas are also complaining      about lending abuses, causing more than 30 states and dozens      of cities to consider curbs on predatory lending.       The upswing in defaults poses a double challenge for the      big banks: They must fend off hundreds of lawsuits brought      against their subsidiaries. As they do so, they will be asked      to bring better practices to an industry derided as      ``legalized loan sharking'' by detractors.       The tactics are all too familiar. Critics call one the      ``bait'' scam: In Philadelphia, where the 3,226 foreclosures      last year were almost double the number in 1997, a poor      veteran named Leroy Howard says in bankruptcy papers that he      was lured into refinancing his mortgage with an offer of      $4,000 in cash and debt relief. When he accepted, his      mortgage doubled in size to $40,000, including $9,040 in new      fees and charges. Howard's attorney charges the lender made      the loan even though it was aware Howard could not repay it;      a notation in his file says he would use the cash for food.      Citigroup, which acquired the loan's servicing rights,      settled the case.       There's the hard sell: In Chicago, it is alleged in court      that a home improvement contractor, along with a mortgage      broker, went to a local hospital and persuaded a woman      admitted there to refinance on unfavorable terms. ``You      couldn't tell him no that day,'' says Valerie Mason, daughter      of the woman, who has died.       The banks don't condone these tactics. ``Small,      unscrupulous lenders don't have to follow the rules,'' says      Howard Glaser, chief lobbyist for the Mortgage Bankers      Association. The responsible lenders ``get tainted by what      the bad actors do.'' The major lenders--including Citigroup      and Bank of America--argue that subprime lending doesn't bilk      the innocent or gut neighborhoods. Far from it, they say: The      vast majority of the loans help people with bad credit to      repair their homes and settle their debts. A decade ago,      homeowners with imperfect credit would have paid 5 to 10      percentage points more for loans, they say, if they could get      a loan at all. The banks also claim that the number of      predatory lending cases is minuscule, though consumer      advocates disagree. (There are no national data to resolve      that dispute.)       Flipping and packing. The taint of predatory lending hasn't      deterred major banks from entering the growing subprime      market. There were 856,000 subprime loans issued in 1999, six      times as many as in 1994. Those loans often produce margins      eight times those of conventional mortgages, although there's      a greater risk of default and higher servicing costs. Banks      can make more money by packaging subprime loans as mortgage-     backed securities and selling them to mutual funds.       But can the major banks help curb bad practices? Citigroup      will be the largest test case. In November, the company      completed a $27 billion acquisition of Associates First      Capital, which was spending $19 million to fight more than      700 lending lawsuits. The suits spotlight more questionable      tactics. For example, Associates established quotas for      refinancing loans over and over, or ``flipping'' them, with      no benefit to the consumer, former company employees      testified. (Its motto, according to the court papers: ``A      loan a day or no pay.'')       Another common practice, employees said, was the      ``packing'' of costly insurance products into the price of a      loan. Consider the testimony of Rick McFadden, a branch      manager in Tacoma, Wash. When he failed to tack on the      insurance, the boss would crumple a piece of paper into the      phone. ``You hear that?'' the boss would say. ``That's your      loan. It doesn't have any insurance on it. . . .'' And into      the trash it would go. A Citigroup spokesman declined to      comment on the testimony but said the issues ``have been      addressed in the pledges we've made.'' Citi settled a Georgia      class-action ``packing'' lawsuit in January for $9 million      and, U.S. News has learned, a similar suit in Pennsylvania.      In reforms announced last fall (including caps on fees and      improved training), the company condemned the practices of      ``packing'' and ``flipping.''       Still, victims seeking restitution are having a hard time      figuring out who is to blame. In Goldie Johnson's case, her      loan was solicited by Diamond but ended up in EquiCredit's      portfolio. The Bank of America subsidiary then tried to      foreclose on Johnson. The company claimed in court, however,      that it was not responsible for tactics used to sell the      original mortgage. (Since the lawsuit was filed, the loan has      been sold again.) The insulation of the banks rankles legal-     aid lawyers. ``At some point, the ostrich defense doesn't      work,'' says Johnson's attorney, Ira Rheingold.       While lawyers and lenders duke it out, once stable      neighborhoods in places like Maywood, Ill., a working-class      Chicago suburb, are filled with boarded-up houses resulting      from foreclosures. Resident Delores Rolle, 51, says gang      members from the Latin Kings took over an abandoned house,      put up drapes, and used it for drug dealing. ``This has been      a nightmare,'' says Rolle. ``It's Beirut around here.''
