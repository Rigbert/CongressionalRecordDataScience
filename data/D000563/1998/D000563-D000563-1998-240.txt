President, I rise today in order to engage the chairman of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Cochran, in a brief colloquy regarding the ``Orphan Products Research Grant'' program. I am pleased to note that the bill before us which includes funding for the Food and Drug Administration specifically maintains the current level of funding for the operation and grants that support research on rare conditions and diseases, the so-called ``orphan products''. While I hasten to point out here, as in many other cases, continued level funding is a reduction in program effectiveness because underlying costs go up which result in fewer grants and less research efforts going into this effort to help what have to be some of the most neglected and medically needy in our society who lack effective therapies.  Beyond the grant funding, I am seeking assurance that the Committee intends that the staffing and support functions of the FDA's orphan program are to be continued at not less than the current level of appropriated dollars and FTE's allocated to this most important mission and function. I understand that the FY98 resources are 17 FTEs and $1.8 million for operation costs for administering the Office for Orphan Products Development. The total funding level is $11.542 million which includes both grants and operation costs. The whole program is relatively small, clearly within the core functions of the agency, and extraordinarily effective and productive. It certainly deserves to have priority on any future increased funds that become available. In the last 15 years, this program has nurtured the development and marketing of more than 170 products, 21 of which have directly benefitted from its grant funding. It could easily get lost in the focus on many of the other big ticket, high visibility responsibilities of the FDA.
