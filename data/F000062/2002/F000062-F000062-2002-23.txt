 President, as chair of the Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittee, I have the opportunity and responsibility to take a close look at our military's construction needs throughout the world.  During our August recess, I chose to take a closer look at an initiative recently implemented by the Army in Europe called ``Efficient Basing''. This initiative is a two part process that will streamline the Army's infrastructure needs in Germany and in Italy.  The plan will direct much needed funds to consolidate U.S. bases throughout Germany, and better position an airborne battalion south of the Alps in Vicenza, Italy to more quickly respond to the possibility of crisis in the Transcaucasus, the Balkans, the Middle East and Africa.  Although the costs for this initiative could total nearly $1 billion when complete, there is little doubt that it will both dramatically reduce the long term costs of basing our forces in Western Europe and provide better strategic positioning for regional conflicts and the global war on terrorism.  This aptly named ``Efficient Basing'' initiative is being guided by the U.S. Army's European Commander in Chief, Gen. Montgomery Meigs. General Meigs invited me to Europe to take a closer look at the work in progress and allow him the opportunity to justify the costs associated with the program. As a result, I went to Camp Ederle, in Vicenza, Italy, and was able to see first hand the real efficiency of this tremendously large task and recognize the actual savings to be gained.  I would like to take a few minutes to recognize the degree of dedication and service to our country that is often overlooked.  Whether fighting a war, or carrying out the daily administrative tasks necessary to provide protection for America at home and abroad, our military commanders and the soldiers within their command display a level of dedication, efficiency, and selflessness that is awe inspiring.  We ask a lot of our soldiers, sailors, Marines and airmen. And, without question, they are up to the task, whatever it might be.  Let me give just a couple of examples: In his nearly 35 years of military service, General Meigs and his wife, Mary-Ann have moved their family 24 times. That's not just soldier dedication, that's family dedication--all for the sake of our freedom. This sacrifice is recognized throughout the world, not only by Americans, but by our allies and partners as well.  In the wake of September 11, a strangely surprising and caring act took place on the part of our Italian allies. In less than 24 hours, the Carabinieri--Italian police--in a show of force protection, came out in large numbers to surround our Vicenza base, Camp Ederle.  The base didn't solicit their presence. It was given voluntarily.  Acts like this do not just happen--they take time and the creation of a rapport built on admiration and years of interaction with our commanders and soldiers. The actions of the Carabinieri was, in part, a response to a lasting friendship--a friendship forged by men like MG Robert Wagner, the Southern European Task Force, SETAF, Commander.  General Wagner, a shining example for all to follow, is one hundred percent engaged with the leaders of the community--the mayor, the director of the Carabinieri, and businesses leaders throughout northern Italy.  The relationships and mutual admiration did not just happen by virtue of his position. It was developed over time, by him and by his predecessors, who hosted dinners and got to know these leaders and their needs, as well as expressing his concerns for our soldiers and the community in which they live and work.  The relationship between General Wagner and the community is priceless, but the care and concern he expresses for his soldiers is even more evident.  I was pleasantly amazed by the spontaneously unsolicited comments by persons like the local base librarian, who takes pride in his facilities and the services that he is able to provide tosome 750 daily visitors. The same type of pride was exhibited by the director of the commissary, who manages a clean, well stocked facility and therefore plays a critical role in the morale and welfare of those who defend us.  A long time concern of mine has been the high operational tempo, or more simply put, the rate at which our service members are deployed away from their home base, whether for training, or deployed in reaction to a crisis.  In Vicenza, Italy, I met an impressive young man--a Californian--1SG Noel Fernando. First Sergeant Fernando, a native of Salinas, California, talked to me about his highly trained Airborne unit's operational tempo.  Sergeant Fernando, a hard worker who achieved his very high enlisted rank at an early age, assured me that more organized planning and early notification to family members regarding deployment schedules has reduced the trauma experienced by younger soldiers and their loved ones. They are now better able to anticipate deployments and plan accordingly.  Another distinguished member of our military forces is Gen. Joe Ralston. General Ralston is the Commander in Chief, U.S. European Command and the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe.  As Commander in Chief of U.S. European Command, he is the senior U.S. military officer and commander of a unified combatant command with an area of responsibility that includes 89 nations in Europe, Africa and the Middle East. General Ralston will be retiring soon, and just like many service members before, he and his family have sacrificed much of their lives for our freedom.  I was pleased to have been escorted by General Ralston to the sites of several upcoming military construction projects in the Mons, Belgium area.  The first is a barracks complex that will accommodate soldiers at the ``one-plus-one'' housing standard. Another project will add a classroom to the SHAPE, Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, elementary school.  While there, I had an opportunity to visit this site and visit with the students and teachers. I am pleased to report that the administrators of this and other military schools in Europe have been able to reduce the student to teacher ratio significantly, thus offering a quality education for our military dependents.  In summary, I would like to emphasize the important role that our officers, enlisted members, and their families play in creating good will around the world for the people of America.  As I have mentioned previously, all of these people dedicate their lives, and to a certain degree their personal freedom, to ensure our nation's remains free. These military service members and their families deserve quality facilities wherever they might be stationed.  This is why, I feel honored to sit as chair of the Appropriations Military Construction Subcommittee, because it allows me to make a difference in the living and working conditions for our troops who are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice on our nation's behalf. I am dedicated to providing first class facilities for them both at home and abroad.  Lastly, it is with great pride that I commend those service members like General Ralston, General Meigs, General Wagner and First Sergeant Fernando, who have for decades sought to ensure a better quality of life for our fighting force.                          ____________________
