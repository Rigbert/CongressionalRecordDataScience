 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:45 a.m tomorrow, June 27. I further ask that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved, and the Senate proceed to a period of morning business until 11 a.m., with the first 15 minutes under the control of the majority leader or his designee, the next 15 minutes under the control of the Democratic leader or his designee, and the remaining time until 11 a.m. be equally divided; further, that the Senate then resume consideration of S.J. Res. 12, the flag antidesecration resolution. I further ask that the Senate stand in recess from 12:30 until 2:15 to accommodate the weekly policy luncheons.
