 President, today I rise to honor Miss Sophia Brown of Louisville, KY. Miss Brown was recently selected by the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States to receive the National Voice of Democracy scholarship. This scholarship competition gives high school students from across the Nation the opportunity to write and then record a broadcast based on a selected theme.  I am particularly proud since Miss Brown is a sophomore at my alma mater, duPont Manual High School. She was awarded the scholarship based on her broadcast pertaining to American heroes. I wish to congratulate Miss Brown on her hard work, perseverance and dedication.                          ____________________
