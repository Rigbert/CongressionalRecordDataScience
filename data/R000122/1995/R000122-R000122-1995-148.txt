Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to rise today on behalf of an outstanding Rhode Islander, Chief Madison A. Bailey, Jr., on the occasion of his retirement from the Portsmouth Rhode Island Police Department.  The people of Rhode Island have been well-served by his professionalism and devotion to duty. A native Rhode Islander, Chief Bailey graduated from Rogers High School in Newport and enlisted in the Naval Reserve. Appointed in 1967 to the Portsmouth Police Department, he is a graduate of the Pawtucket Police Academy and the Rhode Island Municipal Police Academy. After receiving his bachelor's degree from Salve Regina College in 1973, he continued his police education by graduating from the FBI National Academy in 1974, and was promoted to deputy police chief. In 1981, he was appointed police chief of the Portsmouth Police Department.  Chief Bailey served as president of the New England Police Chiefs Association during 1991-92 and was president of the Rhode Island Police Chiefs Association the following year. While serving on the Portsmouth Police Department, he was awarded the American Legion Medal of Heroism for saving a child's life.  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of my home State of Rhode Island, I respectfully ask that my fellow colleagues join me in saluting Chief Madison A. Bailey, Jr. on his many contributions to society and applauding his outstanding citizenship.                          ____________________
