Chairman, I am pleased the gentleman did not reference the Redskins' performance this year, but we are coming back.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania providing this legislation not apply to regulations protecting U.S. waters and pollutants of toxic waste.  Day after day after day, like ground-hog day in that movie, we are having the Chesapeake Bay polluted, one of the greatest estuaries of this world. We need to stop it. The Federal Government has taken substantial steps toward that end.  I think it is appropriate to say in this instance, because of the critical nature of the problem that we confront with respect to the pollution of the Chesapeake Bay and other waterways of this Nation, that this is not the type of unfunded mandate, that, in fact, yes, it is costly to clean up our waste, but it is not so costly that the cost downstream and in the long run is not far greater.                              {time}  1850  Mr. Chairman, I think that is what the gentleman's amendment speaks to, and I rise in its support.  Mr. Chairman, do we need to curb the ease by which we pass unfunded mandates on to State and local governments? Yes we do.  However, it is important to recognize that there are many present mandates which the Federal Government imposes and which my constituents would not want abolished.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania providing that this legislation not apply to regulations protecting U.S. waters from pollutants and toxic waste.  The transformation of the Chesapeake Bay from its dismal state a decade ago into the more healthy estuary in the world is a perfect example of what the shortsighted impact of this legislation could be. We cannot move backward on the Chesapeake Bay.  We must guarantee that individual localities not be able to dump waste into waters and destroy the very environment that is enjoyed by people across the entire mid-Atlantic region and whose health our coastal economics depend upon.  It is imperative that the future impact of H.R. 5 not jeopardize the successes of several environmental, safety, and health standards that the American people depend upon and support.  Unfunded mandate legislation cannot and should not result in unintended consequences.  Mr. Chairman, we have a Contract With America. It is the contract that we have made together to provide protections and safeguards for our environment, our workers, and our health.  I agree with my colleagues who support this measure that we must more carefully judge the requirements we impose. However, in the rush to legislate we must ensure that we are not rushing to abdicate important protections that the American people want and expect.
