I will advise our Members not to have Friday night planes scheduled, and to have maybe a little later Saturday scheduled, maybe well into the morning.  November is when we will next reconvene, it is my understanding. You previously indicated that after we have our last votes, the House will not be in session again until Monday, November 13. Is that still your intention?  I yield to my friend.
