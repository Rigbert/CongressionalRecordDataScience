Justice Brennan wrote, ``We can imagine no more appropriate response to burning a flag than waving one's own.'' That is exactly how the American people respond.  Immediately following September 11, Americans all around the country began to fly flags outside their homes and businesses, to wear flag pins on their lapels, and to place flag stickers on their automobiles. This surge in patriotism over the past 9 months has made American flags such a hot commodity that several major flag manufacturers cannot keep flags stocked on store shelves. Within one week of the attacks, demand for American flags was 20 times higher than is typical for that time of year, according to the National Flag Foundation in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. During that same week, Wal-Mart sold 450,000 flags. Within days of the bombing, K-mart sold 200,000 flags.  This expression of national pride was spontaneous, and consisted of individual Americans taking conscious acts of patriotism. No one in the government decreed that Americans must purchase and fly flags. There was no official direction stating that Americans should wear clothing and accessories with flag designs, but these have been wildly popular as well.  Supporters of S.J. Res. 7, a constitutional amendment to prohibit flag desecration, believe that Americans need a lesson in how to respect the flag. I disagree, and I believe that the American people have proven these Senators wrong.  At the height of World War II, in the case of West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, Justice Jackson wrote, ``To believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies arevoluntary and spontaneous instead of a compulsory routine is to make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds.'' Patriotism is flourishing in ways that no one could have predicted. Americans are rallying around the flag in a voluntary show of strength that demonstrates America's commitment to freedom and liberty.  Respect cannot be coerced or compelled. It can only be given voluntarily. Some may find it more comfortable to silence dissenting voices, but coerced silence can only create resentment, disrespect, and disunity. You don't stamp out a bad idea by repressing it; you stamp it out with a better idea.  My better idea is to fly the flag, not because the law tells me to; not because there is something that says this is what I have to do to show respect; I do it because, as an American, I want to. That is why the American flag has always flown at the Leahy home. The extraordinary display of patriotism we have witnessed over the past 9 months is evidence that the American public agrees.                          ____________________
