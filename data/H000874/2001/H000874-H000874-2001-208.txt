Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, obviously I rise in strong support of this resolution. I was delighted to introduce this legislation just over 3 weeks ago in conjunction with the chairman of our committee, the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney), who has been an example I think for all the Congress as to how to work in a bipartisan, productive, positive fashion; and I thank the gentleman for that. I see some of the majority staff on the floor as well. I want to thank them as well for the very cooperative way in which they are working with our minority staff to make sure that we do our business in a very productive, positive way. I very much appreciate it.  Mr. Speaker, this resolution authorizes the printing, as the chairman has said, of a revised edition of the House document last printed in the 101st Congress, 11 years ago, entitled ``Black Americans in Congress, 1870-1989.'' I thank my distinguished colleague from Ohio for facilitating and cosponsoring this resolution. His support has been critical in bringing this resolution to the floor so quickly.  I also thank my 43 other distinguished cosponsors, including the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), the Chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, who hopefully will be here in just a few minutes; the entire caucus membership; and the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Watts), chairman of the House Republican Conference himself, and a distinguished African American, who have cosponsored this legislation.  The first edition of Black Americans in Congress, Mr. Speaker, was published in 1976 during our country's bicentennial. This was just over a century after the first African American to serve in Congress, Hiram Revels of Mississippi, was elected to the Senate. That election, of course, came after a great civil war was waged to ensure that African Americans not only were considered to be full persons, but also would be considered among those included in the ringing phrase in the Declaration of Independence that we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men, and we should have added, but had not at that time, and women, are created equal, and are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, and among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We fought a great civil war to address the grievance of non-inclusion of those of African descent. It was not until the last century, in the 1920s, that women were given the full franchise in America.  It is appropriate that we recognize inclusion. We are going to have today the passage of this resolution, to recognize those of African American descent who have served in this Congress and made an historical contribution to this country. Next week I expect us to bring forward out of our committee another resolution which will recognize all of the women who have served in Congress to the present date.  The second edition of this document, which was published in 1990, contains brief biographies, photographs, and other historical information about Senator Revels and the 65 other distinguished African Americans who had served as of January 23, 1990. The volume is a treasured resource in libraries across America.  It is through this document, Mr. Speaker, that not only can young African Americans, but young people of all races, colors and creeds can be inspired by the biographies it contains, so that irrespective of who they might be, they can aspire to be honored by their neighbors and constituents and serve in the Congress of the United States.  This book explores not only the lives and careers of Members, but also provides a window on the many obstacles that have confronted African Americans as they made their way to the halls of this Congress. For example, Mr. Speaker, the biography of Senator Revels reveals how, having been born to free parents in 1827, he pursued a career of religious work in several States, including my own State of Maryland.  Settling in Mississippi after the Civil War, Revels won election to the State senate. After his colleagues sent him to Washington to complete Jefferson Davis' term in the United States Senate, an irony that I am sure is not lost on any of the readers of this biography, some Senators bitterly opposed his seating, arguing, among other things, that he did not meet the 9-year citizenship requirement, having just secured full citizenship with the ratification of the 14th Amendment in 1868.  Think of that argument, Mr. Speaker. ``We have prohibited you from being a citizen. You are now free and a full citizen because we have adopted a constitutional amendment, but you do not qualify for membership in this body because, as a result of us not according you full citizenship, you have not met the 9-year requirement.''  Fortunately, however, the Senate rejected those arguments and seated Mr. Revels on February 25, 1870, by a vote of 48 to 8.  The first African American Member of this House, Representative Joseph Rainey of South Carolina, was born the son of slave parents who managed to buy their family's freedom. When the Civil War began, Rainey was drafted and compelled to serve on a Confederate blockade runner, but he escaped to Bermuda. Returning to South Carolina after the war, Rainey was elected to the State senate, and later to complete an unexpired term in this body, taking office in December of 1870. Rainey served five terms with distinction and became the first Member of African ancestry to preside over this House.  Since Senator Revels and Representative Rainey took their oaths as Members of the 41st Congress, 104 additional African Americans have trod the path they so courageously blazed. A total of 40 additional distinguished African Americans have served since publication of the 1990 edition, 32 of whom are serving today.  Mr. Speaker, one need only to look around the House to see a new generation of African American leaders serving the American people ably and proudly. It is important, Mr. Speaker, that we recognize their contribution and chronicle their service, not for them individually, not to aggrandize them or to expand their egos. It is to recognize the hallmark of America, diversity and inclusion. It is our strength, and it is our promise to all our people. Even more importantly, it is crucial that we continually seek to inspire young people, as I said earlier, all across America, that they can aspire to public service, whatever the color of their skin and however humble their circumstances might have been. Adopting this resolution is yet another way to do that.  Mr. Speaker, the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) has noted that the 1990 edition was dedicated to Representative Mickey Leland of Texas, a colleague with whom I had the honor of serving.                              {time}  1030  He perished in a plane crash in August 1989 while on a humanitarian mission in Africa.  The gentlewoman has suggested that this next edition be dedicated to our late colleague Julian Dixon who died just last December, shocking and saddening us all after 22 years of service in this House. It was my privilege to servewith him for almost two decades. He was a wonderful human being and a great Member of this body. I cannot think of a more appropriate thing to do.  Mr. Speaker, I know that the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Ney) joins me in that sentiment. Mr. Speaker, I urge the House to support the motion.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
