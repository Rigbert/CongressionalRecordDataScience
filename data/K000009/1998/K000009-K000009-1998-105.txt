Speaker, over Labor Day weekend, John Morrison died suddenly of an apparent heart attack at his home in Dubberly, Louisiana. Across the country, his family, friends, and colleagues were shocked by the news. His leadership and vision for all farmers will be greatly missed. For the past six years, John had been the Executive Director of the National Country Poultry Growers. He had founded the organization due to his own experiences as a contract grower facing the unfairness of his contract and the control exerted by the large poultry companies.  It was the commitment and leadership that John and other family farm organizations had that prompted me to sponsor H.R. 2738--The Family Farmer Cooperative Marketing Amendments Act. Other colleagues have joined me as co-sponsors. On one of the last days of the session nearly a year ago, I met with representatives of the NCPGA and national allies that are working together to increase support for this legislation in the countryside. That meeting was two days after the momentous defeat of fast-track legislation.  I remain committed to working for passage of this legislation in the next Congress. It is an important step towards restoring social and economic justice to an entire group of farm families; those who are growing and marketing their commodities; whether poultry, grain, hogs, or livestock under the excessive control of major corporations. This legislation will enable farmers in their cooperative associations to negotiate for a fair contract.                          ____________________
