President, I also wish to remember Army SPC Thomas R. Leemhuis who died along with four other servicemembers on June 21, 2007 of wounds sustained when their vehicle struck an improvised explosive device in Baghdad, Iraq.  Tom was born in Lawton, OK on August 2, 1983 and attended Binger-Oney High School in Caddo County, OK before moving to nearby Anadarko after he graduated in 2002.  In 2005 he was inspired to join the Army after the death of his uncle Melvin Jody Stevens, a Vietnam veteran. Upon completing basic training he was assigned to 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division, Schweinfurt, Germany.  About 500 friends, relatives and fellow soldiers attended a memorial service at Binger-Oney High School Auditorium with internment at Williams Family Cemetery in Binger. At the service, Tom was remembered as a fun-loving young man who enjoyed cracking jokes and playing video games. ``His No. 1 football team was the Nebraska Cornhuskers, and he loved to wear his Nebraska hat around the University of Oklahoma,'' said his mother. ``He loved to push it to the limit.''  Tom had first thought of becoming a teacher and basketball coach when he got out of the military, but then decided to become a police officer because he hated drugs. He had decided to return to Binger after he completed his commitment with the Army because he wanted to make a difference there. He was extremely proud of the military and being a Native American.  Tom is survived by his mother Patty Leemhuis; father Paul Whitehorn of Birmingham, AL; a brother Paul Whitehorn Jr. of Binger, OK; and three sisters, Stephanie Leemhuis of Dublin, CA; Renee Whitehorn of Anadarko, OK; and Dream Cox of Birmingham, AL.  Today we remember Army SPC Thomas R. Leemhuis, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                    Staff Sergeant William D. Scates
