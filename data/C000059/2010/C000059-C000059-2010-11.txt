Chairman.                                  ____           [From the Press-Enterprise PE.com, Mar. 18, 2010]                     Prevent a Double-dip Recession                            (By Ken Calvert)       A recent P-E article cited local economic forecasts that      suggested the Inland Empire will continue to lose jobs well      into 2010 (``Small businesses still pessimistic,'' March 12).      As residents know all too well, the drastic downturn in      residential construction and international trade has      significantly impacted our region's economy.       Businesses hire when they see an economic opportunity to      increase the sale of the goods or services, not when the      government provides a one-time tax credit to hire. When      businesses are ready to grow, they often need financing in      order to make big purchases. However, small businesses around      the country are struggling to get the credit necessary to      grow as banks tighten lending standards in the aftermath of      the financial crisis on Wall Street.       Businesses may find it even harder to obtain credit as they      begin confronting liquidity challenges in the commercial real      estate market. Recent analysis conducted by Deutsche Bank      analysts indicates that of the almost $1.4 trillion in      commercial real estate mortgages due by 2013, as many as 65      percent may struggle with refinancing, even if they are      performing loans that are completely current.       If the conditions in the commercial real estate market      deteriorate further, the negative effects will be significant      and widespread. If community banks are forced to close or      further tighten lending standards, small businesses will find      it even harder to obtain financing sources and our economy      will lose its tenuous grasp on a recovery and dip back      further into recession.       Due to this growing economic threat, I spearheaded a      bipartisan effort to raise these concerns to Treasury      Secretary Timothy Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben      Bernanke. In a letter to the regulators, 78 of my colleagues      and I proposed that a clear method for measuring the      effectiveness of recently announced commercial real estate      loan modification guidance should be established. Also, the      letter called on the officials to institute metrics that will      allow banks to more clearly differentiate performing versus      nonperforming loans in order to treat them appropriately.       The regulators also should give banks the flexibility to      account for performing loans as an asset, not a liability,      something that could be achieved with a simple change in      accounting practices. This would actually increase      transparency as well as free up capital that could be loaned      out into the market. Most important, the fix would not cost a      dime to American taxpayers or require any form of a bailout.       Our current economic situation could aptly be called the      speculators' recession and, if the administration does not      take action, this second dip would be known as the      regulators' recession.       No legislation is needed for the fix. The administration      can address the liquidity issues facing small businesses and      the commercial real estate market by providing correct      guidance to the bank regulators. A proactive and engaged      response can prevent a doubledip recession and ensure small      businesses can grow and start hiring again.                          ____________________
