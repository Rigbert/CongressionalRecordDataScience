Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise certainly in support of H.R. 518.  Regulations are based on the state of technology at the time that they are developed and may have the unintended consequences of hindering new advances in products. Such has been the case with the Department of Energy's efficiency standards for external power suppliers, EPS. As the regs on the books now stand, it is not legally possible to make certain types of light -emitting diode--LED--devices, as well as some kinds of ceiling fans.  So this bill, H.R. 518, the EPS Improvement Act, provides a carefully tailored solution to the problem. And I want to thank two Members, Republican and Democrat, Mr. Guthrie and Ms. DeGette, for their good work on behalf of both the manufacturers, as well as the users, of these products.  The bill carves out an exception for these devices while giving DOE the option of setting separate efficiency standards that are more suited to them.  This bill has been thoroughly vetted--yes, it has. It was included in last year's energy package. And although that bill didn't make it to the finish line for unrelated reasons, language virtually identical to that in H.R. 518 enjoyed very strong bipartisan and certain bicameral support.                              {time}  1600  In addition, the bill passed the House on suspension last year as well, but failed to make it on the Senate calendar.  For the sake of the manufacturing jobs that are associated with these products as well as the consumers and small businesses that rely on them, I would urge all of my colleagues to support and vote for H.R. 518.  I reserve the balance of my time.  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I rise today to urge the passage of H.R. 518, the EPS Improvement Act.  Last session of Congress, I cosponsored this bill with our former colleague Congresswoman Ellmers, and this year, Representatives Guthrie, Matsui, and Dent are joining me in this effort to strengthen the standards used to keep LED lighting safe and efficient.  By ensuring that our country's energy conservation standards are up to date with the latest developments in high-tech lighting, we can remove obstacles to innovation without sacrificing safety. And as we heard from the chairman, if there has ever been a bill in Congress that was vetted, it was this one.  We have been working on this bill for some years now, and, frankly, what it is doing is it is truly addressing unintended consequences that happened due to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. That act defined external power supplies in a way that just simply did not anticipate the rapid growth and use of LED and OLED light sources during the decade that followed.  Now, these lights are really energy efficient. They are up to 80 percent more efficient than traditional lights like fluorescent and incandescent lights, and 90 percent of the energy in LEDs is committed to illumination, while only 5 percent is heat; so it is no wonder they have become so popular in the last 10 years. Unfortunately, in the 2005 act, the standards did not allow for these types of lighting as their use continues to constitute an ever-growing share of our energy consumption.  What this bill does is it clarifies the definition of ``external power supplies'' and it amends the conditions under which the Energy Department can undertake a rulemaking process in the future. The bill will facilitate the continued growth of LED lighting, and it will help lower energy prices for businesses and households both in my home State of Colorado and across America.  Clean energy truly is the future. It can be safe, efficient, and affordable for all when it is properly regulated, and that is exactly what this legislation does.  I urge everybody to support this act, and I hope that the Senate will pass it this year. We are getting a good, early start.  Mr. Speaker, I have no one else to speak on this bill, so I yield back the balance of my time.
