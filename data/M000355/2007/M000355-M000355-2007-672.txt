  I repeat, there is no good reason why we couldn't finish this bill tomorrow night. We are in the process now of surveying the number of amendments over here that need to be offered. Obviously,at the top of that list is the Gregg amendment. I would hope we could continue our discussion about how we might wrap this bill up.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The majority leader.
