President, I sat here, discussing with the distinguished ranking member, Senator Specter, health matters. Senator Specter is a longtime friend. He has gone through some terrible health issues. We were discussing that. I will not go further into that because it was a private conversation, except that he knows how much I pray for his well-being and his continued health.  I would also say I thank Senator Warner and Senator Durbin and Senator Specter and others for what they said about Senator Kennedy.  We in New England especially feel extraordinarily close to Senator Kennedy. I have known him for more than a third of a century. We have all heard bad news on the Senate floor. This is one of the most difficult things I have heard in my 34 years here. I said to the people in my office, this is one of the worst days I have spent in the Senate, to hear this news.  Marcella and I will keep not only Senator Kennedy but his wonderful family in our prayers and will continue to pray for a full recovery.
