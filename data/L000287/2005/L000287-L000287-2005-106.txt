Mr. Speaker, it is with great disappointment that I submitted a statement for the Record yesterday, instead of going to the floor, as originally scheduled, to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. The Republican Leadership has decided that the commemoration of the 40th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act is less important than leaving a day early for the Congressional August Recess.  I introduced House Concurrent Resolution 216 with my bipartisan colleagues from the Judiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers, Mr. Sensenbrenner, Mr. Chabot and Mr. Nadler. On Wednesday, I had planned to join my colleagues in debating the resolution on the floor, but at the last moment, the Republican Leadership decided to pull the solution from consideration in order to consider CAFTA. Thursday morning, the resolution was listed for consideration, but by late morning, it was brought to my attention that the Republican Leadership had decided to reduce debate on this resolution to a mere 5 minutes, down from the customary 40 minutes allotted to consideration of resolutions under suspension of the rules. Furthermore, they planned to package the suspensions together under condensed time and they were also adding to that package an additional controversial suspension bill without allowing any debate. This important resolution was being treated as insignificant. The Minority Leader opposed giving this important resolution such short shrift, and in response, the Republican leadership pulled the legislation from consideration all together.  Today was the last opportunity for us to celebrate this important Act before the anniversary on August 6. This has become an unacceptable pattern for the Republican Leadership. The Republican majority promised after the 1994 elections to manage the House in a way that fostered ``deliberative democracy,'' which they defined as the ``full and free airing of conflicting opinions through hearings, debates, and amendments.'' They also pledged in their Contract with America to ``restore accountability to Congress.'' Instead of sticking to their word, they have broken their promises, and flaunted and abused their power. They have abandoned the principle of procedural fairness or democratic accountability.  There is no reason that we could not debate this resolution this week, particularly when the Republicans will conclude business early in the day today. I am disappointed in my Republican colleagues for again derailing debate, particularly when it comes to issues related to voting and the Voting Rights Act.                          ____________________
