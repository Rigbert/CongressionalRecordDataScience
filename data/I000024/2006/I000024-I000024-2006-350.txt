President, again, it is a beautiful statement in opposition to an amendment that doesn't exist. When the Senator from California talks about emergencies and an emergency evacuation, I previously used the example of California because I suspected she might be coming down. That is, if there is an evacuation or some emergency, it can be done in Chinese so Chinatown can all evacuate. That is not a problem.  Yet when I spoke on the floor in Spanish, the only reason I had to translate it is because that is one of the rules of the Senate. It has nothing to do with this bill. That would not be affected in any way.  I yield to the Senator from South Carolina 8 minutes.
