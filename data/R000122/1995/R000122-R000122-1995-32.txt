Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. Lowey].  Mr. Chairman, the legislation before us will impose severe cuts on educational assistance, and it will deny millions of Americans the chance to go to college, and this is an opportunity that is increasingly elusive for middle-income Americans, and I would like to illustrate the effect of these cuts by introducing my colleagues to a young lady. Her name is Jenifer. She is from Hockum, WA. She is one of eight children, the first in her family to go to college. Jenifer lives on her own. She supports herself, and indeed she helps her family with their expenses. Her father is a logger, and he makes about $28,000 a year. She has to pay a tuition of about $11,600 a year. She commutes 60 miles a day to school. She works 30 hours a week in her hometown, and she works an additional 15 to 20 hours at her college, and when she graduates she wants to become a teacher. Jenifer currently receives Federal financial assistance in the form of Pell grants, Perkins loans, State student senate grants, all of which are reduced or eliminated under this legislation. Under this bill she would most likely loose her SSIG grant and her Pell grant, and the amount of her Perkins loan would either be reduced, at best, or eliminated. This adds up for her education to an additional $2,000 to $3,000 in added costs, and I ask my Republican colleagues where is she going to get this money? She cannot possibly work any longer. She already commutes 60 miles a day to school, but I tell my colleagues what I think is likely to happen.                              {time}  1530  She very well might be forced to drop out and to compromise her chance for a college education. She represents exactly the type of young person we should support, but instead this legislation is taking away that support.  We must continue to support higher education through these programs. We must continue to provide people a chance to achieve the American dream. Let us not take that dream away by passing this legislation. Let us reinforce and reinvent the future of this country.
