President, today I am introducing the bipartisan LIHEAP Protection Act, along with my colleagues Senator Snowe from Maine and Senator Sanders from Vermont, and many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I am pleased to see such broad support for funding for this critical program even in the midst of our budget challenges.  Indeed, LIHEAP is a lifeline, providing vulnerable families with vital assistance when they need it most by helping low-income families and seniors on fixed-incomes with their energy bills.  Last year, Congress provided $4.7 billion for LIHEAP. In an effort to control Federal spending, the Administration proposed an approximately 45 percent cut in LIHEAP funds from last year's level, down to about $2.57 billion in 2012. The Senate and House Appropriations bills only partially restored this drastic cut, to roughly $3.6 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively.  These cutbacks could put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, especially as the number of households eligible for the program already exceeds those receiving assistance. Given the difficult economy and the projected rise in household energy expenditures, as much as 8 percent more than last year for those who heat their homes with heating oil according to the Energy Information Administration, it does not make sense to cut vital LIHEAP funding.  We also need to act quickly. If funding is not finalized before winter, millions of low-income households run the risk of not receiving assistance during the coldest months when they need it most. Given the uncertainty in the full year appropriations for LIHEAP, which resulted in the release of only $1.7 billion in LIHEAP funding to States in October, some States have already begun lowering LIHEAP grant amounts.  LIHEAP is a smart investment. For every dollar in benefits paid, $1.13 is generated in economic activity, according to economists Mark Zandi and Alan S. Blinder.  I know we face a lot of difficult budget decisions around here, but I, along with so many of my colleagues, believe that LIHEAP should not be the place where we seek savings.  I look forward to working to provide level funding for LIHEAP for fiscal year 2012.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1961       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``LIHEAP Protection Act''.     SEC. 2. LOW-INCOME HOME ENERGY ASSISTANCE APPROPRIATIONS.       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section--       (1) is to ensure the appropriation for fiscal year 2012 of      the total amounts described in subsection (b), for payments      described in that subsection, under this Act or prior      appropriations Acts; and       (2) is not to require the appropriation of additional      amounts for those payments, under appropriations Acts enacted      after this Act.       (b) Appropriation.--In addition to any amounts appropriated      under any provision of Federal law, as of the date of      enactment of this Act, there is appropriated, out of any      money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, for fiscal      year 2012--       (1) an amount sufficient to yield a total amount of      $4,501,000,000, for making payments under subsections (b) and      (d) of section 2602 of the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance      Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C. 8621), and all of such total amount      shall be used under the authority and conditions applicable      to such payments under the Full-Year Continuing      Appropriations Act, 2011; and       (2) an amount sufficient to yield a total amount of      $200,000,000, for making payments under section 2602(e) of      the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act of 1981 (42 U.S.C.      8621(e)), notwithstanding the designation requirement of such      section 2602(e), and all of such total amount shall be used      under the authority and conditions applicable to such      payments under the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act,      2011.     SEC. 3. SENSE OF THE SENATE.       It is the sense of the Senate that--       (1) this Act should be carried out in a manner consistent      with the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Public Law 112-25; 125      Stat. 240);       (2) the Secretary of Health and Human Services should      continue and expedite program integrity efforts to identify      best practices used by grant recipients under the Low-Income      Home Energy Assistance Program, provide training and      technical assistance to such grant recipients, recommend      policy changes, and assess and mitigate risk at the Federal,      State and local levels, in order to eliminate any waste,      fraud, and abuse in the Program and strengthen the Program so      all Program funds reach the households who need them most;      and       (3) every Program dollar going to waste, fraud, and abuse      is a dollar not being spent as the dollar is needed or      intended.
