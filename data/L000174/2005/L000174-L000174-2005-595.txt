 Mr. President, I would simply reiterate what I said before. If the vote on the nuclear option was cast in secret, from everything I have been told by my fellow Senators, it would go down to crashing defeat. As Senators know, we have to break the rules to change the rules.  Again, I would just urge that both leaders, both the Republican and Democratic leaders, make it clear to their Members that nobody is going to be punished for a vote on conscience. I hope Senators will stand up and be a profile in courage, vote their conscience, and vote the right way.  Mr. President, the hour of 5:30 has arrived, so I yield the floor.                              Quorum Call  Mr. President, I see the Republican leader is not on the floor yet, so I will suggest the absence of a quorum to accommodate him. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
