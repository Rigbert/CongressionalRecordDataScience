 President, I am aware of House action on this matter as well as the Senators' role in bringing about that action and of their steadfast commitment to improving boating safety. I can assure the Senators from Michigan that I will support directing the Coast Guard in the final Transportation Appropriations Act for FY 2000 to keep the Muskegon seasonal Air Facility open.
