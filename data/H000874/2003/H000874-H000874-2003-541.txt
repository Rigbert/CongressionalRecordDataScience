 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Maryland yielding to me.  Mr. Speaker, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules at that time. There will be no votes in the House before 6:30 p.m. next Tuesday.  On Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m.; and we expect to consider H.R. 395, the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act, to restrain rampant telemarketers. Additionally, we hope to consider the conference report on House Joint Resolution 2, which will finish up the 2003 appropriations process. However, if the conference report is not ready for floor consideration, the House will need to consider another continuing resolution.  On Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. We expect to consider the Welfare Reform Reauthorization Act.  I am happy to answer any questions the gentleman may have.
