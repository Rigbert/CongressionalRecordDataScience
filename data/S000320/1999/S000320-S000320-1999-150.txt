 President, I am offering this amendment on behalf of Senator Daschle. It deals with airport eligibility. It has been cleared by both sides of the aisle. I see no opposition to it.  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.  The amendment (No. 1661) was agreed to.                    Amendment No. 1663, As Modified (Purpose: To express the sense of the Congress that the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration should develop a national policy     and related procedures concerning the interface of the Terminal       Automated Radar Display and Information System and en route  surveillance systems for Visual Flight Rule (VFR) air traffic control                                 towers)
