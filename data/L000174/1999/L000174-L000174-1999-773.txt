President, last night, the Senate passed the Supplemental Appropriations bill, which, among other things, contains funding for hurricane relief for Central America. I am very pleased that the Supplemental also specifies that up to $2,000,000 should be made available for humanitarian demining activities in Nicaragua and Honduras. Hurricane Mitch has greatly exacerbated the problem of anti-personnel landmines in both countries. An estimated 100,000 mines were placed in the Nicaraguan-Honduran border area in the 1980's by Sandanista and Contra soldiers. Demining activities to date have been diligent, but painstakingly slow, as over 70,000 mines continue to threaten the population.  While the problem has certainly been very serious, at least the areas which contained these mines in both countries were reasonably well known. Until Hurricane Mitch, that is. Mudslides and the tremendous volume of water that accompanied the hurricane have carried mines into areas not previously contaminated. Two Nicaraguan civilians were killed last fall by a mine in an area never thought to hold them previously. A U.S. Army study confirmed the new threat in many areas of Nicaragua.  Imagine, Mr. President, the impact on reconstruction efforts in these devastated countries if an American or other foreign national working to rebuild the infrastructure should be injured or killed by a mine.  Other Senators may be surprised to hear that one of the most effective ways to demine these areas is the use of man-dog teams. The explosive material in mines emit a gas, which dogs can be trained to detect. Once a mine is detected, the dog is trained to immediately stop and sit, and conventionaldemining can begin. Conventional demining amounts to metal detection, a painstakingly slow process which may detect thousands of discarded metal items for every mine found. Most surface area scanned for mines never had any to begin with. But the fear of mines keeps native populations from utilizing the land. Dogs can radically speed the process, and focus the efforts of human deminers into areas which actually contain mines.  The Marshall Legacy Institute, responding to a request from the InterAmerican Defense Board, has proposed putting additional man-dog teams into Central America to speed the reconstruction process. The proposal has the support of the Humane Society, and I hope the Administration will give serious consideration to supporting this proposal with these supplemental funds.                          ____________________
