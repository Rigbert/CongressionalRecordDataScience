  As we wind down debate on this bill, it is very important that I give appropriate thank-yous to people who have worked so hard on putting this bill together. I am talking about the staff of the Finance Committee and the Joint staff, both Republican and Democrat: Chief tax counsel, Mark Prater; chief of staff, Kolan Davis; Ed McClellan, Dean Zerbe, Christy Mistr, Diann Howland, Elizabeth Paris, and Brad Cannon; members of the health staff of the Finance Committee: Colin Rosky, Jennifer Bell; members from the Budget Committee staff: Chief of staff, Hazen Marshall; Cheri Reidy, Beth Felder, and Rachel Jones; Staff of Majority Leader Frist and Assistant Majority Leader McConnell, including Lee Rawls, Eric Ueland, Rohit Kumar, Bill Hoagland, and Mike Solon.  All of the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation worked through the night on many occasions. As one who was caught in the crossfire on this bill, I can appreciate when they take the heat from both sides on revenue estimates.  I would especially like to thank George Yin, Mary Schmitt, and Bernie Schmitt of the Joint Tax Committee. I wish more of the participants in the tax legislative process realized how tough the Joint Tax's job is; conferee staff, including Evan Liddiard and Garett Jones with Senator Hatch's office; Laura O'Neill with Senator Lott's office; Lisa Wolski and Lawrence Willcox of Senator Kyl's staff.  Senate legislative counsel, these folks, of course, are true legal wizards who do excellent work under amazing pressure. This group includes Jim Fransen, Mark Mathiesen, and Ruth Ernst.
