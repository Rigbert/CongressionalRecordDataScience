 President, the Senate is about to engage in a cloture vote on the Senate Democratic leadership's third stimulus bill. What I find surprising is that what we are about to vote on indisputably and absolutely belongs to the majority leader. That is to say we are not going to vote on a bipartisan package that I put together with Finance Committee Chairman Baucus. I was under the impression that the Senate Democratic leadership was genuine in its desire to work on a bipartisan basis, but clearly I was mistaken. Although the Senate Democratic leader was highly involved in the development of a bipartisan bill, he arbitrarily decided to replace it with a bill he hopes to jam through the Senate.  As much as I was surprised by the Senate Democratic leader's disregard for bipartisanship, I am even more surprised by the explanations given by him and his cohorts.  Perhaps the most significant change between the bipartisan package Chairman Baucus and I helped put together and the package we will be voting to move to is that a package of expired tax provisions has been removed. Normally referred to as extenders, these generally very popular and certainly bipartisan provisions have been extended several times over the past few years.  What is surprising is that hyperpartisan members of the majority have suddenly decided that the tax extenders are partisan pork for Republicans. A representative sample comes from one report, which describes the bipartisan bill as ``an extension of soon-to-expire tax breaks that are highly beneficial to major corporations, known as tax extenders, as well as other corporate giveaways that had been designed to win GOP support.'' Just today the Washington Post includes this attribution to the Senate Democratic Leadership. From the Post:       ``We're pretty close,'' {the majority leader} said Friday      during a television appearance in Nevada, adding that he      thought ``fat cats'' would have benefitted too much from the      larger Baucus-Grassley bill.  The portrait being painted by certain members of the majority, echoed without critical examination in some press reports, is wildly inaccurate. For one thing, the tax extenders include provisions such as the deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses and also the deduction for certain expenses of elementary and secondary school teachers. If you are going to school or if you are a grade school teacher, the Senate Democratic leadership thinks you are a fat cat so you are on your own. If your house was destroyed in a recent natural disaster and you still need any of the temporary disaster relief provisions contained in the extenders package, too bad, because helping you would amount to a corporate giveaway in the eyes of some.  The tax extenders have been routinely passed repeatedly because they are bipartisan and very popular. Democrats have consistently voted in favor of extending these tax provisions.  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a very strong statement upon House passage of tax extenders in December of 2009, saying this was, ``goodfor businesses, good for homeowners, and good for our communities.'' December of 2009 was not very long ago. In 2006, the then-Democratic leader released a blistering statement: ``After Bush Republicans in the Senate blocked passage of critical tax extenders, . . . American families and businesses are paying the price because this Do Nothing Republican Congress refuses to extend important tax breaks.'' I ask unanimous consent that both of these statements be printed in the Record in their entirety.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Pelosi: Tax Extenders Act Creates New Jobs, Growth, Innovation, and                      Opportunity for Every American       Washington, DC--Speaker Nancy Pelosi released the following      statement today after the House passed the Tax Extenders Act      of 2009, which will help to create jobs and cut taxes for      American middle-class families. The House passed the bill by      a vote of 241 to 181.       ``Today, Congress took another positive step forward in our      drive to create more jobs, strengthen our economy, and lay      the foundation for long-term prosperity. By passing the Tax      Extenders Act, we are placing our working families at the      center of our economic recovery.       ``This legislation is good for businesses, good for      homeowners, and good for our communities. The bill extends      research and development tax credits for American companies,      encouraging them to invest in innovation and clean energy,      and create the high-tech jobs of the 21st century. It      provides property tax relief to 30 million families, ensures      our men and women called to serve overseas do not face a pay      cut here at home, and offers some security for millions of      parents, teachers, and consumers by extending deductions for      college tuition, classroom expenses, and state and local      sales taxes.       ``Maintaining our commitment to fiscal discipline, this      legislation will not add to the deficit. The costs of this      proposal are fully paid for because we put an end to the      preferential tax treatment for hedge fund managers and      investment bankers and crack down on offshore tax havens.       ``This bill is a down payment on new jobs, growth,      innovation, and opportunity for every American.''                                  ____          Reid: Republicans Should Stop Blocking Tax Extenders       Washington, DC--Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today      issued the following statement after Bush Republicans in the      Senate blocked passage of critical tax extenders.       ``American families and businesses are paying the price      because this Do Nothing Republican Congress refuses to extend      important tax breaks. Families who just recently took their      sons and daughters to college now wonder whether the tuition      deduction that Republicans allowed to expire last year will      get reinstated. Teachers, forced to reach into their own      pockets to provide supplies for their students, now wonder      why Republicans refuse to extend the modest tax break they      get for doing so. Instead of holding such important tax      provisions hostage to ill-fated estate tax giveaways to      multi-millionaires, Republicans should join Democrats to pass      these measures today. Middle-class Americans deserve a new      direction, where they will not be forced to endure a tax      increase because of Republican inaction and obstruction.
