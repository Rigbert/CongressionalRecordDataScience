 President, I wish to thank the Senator from Ohio for sharing those stories. It tells the compelling reasons why tomorrow night's vote to move to this bill is so important, and we are all honored to be a part of that.  After a lot of hard work, it is amazing that our country really is now closer than we have been in decades to passing a real health insurance reform bill that will help provide our families and our businesses with affordable and stable health insurance coverage.
