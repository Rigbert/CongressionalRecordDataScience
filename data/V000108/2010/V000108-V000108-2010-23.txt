In true patriotic fashion, on the day of our great Nation's celebration of independence, a naturalization ceremony will take place, welcoming new citizens of the United States of America. This memorable occasion, coordinated by the Hammond Public Library and presided over by Magistrate Judge Andrew Rodovich, will be held at Harrison Park in Hammond, Indiana.  America is a country founded by immigrants. From its beginning, settlers have come from countries around the globe to the United States in search of better lives for their families. The upcoming oath ceremony will be a shining example of what is so great about the United States of America--that people from all over the world can come together and unite as members of a free, democratic nation. These individuals realize that nowhere else in the world offers a better opportunity for success than here in America.  On July 4, 2010, the following people, representing many nations throughout the world, will take their oath of citizenship in Hammond, Indiana: David Buabeng Agyen, Gordana Obradovic, Adesola Titilayo Ikene, Iryna Anatolitvna Hillegonds, Snezana Cude, Olufunmilayo Oluranti Adebayo, Kim Anh Tong, Kenneth Llanos Fabugais, Reshma Begum, Lubna Sairesh Hussain, Ummaima Sadaf Hussain, Hilda Marumbo Love, Gilberto Garcilazo Ambriz, Hossein Ali Safavi Naeini, Lorraine Emilia Von Tobel, Jose L. Guerrero, Ashok Sundaram, Lily Shajil, Amjad M.A. Ahmed, Delia Lord, Sonal Sanjay Shah, Alfredo Gerardo Discepolo, Corazon Samonte Jurado, Eric Udave Zaragoza, Dan Chen, Muriel Magalhaes Pessoa, Saber Zedan Khawaled, Justine Elizabeth Smith, Harvind Singh Azrot, Dragan Gjikoski, Gopikrishna Ratakonda, Surinder Singh, Manjeet Geeta, Maria Cristina Sangueza, Rey Ancajas Sararana, Maynard Villavecencio Utayde, Eunice Jocabed Bojorquez, Olubunmi Emmanuel Adebayo, Amjad M. Amer, Rogelio Jose Munoz, Isabel De La Rosa Rangel, Juventino Flores, Jose Gutierrez Olivares, Vinh Quang Le, Eleazar Talili Tan, Nikunj Natvarlal Patel, Joel Erie Lingua, Mohannad Khaleel Alkaki, Dhirenkumar Jaswantlal Shah, and Ambrosia Ewican McLaughlin.  Though each individual has sought to become a citizen of the United States for his or her own reasons, be it for education, occupation, or to offer their loved ones better lives, each is inspired by the fact that the United States of America is, as Abraham Lincoln described it, a country ``. . . of the people, by the people, and for the people.'' They realize that the United States is truly a free nation. By seeking American citizenship, they have made the decision that they want to live in a place where, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the Bill of Rights, they can practice religion as they choose, speak their minds without fear of punishment, and assemble in peaceful protest should they choose to do so.  Madam Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating these individuals, who will become citizens of the United States of America on July 4, 2010, the day of our Nation's independence. They, too, will be American citizens, and they, too, will be guaranteed the inalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We, as a free and democratic nation, congratulate them and welcome them.                          ____________________
