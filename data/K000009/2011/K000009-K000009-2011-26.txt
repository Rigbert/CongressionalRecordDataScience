 Isn't it an indictment on the legislative branch of this country at the national level that when people need unemployment benefits, we have to run out the clock right to the bitter end, right to the bitter end for benefits that have been earned--earned.  In church on Sunday, a couple came up to me and the husband asked: Congresswoman, if you know of any other jobs, please let me know. What's going to happen with unemployment benefits? This was a family that obviously needed help, a family that had spent their entire life, the man and wife, both working.                              {time}  1830  He didn't want to ask about the unemployment benefits; but he knew that for that family, maybe it was all that would be there in the near term.  I'll give you a couple of figures I would like to put on the record thisevening. One, I called the head of one of our major railroads the other day because I was trying to get the word out across my region--not everybody is plugged into the Internet--that there were 4,000 jobs that CSX was offering around the country. I wanted to make sure that people in our region knew that they were available. The chief executive officer of the company said, Well, you know, we've had 500,000 applications for 4,000 jobs.  The American people want to work. It is not that they do not want to work, as some of our friends on the other side infer. No, no. They're looking every day. They're just not finding the jobs that existed in past generations. And we know that those jobs have been displaced by imports from places like China. And company after company that used to be located in our neighborhoods aren't there anymore.  So it's harder to find jobs. We have to create new jobs. But the new ones aren't coming on stream fast enough. The level of desire to work in our country is so much higher. Millions more people want to work than there are jobs available right now. And so for many families, unemployment insurance is all that's left for them. Again, this Congress is just waiting to the bitter moment rather than acting responsibly to help families who have literally built this country and who have a very good work ethic and want to work.  So I want to thank the gentlelady from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for bringing this subject up and putting a human face on what this unemployment really looks like out in the country. If anyone has any doubt, come to Ohio. Come meet these families who want to work and are looking every day.  Of course, the way it works, you can't go into a company. They tell you, Well, we might have a hundred jobs but apply to us through the Internet. It's like you go into this faceless system where you can't really find a human being.  They're trying out there in the country. All the economic figures show us--and the last thing I will say here for this segment--Mark Zandi from Moody's has classified every single expenditure that one can make that gives the economy more than a dollar for every dollar expended. Would you believe that if one looks at things like unemployment insurance and payments to the unemployed, that produces the biggest bang to the economy? Well over $1.35 for every dollar invested as opposed to, let's say, tax credits or something like that, these arcane tax provisions, where less than 30 cents is actually reinvested in the economy.  So unemployment insurance extensions also make sense for economic growth at this very tender time because the people who receive those benefits spend them on essentials that drive the economy.  I yield to the gentlelady.
