 I want everybody to know that he is correct. He came to me to work in a bipartisan fashion. In fact, we have come to one another at various times to work in a bipartisan fashion. And I am pleased to work with the majority leader.  I think the majority leader--as I have said with him not present and I will say it here today--is someone with whom I can work, have worked, and expect to work. I think he is honest and straightforward when he makes his representations to me, Mr. Speaker, so I want to thank him for that.  But I want to reference all three of the issues that you just discussed. I am going to go in the opposite direction you went. The gentleman started out with the EPA. I am going to start out with the budget.  As the gentleman I am sure knows, there is a $1.5 trillion asterisk in this budget: savings to be determined at some time in the future. Hooray. What courage.                              {time}  1300  What I am saying about the budget is we had a deal. We agreed, in a bipartisan fashion, an agreement that you and I both voted for.  Mr. Speaker, we both voted for it. It wasn't what either of us probably wanted, Mr. Speaker, but it was an agreement. It was compromise. It was how this body should and does work.  And the problem is we have had such great difficulty saying we are going to implement that agreement, notwithstanding what Speaker Ryan said just a few months ago.  So from the budget standpoint, A, I don't share the gentleman's optimistic view, Mr. Speaker, that it is balanced. It is easy to put an asterisk in there and say we are going to get $1.5 trillion somewhere, somehow, from someplace. It is much more difficult to say where you are going to get it. And what the American people have seen is that asterisk is never realized.  So he and I disagree on the fact that, A, we haven't worked in a bipartisan fashion. We did. It was very tough. The Speaker, you, Mr. Scalise, Leader Pelosi, and I, all five of us voted for an agreement.  Very frankly, it is our perception, Mr. Speaker, that the Leader's side of the aisle has not been able to carry out their agreement because of internal divisions within your party. Frankly, that is reported on. It seems to be self-evident, and that is our view. Our view is we had a number agreed upon.  It is not about spending more money. It is what we agreed to spend, in a bipartisan fashion, that is not being adhered to.  Secondly, when the gentleman says there is money somewhere, of course there is money somewhere, but it is not a zero sum game. Somebody will bedisadvantaged and hurt and left behind if we take money from the program that this Congress appropriated to be spent on Ebola.  The gentleman came to me, we did have a bipartisan meeting, which I have referred to and the gentleman has referred to. Tony Fauci was there, Secretary Burwell was there, Dr. Frieden was there from the Centers for Disease Control.  All of them said that the suggestion that we take money from Ebola and put it towards Zika would harm the effort to ensure that Ebola does not come back to our shores and, in fact, is controlled overseas as well, because if it is overseas, it will ultimately come on shore here in America; so that they have asked for the resources to deal with Zika now. The longer we wait, the more difficult it will be.  I agree with the gentleman entirely, that we are finding out new things as each day goes by, as each week goes by. But the fact of the matter is we need to give them the assurance that they will have the resources to deploy the kind of effort that we need to make sure that Zika does not become an epidemic here in this country, in Puerto Rico, in the Virgin Islands, and in other places in the world.  Lastly, Mr. Speaker, it is, to me, very ironic. I have heard this year, in years past, EPA, get out of our lives. EPA, stay out of our communities. EPA, we don't need your advice and counsel.  Mr. Speaker, the Governor of Michigan, knowing full well that the water from the Flint River was not the kind of water that we ought to be feeding to our children and to our adults, and refusing to spend the money to treat the pipes so that they would have been lined and the lead from the pipes would not leach into the water and adversely affect the health of the children of Flint, nevertheless, went ahead.  In January of last year, the EPA advised the Governor of Michigan and the Department of Environmental Quality in Michigan, you are getting lead in your water. It is dangerous. January 15, 2015.  Notwithstanding that advice, the Receiver, appointed by the Governor of Flint--the mayor wasn't in charge, the city council wasn't in charge. The Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, appointed by a Republican Governor, kept feeding the water to the people of Flint. And we have now determined that EPA kept after them after January 15, and their advice was ignored and, in fact, said, look, we have got it. We can handle this. We have experts.  Frankly, a professor from Virginia Tech started testing the children and found that, tragically, the lead levels in the blood of the children of Flint were going up to dangerous and harmful levels.  So, Mr. Leader, very frankly, your party has made it very clear repeatedly on the bills that you have brought to the floor, you don't want EPA involved. I don't mean you personally. Let me make that clear, Mr. Speaker.  But the votes on this floor have been to reduce EPA's authority, to reduce their involvement, to reduce reliance on EPA's wisdom on behalf of the health and environment of our country.  So then on all three of those issues, Mr. Speaker, let me say something in conclusion.  I know it is Holy Week. And what Holy Week teaches us is that we need to care for one another; that we need to make sure, Mr. Speaker, when there are those in trouble and at risk, that we act. If that is not what Holy Week is about, I don't know what it is about.  We ought to be about the business of responding, Mr. Speaker, to these three crises. Now, we don't have to do it on a Saturday, and I agree with my friend, the majority leader.  We say that all the time, ``my friend,'' but Kevin McCarthy is my friend, Mr. Speaker. I have great respect for him. He is hardworking, he is honest, and he cares about our country. Let there be no mistake.  But what I am trying to do, Mr. Speaker, is simply to elevate a sense of urgency to respond to two emergencies that confront Americans; and that we, therefore, have a responsibility to act, act promptly, decisively, and effectively. I am urging that we do that, and I am urging that we not waste time in accomplishing that objective.  I am through, unless the majority leader would like to respond further. I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I just want to respond to a few points you made.  The money that we are talking about using for Zika, so nobody is delayed, is leftover money from the emergency supplemental voted in 2014. I know it is dealing with Ebola, but it is $3 billion sitting over there. They have some leftover money that they should make sure that they don't wait 1 day to start working.  Now, you talk of the budget. We just passed a budget out of the Budget Committee that had a discretionary number of $1.07 trillion. Nowhere does it show that that is not the agreement.  Now, you and I can debate a lot, but since Republicans took the majority, if you look at the numbers of--and I know in your last year in the majority, you didn't produce a budget. But we have saved America tremendous, more than $800 billion by taking the majority.  Now, you and I both know that the real challenge for America is the mandatory spending, and we have to get to that.  Now, when you talk about the EPA, the challenge that I find, and nobody should ever have water like Flint had. But I am very passionate about this issue. I am passionate that the children have drinking water. You know why? Because that same thing is happening in my State because of lack of water.  Every year we have been in the majority, we have passed a bill here dealing with California water, but it goes nowhere in the Senate.  I want the same for children across the country, because it is not just these two areas, there are lots of places we have to deal with this.  But if I remind the gentleman, I think it was just a month ago, bipartisan on this floor, the vote was 416-2, telling the EPA not to hold information because, when it came to Flint, they knew of it and they waited months before they brought that information forward.  So you and I work together, just as both sides of the aisle in here. They said the EPA needs to stop. If they have information on any community, don't hold that, release it. People need to be warned. People need to be advised.  I was proud of the fact that both sides joined together, and I look forward to our being able to work on the other issues.  Now, you and I may have a disagreement on the timing, because what I have found, these committees have been working. We want to get it right. And in no way, in no shape, have we not kept you, one, a part of it, or if we even have a meeting, advised of it.  Congressman Sensenbrenner walked from a meeting with the Speaker, the committee chairs, and me directly over to your Leader Pelosi, the same time that we have been dealing with this within the committee, showing all what is being worked on, and I hope we can keep that same working together as we solve the problem.  I wish the gentleman from Maryland good luck in his NCAA bracket. But as he knows, Cal State Bakersfield has never lost in the tournament. Now don't take it we have never been in it, but we have never lost yet.
