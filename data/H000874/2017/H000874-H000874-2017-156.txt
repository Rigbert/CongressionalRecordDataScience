Speaker, I want to join my friend who has been such a great leader in dealing with those who have associations with our country but are not States. I join with his remarks.  The Puerto Rican election that was held overwhelmingly voted for statehood as the option of governance they wanted to pursue. It is now, it seems to me, the responsibility of the United States Congress and the administration to recognize the overwhelming sentiment of the Puerto Rican people, expressed in a free and open election.                          ____________________
