President, I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate for a few minutes. I see Chairman McCain, and I wanted to engage him in a brief discussion on a matter involving the Death on the High Seas Act. I have offered several amendments with respect to this issue, but I don't intend to offer them this morning because this bill has several hundred amendments.
