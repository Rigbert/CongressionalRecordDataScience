President, I understand the senior Senator from New York has an amendment. While the senior Senator from Iowa is on the floor, I ask unanimous consent that it be in order for the Senator from New York to bring up his amendment--that the pending amendment be set aside for 5 minutes--speak on it, and if there are no objections to it, it then be accepted, and we go back to the Kyl amendment so as not to interfere with the unanimous consent agreement to have a vote on the Kyl amendment at 11:45 a.m. I make that request.
