President, I have spoken on this floor many times about the danger of antipersonnel landmines. In fact, I find that this is an issue on which I get thousands of letters and comments on my web page and over the Internet and telephone calls from all over the country and all over the world from people urging the ultimate banning of antipersonnel landmines and applauding steps that we took in this body to vote to ban them.  Mr. President, the NATO peacekeeping operation has been underway in Bosnia for less than 12 weeks. During that period, at lest 40 IFOR soldiers have been wounded or killed by landmines. The first American killed in Bosnia, Sgt. Donald A. Dugan, may have died from a landmine. He was apparently trying to disarm it, when it detonated in his hand.  Sargent Dugan was 38 years old. He died trying to help end the most brutal war in Europe in 50 years. He died so others, many of whom have lost parents, children, or brothers and sisters, could live.  The first American wounded in Bosnia was also the victim of a landmine. Another American lost part of his foot from a mine. Three British soldiers were among those killed by landmines.  In the 3 years that the United Nations force was there, 204 U.N. soldiers were injured by mines, and 25 died. As the snow melts and the ground thaws, there will be more landmine casualties.  Since 1990 when the war started, thousands of civilians have been injured and killed by landmines, and they will continue to suffer casualties long after the NATO troops leave. The Army's advice is ``if it's not paved, don't step on it.'' That's great. That means that 99 percent of the land in Bosnia is too dangerous to walk on. The landmines in Bosnia, like many other countries, will be cleared an arm and a leg and a life at a time for generations.  Mr. President, I have spoken often on this subject and I will continue to do so. Today I want to make just one point.  If there ever was an opportunity for American leadership to make the world a safer place, this is it. On February 12, President Clinton--and I applaud him for it--signed the foreign operations bill which contains my amendment to halt, for 1 year, U.S. use of antipersonnel landmines.  Some in the Pentagon have complained that since they use landmines responsibly they should not have to stop using them.  Mr. President, no one is more proud than I am of our Armed Forces. Our men and women in uniform, whether they are in Bosnia, Korea, or here in Washington, make every American proud for what they stand for, and their unmatched professionalism. I have voted for just about every defense appropriations bill since I came to the U.S. Senate.  If I thought for a minute that getting rid of antipersonnel landmines would put our troops or our national security in jeopardy, I would not be speaking here today. On the contrary, I believe we have far more to gain. Antipersonnel landmines cannot be justified on military grounds or on moral grounds.  I have received calls and letters from combat veterans from every part of this country who experienced the horrors of landmines, and who agree with me that they made their job more dangerous, not safer. Some were wounded by mines. Some saw troops under their command killed by mines, even by their own minefields when the battle changed direction.  I know landmines have some military use. But consider the cost. Over 24,000 Americans were injured or killed by mines in World War II. There were over 2,400 recorded landmine casualties in Korea, and over 7,400 in Vietnam. Twenty-one Americans died in the Persian Gulf from mines--20 percent of all our casualties there. Twenty-six percent of our casualties in Somalia were from mines.  No matter how or what type of landmines are used, they are indiscriminate. They are triggered by the victim, and usually it is a civilian. Our mines, and the mines of countless other nations, are killing and maiming hundreds of innocent people each week.  Mr. President, we have a tremendous opportunity. The law signed by the President will halt, in 3 years, our use of antipersonnel landmines except in very limited areas. We will not be alone. Canada and Belgium have unilaterally halted their production, use, and export of these weapons, and 20 other nations have declared support for an immediate, total ban.  During the next 3 years, we can lead other nations to join with us in repudiating this weapon. If the Congress, the President, the Vice President, the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the Secretary of State, our U.N. Ambassador, all our Ambassadors in posts around the world--if we all speak loudly and with one voice, the message will be heard.  Mr. President, a recent Washington Post article entitled ``A Global Bid To Ban Landmines,'' described how the Serbs used minefields in their campaign of ethnic cleansing, by forcing their Moslem captives to walk through minefields, triggering the mines.  That many sound appalling, and it is. But it is little different from what millions of people are forced to do each day, in countries where survival means tilling the land, and the land is a minefield.  So Mr. President, we remember Sgt. Donald Dugan for his sacrifice for peace in Bosnia. Let us also remember him by renouncing these cowardly weapons that have claimed the lives of so many innocent people.                          ____________________
