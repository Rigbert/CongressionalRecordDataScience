 President, on September 29, I was unable to voice my opposition to the amendment proposed by Senator Inouye that reduced funding for international broadcasting. There are many programs and institutions worthy of support, but I believe it was self-defeating to augment one at the expense of another, which is one of the most valuable instruments of American foreign policy--Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.  I come to this issue with a good deal of experience as to the importance of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The Radios, as they are commonly called, have set standards for objective journalism and analysis that are emulated and respected by news organizations and media across central Europe and the former Soviet Union.  Many of the millions worldwide that listen to our U.S.-supported broadcasters live in countries where information and news continue to be controlled by the government. In these parts of the world, government information bureaus, government wire agencies, government radios and television channels continue to constrict the free passage of ideas.  In an attempt to find offsetting funds in the bill, the sponsors of this amendment--naively and recklessly, in my opinion--would hobble an important instrument for promoting U.S. interests abroad. Last year, the Foreign Relations Committee, which authorizes funds for the Radios, debated and eventually agreed on a sensible plan to restructure and streamline the broadcasting programs.  As we speak, Mr. President, U.S.-supported international broadcasting is becoming a more efficient and effective operation. The drastic cuts in this amendment, if left as is, will undermine the reform effort and will almost certainly force the elimination of important radio services around the world.  Let's go over the International Broadcasting Act that this Congress enacted last year with bipartisan support as part of the State Department authorization bill. First, the act consolidated all the U.S. international broadcasting services and created a new broadcasting Board of Governors, which is now in place.  Second, the plan called for reductions in Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty broadcasts to Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union by one-third. In the last year, over 1,250 jobs in programming, news gathering, broadcasting, and support services have been eliminated.  Moving the headquarters of Radio Free Europe from Munich to Prague this fall, when completed, will reduce personnel costs by one-third. President Havel of the Czech Republic generously offered the Radios the use of the former Czechoslovak Parliament building at a symbolic fee of $12 per year.  Overall, the plan will save well over $400 million by 1997.  Moreover, Congress has directed that the funding of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty be assumed by the private sector by the end of the century. The radios are taking this seriously; indeed, the move to prague is a step on the path to privatization. The research arm of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty has already been privatized.  Mr. President, the president's fiscal 1996 request for international broadcasting is 20 percent lower than the 1994 level. The committee appropriation of $355 million is $40 million less than the President's request and $30 million less than the amount authorized by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In other words, international broadcasting is already facing severe reductions that will force the elimination of language services and hours of broadcasting.  This further cut to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty could irreplaceably damage our ability to broadcast to areas of the world where the United States has important national security interests. It is my firm belief that in the post-cold war world the United States must retain diversity and choice in the means by which it conducts its foreign policy. Gutting the radios--on top of the drastic cuts to State Department operations in the bill--would severely limit U.S. flexibility in promoting our goals overseas.  Once again, Mr. President, allow me to explain to my colleagues why the freedom radios are still as important today as they were during the last 40 years. Leaders such as Vaclav Havel, Lech Walesa, and Boris Yeltsin have all testified to the valuable contribution of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in the demise of communism in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.  Democratic government and market economies have not yet fully taken root in these parts of the world. The radios now offer a dual role: to provide a model of how an independent media should function, and to keep honest those who might seek to reestablish repression of the press. A survey of leaders of the former Soviet empire by the open media research institute found that nearly three-quarters of the respondents felt strongly that Western radio broadcasts were still needed.  Some 25 million listeners still tune in to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The radios provide critical information to the people of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe about the events in Chechnya and the former Yugoslavia. As you know, controlling the media and spreading disinformation are key strategies of the Bosnian Serb leaders, and in several new democracies there is only partial news freedom.  While Voice of America tells America's story, the radios act as surrogate media in the absence of free and independent media in the former Soviet empire, in Cuba, and now in Communist Asia. They fill the information gap--in the local languages--where governments deny citizens the fundamental right spelled out in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: ``To seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.''  Mr. President, Congress has already authorized a plan to restructure and economize the radios. The Appropriations Committee has subjected the programs to further spending reductions. I believe that additional cuts for U.S.-sponsored international broadcasting would be contrary to American interests abroad, and I urge that the amendment be dropped in conference.                          ____________________
