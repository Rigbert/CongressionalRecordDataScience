Speaker, today, after nearly a half-century as a member of California's higher education community, California Baptist College becomes California Baptist University. Cal Baptist, founded in 1950, was housed in a borrowed church building for its first four years, moved to its present Riverside location in 1954 and earned accreditation in 1961.  The college reaches this milestone under the leadership of Dr. Ronald L. Ellis, president since 1994. Former presidents are Dr. P. Boyd Smith, 1950-57; Dr. Loyed R. Simmons, 1958-69; Dr. James R. Staples, 1970-84; and Dr. Russell R. Tuck, 1984-94.  During the 1980's, the college was on the cutting edge of non-traditional education when it established the Business Executive program, the pre-cursor to the current Evening Degree-Completion program for working adults. In the mid-eighties, the college added its first post-graduate degree, a Master's degree in Counseling Psychology. Three years ago, the college added a Master of Education degree and, last year, the Master of Business Administration degree. From 1994 to 1997, the institutional enrollment increased 149 percent, much of it through graduate and Evening Degree-Completion programs.  California Baptist College has consistently produced well-schooled graduates. Scores of children in my district are the beneficiaries of that product as they thrive under the teaching of Cal Baptist alumni. The graduates of Cal Baptist's Master's degree program in Counseling Psychology have an unusually high pass rate on the state licensing exam. Cal Baptist alumni serve in the Riverside police department, city government, management in our local banking institutions, a broad array of social service agencies, and church-related positions on a global scale.  California Baptist College--now university--is in the business of preparing complete people, people who are equipped to make a difference. The university provides an environment that fosters not only intellectual development, but spiritual, emotional, physical, and character development. Students are involved in outreach to the homeless; tutoring programs at the county juvenile facility and Sherman Indian High School, a local Bureau of Indian Affairs boarding school; city clean up projects; and the City of Riverside's Study Circles on Race Relations.  The university adheres to a high ethical standard, the kind of standard to which our nation has traditionally aspired and which we continue to uphold as the mark of the truly successful. On behalf of the residents of the 43rd Congressional District, it is an honor to congratulate California Baptist University upon the occasion of their transition to university status.                          ____________________
