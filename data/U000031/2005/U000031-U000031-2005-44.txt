Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the resolution (H. Res. 376) expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that the Federal Trade Commission should investigate the publication of the video game ``Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' to determine if the publisher intentionally deceived the Entertainment Software Ratings Board to avoid an ``Adults-Only'' rating, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              H. Res. 376       Whereas the video game ``Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas''      was given a rating of ``Mature'' by the Entertainment      Software Ratings Board;       Whereas the game contains sexually explicit content that is      accessible by consumers but that appears to have been hidden      from the ratings board in order to avoid the game receiving      an ``Adults Only'' rating;       Whereas the Entertainment Software Ratings Board took swift      action in investigating the matter and revoked the ``Mature''      rating, ensuring any future sales of ``Grand Theft Auto: San      Andreas'' will be under an ``Adults Only'' rating; and       Whereas the publisher of the video game, Rockstar Games,      may have deceived the ratings board and consumers: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of      Representatives that--       (1) the Federal Trade Commission should investigate the      publication of the video game ``Grand Theft Auto: San      Andreas'' to determine if the publisher, Rockstar Games,      deceived the Entertainment Software Ratings Board to avoid an      ``Adults-Only'' rating; and       (2) if the Commission determines Rockstar Games to have      committed such deception or fraud, the Commission should      apply the toughest of penalties.
