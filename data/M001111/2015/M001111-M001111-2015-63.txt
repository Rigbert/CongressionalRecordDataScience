 As ranking member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, I support this amendment, which establishes a process for educators in traditional public schools to pursue innovative, community-inspired strategies to improve education. My home State of Washington has benefited from educator-initiated innovation through the Washington Innovative Schools Program. I am proud to say that we now have almost thirty designated innovative schools that are pursuing creative and innovative educational ideas with a high level of parent and community involvement. And while providing room for innovation is important, it is also essential that we maintain important Federal safeguards. This is why under this amendment, innovation schools must still comply with part B of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. This program will ensure that we balance the need for flexibility while maintaining strong accountability.
