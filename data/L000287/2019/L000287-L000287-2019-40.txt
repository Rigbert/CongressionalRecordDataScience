I rise today with a heavy heart to recognize Senior Bishop McKinley Young, who served as the 109th Bishop from Big Bethel AME Church in Atlanta since 1992.  One of the beloved sons of Atlanta, he was a man of the people and for the people. After completing his studies in Atlanta's public schools, Bishop Young continued his education by earning degrees from Morris Brown College, Andover Newton Theological School, and the University of Chicago Divinity School. An additional six institutions of higher education recognized him with honorary doctorate degrees.  Over the years, the Bishop pastored in Providence, Rhode Island, Chicago and Evanston, Illinois, but Atlanta was always home. In our community, he was committed to the souls of his congregants and service to our society.  Throughout Metro Atlanta, Bishop Young initiated voter registration, education, mobilization, which led to a day of action at the Georgia State Capitol. He was an active supporter of the African Methodist Episcopal Church Service and Development Agency (AME-SADA) for over 20 years and most recently served as chair of the board. Bishop Young also served as the president of the Council of Bishops and the General Board and chaired the Commissions on Women in Ministry, Global Witness and Ministry, Annuity Investments and Insurance, and the Commission on Church Growth and Development.  This great man spoke up and spoke out on behalf of those who had no one to speak for them. Bishop Young worked tirelessly to give hope and opportunity to those, who were left out and left behind. He ministered to those who were lost in the wilderness of despair. In my heart of hearts I know that the impact of his prophetic leadership will be felt by generations yet unborn.  Madam Speaker, today, I offer my deepest condolences to his loving wife, Dorothy Jackson Young; children, Karyn (Ron) Young-Lowe, Deana (Julius) McAllister, Andrea (Roderick) Jones and Stephanie Lynn Young; grandchildren, Jennifer Renee and Jessica Christina Lowe, Julius III, Colin and Dylan McAllister, Peyton, Noah and Miles Jones. I thank them for sharing this ``faithful giant'' with us.                          ____________________
