Chair, today we fight to keep electricity affordable with the Ratepayer Protection Act, a bill that protects folks all across the country from the potential rate increases and reliability risks that experts predict will occur under the EPA's proposed Clean Power Plan. I applaud my colleague Ed Whitfield for his efforts on this important bill and I urge my colleagues to support it.  In my home state of Michigan, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity estimates that the EPA's proposed plan would increase electricity prices by 12%. The last thing families in Michigan and across the country can afford right now are higher bills just as they are finally feeling as if they have turned the corner following the extended economic downturn.  Legal experts, including President Obama's own law professor, Laurence Tribe have testified that the proposal raises grave constitutional questions, exceeds EPA's statutory authority, and violates the Clean Air Act. In fact, Professor Tribe equated the administration's action to ``burning the Constitution.''  Low-income households and those on fixed incomes get hit the hardest when electric bills go up. In Michigan, there are nearly 2 million lower-income and middle-income families--representing 52% of the state's households. Unfortunately, the costs of this proposed rule would fall disproportionately on the most vulnerable.  Small businesses would also face increased electricity costs that could harm their bottom line. And every extra dollar that goes toward higher energy cost is money that can't be spent on new hiring.  For manufacturers, affordable energy is imperative to stay competitive in a global market. That is why the Chamber of Commerce, National Association of Manufacturers, and many other representatives of job-creating businesses have sounded the alarm on the serious threat posed by the administration's plan.  I would also note that higher costs are not the only menace looming on the horizon--what's worse than expensive electricity is no electricity at all. But that is a real possibility. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation and others have warned that the EPA's proposed plan poses a serious threat to electric reliability as power sources are forced offline.  The Ratepayer Protection Act is a thoughtful and straightforward answer to the potential rate shocks and blackouts. The legislation would allow for the completion of judicial review of any rule before requiring states to implement it, and if a governor of a state finds that the rule poses a significant threat to electricity affordability and reliability they would have the power to suspend compliance with the administration's plan.  The Ratepayer Protection Act does not repeal the Clean Power Plan, it merely adds several reasonable safeguards to it. Regulatory overreach has defined this administration and it is time we all stood up to protect affordable energy. Vote yes in support of every American ratepayer and lower bills.  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment under the 5-minute rule.  It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-20.
