 Let me tell you what is wrong with the bill. Does it improve the position of women and children? Sure, but it also improves the position of credit card companies, competing with the women and children for limited funds.  Does it close the homestead loophole? A little bit, but it allows those who are wealthy to find their way around their legal obligation in bankrupcy.  I have coauthored, cosponsored, and voted for bankruptcy reform when it was bipartisan and balanced. This bill is not. This bill was written by a conference committee dominated by one party. It is being shoved down our throats. It is time to shove that old dog off the back porch.
