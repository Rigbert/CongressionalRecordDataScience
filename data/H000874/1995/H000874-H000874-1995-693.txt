Speaker, as a dedicated member and former chairman of the fire services caucus, I am proud to introduce the Firefighters Pay Fairness Act of 1995.  Mr. Speaker, every day over 10,000 Federal firefighters around the country put their lives on the line to protect our lives and property. They work exhausting shifts and take on the greatest of physical and mental challenges. We have an obligation to properly compensate them for their work.  For far too long, our Federal firefighters have received significantly inadequate pay for their hard work. Under the present system, Federal firefighters work over 25 percent more hours a week, yet earn nearly 44 percent less per hour than the average municipal firefighter. Furthermore, the average Federal firefighter is also paid significantly less per hour than their Federal employee counterparts.  Mr. Speaker, Federal firefighters currently work an average of 72 hours, while there municipal counterparts work an average of 50 hours. Meanwhile, Federal firefighters are paid an average hourly rate of $7.34, while the municipal firefighters earn an average of $12.88.  I introduced this legislation to correct the inequities that exist under the present system. This is not an issue about rewarding firefighters for their hard work. Moreover, this should not be viewed as a complimentary pay raise. Rather, this is an issue surrounding fairness comparability. These firefighters work endless work days, put their lives on the line for our constituents, and deserve to have a fair and equitable pay system.  This bill does nothing more than seek fair and equal pay rates for Federal firefighters. It will employ the existing statutory provisions of the Federal general schedule pay system to compute their hourly pay. Thus, Federal firefighters will earn equal pay as compared to their Federal employee counterparts. It also seeks to pay all firefighters, including those who are not defined solely as Federal firefighters, including forestry technicians. These forestry firefighters have braved the brushfires in California and throughout the West over the past several years and thus, deserve adequate compensation.  Mr. Speaker, far too many Federal firefighters have had to work under the inequitable pay system that we presently have. Moreover, upon completion of their required training, many Federal firefighters leave for the private sector where they can earn a larger salary. Thus, this lengthy, expensive training process goes for naught when a firefighter leaves the Federal fire system. It is our duty and responsibility to both those firefighters and the people they protect and serve, to reverse the ills of this system. We should not let another day go by where our Federal firefighters are put in an unfair position as compared to other municipal firefighters and Federal employees.  Mr. Speaker, I hope that my colleagues will join with me in support of this legislation to replace the present inequities of this pay system with a fair, comparable pay structure for our Federal firefighters.                          ____________________
