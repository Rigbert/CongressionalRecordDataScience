President, everyone in here knows what the United Nations Arms Trade Treaty does. It doesn't infringe upon our Second Amendment rights. We all know that. It also limits our ability to help our allies like Israel in building their weapons system.  President Obama has signed the treaty but has not submitted it for ratification; for one reason, he knows the votes are not there. Two years ago, at 5 a.m. in the morning, 53 Senators, from both parties, voted for my amendment very similar to this. My amendment would prevent funds from going to the treaty Secretariat or any other organization that is working to implement this treaty.  I ask for your support and retain the remainder of my time.
