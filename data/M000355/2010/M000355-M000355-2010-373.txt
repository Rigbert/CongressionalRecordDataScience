 He will come to Washington and be sworn in on the Senate floor, as is customary, later today. We all look forward to welcoming him. The people of Massachusetts are eager to have Senator Brown working on their behalf, and Republicans look forward to having him join our conference. This was certainly a high-profile election, but now it is time to get to work.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
