 President, I rise today to pay tribute to the 50th anniversary of the State of Israel, and the enduring, unshakable friendship that has been built between the United States and Israel during those 50 years.  Fifty years ago today, according to the Hebrew calendar, David Ben-Gurion told the world that the State of Israel was born. In that moment, one of the greatest events in the life of the Jewish people took place. Since the Jewish people were expelled from their ancient homeland nearly 2,000 years ago, the desire to return had remained in the hearts and prayers of Jews throughout the world.  In the early decades of this century, the Zionist movement brought thousands of young, idealist Jews back to Palestine, which was at the time controlled by the Turks, and then the British. They returned to the land, establishing kibbutzim and agricultural settlements, and reinvigorated ancient cities. They built the foundations for a state, joined during and after the Holocaust by other Jewish immigrants, fleeing unprecedented persecution.  Supported by Jewish communities around the world, their efforts, and the burning need for a Jewish homeland, were recognized by the United Nations in the Partition Plan of November 29, 1947, which called for the creation of a Jewish and an Arab state in Palestine. Six months, later, on May 14, 1948, the State of Israel was formally established.  Much like the United States, Israel is a nation of immigrants. The establishment of Israel has provided a home and refuge for more than 2.6 million immigrants since its inception. They came to escape persecution, to build a better life, or simply to participate in the rebuilding of a nation.  Jews from every continent and dozens of countries, speaking nearly every language on earth, have returned to their ancient homeland: from Russia fleeing first pogroms and then Communism; from Germany, Austria, Poland, Hungry, Romania, and Czechoslovakia fleeing the Holocaust; from Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and North Africa fleeing Arab anti-Zionism; from Iran fleeing the Ayatollahs; and from Latin America fleeing cruel military regimes.  In the 1990's Israel has seen the largest wave of immigration in its history. 757,000 immigrants, some 700,000 of them leaving behind the chaos of the former Soviet Union, and 14,000 of whom were rescued in one day in a daring airlift from Ethiopia. Israel has served as a model for ethnic diversity as Jews from all parts of the world have ascended to the highest levels of the public and the private sector.  Within minutes of Israel's founding in 1948, President Harry Truman recognized the new state. But there was little time for celebration, because within 24 hours, Israel was attacked by Arab forces from all sides. Immigrants who had just fled the horrors of the Holocaust were given guns and instructions to fight, in languages they did not understand.  In that desperate War of Independence, Israel lost nearly 1% of its population defending itself. But the military acumen and spirit of sacrifice that made that victory possible presaged the building of the Israel Defense Forces--a true citizen army--into one of the world's most respected militaries. In subsequent wars when Israel's survival was threatened--in 1956, 1967, and 1973, Israel fought off seemingly insurmountable odds to retain its statehood.  As spelled out in its Declaration of Independence, the state was formed adhering to democratic and Jewish values, recognizing the freedom of all individuals who reside within it. Israel's vibrant democratic system embodies many of the same values that America holds so dear, including: the separation of powers; concern for human rights; an independent judiciary; a representative parliament (the Knesset) with 11 political parties representing Jews, Arabs, Christians, Druze, men and women; a free press with the highest percentage of newspapers and readers per capita in the world; an average of 80% voter turnout in national elections; and, guaranteed civil liberties.  Over the years, the United States and Israel have built a deep and multi-faceted friendship. Based on common values of democracy and peace, and backed by the United States' ironclad commitment to help Israel safeguard its security, the U.S.-Israel relationship is poised to develop into an even more intimate one in Israel's next 50 years.  In science and technology, trade, culture, and of course, security cooperation, the ties grow deeper every year. Most recently Israel and the U.S. have moved to deepen their defense cooperation by expanding the Arrow anti-missile program, developing the Theater High Energy Laser designed to defendagainst Katyusha rockets, and by the U.S. providing $25 million for anti-terrorism assistance.  Thanks to the industriousness of its people, and with the help of American financial assistance and free trade agreements with both the United States and the European Union, Israel has transformed itself from a small, agriculturally-based economy in a largely desert climate into a modern, successful, high-tech economy.  Israel's industrial exports are today 1,380 times what they were 47 years ago. Its Gross Domestic Product has risen from $2.5 billion in the 1960s to $90.6 billion last year. Its computer industry and agricultural technology are some of the most successful and innovative in the world.  Israel has also seen phenomenal growth in health care and education. More than 33% of Israelis have formal schooling of 13 years compared from 6% in the 1960's and the life expectancy of Israelis is among the longest in the world. It is a sign of Israel's economic maturation that in January of this year, Israel and the United States began to discuss proposals to reduce and phase out U.S. economic aid to Israel.  For Israel's long-term security and economic success, there is no higher priority than the achievement of a permanent peace settlement with all of its neighbors. The peace treaties with Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994 were the first steps in that process. The United States has stood by Israel in its desire to achieve peace with its neighbors, and will continue to work to help Israel achieve peace with Syria, Lebanon, other Arab nations, and, perhaps most urgently, to fulfill the promise of the handshake between the late Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat on the White House lawn in 1993 by achieving a final peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.  For all of us who care so deeply for Israel's security, who long to see Israel achieve peace with its neighbors, the current peace process has reached a critical juncture. Since Israel's security can best be guaranteed by peace between it and its neighbors, the United States must remain prepared to do everything we can to help reach a successful conclusion to this peace process. That is the best 50th birthday present we can give the people of Israel.  On this historic occasion, I would like to offer my utmost congratulations to President Weizman, Prime Minister Netanyahu, and the people they represent, and express my deep admiration for the accomplishments of the State and people of Israel, a nation that has risen from the darkest moments of history to rebuild itself as an example of the capabilities of the human spirit, the unbreakable ties that exist among a people, and the great justice of democracy. May Israel's next 50 years bring it even greater success.                          ____________________
