Speaker, I thank the majority leader.  Mr. Speaker, in addition, one of the things, obviously, that I think both sides are concerned about, and Secretary Mnuchin has urged, and others have urged us to deal with, is the debt limit. We are not exactly sure when it will be necessary and when the administration will run out of extraordinary measures to ensure that we pay our bills.  I have told the majority leader privately and I have said publicly to the press that assuming we have a clean debt limit extension, it would be my intention to urge my Members to support such a clean debt limit extension.  Does the gentleman have any thought as to when we might be considering that?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding and for the question.  Mr. Speaker, I do agree with the gentleman on the premise that it is responsible fiscal policy and it is important to our country's ability to succeed, that includes honoring the full faith and credit of the United States.  The last information I was given, I believe this is public, is that the debt ceiling will not run out until October. There was conversation that that could have been earlier, but we will continue to work with you and Secretary Mnuchin to make sure we pass an extension.
