Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his clarification. It certainly sounds better than the way it was described by some of the earlier speakers in terms of this portion of the bill.  However, I guess I will go back to a problem I have had throughout the bill, which is in a number of critical cases we have seen the bill essentially written, rewritten, and amendments sort of mutating as we go along in this process, and no capability of really explaining them.  Some might remember my debate over the section 401, hydropower licensing, last Thursday night, where the authors of the substitute amendment could not explain it. They could not explain the laws they were referencing, and what principles would still apply.  Mr. Chairman, our water resources are too precious, just too precious, to have either outside influences, polluters, or to have others writing on the back of the napkin and rewriting these laws. This should be a more deliberate process.  Certainly, in this case, I thank the gentleman for his clarification. It seems that they have substantially amended the original version and improved it, but I think that this is not the first instance during the consideration of this bill where we have had this problem. I think it should be instructive to the chairman and others that this is not the best way for such an important piece of legislation to be rushed through the House. I do not see a rush. The Clean Water Act has been working substantially across the country, working well. It is one of the few success stories that we can all point to in terms of Federal enforcement. We should modify it carefully and deliberately, where there has been excess, [[Page H5005]] but where it has been a success, we should build and improve upon it. Our water resources are too precious, our progress has been so hard won, that we should not go backward.
