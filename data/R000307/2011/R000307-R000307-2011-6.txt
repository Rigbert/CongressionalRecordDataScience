President, I had the distinct privilege to participate in a ceremony recently in Topeka, KS, to honor our dear friend and longest serving Republican leader here in this Chamber, Senator Bob Dole. Kansas Governor Sam Brownback conceived of the Kansas Walk of Honor, located right outside the Kansas Capitol, to commemorate and honor important Kansans. It is only fitting that the plaque that bears Bob Dole's name is the first to christen the Walk of Honor. Senator Dole's contributions and history is interwoven in the hallowed halls of the Senate. With that rich history, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record his comments, along with mine, from the Walk of Honor event.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     Remarks of Senator Pat Roberts                          Kansas Walk of Honor                            (Sept. 30, 2011)       I am honored and privileged to be here with you today to      celebrate the Kansas Walk of Honor and to commemorate my good      friend, Kansas Native Son, and WWII hero, Bob Dole. Bob Dole      is a living legacy. As a member of the Greatest Generation,      his incredible history is well known to fellow Americans      nationwide. It is only fitting that he is the first honoree      of the Kansas Walk of Honor.       As a statesman, Bob Dole's reach is far and wide. His      legislative achievements are legion and in many cases,      unknown and unheralded. On Bob's list of accomplishments are      some big ticket items such as, the 1983 Social Security      Reforms, the Americans with Disability Act, the Voting Rights      Act, just to name a few. He also worked across the aisle with      the likes of liberal George McGovern, as seen by their      bipartisan work on nutrition programs.       Bob set the bar high as the longest serving Republican      Senate Majority Leader. He was known as a pragmatic      Midwesterner who was respected on both sides of the aisle and      a master consensus builder. He led by example, encouraging      fellow members to express their convictions without hostility      and allow for disagreement without declaring war on the floor      of the Senate.       But his work didn't stop there. After his service in public      office, Bob served our nation in a different capacity;      honoring our nation's veterans. Simply put, the World War II      Memorial would not exist were it not for Senator Bob Dole. I      was proud to be a part of the ceremony to recognize Bob's      tireless support of America's veterans and the World War II      Memorial. It is largely through his efforts, advocacy, and      fundraising that the World War II Memorial stands proudly on      the National Mall.       The man was and is amazing; his record of public service,      this memorial, the Honor Flights and Wounded Warriors      programs. The World War II Memorial has become wonderfully      unique; a Mecca not really expected or predicted--where      veterans whose heroic efforts and sacrifice preserved our      freedoms--now come by the thousands.       Bob, your record is unmatched. We thank you.       But, hold on, I've got another job to do and that is to      move this ceremony along at a fast clip. As we all know, the      now Governor Brownback's previous job was riding shotgun with      me in the Senate. Sam followed in the footsteps of today's      honoree to continue the level of commitment and service to      our great state.       Sam, I remember the first campaign rally we attended      together. The featured guest speaker, Senator Phil Gramm of      Texas introduced me as one who made significant changes in      the House of Representatives and then introduced Sam as:      ``One who not only wants to change things but to make the      right changes.''       That remains true as you've taken the reins back here in      the heartland. And now it is my pleasure to turn over this      lectern to the indomitable Kansas Governor, Sam Brownback.                                  ____                      Remarks of Senator Bob Dole       Kansas Walk of Honor, Kansas State Capitol, Topeka, Kansas                            (Sept. 30, 2011)       Over the years I've had all sorts of recognitions but      nothing that means as much as this one. Hollywood may have      its Walk of Fame, but in Kansas we have a Walk of Honor. That      tells you a lot about this place and its values. Fame is      fleeting, unsubstantial, first cousin to celebrity. Fame      gives you five minutes on the Today Show or maybe--if you're      sufficiently mobile--a shot at Dancing with the Stars. I'm      still waiting for my invitation. In the mean time I've been      telling Elizabeth to work on her Fox Trot.       Fame comes like a prairie squall, and lasts as long. Honor,      on the other hand, is the work of a lifetime--more, it's the      seed of character planted in one generation and bearing fruit      for as long as there are people who practice the old virtues      of decency and self-denial, love of country and the      neighbor's concern for those in distress. Sixty years have      passed since I first entered this building the greenest of      lawmakers--a somewhat banged up 2nd Lieutenant studying law      at Washburn and hoping that my hero Dwight Eisenhower could      be persuaded to run for president.       Now there's a definition of honor. In fact, honor is a      quality that often goes unrecognized. It exists outside the      headlines. It thrives quietly in our classrooms and church      pews, on our playing fields, and, yes, in these halls where      our democracy plays out--wherever Kansans put service before      self, keeping faith with all those who have made this the     greatest state in the greatest nation on earth.       My debt to those Kansans can never be repaid. But it can be      honored--every time I try, in some small way, to emulate the      compassion and generosity of my friends and neighbors in      Russell, multiplied over the years by countless acts of      kindness, and culminating today in this ceremony. A long time      ago, long before anyone could remotely imagine Bob Dole in a      Walk of Honor, I took inspiration from a song called ``You'll      Never Walk Alone.'' My whole life, up to and including today,      has been a validation of that song. And the greatest honor of      my life has been to share that walk with my fellow Kansans--     the most honorable people I know.                          ____________________
