Res. 504       Whereas, beginning on March 10, 2008, Tibetans and Tibetan      Buddhist monks began demonstrations in Lhasa, the capital of      the Tibet Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of      China;       Whereas those protests spread to elsewhere in the Tibet      Autonomous Region and to Tibetan autonomous areas in the      Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghan provinces of China;       Whereas, long-suppressed resentment prompted violent      clashes between demonstrators and government forces in the      streets of Lhasa, resulting in innocent civilian casualties,      the burning of buildings, and extensive property damage;       Whereas Chinese and Tibetan sources report dozens of      fatalities, and the arrest of more than 1,000 protesters in      the Tibet Autonomous Region and surrounding Tibetan areas of      China;       Whereas Tibet is the center of Tibetan Buddhism and the      Dalai Lama is the most revered figure in Tibetan Buddhism;       Whereas, the Government of China continues to restrict the      rights of Tibetan Buddhists to practice their religion      freely;       Whereas the Dalai Lama has condemned the violence that      began on March 14, 2008, and announced his continuing support      for the Olympic Games to be held in Beijing, China;       Whereas the Dalai Lama has specifically stated that he does      not seek independence for Tibet from China and has called for      negotiations to bring about meaningful autonomy for Tibet      that allows Tibetans to maintain their distinctive identity      within China;       Whereas the Constitution of the People's Republic of China      guarantees freedom of religious belief for all citizens, but      the 2007 Annual Report on International Religious Freedom of      the Department of State states that ``[d]uring the period      covered by this report, the Government [of China]'s respect      for freedom of religion remained poor''; and       Whereas, following the demonstrations that began on March      10, 2008, the Government of China began severely restricting      access to journalists and diplomats and creating a shortage      of independent verification of the situation on the ground in      Tibet: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) condemns the violence in Tibet and calls for restraint      by the Government of the People's Republic of China and the      people of Tibet;       (2) calls for a dialogue between the leadership of the      Government of China and His Holiness the Dalai Lama on      meaningful religious and cultural autonomy for Tibet within      China and urges that these discussions take place with all      deliberate speed;       (3) calls for the release of individuals who protested in a      peaceful manner and for medical care for those injured and      wounded in the violence that followed the protests;       (4) calls on the Government of China to cease its efforts      to enter monasteries to ``reeducate'' monks and nuns, to      respect the right of the people of Tibet to speak of the      Dalai Lama and possess his photograph, and to respect and      protect basic human rights, as provided in the Constitution      of the People's Republic of China;       (5) calls on the Government of China to honor its      commitment to allow international journalists free access to      China from mid-2007 to October 17, 2008;       (6) calls on the Government of China to provide a full      accounting of the March 2008 protests in Tibet, the response      of the Government of China, and the manner and number of      detentions and deaths that occurred following the protests;      and       (7) both--       (A) calls on the United States Department of State to fully      implement the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 (22 U.S.C. 6901      note), including the stipulation that the Secretary of State      ``seek to establish an office in Lhasa, Tibet to monitor      political, economic, and cultural developments in Tibet'',      and also to provide consular protection and citizen services      in emergencies, and       (B) urges that the agreement to permit China to open      further diplomatic missions in the United States should be      contingent upon the establishment of a United States      Government office in Lhasa, Tibet.
