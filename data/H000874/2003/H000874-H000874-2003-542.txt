Speaker, I thank the gentleman for the information. I would ask the distinguished majority leader, when does he expect the conferees will complete their work on the omnibus? Does the gentleman have any idea?  I notice the gentleman says, ``if it is available.'' Does the gentleman have any information on when it may be available and completed?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman will continue to yield, Mr. Speaker, I have talked to the chairman of the Committee on Appropriations. He is working all through the weekend.  As the gentleman may know, the Republican Caucus is going to spend this weekend in retreat. The chairman and some of the conference members are not going on that retreat so they can work through the weekend. They hope to be able to have a formal conference meeting Monday, Monday evening, and start the formal process at that time, hopefully getting the conference report to the floor by Wednesday.
