Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud cosponsor of H. Res. 1185, recognizing National Foster Care Awareness Month.  Today, more than half a million children nationwide are living in foster care. Like children everywhere, these vulnerable young people need the safety and security of a permanent family. For many children who cannot be reunited with their parents, that means joining a new family through adoption.  Across the country there are families who have adopted children and youth from the foster care system. One of those outstanding persons is my constituent Ms. Ann Carnegie in Atlanta who has dedicated her life to the service of others. She is one of many hard-working Americans determined to make a difference for the next generation.  Ms. Carnegie became a single mother when she adopted three children. She began as a foster parent for Bernard and Latrice. Both had already spent 5 years in foster care and had special needs; Ms. Carnegie knew that if the opportunity presented itself that she would want to adopt them.  Bernard is an intelligent, artistic young man who aspires to work with computer animation one day. Latrice is a French honors student who hopes to become a lawyer. Everyone in this loving family takes time to play cars and dinosaurs with their youngest brother Matty. I have faith that all the children in the Carnegie family will fulfill their dreams one day.  Every year, the Carnegie family celebrates the children's adoptions with a special celebration. There are many important pieces of legislation that we both support that will improve child welfare services and strengthen America's families.  I have the privilege to serve on the Income Security and Family Support Subcommittee under the leadership of my good friend, the Gentleman from Washington, Mr. McDermott. I know that all of us on the Subcommittee share a commitment to protect and improve the future of those in the child welfare system.  We must do all we can to help children living in foster care join loving families like the Carnegies, and I look forward to supporting reforms this year. Initiatives like the federal Adoption Incentive program encourages states like mine to finalize more adoptions of children from foster care, but there is more that can be done. Children in foster care have waited long enough.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important resolution today, and to give strong consideration of the many legislative proposals to improve the lives of children in foster care.                          ____________________
