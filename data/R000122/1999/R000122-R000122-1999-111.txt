And to remedy this situation, the bill we have introduced, S. 1313, the Rhode Island Federal Worker Fairness Act, will require the President's Pay Agent to consider the State of Rhode Island as one county strictly for the purposes of locality pay. We believe this bill will enable Rhode Island, the smallest state in the nation and about the same size as the average county in the United States, to apply for locality pay on an equal footing with county governments in other parts of the country.  We look forward to working with the distinguished Chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, Senator Thompson, and the Committee's ranking member, Senator Lieberman, in our effort to reduce the inequities among Federal employees in our regionand enable federal offices in Rhode Island to attract and retain qualified employees.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
