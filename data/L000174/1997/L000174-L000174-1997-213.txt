President, I would like to take a moment to highlight a provision in the energy and water appropriations bill which could begin to address some of the energy generation problems facing very rural areas. The bill provides modest funding for the deployment of solar, wind, fuel cell, and biomass technologies in remote areas of the United States.  Producing and distributing power in rural areas is a challenge in and of itself. Distribution lines are often moreexpensive and difficult to establish, and communities are often forced to rely on cheaper, but more polluting fuel sources. This demonstration will provide the resources to look at the effectiveness of less noxious, renewable energy technologies.  One application of this kind of demonstration which has come to my attention is a proposal in Vermont to replace polluting diesel engines with modern fuel cell technology for snow production. One of the last places you might think of air quality problems is in the mountains of Vermont. But in fact, four of the six largest sources of NOx emissions in the State are ski resorts which often use inefficient and dirty burning diesel engines to produce snow. Because of the remoteness of snow production facilities, other, cleaner commercial energy alternatives are not an option. This funding would allow States like Vermont to experiment with energy production technologies that can work efficiently while greatly reducing NOx and particulate matter emissions.  I would like to thank the Senator from New Mexico for funding this valuable initiative and ask for his comments on this possible application of fuel cell technology to the problem I have described in Vermont.
