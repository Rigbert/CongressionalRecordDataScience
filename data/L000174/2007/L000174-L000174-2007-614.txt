Senator Kennedy, who is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Refugees, makes an important point. I believe that the United States should contribute half of the funds, and I will work with Senator Kennedy and with the State Department to ensure that those funds are provided. I agree thatAmerica should show greater leadership by providing at least half the funds for this appeal.                                 NDIIPP
