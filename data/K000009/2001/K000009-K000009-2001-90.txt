Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from Texas for yielding.  To reaffirm what she has said with me here today, I have documents from over 1,100 public housing authorities in our country and their neighborhoods that are benefiting from this program. Members should know and should check their own districts prior to voting on this amendment. It serves America coast-to-coast. It has made our communities more beautiful and safer places in which to live. It saves lives every day. I thank the gentlewoman for asking for that clarification.
