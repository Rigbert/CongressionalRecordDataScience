 President, I am pleased to rise in support of Ambassador Albright's nomination as Secretary of State. I am confident she will serve our national security interests with distinction.  While she has managed a broad portfolio in her capacity as our Ambassador to the United Nations, there are two issues where I have had occasion to work closely with her and have been particularly impressed with her views and commitment.  On Burma, Ambassador Albright has consistently delivered a tough message to the ruling junta: We expect improvements on human rights, we expect a serious effort to be made to combat the scourge of narcotics trafficking.  She has recognized that the key to progress in both areas is to restore democracy to Burma.  To the supporters of Aung San Suu Kyi and her legitimately elected Government of Burma, robbed of their victory in 1991, Albright has been the sole voice of support and hope in this administration.  Following the International Conference on Women in Beijing, she traveled to Rangoon and met with Aung San Suu Kyi.  This may not seem to be exceptional, but Ambassador Albright is the only senior official in the administration to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi and has been alone yet unfailing in her outspoken support for the advancement of Burma's freedom from the thugs who currently rule.  A few weeks ago, after several hundred students and citizens were arrested for calling for political change, Ambassador Albright spoke out forcefully and in clear terms at the United Nations that this oppression must come to an end.  Last year, during consideration of the foreign operations bill, we included language which established criteria for imposing economic sanctions against SLORC.  Specifically, we required sanctions be applied if there was large scale repression against the opposition or if any action was taken to harm or rearrest Aung San Suu Kyi.  Since the bill passed, the administration continues to be in a holding pattern claiming our policy is under review, a review which has been going on for several years.  In the meantime, more than 500 people have been arrested when Aung San Suu Kyi ventured from her compound several weeks ago, her car was stoned and smashed by thugs as SLORC police looked on. Since then she has been under undeclared house arrest.  Given her past support I am hopeful Ambassador Albright will finally take the necessary steps to position this administration squarely in support of democracy and its most eloquent, dignified advocate Aung San Suu Kyi.  Let me comment briefly on one other area where I believe Ambassador Albright has already made a difference.  During the administration's recent consideration of the level of support for the foreign affairs account she has been unflinching and unapologetic about the need to provide adequate resources to administer American foreign policy and assistance programs.  I share her view that we have reached a crisis point--we cannot afford to compromise our financial support for our embassies and programs abroad based on a misguided notion that further reductions will actually make a difference in balancing the budget.  The 150 account is already less than 1 percent of Federal spending--further cuts will not make any meaningful contribution to controlling our budget deficit and, in fact may actually make it worse.  Cutting back on America's presence overseas has a direct impact on American commercial interests--without export promotion programs to launch and support them in critical but risky new markets, American business men will lose long term access and share--and as we all know, exports are the key to both American income and 11 million jobs.  It's not just our economy that is affected, our presence abroad has a direct affect on protecting our interests in combating terrorism and narcotics trafficking, direct threats to our communities and families.  American leadership has paid a premium in peace and prosperity but it comes at a price. Madeleine Albright has courageously and clearly defended the importance of making that down payment.  I am confident that she will bring the same frank, smart, and tough approach to her new responsibilities that we have seen her exercise in her current position.  I ask unanimous consent that Ambassador Albright's statement at the United Nations be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the statement was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     Statement by Ambassador Madeleine K. Albright, United States  Representative to the United Nations, in the General Assembly, on the            Human Rights Situation in Burma, December 12, 1996       The United States strongly supports this resolution on the      human rights situation in Burma, and I congratulate my      colleagues from Sweden for the skill and commitment with      which they authored and gained agreement to it.       This resolution reflects the consensus view of the members      of the United Nations, a view premised on the ideals of the      UN Charter and the principles enshrined in the Universal      Declaration of Human Rights. It reflects the hard-earned      wisdom of the international community that every government      of every society should be held to certain minimum standards      of respect for the rights and freedoms of its own people.       Regrettably, the current government of Burma is not meeting      these minimum standards. It has subjected democratic forces      to a kind of rolling repression in which small steps forward      alternate with crackdowns and episodes of intimidation and      violence.       The Burmese authorities, known as the SLORC, have refused      to enter into a meaningful dialogue with the leader of the      National League for Democracy, Aung San Suu Kyi, or with      other democratic leaders and representatives of the major      ethnic groups. They have continued to deny to their citizens      the fundamental political freedoms of expression and      assembly. And they have engaged in torture, forced labor,      forced relocations and summary executions.       It is increasingly clear that the failure of Burmese      authorities to respect civil and human rights is causing      unrest within the country.       Recent student demonstrations, although non-political in      nature, have been harshly repressed. The Government has      periodically curtailed the right of Aung San Suu Kyi to      address her supporters in public and even to leave her home.      Last November, her motorcade was attacked by a mob that could      only have acted with official authority and blessing. As we      speak, the restrictions on her movements and activities are      the most severe since her release from ``house arrest'' in      July, 1995.       Although the SLORC professes a desire to move Burma in the      direction of democracy, it has not done so. The      Constitutional Convention it established to create the      illusion of a national political dialogue is a sham--fully      controlled and orchestrated by the government. As a result,      the Convention has been a source not of reconciliation, but      of further division.       Finally, the Government of Burma has refused to cooperate      with the UN Special Rapporteur and with the Special      Representative of the Secretary-General.       The Burmese authorities would like the world to believe      that its harsh policies are necessary in light of Burma's      turbulent history and the multi-ethnic nature of Burmese      society. But as the Resolution approved today shows, the      world does not accept that excuse. The right of people to      participate freely in a democratic political process is an      ally--not an enemy--to national unity and social peace.       Experience tells us that the kind of stability that may be      achieved through repression is sterile, superficial and      temporary. It is a stability maintained by fear, in which the      human resources of a society are held back and beaten down.       Lasting stability, economic prosperity and a rich cultural      life come when people are free to make use of their full      talents and abilities. A society blossoms when those who      govern respect those who are governed, and when the people      have confidence in those they have chosen to make and enforce      their laws.       For Burma, the path to that kind of future is outlined in      this resolution.       In it, we call upon the government to cease abusing human      rights, to empty their cells     of those detained for political reasons, to permit UN      representatives to visit; and to begin a genuine dialogue      with democratic and ethnic leaders.       The more time elapses before these steps are taken, the      more the pressure will build, the more divided Burma will      become, and the more difficult it will be for Burma to      achieve a peaceful transition to democratic rule.       The international community would like to see Burma develop      into a stable, prosperous and democratic society. We would      like to remove Burma from the list of nations about which we      annually express concern.       But as long as repression remains the government's chosen      means of conducting business with its own people, we will      continue to meet our own responsibility to speak up; and to      assert the validity in Burma of the universal and cherished      principles by which all nations have agreed to live, and      without which, no nation can fulfill its potential.
