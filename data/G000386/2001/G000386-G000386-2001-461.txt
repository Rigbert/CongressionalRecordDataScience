 President, the amendment I am offering with Senators Snowe, Domenici, Collins, and Frist this afternoon represents Senate Republicans following through on our commitments. We joined President Bush in committing to strengthen and improve Medicare to meet the needs of older Americans. And the amendment I am offering demonstrates that we will keep that promise.  This amendment provides the flexibility necessary for the Finance Committee to craft legislation that notonly provides necessary reforms and improves access to prescription drugs, but does so in a responsible fashion--so we're not left with uncontrollable spending.  I hear from constituents all the time about things in Medicare that need to be updated. And while prescription drugs is the most visible improvement, it is surely not the only one.  Medicare is operating on a system that is almost a half-century old.
