And I thank the Senator from Nevada for his leadership. I was happy to join him on this legislation. What really frustrated many of us was the fact that Congress was unwilling to even look at the issue.  It is something to go back home, whether the home State is Illinois or Nevada, and find people who are telling you real-life stories, tragedies of businesses that have had to cut back in the number of employees and the work they are doing, because of the cost of energy.  I am from a farming State. Illinois, of course, is proud of the fact that it produces so much corn, soybeans, wheat, pork, and beef, but the farmers with whom I have talked face the same thing. It is not just the cost of operating their businesses on the farm butthe cost of fertilizer. All of this is directly linked to the cost of energy.  We can explore and debate future energy policy, but we have to be very honest in dealing with the reality of the challenge facing families today. That is why I am hoping--and I hope the Senator from Nevada agrees with me--that there can be an agreement very soon between the Democrats and Republicans to reorganize this Senate and to move forward.
