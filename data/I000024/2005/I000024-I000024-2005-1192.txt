President, today I will continue my series of the four pillars of climate alarmism. This is the third pillar speech. In my first speech, I outlined how the media and some of the environmental extremists distorted, exaggerated, and mischaracterized a major climate change report from the National Academy of Sciences.  I showed how the left and the media exaggerated a document that contained numerous caveats about the uncertainties of current knowledge and the caution that its conclusions were tentative, proclaiming the report showed conclusively that global warming due to man is occurring.  In my second speech, I described some of the more serious and, indeed, fatal flaws in the 2001 Third Assessment Report from the U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, known also as the IPCC, which I will refer to from time to time. In that speech, I exposed how Michael Mann's now infamous ``hockey stick,'' the flagship of the IPCC's claims that global warming is real, has been thoroughly discredited in scientific circles, and that the IPCC's projections of future carbon emissions, which drive temperature model conclusions, have been proven to be based on political decisions that, by the end of the century, countries such as Libya will be as wealthy or wealthier than the United States.  Now, I would like to examine the Arctic Climate Impact Assessment Report, which received considerable attention on its release late last year. Last November, the Arctic Council, described as a ``high-level information forum'' that includes the United States, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, and Sweden, released its 140-page arctic synthesis report, entitled, ``Impacts of a Warming Arctic.'' It details the major findings from the Arctic Council's 1,200-page scientific report, which will be released in the coming weeks.
