President, I ask unanimous consent that the statement of A.J. Wilhelmi, president and CEO of the Illinois Health and Hospital Association also be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  [From the Illinois Health and Hospital Association, Sept. 21, 2017]         The Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson ACA Repeal Proposal                           (By A.J. Wilhelmi)       The Illinois Health and Hospital Association opposes the      latest Senate proposal to repeal the Affordable Care Act,      which would do great harm to patients, hospitals, the      healthcare delivery system, and our state budget and economy.      The Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill is even more damaging      than the previous Senate and House repeal proposals. Not only      will it result in the loss of healthcare coverage for up to      one million Illinoisans, but it will erode key protections      for patients and consumers and will cut federal healthcare      resources to Illinois by more than $150 Billion.       IHA also opposes changing Medicaid to a capped funding      model. Illinois already ranks 50th in the country in federal      funding support per Medicaid beneficiary. Capped funding      would lock Illinois into low, insufficient federal funding      levels and shift costs to the state.       Illinois cannot absorb additional financial burdens that      would be imposed on the state and would be forced to reduce      eligibility, covered services, and payments to providers. The      magnitude of these cuts and changes to Medicaid is      staggering.       We were encouraged by recent bi-partisan negotiations to      stabilize the individual marketplace. The Graham-Cassidy-     Heller-Johnson bill will do nothing in the short or long term      to create marketplace stability.       We urge the Senate to reject this proposal, and we implore      the members of the Illinois House Delegation to oppose the      bill if it passes the Senate. There is a great deal at stake      for the health and well-being of the people of Illinois.
