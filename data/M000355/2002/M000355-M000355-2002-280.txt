 President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut, the chairman of the committee, for an excellent suggestion.  I also thank the Senators from Florida for being willing to take this particular path. It certainly simplifies our lives and hopefully gets the response the Senators are seeking as well.  I have talked to Senator Bond. He also agrees.  So it seems to me that is a good solution to the issue.
