Chairman, reclaiming my time, I agree with the gentleman; and I say to the gentleman, he and I have voted on different sides of an issue that I think was a very central first amendment right. He and I differed on that issue. But our opinion on that issue, other than that it may have motivated each of us to vote, is irrelevant. In the final analysis what is relevant, what is important to the individual, is what the Supreme Court of the United States says we did, and nothing we say in our legislation, affirming its constitutionality or questioning its constitutionality, will make any difference. It is the opinion of the Supreme Court that will make the difference.  Therefore, I oppose this amendment, not because its sentiment is wrong--because its sentiment is not--but because it is mere surplusage, and not relevant to this legislation. I do not mean to say to the gentleman from Illinois that his opinion as to the constitutionality of one or more provisions of the act is not relevant. Clearly it is, and it may well motivate his vote on this particular piece of legislation. But to add this surplusage does not add to or subtract from the substance of this legislation.  I would hope that this body would reject this amendment because of the process that this amendment will require the legislation to then go through.  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentlewoman from Michigan (Ms. Rivers).
