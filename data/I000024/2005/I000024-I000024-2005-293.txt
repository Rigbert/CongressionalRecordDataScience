President, I rise today along with my colleague, Tom Coburn, to proudly introduce legislation to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at 6110 East 51st Place in Tulsa, OK as the ``Dewey F. Bartlett Post Office''.  Dewey Follett Bartlett, former Governor and distinguished alumnus of this Senate body, emulated the Oklahoma spirit of innovative leadership, hard work, and public service. In his honor, I proudly seek to name a post office in his hometown of Tulsa, OK. We commemorate an outstanding public servant so that posterity will be challenged by his example, just as we have been.  Although he was not actually born in Oklahoma, Dewey Bartlett naturalized as fast as he could. While studying at Princeton University, he came home during summers to work in Oklahoma oil fields just as I did. He moved to my hometown, Tulsa, in 1945 to assume a managing role in his family's business after his military service during World War II.  Dewey Bartlett shared my dedication to a strong national defense. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a pilot myself, I appreciate Mr. Bartlett for his military service to our country. He was awarded the Air Medal for his distinguished efforts in the Pacific Theater during World War II. Not only did he serve in the U.S. Marine Corps as a combat dive-bomber pilot, he championed the military during his service in the Senate.  During his tenure in the Senate, Bartlett was more than once deemed the most conservative member of the Senate. It is an Oklahoma distinction that I have sought to uphold. Last year, the American Conservative Union ranked me as the most conservative member of the Senate. I share his vision of advocating common sense Oklahoma values including less government bureaucracy, less regulation, lower taxes and fiscal responsibility.  Dewey Bartlett's political philosophy was consistent with the Constitutional intention to not encumber Americans with layers of bureaucracy, but to promote individual liberty, freedom and justice. I am pleased that we can honor albeit in a small way, his service to our country by naming a post office in Tulsa, OK after him.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation as we commemorate an outstanding citizen so that future generations will be challenged by his example.                                 ______                                       By
