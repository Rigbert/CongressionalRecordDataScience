President, I regret that the President and the Republican leadership in the Senate continue to choose division over cooperation and confrontation over consensus on the Presidents' most controversial judicial nominees. Senators can work together, Republicans and Democrats. The conflict we are experiencing on the Senate floor, which has the collateral consequence of disrupting important and unfinished work of the Senate, is by Republican partisan design. It is bad for the Senate and the country.  Earlier this morning I was at the White House for the signing of the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act. Senator Campbell and I were the lead sponsors in the Senate on this successful effort, which we know as the ``Steve Young Act'' to honor an outstanding law enforcement officer.  Another example of our bipartisan cooperation is the resolution the Senate passed unanimously last night regarding with the consequences of the Supreme Court's decision in the Blakely case and the need to clarify Federal criminal sentencing law, S. Con. Res. 130. The Senate has now said, consistent with the record we developed at our recent Judiciary Committee hearing, that the Supreme Court should expeditiously clarify the status of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals urged expedited consideration. The Department of Justice is bringing cases to the Supreme Court and should seek expedited consideration to afford the opportunity needed to obtain that necessary guidance.  There are scores of other measures on the Senate Calendar of Business on which we should be acting and could have been acting this week. We still need to enact the Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act, S. 2013; the Ag Workers bill, S. 1645; the Dream Act, S. 1545; the judicial pay raise, S. 1023, the Anti-Atrocity Act, S. 710; the authorization for mental health courts, S. 2107; and other needed legislation on which there is so much bipartisan agreement.  With all this to do, with the 13 appropriations bills as yet unfinished, without a budget, without serious oversight of significant problems, it is incredibleto me that the Republican Senate leadership is devoting this week to divisive cloture votes on controversial nominations. Why they choose to sow division rather than make progress on matters that could improve the lives of so many Americans across the country is for others to explain.  Criticism of this ``do-nothing'' Congress is becoming universal. Conservative writers who are more prone to promote the Republican agenda than criticize its leadership have even joined in the chorus. Maybe that explains this misguided exercise, maybe it is reaction to all the criticism and an effort to shore up the extreme right-wing of Republican support. I do not know.  I fear more and more that some want the Senate to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of this Presidency and the Federal courts to become an arm of the Republican Party. That is wrong, that is unwise, that is unsound. The American people need to say no and preserve this great democracy.  Rather than doing the people's business, the Senate is being forced into contrived stunts for partisan political purposes. I urge the Republican leadership to use the upcoming recess to learn about the Senate and its role in our Federal Government. Maybe read Master of the Senate, the extraordinary and award winning book by Robert Caro, or the Constitution of the United States.  The American people deserve better. The Senate deserves better. Senator Byrd has spoken to this situation. Senator Daschle, Senator Reid and all Democratic Senators have demonstrated over and over again our good faith and commitment to moving forward. Let us all, Republicans and Democrats, come back from the upcoming hiatus in our Senate proceedings with a commitment to find the common ground that Senator Daschle spoke about so well last month in the interests of the American people.                          ____________________
