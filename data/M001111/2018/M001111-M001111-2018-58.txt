 I would like to ask my colleagues through the chair about section 111 of the bill amending section 415 of the Congressional Accountability Act. A new subparagraph, which will become 415(d)(1)(D), describes certain violations for which reimbursement is required by a Member of the House of Representatives or a Senator. I am interested in my colleagues' understanding regarding how that language should be interpreted?
