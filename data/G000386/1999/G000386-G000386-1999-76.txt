 President, in response to what the Senator from Vermont said, obviously I am in no position to speak for our majority leader or assistant majority leader on some of the things he said. But I do share his view, especially coming from a rural State, as the Senator from Vermont does, that there is very much benefit for our rural constituents in that satellite viewers legislation. I, too, would like to see it pass.  I can say again, not for the leader but for myself, I have observed a lot of contact between important Senators around here on that issue. There is a real effort being made to find a solution so that can be passed so on December 31 what you said would happen, and what would actually happen if the bill does not pass will not in fact happen.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
