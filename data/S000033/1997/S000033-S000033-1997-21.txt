 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, let me at this point thank both the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Rogers] and the gentleman from West Virginia [Mr. Mollohan] and Members from both sides of the aisle for their commitment to fairness. I think that is the right thing to do, and I appreciate it.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a tripartisan amendment sponsored by progressives and conservatives, Democrats, Republicans, and an Independent.  Mr. Chairman, in my view, our current trade policy is a disaster. This year we are going to run up a $200 billion merchandise trade deficit, the largest in our history, and it is a deficit that is going to cost us millions of decent-paying jobs. But, Mr. Chairman, as serious as the economic implications of our trade policy are, this amendment deals with an issue that is even more important.  This amendment deals with democracy and national sovereignty and the right of the American people, through their local, State and nationally elected bodies, to make legislation which the American people believe is in their best interests.  The Members of Congress who are cosponsoring this legislation have different political points of view. We disagree on everything, but we agree that it is the people of the United States of America who should decide the important issues and not people in the World Trade Organization meeting behind closed doors in Switzerland who should make those decisions and who should override legislation that we pass, that State government passes, that local government passes.                              {time}  1800  Briefly stated, what is some of the legislation that is being threatened, that has been threatened? The WTO, through the urging of Venezuela, forced changes in our Clean Air Act. Mexico forced changes in the Marine Mammal Protection Act.  Southeast Asian countries have filed complaints against American restrictions on shrimp. A Massachusetts law promoting democracy in Burma, which has also been passed by many cities all over America, is now being brought before the WTO by the European Union and Japan. If Massachusetts loses that case, they must take their law off of the books or risk being punished by trade sanctions.  The bottom line here is that no matter what Members' political views are, and I disagree with Helms-Burton, voted against it, want to see it repealed, but I want to see that debate take place here in Congress, and not have somebody through the WTO overrule it. That is the issue.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
