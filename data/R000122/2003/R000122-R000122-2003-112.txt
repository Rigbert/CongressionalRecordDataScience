President, we often don't think about how important water is to our everyday lives, for our health and for our economy. As Americans, we take for granted that when we turn on the tap that clean and safe water will flow from the faucet.  Over the last three decades, the United States has made substantial progress in reducing the pollution flowing into our waters and safeguarding drinking water supplies for our communities. Despite our progress, we still face many challenges.  Population growth is increasing demand for water, and pollution from point and nonpoint sources threaten the quality and quantity of water available to us. According to EPA, the overwhelming majority of the population of the United States--218 million people--live within 10 miles of a polluted river, lake, or coastal water. Nearly 40 percent of these waters are not safe for fishing, swimming, boating, drinking water, or other needs. And while overall water pollution levels decreased dramatically over the last 30 years, recent data may be revealing a disturbing trend. Indeed, EPA's most recent National Water Quality Inventory found that the number of polluted rivers and estuaries increased between 1998 and 2000. Water pollution represents a real and daily threat to public health and to the wildlife that depend on clean water.  This year, we are celebrating the Year of Clean Water. To honor our national commitment to reduce the pollution flowing into our waters and provide safe drinking water for our communities, I am introducing the National Clean and Safe Water Fund Act of 2003. The legislation, cosponsored by Senators Voinovich, Sarbanes, Snowe, Jeffords, Levin and Harkin will create a fund to carry out projects to promote water quality and protect watersheds and aquifers. It would establish a fund whose sole purpose is to advance the restoration of U.S. waters, particularly in the watersheds where these violations occurred. The bill is supported by a wide variety of organizations, including: the Narragansett Bay Commission, the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies, American Rivers, Environmental Integrity Project, Friends of the Earth, National Audubon Society, Natural Resources Defense Council, The Ocean Conservancy and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group. I asked unanimous consent that the bill and letters of support be included in the record following my statement.  Last year, the Federal Government collected $52 million in civil and criminal penalties from violations of the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Acts. The money was deposited in the Treasury with no guarantee that the fines collected would be used to correct the water pollution for which the penalties were levied. Our legislation would make these funds available to local communities, tribes, States and non-profit organizations to protect and preserve watersheds and aquifers and to improve water quality.  This legislation would target this money to worthy projects, such as wetland protection and stream buffers to help filter out pathogens and pollutants that contaminate drinking water; land acquisition and conservation easements to protect watershed and aquifers; best management practices to prevent pollution in the first place; and, treatment works to control combined sewer or sanitary sewer overflows. Our legislation will continue progress to reduce the number of impaired waterways in our Nation, and to reduce, or better yet, prevent contamination of groundwater and drinking water sources.  It is imperative that we increase Federal investment in clean water and drinking water infrastructure and devote greater resources and attention to protecting and improving our watersheds and aquifers.  The Congressional Budget Office released a report that estimated the spending gap for clean water needs could reach as high as $388 billion and the spending gap for drinking water needs could reach $362 billion over 20 years. The CBO concluded the current funding from all levels of government and current revenue generated from ratepayers will not be sufficient to meet the Nation's future demand for water infrastructure. Yet, despite these grim statistics, the Federal Government is investing only $1.35 billion in Clean Water infrastructure each year and $850 million in Drinking Water infrastructure. And unfortunately, the President's budget proposes to cut this funding by $500 million this year.  Given the tremendous need in our communities, and the importance of water infrastructure to our economy, it is vital that the Federal Government maintain a strong partnership with States and local governments to avert this massive funding gap. We need to find new funding sources for watershed and aquifer protection. Clean, safe and abundant drinking water can no longer be taken for granted.  The costs of building new reservoirs and treatment facilities threaten to overrun our ability to pay, especially during the current fiscal crisis. Technology also has limitations in its ability to treat polluted water. Many water agencies are focusing on protecting watersheds and aquifers and conserving valuable clean water resources. In my State, the Providence Water Supply Board collects 1 cent per 100 gallons in a water usage tax to fund watershed acquisition. This may be our best and cheapest way to guarantee water quality and quantity.  Congress needs to increase support for efforts to protect our water resources. Polluted runoff from urban and agricultural land is now the most significant source of water pollution in the nation and the greatest threat to our drinking water. Our greatest future gains in pollution control will, therefore, come from reducing non-point source pollution.  There are cost-effective and environmentally sound projects that could help reduce this pollution, but currently, many non-point source projects cannot participate in the State revolving loan programs since they often do not have a guaranteed source of revenue. Also, without making new Federal resources available it is unlikely we will be able support increased investment in green infrastructure projects such as wetland conservation and stream buffers. The legislation that we are introducing today will make greater funding available for water quality projects.  I hope that my colleagues will join Senators Voinovich, Sarbanes, Snowe, Jeffords, Levin, Harkin and me in supporting this legislation. Creating this fund will help further the Nation's goals of providing safe and clean water for our communities and restoring water quality for wildlife.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of bill and letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1539       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``National Clean and Safe      Water Fund Act of 2003''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds that--       (1) the Administrator of the Environmental Protection      Agency has determined that more than 40 percent of the      assessed water of the United States does not meet applicable      water quality standards established by States, territories,      and Indian tribes;       (2) the water described in paragraph (1) includes      approximately 300,000 miles of rivers and shorelines, and      approximately 5,000,000 acres of lakes, that are polluted by      sediments, excess nutrients, and harmful microorganisms;       (3) Congress enacted--       (A) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251      et seq.) to maintain the chemical, physical, and biological      integrity of water of the United States; and       (B) the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.) to      protect public health by regulating the public drinking water      supply of the United States;       (4) because criminal, civil, and administrative penalties      assessed under the Acts referred to in paragraph (3) are      returned to the Treasury, those amounts are not available to      protect, preserve, or enhance the quality of water in      watersheds in which violations of those Acts occur; and       (5) the establishment of a national clean and safe water      fund would help States in achieving the goals described in      paragraph (1) by providing funding to protect and improve      watersheds and aquifers.     SEC. 3. NATIONAL CLEAN AND SAFE WATER FUND.       Section 309 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33      U.S.C. 1319) is amended by adding at the end the following:       ``(h) National Clean and Safe Water Fund.--       ``(1) Establishment.--There is established in the Treasury      a fund to be known as the `National Clean and Safe Water      Fund' (referred to in this subsection as the `Fund')      consisting of amounts transferred to the Fund under paragraph      (2) and amounts credited to the Fund under paragraph (3).       ``(2) Transfer of amounts.--Notwithstanding any other      provision of law, for fiscal year 2003 and each fiscal year      thereafter, the Secretary of the Treasury shall transfer to      the Fund an amount determined by the Secretary to be equal to      the total amount deposited in the general fund of the      Treasury in the preceding fiscal year from fines, penalties,      and other funds collected as a result of enforcement actions      brought under this section, section 505(a)(1), or the Safe      Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.), excluding any      amounts ordered to be used to carry out projects in      accordance with subsection (d).       ``(3) Investment of amounts.--       ``(A) In general.--The Secretary of the Treasury shall      invest in interest-bearing obligations of the United States      such portion of the Fund as is not, in the judgment of the      Secretary, required to meet current withdrawals.       ``(B) Administration.--The obligations shall be acquired      and sold and interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or      redemption of, the obligations shall be credited to the Fund      in accordance with section 9602 of the Internal Revenue Code      of 1986.       ``(4) Use of amounts for water quality projects.--       ``(A) In general.--Amounts in the Fund shall be available      to the Administrator, subject to appropriation, to carry out      projects the primary purpose of which is water quality      maintenance or improvement, including--       ``(i) water conservation projects;

Hon. Jack Reed,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reed: I write today to express the support of      the Association of Metropolitan Water Agencies (AMWA) for      your National Clean and Safe Water Fund Act of 2003.       AMWA is an association of the nation's largest publicly      owned drinking water systems. AMWA members serve safe      drinking water to more than 110 million Americans.       Funded with fines collected due to violations of the Clean      Water Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act, the National Clean      and Safe Water Fund could provide much-needed resources to      improve the rivers and lakes that serve as sources of      drinking water for millions of Americans.       Agricultural run-off remains the largest contributor of      nonpoint source pollution in our nation's waters. According      to the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S.      Geological Survey, agricultural pollution--such as siltation,      animal waste, pesticides and fertilizers--contributes to 59      percent of reported water quality problems in impaired rivers      and streams.       These and other water quality problems in our nation's      sources of drinking water could be reduced with the      assistance of land acquisition, reduced pollutant loading,      wetlands restoration, wastewater treatment works and other      projects eligible for funding in the National Clean and Safe      Water Fund Act of 2003.           Sincerely,                                                  Diane VanDe Hei,     Executive Director.                                  ____                              The Narragansett Bay Commission,                                    Providence, RI, July 29, 2003.     Hon. Jack Reed,     U.S. Senator, Senate Hart Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reed: On behalf of the Narragansett Bay      Commission, I am writing to express support for the Clean and      Safe Water Fund Legislation, as proposed by you and Senators      Voinovich and Sarbanes.       According to the EPA, the Congressional Budget Office, and      the Water Infrastructure Network, the nation faces a funding      gap as     high as $46 billion per year for necessary and mandated water      and wastewater infrastructure projects. The burden of paying      for these mandated projects currently falls almost      exclusively on municipalities. This legislation will be an      important first step in moving toward a national trust fund      for water and wastewater infrastructure.       We applaud you and your fellow Senator for your recognition      of the importance of a dedicated funding source for water and      wastewater infrastructure and we are pleased to support this      bill.           Sincerely,                                               Paul Pinault, P.E.,     Executive Director.                                  ____         American Rivers Environmental Integrity Project, Friends            of the Earth, National Audubon Society, Natural            Resources Defense Council, The Ocean Conservancy, U.S.            Public Interest Research Group,                                                        July 2003.       Dear Senator Reed: On behalf of our organizations and the      millions of members we represent, we are writing to express      our support for your new legislation, the National Clean and      Safe Water Fund Act of 2003. Currently, funds from violators      of the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act go into      the general Treasury, and are not specifically earmarked for      the protection and enhancement of water quality. This      legislation would establish a fund whose sole purpose is to      advance the restoration of U.S. waters, particularly in the      areas in which violations of those acts occur.       This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Clean Water      Act, but unfortunately we remain far behind the goals of the      authors of the Act. The Environmental Protection Agency      acknowledges that over 40 percent of our nation's waters      remain unfit for fishing and swimming. We need to do a better      job of enforcing the laws that are already on the books, as      well as adopting new strategies to ensure that penalties from      violations of clean water laws are used to restore the      impacted watersheds. The National Clean and Safe Water Fund      Act of 2003 outlines many projects for which penalties      collected from violators of the Clean Water Act and Safe      Drinking Water Act would go towards, including drinking water      source protection, wetland protection and restoration, and      stormwater and wastewater treatment projects.       We appreciate your leadership in introducing this      legislation, and look forward to working with you to see it      passed into law.
