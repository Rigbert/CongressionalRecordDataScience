 I rise today to offer an amendment that I truly believe will have a positive effect on the quality of life for many hard-working American families. Access to childcare is essential to the quality of life of families trying to balance both work and family.  Earlier this year, S. 228, my small business childcare grant program, was incorporated into and passed as part of the supplemental spending bill. I thank Senators Kennedy and Dodd for working with me to secure this authorization. This truly was a bipartisan effort.  My amendment today provides the funding for this program so that we can make a difference for American families.  Unfortunately, our small businesses generally do not have the resources required to start up and support a childcare center.
