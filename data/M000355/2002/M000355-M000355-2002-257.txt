 President, I missed part of the Senator's remarks. I ask the Senator from Virginia, I believe he raised the issue, how this would work in a year in which there were both Federal candidates on the ballot and State candidates on the ballot. Did the Senator from Virginia discuss that issue?  I am having a hard time figuring out how it could possibly work. Does the Senator from Virginia have any thought about that?
