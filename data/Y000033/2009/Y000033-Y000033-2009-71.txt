Madam Speaker, today I introduce a bill that would provide Alaska Native Corporations (ANCs) with parity for an important tax incentive that promotes the permanent protection of land through the charitable donation of a conservation easement.  Primarily, conservation easements are administered under state laws while federal law offers tax benefits associated with them. Under present law, Internal Revenue Code, Section 170 allows taxpayers to take a deduction for charitable contributions of property through conservation easements.  In 2006, Congress enhanced the charitable tax deduction for conservation easements in order to further protect important habitats and encourage such gifts. Congress temporarily increased the maximum deduction limit for individuals making donations of qualified conservation easements from 30 percent to 50 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income. Contributions made by corporations are deductible for up to 10 percent of their income. In the case of a qualified farmer or rancher, the limitation was increased from 30 percent to 100 percent of taxable income.  Many farmers and ranchers are owners of ecologically significant open spaces, but often have limited income. The purpose of the deduction was to create an incentive by providing these farmers and ranchers with some measure of value commensurate to that of the conservation easement donation. Qualified farmers or ranchers are defined as non-publicly traded corporations or individuals whose gross income from the trade or business of farming is greater than 50 percent of the taxpayers gross income. The temporary rules were extended for two additional years by the recently enacted Farm Bill to contributions made before December 31, 2009.  Although subsistence-based Alaskan Native communities are similarly situated to the small communal family farms that are eligible, they are ineligible for these important new tax incentives because they are Federally chartered as C corporations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971 (ANCSA). Moreover, Alaska Native Corporations have insufficient gross income from the trade or business of farming to be eligible for the enhanced deduction.  Alaska Native communities continue to have a deeply symbiotic relationship with the land even today, relying on important food sources from Alaskan waters and lands. For many communities, with purchasing of food both costly and difficult, nearly 70 percent of food continues to come from the land.  Because conservation easements are the result of decades of statutory, regulatory, and case law, this legislation is crafted to ensure it does not change the underlying state law or the underlying federal tax law pertaining to conservation easements. A summary of the legislation follows.  The legislation modifies Internal Revenue Code, Section 170(b) (2) by inserting subparagraph (C), creating an exception that provides Alaska Native Corporations with a deduction for donations of certain qualified conservation easements.  Under Section 170(b)(2)(i), the maximum deduction limit would be set at 100 percent of the taxpayer's adjusted gross income.  If the taxpayer has deductions in excess of the applicable percentageof-income limitation, Section 170(b)(2) (ii) would allow the taxpayer to carry-forward the deduction for up to 15 years.  In order to be eligible, a qualified charitable conservation contribution must: (1) otherwise qualify under Section 170(h)(1); (2) be made by a Native Corporation; and (3) be land that was conveyed by ANCSA.  Section 170(b)(C)(IV) reiterates that this legislation is not meant to modify underlying state law or the underlying federal tax law in any way most notably regarding to existing property rights conveyed to ANC's through ANCSA. For example, while the easement would apply to the surface rights of the land, the Regional Corporation would continue to hold their subsurface rights and reserve their right to develop those resources through methods such as directional drilling.  The increased maximum deduction limit would apply to all contributions made in taxable years beginning January 1, 2009.  Under Alaskan law, all ANCs already have the ability to place conservation easements on their land, so communities that would like to ``tie up their land'' already posses the ability to do so. Additionally, current law affords eminent domain powers to governments for imposing corridors across easements. Moreover, courts have repeatedly held that lands subject to conservation easements are not protected from condemnation proceedings.  Expanding eligibility for the tax deduction for charitable donations of qualified conservation easements would give parity to Alaska Native Corporations, providing them with an incentive to permanently protect properties. In addition, the tax incentive would help provide the resources necessary to offset the costs of permanent protection.                          ____________________
