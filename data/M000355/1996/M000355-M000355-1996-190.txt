 Craig, Mr. Kempthorne, Mr.         Grassley, and Mr. Cochran):  S. 1975. A bill to amend the Competitive, Special, and Facilities Research Grant Act to provide increased emphasis on competitive grants to promote agricultural research projects regarding precision agriculture and to provide for the dissemination of the results of the research projects, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.    the precision agriculture research, education, and information                        dissemination act of 1996 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, today several colleagues and I are introducing the Precision Agriculture Research, Education, and Information Dissemination Act of 1996.  This legislation emphasizes research on precision agriculture technologies. These technologies are very existing and will enable the United States to maintain and augment our competitive edge in global agricultural markets. The legislation amends the Competitive, Special and Facilities Research Grant Act of 1965 by modifying the National Research Initiative [NRI] to give the Secretary of Agriculture authority to provide research, extension, and education competitive grants and programs that emphasize precision agriculture technologies and management practices.  This legislation represents a compromise between various interests. The bill is supported by the Fertilizer Institute, National Center for Resources Innovations, Experiment Station and Extension Service Directors, Lockheed Martin, and a consortium of other high tech companies.  An identical bill H.R. 3795 was introduced by Congressman Lewis and Congressman Crapo on July 11, 1996.  Precision agriculture technologies are rapidly advancing, and it is crucial that the agricultural community invest in this field of research so that all farmers will be able to benefit. This bill will not only increase the investment in precision agriculture, but it will also emphasize an educational process that will assist all farmers in adopting precision agriculture technologies and applications.  Emerging technologies in production agriculture are changing and improving the way farmers produce food and fiber in this country. New technologies such as global positioning satellites field mapping, georeference information systems, grid soil sampling, variable rate seeding and input applications, portable electronic pest scouting, on-the-go yield monitoring, and computerized field history and record keeping are just a few of the next generation technological tools in use today.  These technologies allow the agriculture producer to adjust hundreds of variables in the farm field, form soil pH to nutrient levels to crop yield, on a 2 foot by 2 foot grid that were previously far too costly to calculate for each field. Today, these technologies can map these variables and data instantaneously as an applicator or combine drives across the field. In short, each farm field using precision technology becomes a research pilot. And in the down months or winter season a farmer can collect the data from the previous growing season and adjust dozens of important agronomic variables to maximize the efficient use of all the farmers inputs: time, fuel, commercial inputs, seed rate, irrigation--the list goes on and on.  These precision farming tools are already proving to help farmers increase field productivity, improve input efficiency, protect the environment, maximize farm profitability and create computerized field histories that may help increase land values. Collectively, these and other emerging technologies are being used in a holistic, site-specific systems approach called precision agriculture. Progressive and production minded farmers are already using these technologies. In a decade, they may be as commonplace on the farm as air-conditioned tractor cabs and power steering.  Precision farming seems to offer great promise for improving production performance. Inherently, it just sounds very appealing to be able to evaluate production conditions on an individual square foot, yard, or acre basis rather than that of a whole field. It would seem that we should be able to treat any situation more appropriately thesmaller the plot we are considering. There have been great strides in measuring things on the basis of smaller and smaller units on the ground than we have ever realistically envisioned in the past. Measuring yields as we harvest. Being able to collect soil samples on a very small pilot basis and apply prescribed corrective measures ``on the go.'' All of these things are possible. They are being done on an experimental basis in many locations. Some producers have adopted the new technology and are using it.  Precision farming is, in its simplest sense, a management system for crop production that uses site-specific data to maximize yields and more efficiently use inputs. The technology is quickly gaining acceptance and use by producers, farm suppliers, crop consultants, and custom applicators.  Precision farming links the data-management abilities of computers with sophisticated farm equipment that can vary applications rates and monitor yields throughout a field.  Mr. President, the capabilities of precision agriculture technologies are rapidly increasing. The economic and environmental benefits of these technologies have not been fully realized. Increasing the use of these technologies and development of complementary new technologies will benefit American agriculture, the U.S. economy, and both domestic and global environmental concerns. In Kentucky, this type of research can help producers increase their yield while protecting environmental concerns such as water quality.                                 ______                                       By Mr. D'AMATO:  S. 1976. A bill to authorize the President to enter into a trade agreement concerning Northern Ireland and certain border counties of the Republic of Ireland, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.     The Northern Ireland Free Trade, Development and Security Act Mr. D'AMATO. Mr. President, I introduce the Northern Ireland Free Trade, Development and Security Act.  The resurgence of sectarian unrest that we have witnessed in the last weeks in Northern Ireland has seriously jeopardized the chances of a lasting peace in that province. The current uncertainty brought about by the recent confrontation between the Catholic and Protestant communities does not augur well for the prospect of a prosperous and progressive Northern Ireland adhering to the principles of democracy, restraint and mutual respect.  Throughout the six counties the ancient drums of a harsh and unbending history have been once again been replaced by the fierce and acrimonious sounds of cross community hatred. Shattering glass and car bombs have once more become part and parcel of daily life in parts of Northern Ireland.  Mr. President, voices throughout Ireland continually echo the need for restraint and reconciliation. These are the voices of Northern Ireland's future. Voices which for so long have fallen on deaf ears. These voices Mr. President must be heard. It is in everyones self-interest to go forward. It is in no ones self-interest to slow down the peace process. Sadly this process may have come to a grinding halt, sadly too, the good and honest people of Northern Ireland will once again be the victims of a tyranny of violence and intransigence. The legislation that I introduce today is a marker that says that the men and women of Ulster are not alone in this period of instability and hour of need. We must verify hope, not concede to dispair.  Mr. President, the Northern Ireland and Border Counties Free Trade, Development and Security Act, that I introduce today, is modeled on the Gaza/ West Bank Free Trade Act pending in this body. Both bills are based on the premise that a country or region that has a vibrant, growing and exporting economy requires underlying economic and social cohesion and cooperation. The legislation that I am introducing promises an open, liberalizing trade arrangement between Northern Ireland, the border counties of the Irish Republic and the United States. It will act as a primary inducement and incentive for indigenous Irish business to trade and flourish. This program will mean real jobs for the people of Northern Ireland, jobs that will prove to be crucial if the improvement of social and economic life in the North of Ireland is to be realized. In doing so, it will not only assist in revitalizing Northern Ireland's economy but it will help to rid Ulster of the religious and racial hatred which has plagued its people for more than 300 years.  Mr. President, the paradox of Northern Ireland is that she has given so much to other cultures and lands but has been incapable of fully reaping the rewards of her own peoples skills and strengths at home. The unfortunate reality is that as in the Republic of Ireland, a large majority of the North's highly educated and skilled younger generation has been forced to emigrate due to high unemployment levels which are as high as 70 percent in some areas. These disadvantaged areas are the ones which this legislation has been especially designed to target. Joint cooperation and joint economic development between the United States, Northern Ireland, and the European Union will integrate the most distressed parts of Northern Ireland and the border counties into a dynamic economy that--while firmly rooted in the European Union--continues to expand and cement new trading relatonships beneficial to all trading partners.  Mr. President the coming days in Northern Ireland will mean that serious risks will have to be taken. The way forward is not entirerly clear. Great strains have been placed between our good friends Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland. A close and harmonious relationship between these two nations is a necessary prerequisite to future progress in Northern Ireland. I would ask both of these close friends to join this effort to help forge a new and innovative way forward for their own citizens. Indeed current events call for new approaches, new modalities, and reinvigorated efforts.  To the men and women of Northern Ireland and the border counties, I say that your best days are in front of you. Stand steadfastly. Both communities can work together to create a future that will outshine Northern Ireland's dark but proud past and will significantly increase the prospects for the youth of Northern Ireland who hold the key to the success of this project. Take from your past the virtues of your forefathers--industry, faith, and imagination but leave behind the quarrels of other centuries. Just like the unity of Catholic and Protestant at the Somme, I ask that those heroic deeds be emanated. This time ahead will take courage, strength, and determination on all sides. I remind you once more you are not alone. As this country stood by you at the Somme this country stands by you now.  Northern Ireland's peace process must move forward and the aspirations and goodwill of the vast majority of its citizens must be accompanied by hard work and endeavour. The proposed establishment of a free trade area in these designated areas must be passed into legislation if the predicted 3,000 to 10,000 jobs are to be created. A more prosperous economy with more evenly spread and meaningful job opportunities can only serve to bridge the social and economic disparities that exist in this region. In conclusion this opportunity cannot be overlooked, after 25 years since the outbreak of the ``troubles,'' the people of Northern Ireland have suffered enough violence and depravity. Now it is time to embark on a rebuilding process that will give no chance to the terrorist but every chance to peace and reconciliation.                          ____________________
