Speaker, unless the Congress acts affirmatively by the end of next week, the Obama administration will turn over the core functions of the Internet to an international body. We cannot allow this to happen.  Look at the consequences. Using domain names, we have control over the protection of free speech on the Internet. One of the real positive things of the development of this type of technology over the last 45 or 50 years has been that people have been able to express themselves the way they want to on the Internet and be able to get a huge worldwide audience. Now, I recognize that there is no truth meter on the Internet, but people who make ridiculous statements on the Internet end up getting denigrated in the court of public opinion anyhow.  Free speech is at stake here, but also the national security of our country is at stake. The core functions of the Internet, including control over domain names, should not be turned over to countries that do not have America's best interests or values at heart, like China or Russia or Iran. They have no protections for free speech, they have no value for free speech, and they will do what they want to to put censorship on the Internet, particularly as a way of controlling their own population within their country. If we don't act, that is going to be something that happens, and I think we can guarantee it.  Stopping this move by the Obama administration will also ensure that the United States Government would maintain ownership and control over the dot-gov and dot-mil domain names. That is necessary to protect our national security.  Just think of what would happen if a hostile power like Iran would be able to get control of both the dot-gov and dot-mil domain names. They would be easier able to hack, they would be easier able to spread around propaganda and disinformation, and unwitting people would think that this is coming from the United States Government. How denigrating will that be? It will be huge, and I think we all know the answer to that.  Now, who is best able to protect a free and open Internet? It is the United States of America, with the protections that we have in our Bill of Rights. Those are protections that have made the Internet grow and flourish.  I tell the administration, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The Internet ain't broke, but it will become broken if we have countries that do not have our values and stick their nose into the governance of the core functions of the Internet. It is kind of like a termite. You don't see the danger right when the termite starts eating away, but if you allow it to start eating away and don't send the exterminator out, sooner or later there is going to be a big-time problem. Let's keep the termite of hostile powers who don't share our values out of getting into the Internet.  Congress must act affirmatively. We have to stop this from happening, and we don't have much time to do it.                          ____________________
