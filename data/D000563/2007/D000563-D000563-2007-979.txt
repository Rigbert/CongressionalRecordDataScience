President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation to designate the U.S. Post Office at 127 East Locust Street in Fairbury, IL, as the ``Dr. Francis Townsend Post Office Building.'' I am grateful to Senator Barack Obama, Mayor Robert Walter, Jr. and the Fairbury City Council for their support of this legislation.  This legislation honors Dr. Francis Townsend, the creator of the Townsend old-age revolving pension plan, and his hometown of Fairbury, IL, a town which will celebrate its sesquicentennial anniversary this June.  Dr. Francis E. Townsend, the son of a farmer, was born in January 1867. He became a physician and served in the Army Medical Corps during World War I. Following his retirement from medicine, Dr. Townsend developed an old-age pension plan for seniors during the Depression. The Townsend Plan created a Federal pension of $200 a month paid to every citizen age 60 and older, on the condition that the pensioner spend the entire sum within 30 days of receipt, in order to stimulate the economy.  Dr. Townsend advocated tirelessly around the country on behalf of his plan and encouraged 25 million Americans to sign petitions to the White House and to Congress demanding that the Federal Government institute a revolving old-age pension fund. It is likely that Townsend's efforts expedited passage of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Social Security Act, a major New Deal initiative. The Social Security Act included matching payments from the Federal Government, known as Old Age Assistance, and a national old-age annuity program. Though the initiative fell short of Dr. Townsend's vision, he continued to press for increased benefits to the elderly. Dr. Townsend's persistence helped to sustain the movement for increased elder benefits.  Dr. Francis Townsend, an innovator and social activist, was a pivotal figure in the antipoverty movement and became the leader of a social movement. I am pleased to introduce this legislation to permanently and publicly recognize Dr. Townsend by naming this post office in Fairbury in his honor. Given Dr. Townsend's dedication to his community and his commitment towards the improvement of society, the renaming of this post office would be a most appropriate way for us to express our appreciation to Dr. Townsend and to celebrate his contributions to our Nation's pension programs.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1352       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. DR. FRANCIS TOWNSEND POST OFFICE BUILDING.       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal      Service located at 127 East Locust Street in Fairbury,      Illinois, shall be known and designated as the ``Dr. Francis      Townsend Post Office Building''.       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation,      document, paper, or other record of the United States to the      facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be      a reference to the ``Dr. Francis Townsend Post Office      Building''.                                 ______                                       By
