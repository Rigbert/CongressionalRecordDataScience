Speaker, on October 6, 2004, the Committee on the Judiciary filed its report on H.R. 775, the ``Security and Fairness Enhancement for America Act of 2003.'' At that time, the Committee had not received a Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for the bill, and it filed the report with a committee cost estimate as provided in clause 3(d)(2) of rule XIII of the Rules of the House of Representatives. Subsequently, the Committee received the CBO cost estimate on H.R 775, and I am submitting it here for the Record.                                                 October 27, 2004.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Congressional Budget Office has      prepared the enclosed cost estimate for H.R. 775, the      Security and Fairness Enhancement Act of 2003.       If you wish further details on this estimate, we will be      pleased to provide them. The CBO staff contact is Joseph C.      Whitehill, who can be reached at 226-2840.           Sincerely,                                              Douglas Holtz-Eakin.       Enclosure     H.R. 775--Security and Fairness Enhancement Act of 2003       Summary: H.R. 775 would eliminate the diversity immigrant      program. The costs of implementing that program are covered      by fees charged to winning applicants in a lottery for a      limited number of immigrant visas. The fees are credited to      State Department and Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration      Services (CIS) accounts as offsetting collections and      offsetting receipts, respectively. (Offsetting collections      are a credit against discretionary spending, while offsetting      receipts are a credit against direct spending.)       CBO estimates that enacting the bill would decrease      collections and spending by the Department of State and the      CIS; however, changes in net spending by those agencies would      not be significant. Enacting H.R. 775 would lower the number      of persons eligible for food stamps and Medicaid benefits.      CBO estimates spending for those programs would be reduced by      $164 million over the 2005-2014 period. Enacting the bill      would not affect revenues.       Each year, the Department of State issues about 50,000      immigrant visas under the diversity immigrant program to      natives of foreign states which the U.S. Attorney General      determines have had a low ratio of immigrants admitted under      the other sections of the immigration law. The immigrants are      selected randomly by the Secretary of State from among      persons who submit applications in a special lottery for the      visas. Persons apply in one fiscal year for visas to be      issued in the coming fiscal year. Applicants must meet      minimum requirements for education or work experience and      otherwise be eligible for immigrant visas as specified in the      Immigration and Nationality Act. Those selected in the      diversity lottery must obtain their visas by the end of the      fiscal year covered by the lottery.       H.R. 775 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector      mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act      (UMRA); CBO estimates that states would save about $45      million in Medicaid costs over the 2005-2014 period.       Estimated cost to the Federal Government: The estimated      budgetary impact of H.R. 775 is shown in the following table.      The costs of this legislation fall within budget functions      550 (health) and function 600 (income security). In addition,      the bill would have an insignificant effect on net spending      in budget function 150 (international affairs) and budget      function 750 (administration of justice).--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                                        By fiscal year, in millions of dollars--                                                               -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                                  2005     2006     2007     2008     2009     2010     2011     2012     2013     2014--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                               CHANGES IN DIRECT SPENDING Estimated Budget Authority....................................        *       -1       -3       -4       -5       -9      -18      -29      -41      -54Estimated Outlays.............................................        *       -1       -3       -4       -5       -9      -18      -29      -41     -54--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Note.--* = less than $500,000.       Basis of estimate: For this estimate, CBO assumes the bill      will be enacted before the end of the calendar year 2004 and      that the restrictions on issuing new visas will take effect      immediately. By eliminating the diversity visa lottery, H.R.      775 would decrease the number of immigrants who become legal      permanent residents by about 44,000 each year--not all      persons selected immigrate to the United States within the      period in which the visas are valid. Fewer permanent legal      residents would, over time, lower the enrollment for benefits      under the Food Stamp and Medicaid programs and thus lower      estimated spending for those programs.     Food Stamps       While adult immigrants have a five-year waiting period for      benefits, legal permanent residents under the age of 18 are      automatically eligible for food stamps. CBO estimates that      there will be about 440,000 fewer legal permanent residents      over the 10-year period. Based on data from the Current      Population Survey on participation by noncitizens before the      changes in eligibility that were enacted in 1996, CBO      estimates that by 2009, 4,000 fewer children would receive      food stamps. Overall, CBO estimates that by 2014 about 23,000      fewer people would receive food stamps. Food Stamp program      costs would decrease by $13 million over the 2005-2009 period      and $105 million over the 2009-2014 period.     Medicaid       By decreasing the number of legal permanent residents, H.R.      775 would reduce the number of individuals enrolling in the      Medicaid program. Under Medicaid law, immigrants entering the      United States after August 22, 1996, are subject to a five-     year ban from receiving Medicaid coverage. CBO expects that      certain participants in the diversity visa program (mainly      children, pregnant women, and some disabled people) will      qualify for Medicaid five years after entering the United      States. CBO estimates that by 2014, about 9,000 fewer people      would receive Medicaid than under current law and that      federal Medicaid spending would decrease by about $59 million      over the 2010-2014 period.     State Department       Applicants pay no fee for submitting an application to the      Department of State for the special lottery; however, there      is a $100 special processing fee payable to the Department of      State by persons whose entries are selected and processed at      a U.S. consulate. The applicants must also pay the regular      visa fees at the time of visa issuance. The special      processing fee generates about $5 million in offsetting      collections for the Department of State each year. The bill      would lower collections by the Department of State, but      spending would also decline by the amount of forgone      collections.     Bureau of Citizenship and Immigration Services       The CIS currently charges fees totaling $385 to register      each selected applicant as a permanent U.S. resident. CBO      estimates that CIS collects and spends about $20 million      annually in fees from diversity immigrants--a small fraction      of more than $1 billion in fees the agency collects and      spends each year to administer programs relating to the entry      of aliens. CBO estimates that eliminating the diversity visa      program would reduce fee collections by about $20 million      annually, but that spending would also decrease by an      equivalent amount, so there would be no significant net      budgetary effect.       Estimated impact on State, local, and tribal governments:      H.R. 775 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in      UMRA. By decreasing the number of legal permanent residents      in the United States, the bill would reduce the number of      individuals enrolling in the Medicaid program. CBO estimates      that the change would result in a savings for states of about      $45 million over the 2005-2014 period.       Estimated impact on the private sector: The bill contains      no new private-sector mandates as defined in UMRA.       Estimate prepared by: Federal Costs: State Department:      Joseph C.
