I have purchased both handguns and long guns that way. I have had them shipped from out of State to a gun dealer in my own State.  What I am concerned about--and the question I raised yesterday and theSenator from Idaho, apparently by this redrafting, feels I raised a valid question yesterday--at the end of this, you say:       A qualified civil liability action that is pending on the      date of enactment of this subsection shall be dismissed      immediately by the court.  Does this contemplate some cases that are now pending?
