President, I rise today in support of the Collins-Reed amendment to the Labor HHS Appropriations bill which will increase the availability of funds to provide substance abuse treatment services for our Nation's homeless men and women.  I would like to extend my thanks to Senator Jack Reed who has joined as a cosponsor of this amendment and who has made increased funding for services to benefit the homeless one of his highest priorities. I would also like to extend my thanks to Senators Domenici, Feinstein, Mikulski, Sarbanes, Jeffords, Kennedy, Bingaman, Wellstone, Lincoln Chafee, Dodd, Leahy, Durbin, Snowe, Edwards and Moynihan, all of whom cosigned a letter to appropriators which I and Senator Reed sent earlier this year calling for an increase in funding for mental health and substance abuse treatment for the homeless.  Like all Americans, homeless men and women need decent shelter, but in many cases, homeless people also need treatment to address the underlying problem which has kept them on the street. An estimated 25 percent to 40 percent of homeless people need programs to help them recover from drug and alcohol abuse illnesses. Despite the prevalence of these illnesses among our nation's homeless, very limited funds are available to serve their specific treatment needs.  For a variety of reasons, addicted homeless people often have difficulty accessing mainstream treatment services. For example, many substance abuse service providers are not equipped to handle the complex social and health issues that homeless persons present, and may reject them or provide ineffective care. In addition, the reality of life on the street may significantly complicate the receipt of effective treatment. For example, homeless men and women may have difficulty in adhering to treatment schedules or may lack transportation to and from outpatient services.  Comprehensive programs which link treatment to other health, housing, social and maintenance services often provide the best opportunity for the homeless to adhere to treatment programs and ultimately achieve stability in their lives. The funding addressed in my amendment will provide grants which will assist communities in providing treatment services tailored to best serve the needs of their own homeless population.  I thank the Chairman of the Committee, who has been tireless in his efforts to increase substance abuse treatment services for all Americans in need, and who has been so receptive to this amendment and the needs of our Nation's homeless men and women.  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.                           amendment no. 3701   (Purpose: To provide funds for the Web-Based Education Commission)       On Page 68, line 23 before the colon, insert the following:      ``, of which $250,000 shall be for the Web-Based Education      Commission''.                                  ____                           amendment no. 3702   (Purpose: To provide funds for the purchase of automated external  defibrillators and the training of individuals in basic cardiac life                                 support)       On page 24, line 1, strike ``and''.       On page 24, line 7, insert before the colon the following:      ``, and of which $4,000,000 shall be provided to the Rural      Health Outreach Office of the Health Resources and Services      Administration for the awarding of grants to community      partnerships in rural areas for the purchase of automated      external defibrillators and the training of individuals in      basic cardiac life support''.
