 President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous consent that the injunction of secrecy be removed from the following treaty transmitted to the Senate on September 28, 2005, by the President of the United States: Protocol Amending the Tax Convention with France (Treaty Document No. 109-4). I further ask unanimous consent that the treaty be considered as having been read the first time, that it be referred, with accompanying papers, to the Committee on Foreign Relations and ordered to be printed, and that the President's message be printed in the Record.
