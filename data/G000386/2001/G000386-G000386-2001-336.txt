m., Thursday, so you have not had a chance to take into consideration what he proposes to provide for the State treasuries at the expense of the Federal Treasury.  What Senator Graham has not shared is that his zeal to protect the State treasuries is at the expense of the American taxpayer and, most importantly, the estate tax reform provisions in this bill.  If you would read from his amendment: Beginning on page 64 strike through page 66. What that really says is: Strike all estate tax reductions. Strike all State death tax changes and slash the unified credit.  We may have heard from Governors, obviously, on this. Do we believe that the Governors really believe our bipartisan death tax reform package should be slashed for the mere convenience of State treasuries?  Do we really believe that the American taxpayer with estates between $2 million and $4 million should accept the burden of funding the States' coffers merely because the States have already drafted a budget and they do not want to get around to drafting another budget for a couple years?  I ask that you kill this amendment.
