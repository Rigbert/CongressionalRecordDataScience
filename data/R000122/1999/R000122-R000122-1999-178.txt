 Mr. McCAIN. In all due respect to my friend from Virginia, he knows where that California and Texas thing came from. It didn't come from the bowels of the Pentagon; it came from the White House. That is why, as he knows, we are saying this Commission should only convene after there is a new President of the United States.
