That was the day after the horrendous attack on our Nation. It was the only time in my 33 years here that I can remember the public galleries being closed. There was an unprecedented amount of security around the Capitol. But every Senator came onto the floor of the Senate that day. We wanted to indicate to the world that this symbol of democracy would not close. I especially rememberthat the closed visitors galleries, however, contained two people: former Ambassador James Spain and my wife Marcelle.  This memory, and so many more, came back to me in January of this year when Ambassador Spain's son Stephen informed me that my dear friend Jim had died on January 2 in Wilmington, NC.  It is hard to think of anyone in public life I have met during my years as a Senator who is as memorable as Jim Spain. He has touched me with his dignity, his sense of humanity, and his honesty as no one else could. He was the truest of public servants--one who cared for his country and those his position influenced actually more than he cared for himself.  I first met Jim decades ago when he was the Ambassador to Turkey and I visited him in Ankara. Even though Turkey was under military rule at that time, he invited people from across the political spectrum to meet with the two of us at his residence. It was there I saw the abilities of one of the finest Ambassadors to ever represent our great country as he brought these sometimes adversaries together to talk in what he called his ``game room'' or play room.  Turkey was under a dusk-to-dawn curfew at that time, but I had to leave in the middle of the night to get back to the United States. Jim arranged for a military escort to take me and to open the airport so that my military plane I was using could leave. I still remember ``His Excellency,'' as so many of the Turks called him, waving goodbye from his front door in his pajamas, his bathrobe, and his slippers about 2 a.m.  We kept in close touch when he returned to Washington, through his ambassadorship in Sri Lanka and later retirement. He and Marcelle and I once sat up talking half the night when he was a guest in our house. After every one of these meetings, I would tell others that I felt I had been with a close member of my own family and my conscience had been touched in a very special and very helpful way.  I wish every member of the Foreign Service could read Ambassador Spain's book entitled ``In Those Days.'' I was privileged to write, along with John Kenneth Galbraith and Father Andrew Greeley, a cover blurb for that book. In my blurb I said:       From boyhood glimpses of a strutting Al Capone, to post-war      Japan, a stint with the CIA, and a fascinating foreign      service career--this is a life worth living. History is      shaped by extraordinary people like Ambassador Spain. His      Irish eloquence makes the difficult look easy while his      humanity touches your soul.  Another wrote:       Jim Spain's contribution in assisting CIA Director Allen      Dulles to make President Eisenhower get the pronunciation of      Prime Minister Nehru's first name right during the latter's      official visit to Washington is a typical foreign service      moment. ``Heady stuff for a 28-year-old,'' noted Jim Spain.  Even today I cannot pronounce former Prime Minister Nehru's first name correctly. I cannot think of the number of times when traveling with Ambassador Spain he whispered in my ear to make sure I got the names correct.  In the end, it was his humanity that touched us all. It was as though his great intelligence and ability was only the pedestal to allow the humanity to shine through.  Tissa Jayatilaka--and I do wish Ambassador Spain was here to make sure I come anywhere close to pronouncing this name correctly--wrote:       News reached us over the weekend past that Jim Spain's time      on earth had run out. Heaven knows this world of ours cannot      afford to do without human beings of his caliber and yet      there is only so much that an individual can do for humanity      before he, too, moves unto the dusty descend.       Ambassador Spain was one of the most decent, gentle,      caring, and perceptive human beings I have known to-date.       He was unfailingly generous and kind to his fellow-     companions on this bittersweet journey on earth that we      travel on for a while. It was indeed a privilege to have      worked with him briefly and shared a long and fruitful      friendship with him thereafter.       I first came to know him during my days in The Colombo Plan      Bureau in the 1980s. He had arrived in Colombo some time in      1985 to head the U.S. Mission here. Until then, Sri Lanka was      the only South Asian country he had not lived in before.       He was to make up for this in the years ahead, when in      1989, consequent to his retirement from the U.S. foreign      service, he made Sri Lanka his home.       This decision of Ambassador Spain was all the more      remarkable because the last several years of the 80s was a      period when most Sri Lankans were seeking to run away from      their land of birth.       Jim Spain not only stayed behind, but also did a great deal      discreetly to assist this beleaguered country of ours to save      itself from self-destruction.  This person goes on to write:        . . . It was several years later that I came to know that      only a couple of years prior to his coming to Colombo that      Ambassador Spain himself had suffered a monumental personal      loss.       Consequent to a memorable family reunion after some years      during Thanksgiving 1983 at a resort in West Virginia, Jim      Spain, his wife Edith and daughter Sikandra bade farewell to      their sons and brothers Patrick, William and Stephen and      began to wend their way through country roads back to      Washington.       Near Leesburg, Virginia, their light fiber-glass car was      hit by a huge old station wagon going 85 miles per hour,      driven by a local football player who was not wearing the      glasses his license prescribed. He was not even scratched,      but the Spains had to be evacuated to the Washington Hospital      Trauma Center by helicopter.       By next morning, Sikandra was dead, Edith was clinging to      life in an intensive-care unit and Jim was immobilized with a      variety of fractures and bruises.       A few weeks later, Edith died.       With the help of his sons and his strong spirituality, Jim      Spain bore his irreparable loss with fortitude.  I read all that into the Record so my colleagues would know what a man he was.  I have lost a good friend. Marcelle and I send our condolences to his sons Patrick, Stephen, and William; their wives, Barbara, Beth, and Anu; to his grandchildren Jeanne, James, Aidan, Katherine, and Rachel; and to all within his family.  For my part, I know I have gained more from knowing him than I could ever say.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Ambassador Spain's biography.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Ambassador Spain was born in 1926 in Chicago, Illinois,      where he attended St. Brendan's Parochial School and Quigley      Seminary where his classmates included priest/author Andrew      Greeley and ``Vatican Banker'' Paul Marcinkus. He received a      masters degree from the University of Chicago and a PhD from      Columbia University.       Ambassador Spain served in World War II, for a time serving      on General Douglas MacArthur's staff as a photographer in      occupied Japan. He entered the Foreign Service in 1951, and      spent the entirety of his career in government service. His      assignments took him to Pakistan, Turkey, Tanzania, the UN,      and Sri Lanka.       His first post was as Vice Consul in Karachi in 1951.      Following that he returned to the U.S. where he lived, mostly      in Washington, DC, until 1969. He was appointed as Charge      d'Affaires to Pakistan in 1969, Consul General in Istanbul      from 1970-1972, Deputy Chief of Mission in Ankara (1972-     1974), Ambassador to Tanzania (1975-1979) and Deputy      Ambassador to the United Nations under Andrew Young briefly      in 1979, Ambassador to Turkey from 1980-1981, and finally as      Ambassador to Sri Lanka from 1985-1988. He retired as a      Career Minister in the Foreign Service and remained in Sri      Lanka until 2006, when he returned to the United States. He      has been living in Wilmington, NC since then.       He was the author of numerous books, including In Those      Days, American Diplomacy in Turkey, The Way of the Pathans,      Pathans of the Latter Day, and a series of novels featuring      Dodo Dillon. He contributed articles on foreign affairs to a      variety of publications.       Ambassador Spain lived a distinguished life of service to      his country and dedication to his friends and family. He was      a remarkably able diplomat who drew on his own odyssey from      an impoverished youth on the South Side of Chicago--the son      of a streetcar conductor and a seamstress who were Irish      immigrants--to attending receptions with Presidents and Prime      Ministers to inspire those around him to seek the best for      themselves and their country. He met adversity with strength,      rudeness with grace, and challenges with enthusiasm. He      played pivotal roles in maintaining and strengthening the      United States alliance with Turkey, in bringing about a      peaceful transition to majority rule in Zimbabwe, and      strengthening the United States' relations with all the      countries of the subcontinent. He was most proud not of the      headlines that he had a part in, but of the headlines that      never had to be written, thanks to his work defusing tensions      between nations.       One of his earliest memories of Chicago was being taken by      his father to watch Al Capone walk through City Hall. His      glimpse of the legendary gangster impressed many, among them      Jawarlahal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, who once      held up a reception line just to hear about it.       James W. Spain, 81, died on January 2, 2008 of natural      causes in Wilmington, NC.       He was very pleased to have outlived Sen. Jesse Helms of      North Carolina, but sorely     disappointed not to have lived to see the next Democrat in      the White House.       He was preceded in death by his beloved wife Edith and      daughter Sikandra. He is survived by his sons, Patrick,      Stephen and William and his grandchildren, Jeanne, James,      Aidan, Katherine, and Rachel.                          ____________________
