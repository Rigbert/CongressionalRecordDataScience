Speaker, let us talk a little bit about phony baselines, which is where the gentleman on the other side of the aisle left off before the time expired. That is a funny place here inside the Beltway in Washington, DC.  The Pentagon gets its own special baseline. That is, at the Pentagon things are very expensive, you know, over there at the Pentagon. So they get not only the inflation that seniors get on Social Security or the inflation that anybody else might think about, they get their own special inflation index. And at the Pentagon a cut is a decrease in the increase.  So say next year the Pentagon determines its own little special inflation index is 6 percent. If they only get a 5 percent increase in their $271 billion budget, that is if they only get an increase around $11 billion, if they only get $10 billion, that is a decrease, and we would hear screams from that side of the aisle. We heard screams earlier.  We have appropriated more money for the Pentagon this year. God forbid we should ask them to produce something. It costs extra.  We had to come up with a supplemental bill to pay for the Pentagon to do something. They couldn't squeeze it out of their $271 billion budget.  Now with the nutrition programs, of course, they apply a different ruler. That is, are there going to be more kids going to school next year? Yes; is food going to be more expensive next year? Yes.  There might even be a little bit of an increase in the wages for the people who cook those meals in the schools. A lot of them are getting minimum wage, and if we increase the minimum wage they will get a little bit more. Now in their world those increases don't count. Only increases in inflation for the Pentagon count.  So here is the world we are looking at. We know there will be more kids in school. We know there will be more need for those kids.  I visited a school lunch last week and talked about it last Monday night on the floor. So I won't repeat the stories about how hungry those kids are on Mondays and Fridays and what the needy really is. But the point is, in their world we will only give them enough money to increase it just a little bit. And if there are more kids, the portions get smaller. Or if there are more kids, ketchup becomes a vegetable again, whatever. We are just--can't afford those things.  But we can afford an infinite amount of money for the Pentagon. That is what is wrong with this debate. Let's put our priorities in order here. This debate is about priorities.  What will make America stronger tomorrow? Is it hungry kids who can't learn because we cut back on the school lunch program, the school breakfast program? Or is it imaginary programs like star wars and the fat defense contractors taking people out to dinner every night on the Federal budget, which we all know goes on with these Pentagon lobbyists.  So I would like to put it in that perspective. And let's just remember, when it comes to the Pentagon, a decrease and an increase is a cut, but when it comes to school lunches, a decrease in a real need is not a cut.  That is what the Republicans are trying to feed us here. It is about as real as feeding people ketchup and calling it a vegetable  They talk a lot about the bureaucrats. I checked that out. I was disturbed about that. I thought, well, maybe they are right.  We could eliminate some of these administrative cuts if we eliminated every administrator. That is from the woman who runs the program downtown here in Washington, DC., down to the person who takes the little lunch tickets, to the person who cooks in the school. That is if Congress could miraculously appropriate the money and deliver the food straight to the kids with no one in between. That would be one-eighth of the cuts the Republicans are making in the real needs of these programs.  So it is a lie. It is a lie to say we just want to eliminate the bureaucrats. No, you can't just eliminate the bureaucrats. Where are you going to get the other seven-eighths of your cut?  The gentleman, Mr. Olver, made a great point. How is it they can talk about $7 billion, ``b'', billion dollars, in savings in school nutrition programs, WIC programs and other children's nutrition programs and then tell us there aren't any cuts.  I would like to make $7 billion in savings over at the Pentagon, and I would be happy to tell the Pentagon that those things don't constitute cuts. But we would hear screams from that side of the aisle because it is a different standard. It is a different ruler when it comes to kids. They come after the Pentagon.                          ____________________
