 President, I take a moment to pay tribute to David Hermance, who died in a tragic plane crash on November 25. David was the North American executive engineer for Advanced Technology Vehicles at Toyota.  Many Americans may not know David's name, but they know his work. He was one of the most well- respected environmentalists in America. He was a pioneer--called the Father of the American Prius--who worked tirelessly to help explain the workings and benefits of hybrid and other advanced technology vehicles.  David was an outspoken and passionate advocate. He championed advanced technology vehicles throughout his career at General Motors and Toyota and he earned a well-deserved reputation for being the most authoritative voice in America on hybrid technology. He helped me and many others better understand this new technology and its potential for creating a more sustainable future and a healthier world.  David was instrumental in raising awareness about the importance of these new technologies to help protect our environment. His death is a loss for us all.                          ____________________
