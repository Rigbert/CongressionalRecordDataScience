 President, we have had forest fires raging in the West for a number of years, and this year it finally hit in a big State--California--and destroyed the home of the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Finally, it got the attention of large numbers of Americans, including Members of this body.  With all due respect to my friend from Nevada, the way we do legislation is we appoint conferees and the House and Senate work out their differences. I hope some time before we are out of session this year we will be able to follow the normal legislative procedure and give the conferees a chance to reconcile the differences between the House and the Senate and move forward on this most important issue, because it is not going away. It is going to continue to be a problem summer after summer.
