I think our leadership and the Chairs of committees are prepared and ready to work with your side and to work with the President in finding a way to cut waste.  I must say to you, my friend, while $100 million may be only a small fraction of the overall Federal budget, I remind you that it is $100 million more than the previous administration cut in 8 years, with the help of the Republican-controlled Congress. In fact, with the Republicans, we went from a surplus of $5.6 trillion to a deficit of $4.5 trillion, a turnaround of almost $10 trillion.  We are going to work with you. We are prepared to do what we can to work in a bipartisan fashion to cut waste and to save the taxpayers' dollars.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. Well, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman. And I will tell you, $100 million, when I look at the budget being passed, in a few short years I think of my children and America paying $1 billion in interest a day. I know the American people care as much about their children as I care about mine, and we do not want that to continue.  So I take your hand being out to us in bipartisanship, and I look forward to working with you that we can eliminate waste. I look forward that we can come together with this President and bring it to the floor before Memorial Day. I think there is a way we can reach for greatness; there is a way that we can come together.  Another area that I think we can work well together on is trade. House Republicans stand ready to work with this President. This President has signaled his desire to have a vote on the Panama trade agreement and to begin moving forward with the Colombia free trade. I even know the leadership on the majority side, Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, during the last recess he traveled to Panama, he traveled to Colombia.  So my question to the House Democrats, would there be an opportunity to have a vote before the July 4 recess on the Panama trade agreement that the President asked to have? I yield.
