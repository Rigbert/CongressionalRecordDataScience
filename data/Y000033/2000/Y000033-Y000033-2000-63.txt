Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, S. 503, the Spanish Peaks Wilderness Act of 1999, was introduced by Senator Wayne Allard and will simply add the Spanish Peaks area to a list of areas designated as wilderness by the Colorado Wilderness Act of 1993.  I would like to take a moment to commend my esteemed colleague, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. McInnis), for all his diligent work on the House version of this legislation, H.R. 898. H.R. 898 passed through the subcommittee and full committee by a voice vote. However, in the interest of time we are considering the Senate version today. Therefore, I urge all Members to support passage of S. 503, the Spanish Peaks Wilderness Act of 2000, under suspension of the rules.  Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.
