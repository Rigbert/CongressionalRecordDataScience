Mr. Speaker, yesterday I introduced the Save the Summers Act of 2004, which will temporarily increase the cap on the number of skilled overseas workers allowed into the United States. For the first time and without advance warning, the Department of Homeland Security announced that the cap of 66,000 H-2B visas had been reached just six months into the current year--leaving summer employers stranded. This one-year emergency fix will increase the number of H-2B visas by 40,000 for fiscal year 2004 only. This bill will also require that the Department of Homeland Security provide Congress with quarterly reports on the number of H-2B visas issued and an annual report providing a statistical analysis of the program.  The H-2B visa program allows foreign workers to come to the U.S. for short periods of time (up to 10 months) to fill seasonal or temporary jobs. The fishing industry in Alaska, tourist and resort industry along much of the East Coast, the Upper Midwest, and the Rockies, swimming pool management companies across America, catfish, timber and sugar industries in Louisiana, crab processors in North Carolina, and the shrimp industry in Texas are just a few that depend on the H2-B program to bring in needed workers.  Fishing in Alaska supports nearly 20,000 jobs, and is estimated to be a billion dollar-a-year industry with nearly 700 million dollars-a-year in exports. The processors and vessel owners rely on these temporary workers who are Japanese technicians specifically trained to the standards required for Alaska Ikuro products to be sold in the Japanese market. Their skills are not otherwise available in the Alaska or U.S. labor pool and they are not taking work from U.S. workers. My state relies on these workers and I believe the H-2B visa program is vital to the survival and economic growth of the fishing industry in Alaska. The potential for lost revenue in Alaska is extremely high if the industry does not have these skilled technicians to aid with the processing.  This is a serious matter that requires immediate legislative action. I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives for their support and urge them to swiftly pass this emergency legislation, which directly affects the economy in many of our districts.                          ____________________
