Speaker, I think the leader is right. I think for that to happen lightning is going to have to strike.  Lastly, Mr. Leader, we talked about the intelligence bill being on the floor next week. Can the minority be assured that we will have a substitute for that bill? The gentleman indicated there are 100 amendments pending on the Senatefloor. This is a very important piece of legislation, obviously. The bipartisan commission has spoken to this.  I have read the report, by the way. I think it is an excellent report. We are very hopeful that we not only will have the opportunity to amend any and all sections of the bill, but that we will have the opportunity to offer a substitute, not just simply a motion to recommit, but a substitute at the appropriate time. I would hope that the leader, given the importance of this legislation, would assure the minority that we would have that opportunity.  Mr. Speaker, I continue to yield to my friend.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. As the gentleman knows, the chairman of the Committee on Rules is sitting here. I think he is going to make an announcement about amendments and substitutes.
