Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the DeLay amendment. Mr. Chairman, let me just read a statement: ``As it currently stands, the Rome Treaty could expose service members and the government officials of nonparty states to criminal liability based on politically-motivated charges brought by other states that object to the nonparty state's international policies.''  Mr. Chairman, that statement was made last year by Secretary of Defense Cohen on behalf of the Clinton administration. I think Members do not fully realize that this process has gone on for years. We have held hearings in the full International Relations Committee on this. There are serious flaws. Just as we saw with the U.N. Human Rights Commission, rogue states are now in charge of and acting as the ``conscience of humanity,'' to quote the chief of that commission. We are talking about the Sudan and China, and countries like Cuba. They now will sit with the black robes on and will judge our peacekeepers.  I support ad hoc tribunals, but this grant of authority in the Rome Treaty goes far beyond that.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment offered by my good friend, Tom DeLay. I was an original cosponsor of the American Servicemen's Protection Act introduced by Mr. Tom DeLay in the last Congress. This important amendment would prohibit U.S. cooperation with the International Criminal Court (including restrictions on U.S. military participation in UN peacekeeping operations and the transfer of U.S. classified national security information, and the provision of U.S. military assistance, to the Court). The amendment also authorizes the President to use all means necessary to bring about the release of U.S. military personnel and certain other persons held captive by or on behalf of the Court.  I am reminded of the raging debate which occurred at the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly meeting last year regarding the International Criminal Court. Our European allies were lambasting the United States, among others, for not supporting the Rome Statute of the ICC. The final text of the OSCE PA resolution in fact called on ``all member States to ratify the Rome Statute of the future International Criminal Court without delay.'' Members of the U.S. delegation to the OSCE PA (which I led) expounded on the provisions which were most problematic. In the waning days of the Clinton administration, he did sign the Rome Statute. I would warn the Bush administration about the serious pitfalls of the ICC, and I would encourage the President to not seek ratification of the Treaty.  At the end of World War II, many people urged the creation of a permanent and independent international war crimes tribunal as a mechanism to deter future violations and to punish those responsible for committing systematic war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. It was envisioned as a permanent court in The Hague with the authority to prosecute suspected perpetrators of war crimes. The statute that ultimately emerged from the Rome negotiations in 1998, however, includes provisions which I believe would create unacceptable risks for the United States.  The subject matter jurisdiction of the Court includes crimes against humanity, war crimes, genocide, and ``aggression.'' But during the negotiations on the treaty, negotiators were unable to agree on a definition of ``aggression.'' This is particularly significant because the Nuremberg Tribunal used the term ``war of aggression'' in its charges against Nazi Germany, not the term ``aggression.'' In fact, acts of aggression by states already fall within the mandate of the U.N. Security Council and it is completely unclear what will be considered acts of aggression by individuals. States that have already ratified this treaty have bought a pig in a poke.  The jurisdiction of the ICC can extend to citizens of states which are not party to the Treaty. This is particularly troublesome when you consider the possibility of U.S. military personnel stationed in a country party to the ICC--or serving on a UN peacekeeping mission--being subject to the investigation and prosecution of the ICC even though the U.S. has not, and hopefully will not, become a party to the Treaty. This, in fact, is the provision to which the amendment being offered by Mr. DeLay is directed.  Article 120 of the Statute forbids reservations to the ICC Treaty. Thus, the United States or any other country would have to either accept or reject the treaty in its entirety. In light of the problems I have alluded to, I believe that rejecting the ICC in its entirety is the only reasonable course open to the United States at this time.  During the negotiations on the ICC Treaty, the effort by the United States to limit the application of the Court's jurisdiction over non-States Parties was squelched by the successful passage of a non-action vote requested by Norway. The United States also sought to curb the broad powers of the Court to prosecute the military personnel of UN Members States which are not party to the ICC Treaty but we were rebuffed.   Mr. Chairman, let's consider for a moment the potential effects of the International Criminal Court should 60 States ratify the Treaty and should the ICC have the force of international law. Some supporters of the ICC have belittled concern that the United States--or other countries, for that matter--might find itself the target of politically driven prosecutions. But consider, for a moment, the reaction in some quarters to the use of force by NATO against Serbia in 1999. Serbia is suing eight NATO countries before the International Court of Justice right now for their participation in the NATO campaign; there are also charges by Serbian citizens that have been brought against 15 NATO countries before the European Court of Justice. More troubling are the accusations that were leveled by a group of lawyers from several countries who sought to have some 60 government officials from NATO countries, including NATO's Supreme Commander Gen. Wesley Clark, charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The accusations included ``willful killing, willfully causing great suffering or serious injury to body or health, extensive destruction of property, not justified by military necessity, and carried out unlawfully and wantonly, employment of poisonous weapons or other weapons to cause unnecessary suffering.''       Human rights organizations raised concerns about NATO's      attack on TV and radio transmission facilities, dropping      cluster bombs and destroying power plants inside Serbia.      Others argued that NATO's rules of engagement, which called      for pilots to fly high out of range of Serbian missiles,      endangered civilians and were thus ``clearly prohibited under      international humanitarian law.'' Ironically, many of the      same groups that had urged intervention to stop and prevent      further atrocities in Kosovo quickly denounced NATO for its      action. While I respect human rights groups that have raised      legitimate questions about the conduct of the campaign, some      NATO critics have clearly revealed a knee-jerk anti-American      sentiment in their accusations. For the record, the Chief      Prosecutor of the Yugoslav Tribunal considered the materials      submitted to her regarding NATO actions and declined to      pursue charges against any NATO officials.  Inevitably, if the U.S. assumes a leadership role in maintaining peace and security and promoting human rights around the globe, the enemies of peace, security and human rights will continue to seek ways to undermine our efforts. Unfortunately, the current ICC statute does not provide sufficient safe-guards against the initiation of politically motivated prosecutions.  The concerns raised by the United States regarding the Rome Statute are well-founded and I urge my colleagues to support fully the amendment offered by Mr. DeLay. This will help provide a modicum of protection for our men and women in uniform who may be serving on the territory of a country which has ratified the Treaty.                    The International Criminal Court  hearings before the committee on international relations, house of  representatives, one hundred sixth congress, second session, july 25                               and 26, 2000     Selected Excerpts--Page 37       Mr. Smith of New Jersey. The concept of a permanent      International Criminal Court charged with prosecuting the      gravest of crimes against humanity is not a new one. The idea      was proposed and dismissed after the conclusion of the      Nuremberg and Tokyo War Crime Tribunals that followed World      War II.       In recent years the idea has gained new momentum, driven      largely by memories of the horrific crimes committed in      Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. I share the ideals of many      ICC supporters. If we could construct an entity that would      impartially prosecute only genocidal tyrants and war      criminals I would support it without hesitation, but we do      not inhabit an ideal world. The difficulty is in devising a      system that will prosecute Pol Pot, but not President      Clinton, that will indict Ratko Mladic but not Norman      Schwartzkopf.       I am concerned that the Rome Statute of the International      Criminal Court fails to accomplish that goal and that it is      susceptible to serious abuse and manipulation.       As it took form, the draft statute ballooned from an      instrument focused on well-established war crimes into an      encyclopedia of still-emerging human rights law. The      resulting statute is a 30,000 word document that covers 77      pages. It contains sweeping language that leaves many      elements of vaguely defined crimes up to the imagination of      international lawyers.       For example, according to article VI the crime of genocide      includes, ``causing serious mental harm'' to members of a,      ``national, ethnic, racial or religious group.''       It is true that similar language is contained in the      Convention against Genocide, but the United States took a      reservation to the jurisdiction of the World Court over the      definition of genocide. This is not because we intend to      commit genocide, but because the United States was      unwilling to surrender its sovereignty to a body that      might be manipulated by hostile parties using the vague      language of the convention as an ideological hobbyhorse.       Similarly, article V asserts ICC jurisdiction over the,      ``crime of aggression''--an offense that is not defined in      international law or even in the Rome Statute itself, a point      that I made repeatedly at the OSCE parliamentary assembly in      Bucharest earlier this month. In the context of domestic law,      such vagueness would be problematic. In the more combative      context of international law it is dangerous.       In addition to the problems posed by its vague definitions,      the statute also claims a jurisdictional reach that is      without precedent. Once 60 countries have ratified it, the      statute claims ICC jurisdiction over any defendant who may      have committed a crime in a signatory state regardless of      whether the defendant's own state had ratified the treaty. By      claiming to bind the subjects of non-signatory states, this      self-executing, potentially universal jurisdiction directly      challenges traditional concepts of national sovereignty.       Finally, the Rome Statute gives the ICC prosecutor a vast      amount of personal power with a minimum amount of oversight.      The statute drafters rejected a U.S. proposal that the      prosecutor only be allowed to proceed on cases referred      either by a sovereign state or by the U.N. Security Council.      Instead, the ICC prosecutor may initiate investigations and      prosecutions on his own authority without control or      oversight by any national or international party.       Under article 44, the prosecutor may also accept any offer      of, ``gratis personnel offered by nongovernmental      organizations to assist with the work of any of the organs of      the Court.''       I have long been a supporter of the important work      undertaken by International NGO's, particularly relating to      the protection of human rights and the provision of      humanitarian relief, but it is also true that there exist      hundreds of highly ideological NGO's who look to      international bodies to promote agendas that go far beyond      the domestic political consensus in their home countries. The      combination of the independent prosecutor's extreme      discretion with staff provided by well-funded extremist NGO's      could lead to serious problems and partisanship by the ICC.      These are but a few of the problems that I have with the      present form of the Rome Statute.       I readily acknowledge that many, probably most, ICC      supporters do not intend for the Court to be used as a club      for U.S.-bashing or as an engine or radical social      engineering, but once the ICC is established it will take on      a life of its own. Its activities will be restricted by the      language of the Rome Statute itself rather than by the best      intentions of its most responsible supporters, and I just      would say finally, Mr. Chairman, as you know, I take a back      seat to no one in promoting--in the past and present--both      the Rwanda War Crimes Tribunal and the International War      Crimes Tribunal for the Balkans.       When we were holding early hearings in our subcommittee as      well as on the Helsinki Commission I offered language and      amendments to boost the U.S. donation to those important      tribunals and so I take a back seat to no one, but this I      think has some very real problems that need to be addressed.      I yield back.     Page 52       Mr. Smith [presiding].       Let me ask a few questions and then I will yield to my      friend, Mr. Berman, if he has any further questions.       You mentioned checks and balances that exist within the      Yugoslavian War Crimes Tribunal. Do those same checks and      balances also exist in the Rome Statute?       Ambassador Scheffer. Congressman, there are many more      checks and balances in the ICC statute, and I can go into      some of those. But the power of the prosecutor is much more      qualified within the ICC statute. The principle of      complementarity, which is nowhere found in the Yugoslav or      Rwanda Tribunal statutes is a central feature of this      particular Court.       And, furthermore, this Court, the ICC, depends upon the      states parties to the Court to actually make very important      decisions relating to the Court, whereas, the Yugoslav and      Rwanda Tribunals look to no governments whatsoever for their      decisionmaking.       Mr. Smith. Let me ask you what kind of checks and balances      there are. In terms of elected officials, our Founding      Fathers, I     Page 53     think, were right in vesting only limited power in each of      the three branches, being so distrustful, as they were, of      any single entity being given so much power. Power corrupts,      and absolute power corrupts absolutely.       What happens if a prosecutor and/or judges were to run amok      and to engage in an ideological crusade against certain      individuals? I think we already have a shot across the bow      when lawyers brought action against NATO for alleged war      crimes, that our planes were flying too high, putting      additional civilians at risk, the choice of targets, which      they seem to disagree with. A war crime then potentially      could be in the eye of the beholder. Because, again, I do      think there is some true elasticity to these terms.       Yes, Mrs. Del Ponte did not accept and did not proceed on      those charges, but some other prosecutor may not be so      favorably inclined. You might want to comment on that.      Looking back, if the Rome Statute were in effect during World      War II, for example, and we dropped the bomb on Hiroshima and      Nagasaki, and we did the firebombing of Dresden and the other      German cities with a huge number of civilian casualties,      would that be construed as a war crime under the plain      meaning of the Rome Statute?       Ambassador Scheffer. Well, Congressman, it is far too      speculative to try to get into that. Remember that during      World War II, the question is, were those actions violations      of codified or customary international law at that time?       Mr. Smith. That is not the question I am asking.       Ambassador Scheffer. No, I know.       Mr. Smith. Fast-forward those military actions that this      country undertook with our Alliance.       Ambassador Scheffer. It is entirely speculative to say we      would use exactly the same military tactics today as we did      during World War II. I would not speculate in that direction,      not at all. We are far more precise----       Mr. Smith. But there is no doubt a reasonable man or woman      could use the Rome Statute in cases analogous to matters of      historical fact, where military decisions were made which      resulted in huge casualties. Thankfully, at least, the      consequence of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the ending of the      war. But there is an argument that has been made ever since      as to the advisability of those actions.       I think it is fair question. Past is prologue. We may be      faced with this in the future. We all know that NATO, in      terms of its war doctrine, would rely on superiority, at      least during the Soviet days, rather than quantity. Quality      was what we would rely on. There is the potential that a      United States President, or a French President, or a British      Prime Minister may have to make a decision some day to use      nuclear weapons. It is not beyond the realm of possibility      and it is not highly speculative. Those things have to be      thought through.       Since we have the historical record, I think it needs to be      plugged in to see whether or not this would have triggered a      war crimes prosecution.       Ambassador Scheffer. Well, we were careful in the drafting      of the statute, as well as the elements of crimes, to      establish very high barriers to actually launching      investigations and prosecuting the crimes. Not isolated      incidents, there has to be systematic widespread events.      There have to be plans and policies to directly assault      civilian populations. If military necessity dominates the      reasoning behind the use of any particular military force,      then that is in conformity with international law and it      is in conformity with the statute.       But if you are asking me, speculate as to whether or not it      can conceivably be drawn that the United States takes a      particular type of military action without describing what      the intent was behind it, the plan or the policy behind it, I      can't answer questions like that because you have to go      through every step of the analysis before you can answer      whether or not this statute would actually apply to that      particular use of military force.       Mr. Smith. Well, one of the more perverse outcomes would be      that our military strategists would be faced with factoring      in not     just what is in the best interests of the United States and      our allies, and how are we more likely to achieve a military      end to a conflict. they would also have to factor in whether      or not such an action would violate the Rome Statute.       Let me also say, our nuclear doctrine rests on deterrence,      and if the Russians were to attack us or to launch, we would      destroy Russian cities. How would that fit into a Rome      Statute world?       Ambassador Schheffer. Congressman, this statute, as I said,      specifically provides very high barriers that have to be met.       Mr. Smith. But crimes of aggression aren't even defined      yet.       Ambassador Scheffer. And it is contrary to U.S. Federal law      as well as the Uniform Code of Military Justice to violate      the laws of war. So I would assume the plan or policy of the      United States would not be to violate the laws of war. If it      were the plan or policy to violate the laws of war, then we      have a lot to answer for. But if it is not the policy to      violate the laws of war, there should be symmetry between our      actions and what has been set forth in the statute, which we      agree with.       We agree that the crimes set forth in the statute are      crimes under customary international law which we must adhere      to. We are not disagreeing with what is in the statute in      terms of the list of crimes, we agree with them They must be      complied with.       Mr. Smith. And again, signing a document that still has not      defined crimes of aggression----       Ambassador Schiffer. And by the way, I noticed that in your      opening statement. I did want to get back to you on that. The      whole process in the Preparatory Commission now is to try to      determine, can there be a definition for aggression? The      crime of aggression is not actionable under the statute      unless there has been an agreement among the states parties      to the statute at the 7-year review conference as to what is      the definition of that crime. So you can't--there is no way      to prosecute that crime until such a definition has been      arrived at. And we have a very significant coalition of      governments in total agreement with us as to how to proceed      in those talks to define the crime of aggression.       Interestingly enough, under the statute, if one is a state      party to the statute, you have every right, if a new crime is      added to the statute, to completely exclude yourself from the      coverage of that crime.     Page 55       Mr. Smith. Mr. Slocombe, Secretary Slocombe, if you could      respond to the hypothetical posed earlier about not just our      deterrence strategy, which is based on the obliteration of      cities, unless something has changed there that I don't know      about, but also the bombing of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and the      firebombing that took place in Germany. If the Rome Statute      were in effect, would that have precluded those actions?       Mr. Slocombe. Mr. Smith, I think the way I would answer      that would be to say that, in our view, if the Rome Statute      were properly applied, American military personnel or the      political officers, the President and, I guess in those      cases, the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy who      ordered operations could not properly be prosecuted under      them because they were legitimate. In the case of Hiroshima      and Nagasaki, and, indeed, in general, with respect to the      strategic bombing campaign against both Japan and Germany      with conventional weapons, I would maintain that, judged by      the context in which they occurred, they were not violations      of the law of war under any circumstances.       So that, as a lawyer, the way I would answer the question      would be that the United States would have a good defense if      such cases were, in your case, hypothetically tried.       What I am concerned about, what the United States is      concerned about, is that there could be a politically      motivated prosecution based on what would, in our view, be a      misinterpretation of the law of war, and, therefore, a      misinterpretation of the Rome Statute. And once one is in a      court, once you concede the principle of jurisdiction, there      are no guarantees as to the result.       Mr. Smith. So it would be possible that a Hiroshima,      Nagasaki type action or the firebombing in Japan and in      Germany could be prosecuted in the future if such a thing      were----       Mr. Slocombe. As we have said repeatedly, our concern in      respect of this statute, in respect of the Court, is      precisely the concern about politically motivated, in effect,      bad faith prosecutions. Exactly.       Mr. Smith. But what about a good faith prosecution, by      someone who honestly believed that Hiroshima was a war crime?      I mean it is possible that it could happen?       Mr. Slocombe. Well, there is no question that on its face,      the Court has jurisdiction over actual ``war crimes''. That      is what the statute says, that is what is intended. Our      concern, the United States military, through the United      States military justice system, prosecutes and prosecutes      vigorously well-founded allegations that American military      personnel have violated the law of war.       We do not need the International Criminal Court to deal      with that problem. So that is a non-problem. Our concern is      not that there would be valid prosecutions of American      military personnel. Our concern, rather, is as I said, and as      we had said repeatedly, our concern is with politically      motivated prosecutions based not really on serious      allegations of war crimes, but on disagreement with U.S. or      other alliance policies, of which I think the rejected      allegations with respect to Kosovo are a good example.       Mr. Smith. Could I ask, and ask you to provide it for the      record, that the Pentagon undertake an analysis as to whether      or not Rome would apply to World War II actions like I      mentioned before?       Ambassador Scheffer, I think if these other issues were      ironed out, you probably would like to see us sign this. But      we have got to know what we are heading toward, and we need      to look back before we look forward. Such an analysis, if it      hasn't been done, really should be done.       Mr. Slocombe. It has been done, that is the reason we      opposed the treaty.       Mr. Smith. What has been done, a look back at past      conflicts?       Mr. Slocombe. Well, I don't know that anyone did it in the      mind of saying Dresden could have been prosecuted, I think      they did it in the mind of saying you don't have to go back      to World War II or to the Vietnam War to say that there is a      very real danger that there could be politically motivated      prosecutions through the International Criminal Court, and      that is precisely the reason that not just the Department of      Defense, but the Administration voted against the text and      have refused to sign the treaty.       Mr. Smith. And Ambassador Scheffer, you agree with that,      there could be politically motivated prosecutions?       Ambassador Scheffer. Precisely.       Mr. Smith. I'm sorry?       Ambassador Scheffer. Yes. Yes.       Mr. Smith. Do you, Ambassador Scheffer, personally think      that President Clinton made a mistake when he decided against      signing the treaty in 1998?       Your mike is not on.       Ambassador Scheffer. I'm sorry, Congressman. My answer to      your other questions was yes.       Mr. Smith. OK. Thank you.       Ambassador Scheffer. No, there was no mistake whatsoever.      In fact, the issue of signing was simply not the issue. In      Rome it was, do we agree with other governments to release      the text of the statute out of the Rome Conference in the      form that existed at the end of the conference? That was the      only issue there.       It truly is a more responsible course to take not to      consider even the issue of signing until one sees the      totality of this treaty regime.       Mr. Slocombe. If I could, Mr. Chairman, could I read a      sentence from a letter which Secretary Cohen, with the      concurrence of his colleagues in the senior levels of the      Administration, sent in support of Ambassador Scheffer's      effort, which responds exactly to your point? It reads, ``As      it currently stands, the Rome Treaty could expose      servicemembers and Government officials of nonparty states to      criminal liability based on politically motivated charges      brought by other states that object to the nonparty states'      international policies.'' That is our position and that, in a      sentence, is the reason for our concerns.       Mr. Smith. Let me ask a final question or two. Ambassador      Scheffer, how likely do you really think it is that you will      succeed in your efforts to get the ICC to forego criminal      jurisdiction over Americans and persons from other countries      that are not a party to the Rome Statute? And what happens if      you fail? Obviously there are a different set of diplomats      and parliamentarians that I was meeting with, but at the      Bucharest Conference we were all alone in our opposition. I      was amazed in speaking one-on-one during the course of the      week in Bucharest at the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly at how      Pollyanna-ish some of the views were of members who did not      have a clue what was contained in the statute but just said      ``We want an ICC and that is it.'' The British were probably      more emphatic than anyone, although they seem to have been      informed and knew the contents of the statute They were      vigorously pushing for rapid ratification, which is what the      operative language was that they were offering.       The Germans offered it. We tried to weaken it with an      amendment and it was not acceptable, regrettably. It seems as      if, as Mr. Bereuter pointed out earlier, in terms of a      willingness to just cede sovereignty, the Europeans have no      problem with that, it seems. But obviously we do.       What is the next step if they do not include us--or exclude      us, I should say--from jurisdiction? What would be the next      step?       Ambassador Scheffer. Well, I think there will be some--let      met just describe it as serious results if we cannot prevail      with a provision or a document that is satisfactory to us in      the Preparatory Commission talks.       I think as Under Secretary Slocombe said earlier we are      going to have to take a very serious reassessment of this. I      think there is going to be a clearer assessment as to what we      can consider in terms of military contingencies for this      Government, but at the same time I would hope that that      assessment could, the fact that there would be such an      assessment would encourage a good number of governments,      particularly our allies, that they have far more to gain from      this process from the United States being a cooperative      partner in this Treaty, even as a nonparty, than they do to      isolate us by not taking into consideration the very specific      requirements that we have in the international community, so      all I can say is I hope I can succeed.       I don't want to pretend to say that I have got an easy job      ahead of me. Right now the deck is stacked against me, but we      have to try. This is a step-by-step process. We have     had to exercise some patience in getting there, but every      time we have pursued our objectives since Rome to actually      accomplish what we need to accomplish, we have accomplished      it, so I want to go that final mile and see if we can      accomplish this objective.       Mr. Smith. Again, what is the likelihood of doing it? I      mean Secretary Bolton and--       Ambassador Scheffer. It could be 50-50 at this stage.       Mr. Smith. Secretary Bolton and Eagleburger, former      Secretary of State, have made it clear that they thought we      lost the fight 2 years ago.       Ambassador Scheffer. Well, as I said, we simply do not      share their vision of either having lost or waging this      campaign. I think you have to be in the trenches of it to      recognize that other governments truly do not want, at least      many other governments, truly do not want to see the United      States walk out of this process. They know how valuable we      can be in the long-run for this Court and therefore I would      hope that we could persuade them that a reasonable      accommodation within the Treaty regime of U.S. interests is      going to be to the betterment of the entire process and to      the Court itself.       Mr. Smith. I would respectfully suggest that we did lose it      2 years ago. We are trying to fix it now, and I obviously      wish you success. We all would wish you success on that, but,      you know, you mentioned serious repercussions or serious      consequences. I think we are more likely to avoid that if we      are very specific in saying this or that happens.      Predictability I think is your friend now. Can you elaborate      on some of the consequences if we lose?       Ambassador Scheffer. Well, as we have already stated to our      colleagues in other governments in letters that the Secretary      of Defense has sent to his counterparts, we would have to re-     evaluate our ability to participate in military contingencies      if we cannot prevail on that, and I think that is a fairly      powerful consequence.       In addition to that, I think governments truly are having      to gauge what is the consequence if the United States cannot      be a good neighbor to this treaty. It will severely cripple      the operation of this Court if we cannot be a player in it.       Mr. Smith. How would it affect peacekeeping in your view,      and Mr. Slocombe, you might want to add your views on      peacemaking as well?       Ambassador Scheffer. I think it could have a very severe      impact on that. Walt?       Mr. Slocombe. What the Secretary of Defense said in his      letter was unfortunately a negative result--that is, a      negative result with respect to the article 98 effort--could      have a major impact on our decision whether to participate in      certain types of military contingencies.       That is what he said. I would not see that as an absolute      judgment that we will never send American troops overseas in      any situation, but it would have to be a factor we would have      to take into account.       Mr. Smith. Just getting back to the legislation, and I know      in its current form you have made it clear you don't support      it, but can you not at least admit there is some value in      again broadcasting to the world that we are very serious and      that the Congress is very serious about there being very      negative consequences if this thing proceeds and we are      included, having not been made a party to it, having not      ceded or signed it?       Ambassador Scheffer. Well, I think there is some value to      it and the mere existence of the legislation I think has sent      that signal very loudly and clearly.       What I am saying is that actual adoption of this      legislation would then have the reverse effect on our ability      to actually negotiate our common objective.       Mr. Smith. Let me just take that one step further. I mean      the President obviously would have the capability of vetoing      the bill if he thought it was not the right vehicle.       But let me point out that the Congress also has      prerogatives, and we do fund peacekeeping. We obviously      provide the necessary and requisite moneys for our military.      It seems to me that we need to be very much a part of this      because the outcome could be a disaster going forward for the      world and for U.S. men and women in uniform who may be      deployed overseas.       As I have read this, and I have read just about everything      I can get my hands on, I have grave concerns. I said at the      outset that no one has been more favorably inclined toward ad      hoc tribunals than I am. When we had the first hearings in      the Helsinki Commission on what became the Yugoslavian      Tribunal we were being told by its leader, the man that was      charged by the United Nations to take on the responsibility,      that it was designed to fail, that he had been given      insufficient resources, that it was nothing but fluff in      order to placate certain individuals in countries, but it      really was not a serious effort.       Now if we go in the other extreme and all of a sudden pass      or enact something that potentially could prosecute the      President or our Secretary of State or Defense or Supreme      NATO Allied Commander, I think we have erred significantly as      well, and I don't think there has been enough vetting of this      issue.       I think a very small group of people have decided this. As      I mentioned earlier, you know, I really want to take a look      at who the actual participants were. We have heard that NGO's      were filling the seats and taking on the responsibility of      negotiating rather than the respective governments, who were      kind of like brushed aside and the designated hitters were      making decisions. That is serious if that indeed turns out to      be the case. So I think there has been far less scrutiny      brought to this, and hopefully these hearings are the      beginning of even more focus by the Congress, but I thank you      for your testimony.       Mr. Tancredo is here. Do you have any comments?       Mr. Tancredo. No.       Mr. Smith. I do thank you for your comments. We look      forward to working with you in the future.       Ambassador Scheffer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.       Mr. Slocombe. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.       [Whereupon, at 11:51 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
