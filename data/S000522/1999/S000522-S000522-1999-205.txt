Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh) for his excellent statement and his leadership these many years on the issue of Northern Ireland, just to underscore how important it is that that investigation be completely independent of the RUC in order to procure a result that we know we can live with, and will hopefully yield the results and catch the perpetrators, because there are people who actually did the killing, and there are many others who are probably a part of that killing, and the officials need to get to the bottom.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York (Mr. King), my good friend and another great leader in the cause of human rights in the north of Ireland.
