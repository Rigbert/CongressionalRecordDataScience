 President, before we proceed to the resolutions appointing our committee membership, I want to thank the majority leader for his assistance in working on this joint leadership agreement. As was agreed to in the 108th Congress, we have included language which keeps the current minority staff salary baseline from going below the allocation in the 109th if those funds are available. Given the possibility of a continuing resolution, the majority leader and the chairman of the Rules Committee have agreed to provide each ranking member, if requested, an allocation equal to 49 percent of the 10 percent that was available to the chairman in the 109th Congress. I would further say that this money is available out of existing funds and is not considered as supplemental funds above the current funding levels.
