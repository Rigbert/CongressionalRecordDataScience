 President, I rise to address a great human tragedy silently unfolding in North Korea and the urgent need for the United States to respond.  The North is experiencing a severe famine and has asked the world for help. Pyongyang has gratefully acknowledged our past assistance. It is in our interest to respond generously to their plight.                       on the brink of starvation  According to experts from the World Food Program [WFP] who recently returned from extensive travels in North Korea, tens of thousands of people are on the brink of starvation. Hundreds of thousands more are suffering from severe malnutrition, the result of several years of scarcity.  The public food distribution system on which 78 percent of the North's population depends has effectively ceased to function in most parts of the country. In those few rural areas where the public distribution system still is operating, rations have fallen to below 100 grams per day, the equivalent of a small handful or rice or corn for each person.  The evidence of famine is pervasive and undeniable. Children are among the hardest hit, their hair tinged red from malnutrition, their growth stunted, their eyes sunken and listless.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from this week's copy of Newsweek magazine, which includes a photograph of starving North Korean children into the Record. I'd like to note for the record that a photograph of a Andrew Cunanan graced the cover, while the poignant photo of four starving North Korean kindergarten students was on page 46.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From Newsweek Magazine, July 28, 1997]                          Just Skin and Bones                 (By Tom Masland and Jeffrey Bartholet)       It's a slow-motion catastrophe, largely hidden from      outsiders. But the latest visitors to North Korea confirm the      world's worst fears. A nation of 23 million people is      starving, slowly and painfully. ``Mere survival is becoming      more and more difficult,'' wrote one man to his mother in      Japan. ``There are people dying.'' Travelers describe scenes      that once were unthinkable in this police state: beggars in      the streets of Pyongyang, masked, armed robbers raiding      private homes for food, trees totally stripped of leaves and      edible bark. Perhaps most persuasive of all are the first      photographs to document the deepening tragedy. The one on      this page was taken in an orphanage by an official visitor      from a Roman Catholic charity. The blank stares of the      spindly infants cry out: time is short.       In response to the crisis, Washington last week doubled its      previous donation of food aid to the north. The promised      100,000 tons of grain represents slightly more than half the      $45.6 million requested by the World Food Program earlier      this month in direct response to the plight of North Korea's      children. Executive director Catherine Bertini says the WFP      needs enriched baby food for children who are too      malnourished to digest the customary relief meal, a handful      of ground corn. Bertini reports that the program's staff      members in North Korea ``estimate that 50 to 80 percent of      the children they have seen in nurseries are underweight and      markedly smaller than they should be for their age. They are      literally wasting away.''       Playing politics: The emergency food aid will help, but      it's not a lasting answer to North Korea's creeping famine.      The crisis is bound up with politics: North Koreans are going      hungry because their Stalinist economy is collapsing, and the      United States, Tokyo and Seoul are using food aid to lure      Pyongyang into four-way peace talks and economic reform. Yet      North Korean leader Kim Jong II and his cronies are wary of      any compromise that could loosen their grip on power. They're      prepared to do whatever they feel is necessary to survive--     and they're wildly unpredictable.       Managing North Korea's collapse has become a top priority      of the Clinton administration. The United States has 37,000      troops based in South Korea to help deter Pyongyang. Yet as      North Korea deteriorates, fears mount that its leaders will      ``use it before they lose it.'' The endgame is no longer a      matter of if, but when. As a Rand Corporation study concluded      last year, ``The Korean Peninsula presents a strange paradox.      Nobody knows what might happen this year or next, but      everyone agrees on how things will look in 10 or 20 years.      The North Korean regime is doomed in the long run.''       In part to obtain famine relief, Pyongyang last month      finally agreed to attend peace talks in New York aimed at      ending the formal state of war that still applies on the      peninsula. And last week North Korea promised to lift a ban      that has prevented Japanese wives of North Koreans from      visiting their homeland for more than three decades. Japan,      which has vast stocks of surplus rice, now is considering      providing additional food aid. But anyone who thought      Pyongyang was turning soft got a rude reminder last week. A      squad of North Korean troops briefly crossed the      demilitarized zone and provoked the heaviest exchange of fire      with South Korean troops in two decades.       Why increase tensions along the most heavily armed border      in the world? Pyongyang may believe that by instigating a      fire fight along the border it reinforces the message that      North Korea is dangerously unstable--springing loose more      food aid from Washington, Japan and others. Some analysts      also think that there's a power struggle underway within the      regime between hardliners in the military and moderates in      the civilian bureaucracy. According to this view, every time      the moderates move to open relations with the outside world,      hard-liners resist. Last September the incursion of a North      Korean submarine on the South Korean coast led to a manhunt      in which 24 North Koreans and 13 South Koreans were killed--     just as Pyongyang was trying to persuade foreign businesses      to invest in a new free-trade zone. This time, hard-liners      may have wanted to pre-empt the Aug. 5 peace talks.       Once sanguine about a ``soft landing'' in Korea--in which      Pyongyang embraces economic reforms and gradual, peaceful      reunification--U.S. intelligence analysts now predict a      crash. In one scenario, reformers topple Kim in a palace coup      and call for help from Seoul or Beijing--creating yet another      delicate, hard-to-manage issue between Beijing and      Washington. Or perhaps North Korea attempts to seize Seoul,      hoping to achieve reunification on its own terms. One former      Pentagon analyst warns of a human-wave assault down high      ridges and hills where tanks can't operate. This would likely      come during the summer, when chemical weapons work most      effectively and haze hinders air operations. The argument      against such a disaster: China, North Korea's neighbor and      longtime socialist ally, can be expected to use all its      influence to deter such an attack.       Could famine bring on the collapse of the Pyongyang regime?      Conceivably, if North Koreans come to fear starvation more      than they do the government. But so far discipline remains      strong. U.S. Rep. Tony Hall, who visited the North in April,      recalls visiting a maternity clinic where mothers were dying      and 6-month-old infants looked like newborns. ``If you asked      what they planned to do, people answered, `The Dear Leader      will take care of us. He always does'.'' Hall said. Whoever      eventually rules a united Korean peninsula could pay the      price for years. ``This is one of the few countries I know      where the kids are growing up to be smaller than their      parents,'' says Hall. Some call it ``generational stunting.''      ``If [children] are malnourished in these critical years,      they can't make it up,'' says one U.N. official. For North      Korea's hungry kids, the endgame is now.                        inadequate U.S. response
