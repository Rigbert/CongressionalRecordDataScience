President, I have heard a lot of debate here today. I remind Senators of one thing: The Kagan nomination is not controversial. Every Solicitor General who served from 1985 has endorsed her nomination. That is every Democratic one, every Republican one, across the political spectrum.  Let me read some of the names who have endorsed this woman Charles Fried, Ken Starr, Drew Days, Walter Dellinger, Seth Waxman, Ted Olson, Paul Clement, Greg Garre. Here is what they wrote in their letter of support:       We who have had the honor of serving as Solicitor General      over the past quarter century in the administrations of      Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, William Clinton      and George W. Bush, write to endorse the nomination of Dean      Elena Kagan to be the next Solicitor General of the United      States. We are confident that Dean     Kagan will bring distinction to the office, continue its      highest traditions, and be a forceful advocate for the United      States before the Supreme Court.  One of the conservative professors whom Dean Kagan helped bring to Harvard Law School was Professor Jack Goldsmith. You may remember, he took charge of the Office of Legal Counsel after the disastrous tenures of Jay Bybee and John Yoo.  Professor Goldsmith, a conservative, praised Dean Kagan as someone who takes to the Solicitor General's Office a better understanding of the Congress and the executive branch that she will represent before the Court than perhaps any prior Solicitor General.  I ask unanimous consent that a list of these and the dozens of other supporters be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows: Letters of Support for the Nomination of Elena Kagan To Be Solicitor                       General of the United States                  Current and Former Public Officials       David A.
