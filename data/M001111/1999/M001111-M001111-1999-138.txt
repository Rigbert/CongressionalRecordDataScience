 President, included within the Manager's amendment to the FY 2000 Interior Appropriations bill is a technical fix to last year's legislated I-90 Land Exchange. The amendment to the legislation was necessary to address to discovery of nesting marbled murrelets on two parcels of Forest Service land originally set to be exchanged to Plum Creek Timber Company. The language in the amendment is agreeable to both the Forest Service and Plum Creek.  Other issues, particularly that of potential landslides on parcels of land being transferred to Plum Creek near the town of Randle, Washington, have recently arisen. Members of the community are fearful that if some of these lands are harvested by Plum Creek that dangerous landslides are possible. I believe this a legitimate concern and have begun discussions with the Forest Service, Plum Creek, Congressman Baird and Senator Gorton as to possible solutions. I believe, however, that the land exchange is a benefit to the people of Washington and should proceed as we continue to work on the issue of concern to Randle residents.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter to me from Plum Creek regarding the company's commitment to protecting the welfare of local communities, the forest land it acquires, and willingness to work with all parties to address the issues in Randle. I hope, that if a solution to the issues of concern to Randle residents is found in time, that such a solution be placed into the Interior bill at conference.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        Plum Creek Timber Co.,                                  Seattle, WA, September 14, 1999.     Hon. Patty Murray,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: We greatly appreciate your continuing      efforts to resolve the issues created by the discovery of      marbled murrelets on lands to be acquired by Plum Creek as      part of the I-90 Land Exchange. Plum Creek agrees with the      legislative language worked out by your office and the U.S.      Forest Service to accommodate the new lands package and we      are prepared to assist in any way that we can.       We are aware that some opposition has developed over the      lands near Randle, Washington, that Plum Creek would receive      in the exchange. The opponents have painted a dismal scenario      of what Plum Creek might do when the exchange is complete and      we want to assure you of the facts.       First, Plum Creek has an excellent reputation of including      neighbors and local communities in the planning process. We      have not yet developed any specific plans for the Randle      area, and will not until we have met with community leaders      and heard first-hand their concerns. We are prepared to      consider any options that will help to resolve the issues.       Second, our own standards and the strict forest practice      rules of the state of Washington require that great care be      taken to identify and avoid any areas of geological concern,      such as unstable soils and steep slopes. Indeed, after      extensive public study and comment, nearly 10,000 acres of      U.S. Forest Service land was removed from consideration early      in the exchange process for just this reason. The land that      remains in the exchange has been thoroughly studied and can,      with careful planning, be managed in a thoughtful and      appropriate manner.       Third, any Plum Creek operations will be strictly governed      by our own Environmental Principles and the standards of the      American Forest and Paper Association's Sustainable Forestry      Initiative.       Plum Creek is willing to continue to work with local      citizens, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Delegation to      resolve important issues upon completion of the I-90 Land      Exchange. We continue to believe the Exchange is a fair deal      for Plum Creek and a great deal for the public.                                                       Bill Brown.
