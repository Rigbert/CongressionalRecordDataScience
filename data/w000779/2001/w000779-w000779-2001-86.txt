President, pain is our Nation's silent public health crisis. Pain is often left untreated or under-treated, especially among older patients, minorities and children. Forty to 50 percent of dying patients experience moderate to severe pain at least half of the time in the last days of their lives. A Brown University study published in last month's Journal of the American Medical Association found that 40 percent of nursing home patients nationwide with acute or chronic pain are not getting treatment that brings them relief. Thousand of Americans die in pain every year, and thousands live in chronic pain.  What is truly tragic for these patients is that the medical technology and know-now exist to make them more comfortable. What does not exist is a medical system that supports clinicians trying to address these issues or a system to support patients and families as they try to find help for pain.  The primary goal of the Conquering Pain Act, a bipartisan bill that I am introducing today with Senators Smith, Rockefeller, and Breaux is to create a public health framework with on which effective pain management policies can be developed. Providing help to patients in pain, to their health care providers, and to others caring for those patients will ensure their access to pain management 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.  The widespread crisis of failing to adequately address patients in pain is made crystal clear by the fact that only one State in the Nation has ever has sanctioned a physician for the under-treatment of pain. That State is my home State of Oregon, which is now also considering the creation of a commission on pain management with the State health department.  The Conquering Pain Act does not seek to tell clinicians how to practice medicine. It does not override State regulation and oversight of medicine. it does provide information to physicians and families in an effort to support them. It also seeks to find answers to the complex problems created by the interplay between State and Federal regulation of pain medications.  Most importantly, the bill would create six regional Family Support Networks linking patients, families and providers to information and services to assist patients in pain. These networks would also assist clinicians who need additional information, mentoring or support to deal with the medically complex cases that patients in pain often present.  It would be cruel and callous for this Congress to continue to ignore the overwhelming number of scientific studies that show patient after patient failing to get relief from pain. This legislation, which enjoys broad support with the medical and patient community, would start us down the road toward addressing in a bipartisan, positive way one of our Nation's most serious and continued health problems.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1024       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Congress finds that--       (1) pain is often left untreated or under-treated      especially among older patients, African Americans, Hispanics      and other minorities, and children;       (2) chronic pain is a public health problem affecting at      least 50,000,000 Americans through some form of persisting or      recurring symptom;       (3) 40 to 50 percent of patients experience moderate to      severe pain at least half the time in their last days of      life;       (4) 70 to 80 percent of cancer patients experience      significant pain during their illness;       (5) one in 7 nursing home residents experience persistent      pain that may diminish their quality of life;       (6) despite the best intentions of physicians, nurses,      pharmacists, and other health care professionals, pain is      often under-treated because of the inadequate training of      clinicians in pain management;       (7) despite the best intentions of physicians, nurses,      pharmacists, mental health professionals, and other health      care professionals, pain and symptom management is often      suboptimal because the health care system has focused on cure      of disease rather than the management of a patient's pain and      other symptoms;       (8) the technology and scientific basis to adequately      manage most pain is known;       (9) pain should be considered the fifth vital sign; and       (10) coordination of Federal efforts is needed to improve      access to high quality effective pain and symptom management      in order to assure the needs of chronic pain patients and      those who are terminally ill are met.     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.
