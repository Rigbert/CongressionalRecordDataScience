 President, I join my colleague from Connecticut. We have had a burst of activity this afternoon. I think we are off to a good start. We have to remember that this bill isabout 1,500 pages. This doesn't only affect a little bit of our economy, it affects all of our economy in one way or the other.  I have just laid down an amendment--the Republican alternative to the consumer products--and a lot of people are going to want to debate it on both sides. We are not here to delay this bill in any way. I think it is so important and it is so comprehensive that we are going to have a healthy debate. I appreciate the remarks of the Senator from Connecticut. I believe he understands that very well.
