 President, there are five amendments that have been cleared on both sides; an amendment by Senator Cochran on IFAD, a McConnell-Leahy-Lautenberg amendment on MEDEVAC, a Leahy narcotics amendment, a Pell amendment on the environment, and a modification to amendment No. 5082. I send those to the desk and ask unanimous consent that they be considered en bloc.
