 President, later today, the junior Senator from Nebraska will give the Senate an opportunity to address an issue of profound moral importance. I understand that he plans to ask consent to pass legislation that ought to be the very definition of something that receives unanimous consent in this body. It would help ensure that all baby girls and boys who are born alive--all ofthem--have their right to life respected and receive the medical care they need.  It builds on the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act of 2002, which did indeed pass this body by unanimous consent, and creates enforcement mechanisms if abortion providers fail to give these newborn babies the medical attention and care they so obviously deserve.  Completely apart from the rest of our debate on the issue of life, how could this question be any clearer? What could be more unanimous than this: What medical professionals owe every single newborn American citizen, regardless of the circumstances of their birth, is attention and care--not neglect and certainly not violence. Frankly, it is harrowing that this legislation is even necessary.  What is even more disturbing when, last week, a Democratic Governor was unable to clearly and simply state that, of course--of course--these newborn babies have human rights that must be respected.  I have been a proud cosponsor of Senator Sasse's legislation, and I hope none of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle invent any reasons to block this request later today. That would make quite a disturbing statement.  If they do inexplicably block Senator Sasse's effort, I can assure them this will not be the last time we try to afford newborns this fundamental legal protection.                          ____________________
