President, once again, our Republican colleagues are spending another week rubberstamping President Trump's extreme nominees.  Daniel Collins, nominated to a California Ninth Circuit seat, received a vote over the objection of both of California's Senators.  Before this year, a judicial nominee had never been confirmed over the objection of both home State Senators. Mr. Collins's confirmation marked the sixth time it has happened this year.  This Republican Senate has effectively killed the blue slip for circuit court nominations. This is a precedent that could come back to haunt each of our States. My Republican colleagues who are voting repeatedly to override home State Senators' objections may come to regret those votes someday.  I opposed the Collins nomination. I agree with Senators Feinstein and Harris that Collins has ``a history of taking strong litigation positions for no reason other than attempting to overturn precedent and push legal boundaries.''  I am particularly troubled by his extensive representation of the tobacco industry and his inadequate recusal commitment when it comes to matters involving his former tobacco industry clients.  The district court nominees scheduled for votes this week also have a long history of advancing extreme ideological views.  When it comes to abortion, North Carolina district court nominee Kenneth Bell once wrote in an op-ed, ``There is no middle ground.'' Missouri district court nominee Stephen Clark has spent much of his legal career litigating against reproductive rights and access to contraceptives.  Utah district court nominee Howard Nielson wrote a memo for the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, arguing that the Geneva Conventions, which prohibit torture, do not apply to civilians captured abroad.  DC district nominee Carl Nichols has advanced extreme views of Executive power, including arguing that Presidents and Presidential aides have absolute immunity from congressional process.  I opposed these extreme nominees, and I regret that the Senate's advice and consent process has become an exercise in Republican rubberstamping. This institution can and should do better.                          ____________________
