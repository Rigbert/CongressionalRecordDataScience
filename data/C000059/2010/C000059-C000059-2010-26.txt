I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Chief Master Sergeant Steven J. Perrault for his 23-plus years of dedicated service in the United States Air Force.  Chief Perrault enlisted in the Air Force on January 15, 1988, as an Administrative Specialist assigned to Westover Air Force Base, Massachusetts. He served for two years in this role prior to transitioning to Vehicle Operations. After three years, Chief Perrault then moved to his first duty station and worked as a recruiter at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts.  During his career, Chief Perrault was assigned as a Line Recruiter, which is primarily responsible for new enlistees, and an in-service recruiter which helps Regular Air Force members transfer into the Reserve Component. Due to his knowledge and skills he was selected for a Headquarters assignment helping oversee both the Operations and Training Branches of Recruiting Service at Robins Air Force Base, Georgia in 2000. Chief Perrault took on the tough assignment as a Senior Recruiter and was responsible for a new operating location in Denver, Colorado that managed all in-service recruiters assigned to the Midwest portion of the United States. In August 2005, after laying the ground work for success in Denver, Chief Perrault was assigned to Wright Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio as a Senior Recruiter.  In August 2007, he was chosen as the Superintendent for the Western Recruiting Squadron. Since that time, Chief Perrault has been instrumental in meeting their annual recruiting goals for the ninth straight year. During his career, Chief Perrault has been directly responsible for helping to recruit more than 8,500 airmen into the Air Force Reserve and has contributed to the continued success of the Air Force Reserve Command Recruiting Service.  Most recently, Chief Perrault has served as Superintendent, Western Recruiting Squadron, March Air Reserve Base, California, Air Force Reserve Command. In this role, he has been responsible for coaching and mentoring the 96 enlisted personnel assigned to the squadron as well as ensuring congressionally mandated end-strength manning for reserve units across 17 states, one U.S. territory, and in three countries.  Chief Perrault could not have been such a tremendous leader without the love and unfailing support of his wife Senior Master Sergeant (retired) Cheryl Perrault and their four children: Technical Sergeant Cassandra Casul, Senior Airman Shane Perrault, Kyle Perrault, and Ms. Ashlie Wendt. Helping to build his foundation for success early in life were his father Robert Perrault, his step-mother Carol; his mother Karen Gardiner and his step-father Sergeant Major (retired) Dennis Gardiner.  Madam Speaker, I join my colleagues in expressing our sincere appreciation to Chief Master Sergeant Steven J. Perrault for his outstanding service to both the United States Air Force and our great nation. Chief Perrault will retire from the United States Air Force service with more than just his experience, decorated career and remarkable accomplishments. He will also have served as a shining example and constant reminder of what it means to be an American patriot and leader. I am grateful for his service and salute him as he retires from the United States Air Force.                          ____________________
