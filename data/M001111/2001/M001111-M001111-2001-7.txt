 President, my Pacific Northwest colleagues and I have mixed emotions about the recent move of our friend Bill Walters to Washington, DC. Although he will be sorely missed in our region, where he served in the Seattle office as deputy director for the National Park Service's Pacific West region, we realize that he will be playing a crucial role as associate to the Director for the National Park Service in its headquarters office within the Department of the Interior. We wish him much success in this new posting.  After serving the Pacific Northwest so ably, Bill has demonstrated he is well suited for his new job. The regional leadership of the Park Service call him the ``regional dad.'' He has a charming way of being able to take care of things and make everyone feel good about the outcome. I imagine this is what the Director of the Park Service immediately sensed and why we lost a good person in the Northwest, but gained one at National Park Service Headquarters.  Bill arrived in Seattle in 1992, just as the new administration was talking about downsizing. He shepherded a reasonable approach to efficient management, reducing the numbers of employees without an employee losing his orher job. More importantly, in consultation with me and other members of the congressional delegation, he maintained an office in Seattle, which provides direct service to the people of the Pacific Northwest.  The upheaval created by this reorganization was considerable. His calm voice of reason and genuine compassion made it possible for all of us to work at finding improvement, efficiency, and value in maintaining an office in the Pacific Northwest.  It was through this difficult process that I became acquainted with Bill. Since then, I have witnessed numerous examples of his good judgment and the gracious manner in which he brings people together around thoughtful solutions. He is a master statesman.  Bill is one of the few park professionals who has experience at the local, State, and Federal levels. This experience and his rare personal qualities make him a perfect negotiator and an effective steward of the public trust. Bill developed a impressive working agreement with the State of Idaho for managing the city of Rocks National Reserve. I witnessed his skill firsthand when we worked together in the creation of the city, county, and national partnership for Washington's Ebey's Landing National Reserve, which is bringing new vision and energy to the management of this unique park.  He was instrumental in helping to forge the partnership that resulted in the Vancouver National Historic Reserve along the Columbia River in my State of Washington. Without his personal involvement, the site would still be mired in controversy. Instead, we have Federal, State, local, and private entities working together to support a site that has 200 years of European history and countless years of pre-European archeology.  There is a quiet competence and goodness about this man that enables him to work collaboratively with NGOs, environmental activists, employees, allies, community leaders, and opponents alike. I have always appreciated his honesty and forthright character. Many in the Northwest have come to respect and appreciate Bill's open and engaging manner and professionalism. Bill represents park interests in a way that has made partners out of adversaries. You can't go very far in the Pacific Northwest without seeing examples of Bill's effective problem solving and sound stewardship.  We may have lost a skilled and trusted manager in the Northwest, but National Park Service Director Fran Mainella has gained a valuable associate who will serve her and the National Park Service well in the years ahead. We all benefit by having this man of integrity in Government service.                          ____________________
