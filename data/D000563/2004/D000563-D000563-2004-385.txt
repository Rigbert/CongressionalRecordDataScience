I would like to ask him this question.  Was it not during the last 2 weeks that the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan, who has been Chairman under both Democratic and Republican Parties, testified before the House of Representatives, I believe the Budget Committee, suggesting we have now reached a point because of our deficit situation and the debt of America when we have to seriously consider structural changes in Social Security relative to the benefits paid out to senior citizens and their retirement age? Does the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who had endorsed President Bush's tax cuts for the wealthiest people in America, now say we are in such a desperate situation that we have to turn to Social Security and to cut back in terms of potential benefits for future recipients?
