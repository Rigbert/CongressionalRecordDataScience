What he says is true. He has done an excellent job in joining both sides of the aisle with bipartisanship in finding solutions and getting things done. I am sorry we can't say that for all of us in the Senate. We could probably learn a lot the way the Senator from Wyoming approaches it. I don't want to suggest that the Senator change his approach. If the Senator from Wyoming will give me his assurance that this is a priority, that he will try to bring it up before his committee in a timely way when appropriate, I understand he has other priorities, if he will give me that assurance, I will withdraw this amendment. I hope we can work together from this point forward.
