Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Before concluding, Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank all on the minority side, as well as my good friends and colleagues here on the Republican side.  This is a comprehensive bill. The GI bill, certainly going back to World War II, our early GI bill, has created what really is the modern middle class. More than 20 million people have gotten their college education via the GI bill. That is just one part of this bill. It is comprehensive and deserves the full support of this body.
