Mr. Speaker, tonight the taxpayers are going to dinner with Speaker Gingrich.  Tonight a dozen high rollers will sit down to dine with the Speaker and hand over $50,000 checks for his radical right wing television station. In the process, each attendee will get a tax write-off of almost $20,000. That is almost $240,000 of our tax dollars going to support the radical right wing agenda.  This is the same Speaker who refuses to release the names of the contributors to his personal political machine GOPAC. The same Speaker who, according to the Atlanta Constitution,  [[Page H1297]] accepted almost $715,000 from one couple for GOPAC and hundreds of thousands of dollars from other individuals.  A television station, a political organization, a foundation, even a $4.5 million book deal. It is amazing Speaker Gingrich has any time at all to be Speaker of the House.  Too many ethical questions have been raised about this Speaker. We need an outside counsel to clear the air, to find the truth, and we need one now.                          ____________________
