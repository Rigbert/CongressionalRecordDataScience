Speaker, I appreciate very much my friend from Maryland yielding. We are pleased to have him as a member of our delegation, even though from time to time we may disagree.  I ask my friend from Maryland, I have a letter here addressed: Dear Steny. It makes some comments, but it concludes with this: ``To unduly restrict our ability to work with governmental representatives and agencies through the additional regulation envisioned by the Istook amendment would not be in the best interest of millions of people who rely on the Red Cross when help cannot wait. Sincerely, Elizabeth.''                              {time}  1645  All of us know that Elizabeth Dole, the wife of majority leader of the Senate, is head of the Red Cross. Throughout this letter, as the gentleman may know, she is very concerned about the Istook amendment's proscription on the ability of the Red Cross to advocate positions which it believes to be in the best interest of the people of this country.
