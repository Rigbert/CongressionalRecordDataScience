President, tomorrow, following the morning business period, the Senate will resume consideration of the IRS reform bill. It is hoped that the managers' amendment will be offered during Tuesday's session. In addition, Members who desire to debate this legislation are encouraged to do so tomorrow so that the Senate can complete action on the IRS reform bill as early as possible this week.  As a reminder, there will be a rollcall vote tomorrow at 5:30 p.m. on passage of the workforce development legislation, H.R. 1385. Any votes ordered with respect to the IRS reform bill will be stacked to occur following that 5:30 vote.                          ____________________
