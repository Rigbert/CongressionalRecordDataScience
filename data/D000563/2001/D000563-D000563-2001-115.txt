I was happy to join with him and all the other Senators in that resolution.  A few days ago, with the assistance of Jeri Thomson, who serves as the Secretary of the Senate, we prepared these buttons which are small and probably cannot be seen by anyone following this debate. But the word on them is ``heartfelt'' thank you to the Capitol Police. Most of these men and women have been working 12-hour shifts at least 6 days a week since September 11.  I just had a few words with one of the officers at the Dirksen Building. She told me that while she is working 6 days a week 12 hours a day, her husband is working for the Red Cross 7 days a week and 12 hours a day. They have two children--3 years old and 5 years old. I said: Did you have any chance to go trick or treating with the kids? She said, she didn't get home until 8:30; they would just have to wait until next year.  That is part of the sacrifice by so many people who don't receive recognition in the Congress but deserve it.  For those men and women who are standing out there protecting this House that belongs to the American people and this building that symbolizes so much in our democracy, I want them to know that from all the Members of the Senate this expression of gratitude is heartfelt.  Thank you so much for all you do every single. I hope we can find a way to bring some relief to your life soon. I hope as well that we can see some relief in the lives of all Americans who have been troubled and worried over the events since September 11.                          ____________________
