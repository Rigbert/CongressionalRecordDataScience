President, I thank my leader on the Democratic side.  Yesterday I visited Guantanamo Bay, along with my colleague, Senator George Allen of Virginia. RADM Harry Harris, commander of the Joint Task Force in Guantanamo, spent most of his day giving us a very informative briefing and a tour of the facilities.  I thank the admiral, and I thank all the soldiers and sailors at Guantanamo for their service to our country.
