 Speaker, I wish to tell you a story, and in so doing commend a wonderful grassroots project in northern Vermont. It is a small story and a simple one, but it says volumes about the generosity and support of the people of Vermont, and the care that the citizens of our nation as a whole extend to those who are bravely serving in our military forces.  Sharon Waterhouse, of Richford, Vermont decided to sew a Christmas stocking for her son, Josh, who is serving in Iraq with other members of the Vermont National Guard, and stuff it with small Christmas gifts. It immediately occurred to her that she could sew stockings for his whole unit, all 32 of his fellow Vermont National Guard members.  But Ms. Waterhouse didn't stop there. Since she loves to sew, she set a course to make 500 stockings, asking her aunt, Andrea Bowden, to help get donations to stuff them. Michelle Long of the Guard Family Readiness Group pitched in to arrange the shipping. The Richford Legion and CF's Diner chipped in by setting out donation jars to help buy supplies. And others have volunteered to help sew, including students from Enosburg High School, along with their teachers Jessica Leo and Kaye Mehaffey.  Sharon Waterhouse herself is sewing between 300 and 400 stockings, and with the help of other generous hands, she hopes to provide stockings for the entire Vermont Guard contingent--over 1400 soldiers--serving in Iraq.  There are moments when our brave men and women in uniform, facing daily dangers in Iraq which we can scarcely imagine, need to know that their nation understands the sacrifices they are willing to make on the Nation'sbehalf. What Sharon Waterhouse and the many others working along with her have done is give those soldiers a clear sign that we in America greatly appreciate their dedication and courage.                          ____________________
