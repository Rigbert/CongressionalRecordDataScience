 I hope they are tuning in to the Senate floor today so they can watch the vote on its repeal.  This has been a hard-fought effort, and all of the credit should go to the junior Senator from Nebraska, my good friend Senator Mike Johanns. He has led this fight on behalf of the countless entrepreneurs and small business owners across the country who raised the alarm on this issue.  This is a big win for small business. Importantly, it is also the first of what I hope are many successful repeal votes related to the disastrous health spending bill the Democrats passed last year. The more Americans learn about this bill, the less they like it. We hope we can respond to their concerns with many repeal votes like the one we are going to have this morning right here in Congress. Then we will replace it with the kind of commonsense reforms that will actually lower costs and encourage job creation.  Once again, I thank Senator Johanns for his leadership and hard work on repealing this onerous provision. This is a classic example of a Senator who listened to his constituents, developed a solution, won the support of his colleagues, and doggedly pursued a course of action that led to today's vote. America's small businesses can thank Senator Johanns for pushing this initiative across the finish line. I call on the President to sign it into law.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
