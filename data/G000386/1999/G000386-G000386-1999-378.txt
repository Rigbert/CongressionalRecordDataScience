 President, I rise today to introduce a bill co-sponsored by Senator Baucus to preserve hundreds of community health centers and rural health clinics across the country. Our bill, The Safety Net Preservation Act of 1999, would remedy a phase-out of the payment system that covers the clinics' cost of caring for Medicaid patients. Congress approved the phase-out of cost-based reimbursement during the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.  The phase-out was meant to save Medicaid money and respond to those who felt cost-based reimbursement imposed an expensive mandate on states. Scheduled to begin on October 1, the phase-out will force the clinics to use scarce federal grants intended to provide care for the uninsured to prop up Medicaid under-payments. The change could force health centers to lose as much as $1.1 billion over the next five years.  Our bill would establish a prospective payment system to ensure that health centers and clinics receive sufficient Medicaid funding. The bill would protect the federal investment in health centers while giving states the flexibility to design their own payment systems for health centers and clinics.  There's no doubt that community health centers and rural health clinics serve a unique and essential role in getting high-quality health care services to those in need. They are the backbone of America's health care infrastructure for millions of medically under-served rural and urban communities, where access to health care is often limited. I've seen first hand the valuable services provided by these centers and the obstacles the providers overcome to do so. Last year, I visited a center in Des Moines. They serve patients who speak nine different languages. In many cases, these clinics are often the difference between seeing a doctor and forgoing treatment. We can't allow money shortfalls to force them to shut down. We have to preserve this safety net for millions of Americans.  I am pleased for the support of Senators Murkowski, Rockefeller, Conrad, Robb and Harkin as original co-sponsors of The Safety Net Preservation Act of 1999. I look forward to passage of this important legislation in the 106th Congress.                                 ______                                       By
