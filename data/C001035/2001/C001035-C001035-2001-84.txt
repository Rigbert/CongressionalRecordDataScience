President, I have worked very closely with the Maine Medical Association on a variety of issues. I know that while they do want to see liability provisions similar to those of the Senator, they are very concerned about the issue I raised about the preemption of Maine's law.  Maine has been very active in passing a number of laws to provide consumer protections. They are carefully balanced laws. On this chart, there is a check mark all the way across. I know the Maine Medical Association was very involved with the legislature in negotiating those provisions. They are concerned about the preemption of Maine's laws which they helped to draft.
