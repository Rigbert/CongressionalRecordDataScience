 President, the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Sessions, Senator Kyl, and I will take a few moments to discuss the pending Supreme Court nomination and the proceedings leading up to that. I have notified the Democratic floor staff that it might slightly delay the 4:20 vote. I find that not objectionable on the other side.  I would inform our colleagues that we are going to proceed as if in morning business. I ask unanimous consent that we may do so.
