 President, I said that the Senate would take up the fiscal agreement after the House acted, and we are. This agreement isn't perfect. I share some concerns other colleagues have raised. But here is the bottom line. This is a fully offset agreement that rejects tax hikes, secures long-term savings through entitlement reforms, and provides increased support for our military. All this is at a time when we confront threats in multiple theaters.  Each of these items was a Republican goal heading into the negotiation. Each of these items was achieved in the agreement before us. I am encouraged that it would enact the most significant reform to Social Security since 1983, resulting in $168 billion in long-term savings. I am encouraged that it would repeal more of ObamaCare. I am encouraged that it would help provide resources our troops so desperately need in an era of diverse and very challenging global threats--when we see ISIL consolidating gains in Iraq and Syria; when we see the forces of Assad marching alongside Iranian soldiers and Hezbollah militias, supported by Russian aircraft overhead.  Colleagues know that I will respect whatever choice they ultimately make when this agreement comes up for a vote. There are valid differences of opinion, and that is OK. But I ask every colleague to also consider what this fully offset agreement would mean for the men and women who voluntarily put themselves in harm's way so that we may live free.  Commanders tell us that additional resources are required--required to ensure their safety and preparedness. This fully offset agreement would help provide them--along with enacting the most significant Social Security reform in over three decades, along with repealing another piece of ObamaCare, and along with refusing to raise taxes by a penny. I hope Senators will join me in voting for it.                          ____________________
