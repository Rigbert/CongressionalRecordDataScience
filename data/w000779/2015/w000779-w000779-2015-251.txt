Last December, the Senate approved a package of tax extenders for the 2014 year. That law expired before the ink could dry. By New Year's Day, taxpayers were thrown back in the dark about what they will owe in the future.  Let's not repeat that mistake. A grab bag of tax breaks is nobody's idea of perfect tax policy. My amendment will definitely move the ball forward on tax policy. It will send a clear signal that the Senate is ready to put these tax incentives in place through the year 2016.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
