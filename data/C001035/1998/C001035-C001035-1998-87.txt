President, I want to start by complimenting the chairman of the Commerce Committee for his outstanding leadership in dealing with a very important consumer issue, and that is telephone slamming.  I also want to commend the Senator from North Dakota for his very eloquent explanation of the problem and the solutions.  Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for S. 1618, legislation that will provide America's consumers with much needed protection against a fraudulent practice known as slamming--the unauthorized switching of a customer's telephone service provider. I want to commend Senator McCain and Hollings for taking steps to attack this rapidly growing problem.  Telephone slamming is spreading like wildfire. In Maine, complaints increased by 100 percent from 1996 to 1997. Nationwide, slamming is the number one telephone-related complaint. While the FCC received more than 20,000 slamming complaints in 1997, a significant increase over the previous year, estimates from phone companies indicate that as many as one million people were slammed during that 12-month period.  Last fall, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, undertook an extensive investigation of this problem. At a field hearing this past February in Portland, Maine, at which I was joined by Senator Durbin, one of the leaders in the fight against slamming, we heard from several consumers who were victimized by this practice. Their words reflect the public attitude toward the intentional slammer, as they described what happened to them as ``stealing,'' ``criminal,'' and ``break-in.''  My Subcommittee recently held a second hearing, which revealed that a number of what are known as switchless resellers were responsible for a large percentage of the intentional slamming incidents. These operations use deceptive marketing practices and outright fraud to switch consumers' long distance service without their consent.  One recent victim was a hospital in western Maine. This demonstrates that no one is immune from this despicable practice.  Mr. President, our hearings presented a case that dramatically shows the need for tougher sanctions to deal with this problem. I refer to an individual by the name of Daniel Fletcher, who fraudulently operated as a long distance reseller under at least eight different company names, slamming thousands of consumers, and billing them for at least $20 million in long distance charges. While we were struck by the ease with which Mr. Fletcher carried out his activities and evaded detection, we were shocked to learn about the absence of adequate criminal sanctions to deal with his activities.  Mr. Fletcher bilked America's telephone customers out of millions of dollars by charging them for services they did not authorize and obtaining from them money to which he was not entitled. Yet, we lack a statute that expressly makes intentional slamming a crime, and unless that is corrected, we can expect many more Fletchers. Mr. President, the time has come for the United States Congress to disconnect the telephone slammers.  Given our concern about this problem, Senator Durbin and I introduced slamming legislation, and I want to thank Senators McCain and Hollings for agreeing to incorporate its three main provisions into a Manager's Amendment to their bill. These additions will help make a good bill even better.  The first of these provisions will get tough with the outright scam artists by establishing new criminal penalties for intentional slamming. I should emphasize that these penalties will apply only to those who know that they are acting without the customer's authorization and not to those who make an honest mistake or even act carelessly. It's time we sent the deliberate slammer to the slammer. In addition, anyone convicted of intentional slamming will be disqualified from being a telecommunications service provider, thereby enabling us not only to punish past conduct but also to prevent future violations.  The second provision is designed to remove the financial incentive for companies to engage in slamming by giving slammed customers the option to pay their original carrier at their previous rate. Under current law, it appears that customers are obligated to pay the slammer even after they discover they have been switched without their consent. That hardly acts as a deterrent, something that must be changed.  The third provision will improve enforcement by requiring all telecommunications carriers to report slamming violations on a quarterly basis to the FCC. To avoid putting a burden on the carriers, the report need only be summary in nature, but it will enable the FCC to identify and move against the frequent slammer.  Deregulation of the telephone industry may produce many benefits for consumers but it also has given rise to fraud where it did not previously exist. It was Congress who decided to deregulate the industry, and it is Congress that must act to stop this fraud. Senate bill 1618 will move us in that direction by putting a big dent in telephone slamming and by protecting the right of the American people to choose with whom they wish to do business.  Again, I very much appreciate the cooperation of the distinguished chairman of the Commerce Committee and his willingness to accept the Collins-Durbin amendments.  I thank the Senator, and I yield the floor.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Collins again. We look forward to working with her on other issues that are as noncontroversial as these, as opposed to campaign finance reform which generated much more concern. But I seriously want to note the hard work that Senator Collins devoted in her subcommittee to this issue. It was very important. I thank the Senator.                           Amendment No. 2389   (Purpose: To provide a substitute that incorporates the Committee    amendments and additional changes in the bill as reported by the                                committee)  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the incorporation at this time of the managers' amendment to S. 1618. I ask unanimous consent that it be adopted.
