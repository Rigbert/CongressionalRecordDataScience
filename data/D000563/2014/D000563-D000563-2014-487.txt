We had a lengthy discussion in the Foreign Relations Committee about this twitter project, whatever it was, and whether it was wise--and I think it was the consensus of our committee--that if it opens up Cuban people to other ideas and more information, it is a positive thing.  You and I discussed afterward the fact that there are other things we can do. I think you just alluded specifically to them on the floor, and I wanted to associate myself with your thinking on this and hope that after some 50-years-plus, some fresh thinking on our foreign policy in terms of Cuba may lead to what we ultimately want, and that is giving the Cuban people an opportunity to be part of a real democracy and have real freedoms. Isn't that right?
