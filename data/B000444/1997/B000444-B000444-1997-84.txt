 President, again, the Senator is always straightforward. He indicates he worries that this is a scenario for reenacting a set of circumstances, putting in place a set of circumstances, that will allow the abuses that took place before to come around again. I am not being smart when I say this, but you, Senator Feingold are going to be here. The likelihood of that happening with you sitting here in this Chamber and with it sitting out there by itself is zero, unless all of a sudden you go back to Wisconsin and decide that you don't like your--and I mean this positively--your crusade for fiscal responsibility anymore.  I pointed out in the beginning, one thing I have found out about you is your tenacity. I can't believe there is any reasonable prospect that the scenario you fear has any prospect of occurring while you are here. I don't think it is occurring period, but in terms of what is likely to happen, I don't want to be a board member when they come back and tell you, ``By the way, we're not privatizing,'' and ``By the way, we want more money,'' and ``By the way, we're increasing our salaries,'' all of which would have to come through here.  I will argue again, if it is buried inside the State Department, you have a much better chance of it occurring there than if it is sitting out in the cold light of day, and I mean that sincerely.
