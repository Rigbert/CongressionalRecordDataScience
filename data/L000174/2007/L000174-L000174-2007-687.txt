President, today I wish to tell my colleagues in the Senate about a family-owned telephone business in Vermont that has once again led the industry in customer service and technological advances. Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom has successfully delivered high-speed broadband Internet service capability by way of Digital Subscriber Line, DSL, technology to every single one of its customers something most of its competitors have found difficult, if not impossible, to do.  The beautiful rural and mountainous landscape that makes Vermont such a wonderful place to live has proven to be a stubborn barrier in delivering broadband access to every Vermonter. Moreover, as one of the country's most rural States, Vermont struggles to implement large broadband infrastructure investments that reach relatively small population densities. Yet in the Mad River Valley--where Mother Nature has deposited plenty of these beautiful yet stubborn barriers and people settled where they wanted to and not where the roads told them to--Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom found a way to ensure that their customers have an access ramp to the information super highway.  By making this significant investment in their own network, Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom has invested in the economic vitality of every household it serves. Broadband access is a necessity for the company looking to move to Vermont, for the student writing a research paper, or for the family doing research on an upcoming vacation. So much of our country's economy depends upon high-speed Internet access, and making this access available to every American will require more companies willing to follow the lead of Vermont's own Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom.  Waitsfield and Champlain Valley Telecom is a growing company, but it remains independently owned and operated by the Haskin family, under the leadership of Gregg Haskin. My wife Marcelle and I are proud to call the Haskins close friends, and we are even prouder of the deep commitment they have to their community. We wish them continued success, and I hope that my friends in the Senate will take this story back to their home States and point to this company's model as a key factor toward bridging the digital divide.                          ____________________
