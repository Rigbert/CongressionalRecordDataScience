5 an hour. Imagine what that translates into if you are working at $5.15. Double that if you are working two jobs. Say you worked 80 hours a week at $5.15 an hour. What a glorious life you would lead.  The Senator from Nevada comes back to the point I was trying to make earlier. Whether you are talking about the cost of health insurance, the cost of college education, prescription drugs in Medicare, or minimum wage, those issues certainly are higher priorities to this Senator and to most of the people I represent than whether or not people who are worth literally millions and millions of dollars are going to get a tax break.  The Senator from Texas is entitled to his point of view. I respect him for being very honest about it. But I hope this Senate comes down to some face-to-face votes, some real votes on real issues that mean something to families across Nevada and Illinois.
