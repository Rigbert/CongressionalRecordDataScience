President, I ask unanimous consent that some additional op-ed pieces, columns, and others be printed in the Record regarding this nomination.  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 19, 2001]                         Ashcroft The Activist                         (By William Raspberry)       Opponents of John Ashcroft's nomination to become attorney      general have been turning over every rock in sight, hoping to      find some outrageous statement, some political skeleton, some      evidence that he is unfit to be the nation's chief law      enforcement officer.       His supporters have been doing their best to prove that the      nominee is technically qualified for the job and is,      moreover, a decent man who would enforce the law fairly.       The whole thing seems to be missing the point. I have never      doubted Ashcroft's decency, never questioned his legal      abilities, never worried that, in a particular case, he would      be unfair.       But the attorney general is not just the nation's chief      cop. He is also the chief influencer of our law-enforcement      policy.       It is from that office that decisions are made on which      laws to enforce, and how vigorously; what discretion ought to      be exercised, and in which direction; how law-enforcement      resources should be deployed, and with what emphases. Bland      reassurances that Ashcroft would ``enforce the law fairly''      aren't much help.       To take a simple example, what does it mean to enforce      America's drug laws ``fairly''? Does it mean locking up      anybody caught with illegal drugs, as the law permits? Does      it mean focusing resources on major traffickers, as the law      also permits? Does it mean shifting resources from      enforcement to treatment--or the other way around? Does it      mean confiscating more and more assets of people found in      violation of the drug laws? The law allows all these things--     allows as well the disparate sentencing for powdered and      ``crack'' cocaine and the well-documented racial disparity      that results from it.       To promise to enforce the law without talking about which      policies would be emphasized or changed is to say nothing at      all. Absent a president with strong feelings on the matter,      law-enforcement policy is largely left to attorneys general      to decide. Some have gone against discrimination, some      against organized crime, some against monopolies and trusts.      Some have followed public sentiment, and some have gone their      own     way. Most of the time, it hasn't mattered much. So why do so      many non-conservatives believe it will matter so much this      time?       The answer is in Ashcroft's record of advocacy. He has      fought with extraordinary vigor for positions that are well      outside the American mainstream--on gun control, on abortion,      on juvenile justice, on the death penalty. I don't mean to      deny that his position on all these issues might be shared by      a significant minority. I say only that his views are      unusually conservative. He is, I think it fair to say, an      ideologue. And when you take someone who has been advocating      views that are well away from the political center and put      him in charge of law-enforcement policy, it's not enough to      say he'll ``enforce the law.''       Ashcroft signaled his own understanding of this point when      he was asked whether he would try to undermine the 1973 Roe      v. Wade decision on abortion. He said that for the solicitor      general (who ranks under the attorney general) to petition      the Supreme Court to have another look at Roe would undermine      the Justice Department's standing before the court.       He was, as I read his response, saying he could make the      attempt, though it might be impolitic to do so at this time.       Is it unfair to oppose Ashcroft, an experienced lawyer, out      of fear that his personal and religious views would influence      his role as attorney general?       As Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) reminded us the other day, it      is a question Ashcroft himself has answered. When Bill Lann      Lee was named by President Clinton to head the Justice      Department's civil rights division, Ashcroft fought to deny      him the job.       He had no doubt concerning the nominee's professional      ability, Ashcroft said at the time, but Lee's beliefs (on      affirmative action) ``limit his capacity to have the balanced      view of making judgments that will be necessary for the      person who runs the division.''       Why can't the same assessment apply to the person who will      run the whole department?                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 18, 2001]                           Civil Rights `R Us                           (By Mary McGrory)       Obviously, it's a case of mistaken identity.       That man sitting before the Senate Judiciary Committee is      no kooky right-winger. He's not anti-black, anti-Catholic, or      antisemitic, as holding an honorary degree from Bob Jones      University might suggest. He is against abortion, he admits      it, but he'll observe Roe v. Wade. He's a man of law.       Segregation? He's against it. Never mind that he fought      integration when he was attorney general and governor of      Missouri. He's a little sentimental about the Confederacy,      yes, but if he had been alive at the time of the Civil War,      he would have fought for the Union. Don't call him a partisan      Republican, please. When he's looking for the name of an      illustrious predecessor at Justice, Robert Kennedy leaps into      his mind. Harry Truman leads his list of prominent      Missourians.       This is an erstwhile club member who thanks senators for      mean questions and humbly praises their candor when they      blast his record.       Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) noted his sense of humor and      pointed out how handy it would be when the witness was      discussing ``the death penalty and other weighty matters'' at      the Justice Department.       The makeover of John Ashcroft, a cranky extremist, for his      confirmation hearings is a masterpiece. His handlers have      created a genial healer; his haberdashery is impeccable and      so are his manners. Five young men with black suits and stern      expressions sit a row behind him and hand over notes when      things get dicey.       This graduate of Yale and Harvard Law is pretty      sophisticated about most things, but not about hot potatoes      like Bob Jones U. and Southern Partisan magazine, a      publication to which he confided his misty-eyed appreciation      for the Confederacy, and one that has a profitable sideline      in T-shirts celebrating the assassination of Lincoln.      Wouldn't you know Lincoln is Ashcroft's favorite political      figure? He was shocked, shocked to learn about Southern      Partisan's excesses.       Ashcroft the nominee was engulfed in loving friends,      colleagues and family with a heavy sprinkling of blacks and      women who were so conspicuous in the protest groups outside.      This John Ashcroft wouldn't dream of turning down a      president's choice for the Cabinet just because there were      differences of opinion. He's tolerant almost to a fault, and      his opening statement could have been the bid of an aspirant      to the chairmanship of the ACLU, not top gun for George W.      Bush's legal team.       Opening day theatrics went like clockwork. Sen. Jean      Carnahan (D-Mo.), the widow of Ashcroft's opponent, Gov. Mel      Carnahan, brought her poignant dignity to a cameo appearance      as a presenter of the nominee. Her words were notably chilly.      She urged her colleagues to be fair, but it made a nice      picture.       Committee Republicans came through with econiums to the      nominee's character and integrity. Sen. Charles Grassley (R-     Iowa) fervently praised Ashcroft as someone ``who always does      right by the family farmer.'' Even Ashcroft's 2-year-old red-     headed grandson, Jimmy, performed perfectly. He came onto the      scene wailing, but his grandfather cheerfully introduced him      and he fell miraculously quiet.       On Day Two, a little celebrity caucus was brought on just      before the lunch break. Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) gushed      about Ashcroft. So did former senator John Danforth (R-Mo.),      the patron of Clarence Thomas, Bush I's land mine Supreme      Court appointment. Like father, like son: Thomas was supposed      to flatten all objections because he is black; for Bush II,      Ashcroft's club membership is expected to stifle resistance.       There were moments of discord and disbelief, but these were      treated like caterer's mistakes at a splashy wedding. Sen.      Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) challenged Ashcroft's record on      school desegregation and voter registration. In Missouri,      Ashcroft had resisted a voluntary desegregation plan and      vetoed a registration expansion scheme. To answer Kennedy,      Ashcroft read his veto messages.       If the hearings resume next week, Ashcroft can expect a      kinder, gentler hand on the gavel in the person of Sen. Orrin      Hatch (R-Utah). Sen. Pat Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, was      temporary chairman but turns into a pumpkin when W. takes the      oath.       There's only one thing wrong with the Ashcroft picture, the      figure of Judge Ronnie White, the Missouri Supreme Court      judge who was deprived of a seat on the federal bench by the      persecution of Ashcroft, who got every Republican in the      Senate to vote against his nomination. Ashcroft found White      insufficiently enthusiastic about the death penalty.       By all accounts, Ronnie White is a distinguished member of      the State Supreme Court. Ashcroft misrepresented his record.      Ronnie White is black. Ashcroft, his allies insist, is no      racist. Did he slander Ronnie White for crass politics--an      effort to make the death sentence an issue in his campaign      against Carnahan? The paragon in the witness chair would not      do anything like that. Malice is a singularly unattractive      trait in an attorney general.                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, Jan. 18, 2001]                      The Ashcroft Double Standard                           (By Richard Cohen)       A review of the record, a reading of the relevant      transcripts and some telephone interviews with people in the      know lead me to conclude that if John Ashcroft were a      Democrat, he would oppose his own nomination as attorney      general. For once, he would be right.       The Ashcroft of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings is      a package of hypocrisy. His message is that his ideology,      hard right and intolerant, ought to be beside the point. What      is supposed to matter is his determination to uphold the law,      even the laws he believes are in contradiction to what God      himself intends. This is what Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)      calls the ``Ashcroft standard.'' It is utter nonsense.       Take, for instance, the way Ashcroft handled the nomination      of James C. Hormel as ambassador to Luxembourg. Hormel was a      man of some accomplishment as, in fact, Ashcroft had      firsthand reason to know. Back in 1964, Hormel was a dean at      the University of Chicago Law School when Ashcroft was a      student there. Nonetheless, Hormel was gay and not      particularly shy about it, either. For that reason--and that      reason only--Ashcroft opposed the nomination.       This episode tells you quite a bit about Ashcroft. By any      measure, Hormel was certainly qualified to be ambassador to      this dot of a European country. As mentioned, he had been the      dean of a prestigious law school, had become a well-known San      Francisco civic leader and philanthropist and had been      endorsed by, among others, the Episcopal bishop of      California, the Right Rev. William Swing, and the former      everything (secretary of state, etc.), George Shultz.       Ashcroft was unmoved. Along with Trent Lott, he considered      homosexuality a sin and, as with racists, polygamists,      misogynists and you-name-its, he could cite this or that      passage of the Bible to support his intolerance. Whatever the      reason, he would not even meet with Hormel. He would not take      his phone calls.       Ashcroft explained his vote against Hormel in committee as      one based on the fear that Hormel was ``promoting a      lifestyle'' and what, when you come to think of it, this      might mean to embattled Luxembourg. And then he said this:      ``People who are nominated to represent this country have to      be evaluated for whether they represent the country well and      fairly.''       There you have it: The Perry Mason Moment in which Ashcroft      blurts out the reason he is not suited to be attorney      general. His qualifications, as with Hormel's, are beside the      point. It's what he advocates that matters--whether, as he      would put it, he represents the country well and fairly.       It's Ashcroft's extreme views on abortion--not late-term or      mid-term, but what you might call pre-term. (He would ban so-     called morning-after pills.) It's his approach to gun      control, his reactionary approach to civil rights      legislation, his opposition to lifesaving needle exchange      programs or his insistence that drug treatment programs are a      sheer waste of money since junkies can--to quote an old Nat      King Cole tune--simply ``Straighten Up and Fly Right.'' Only      experience teaches otherwise.       It might be one thing if George W. Bush had won a mandate      for such policies. But he did not even win the popular vote.      In no way did the country register its support or even tacit      approval of the ``soft bigotry'' that     Ashcroft represents. It does not matter that he says he will      administer laws he doesn't particularly like; it matters only      that he is unsuited by rhetoric, ideology and political      conduct to lead our criminal justice system.       If confirmed, Ashcroft would be instrumental in picking the      next generation of federal judges. Bush has already declared      himself a committed delegator who will CEO the federal      government from the Oval Office. (He has a Harvard MBA, don't      forget.) If that's the case--and a man who was among the last      to know his vice presidential nominee had suffered a heart      attack clearly delegates to a fare-thee-well--then the job of      picking federal judges will be left to Ashcroft. The federal      bench is going to look like the faculty lounge at Bob Jones      University.       John Ashcroft must be laughing to himself. He knows that if      the shoe were on the other foot, he would never confirm an      attorney general who had views so antiethical to his own.      Maybe he'd find something in the Bible or, as he did with the      judicial nomination of Ronnie White, distort the record, but      he would be true to his beliefs. His opponents should be true      to theirs.                                  ____               [From the Chicago Tribune, Jan. 16, 2001]               The Confederacy's Favorite Cabinet Nominee                        (By Derrick Z. Jackson)       If the Senate Judiciary Committee straightens its backbone      rather than slap the back of attorney general nominee John      Ashcroft, we may get to see why his hallucinations about Bull      Run will make him a bull in the china closet of civil rights.       Any serious line of questioning should start like this:       Sen. Ashcroft, you praised Southern Partisan magazine for      ``defending'' patriots like Robert E. Lee, Stonewall Jackson,      and Jefferson Davis: ``Traditionalists must do more. I've got      to do more. We've all got to stand up and speak in this      respect, or else we'll be taught that these people were      giving their lives, subscribing their sacred fortunes and      their honor to some perverted agenda.''       Let's explore what you meant by that.       Senator, why are you, in the year 2001, praising Davis, the      president of the Confederacy, who personally italicized the      portions of the Constitution that preserved slavery? Why do      you laud a man who said white superiority over African-     Americans was ``stamped from the beginning, marked in decree      and prophecy''?       Why do you love a man whose vice president, Alexander      Stephens, said the ``cornerstone'' of the Confederacy ``rests      upon the great truth that the Negro is not equal to the white      man; that slavery, subordination, to the superior race, is      his natural and moral condition''?       Why do you complain about Davis being maligned by      historians when Davis tried to rewrite history? He said on      the floor of the U.S. Senate in 1860 that ``Negroes formed      but a small part of people of the southern states.''       For the record, in 1860 black people were 55 percent of the      population in Davis' home state of Mississippi, 58 percent of      South Carolina, and between a third to a half of the people      of most of the rest of the slave states.       Now, Senator, I am reading this sentence again, where you      say we've all got to stand up or else we'll be taught that      Davis, Lee, and Jackson were subscribing their ``sacred      fortunes'' to some ``perverted'' agenda. That sounds a lot      like what Davis said in his first Confederate inaugural      address when he said the North ``would pervert that most      sacred of all trusts.''       Senator, since we know that that sacred trust was slavery,      what is it that you are trying to say? Does that mean you      will not investigate charges of black voter fraud in Florida?       Senator, let's move on to Lee. You say today's history      books ``make no mention of Lee's military genius!'' Why is      that so important to you when the same Lee called Mexicans      ``idle worthless and vicious''? Why do you praise a man who      said as he exterminated Indians: ``The whole race is      extremely uninteresting . . . they are not worth it.'' Where      can we find Lee's genius in saying that killing Indians was      ``the only corrective they understand and the only way in      which they can be taught to keep within their own limits''?       Why is Lee so good when he justified the ripping of black      people out of Africa to enslave them by saying, ``The blacks      are immeasurably better off here than in Africa, morally,      socially, and physically. The painful discipline they are      undergoing is necessary for their instruction as a race''?       Why does Lee need to be revered when his troops, like other      Confederate divisions, hated free black people so much that      they sometimes massacred defeated black Union soldiers even      though they had thrown down their arms in surrender?       Senator, may I read you a passage from the new book, ``The      Making of Robert E. Lee,'' by Michael Fellman? A Confederate      major wrote in 1864 after one battle, ``such slaughter I have      not witnessed upon any battlefield anywhere.       ``Their men were principally Negroes and we shot them down      until we got near enough and then run them through with the      bayonet . . . We was not very particular whether we captured      or killed them, the only thing we did not like to be pestered      burying the heathens.''       Senator, why do you praise Lee when, after the Civil War,      he actively resisted Reconstruction? Lee said white people      are ``inflexibly opposed to any system of laws that would      place the political power of the country in the hands of the      Negro race.'' He said black people lacked the ``intelligence      . . . necessary to make them safe repositories of political      power.''       Senator, thank you, but in light of your reverence for such      men, we'll be asking President-elect George W. Bush to      appoint a less antebellum attorney general. As you leave,      stop by the front desk. The clerk will arrange for you to      participate in a Civil War re-enactment in the slave state of      your choice. Please send us a photo of your experience. We      would love to see who you dressed up as. We're betting      against Frederick Douglass.
