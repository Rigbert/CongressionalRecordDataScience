Madam Speaker, I am pleased to introduce legislation today which will transfer property from the Department of Health and Human Services to the Maniilaq Association in Kotzebue, Alaska. This transfer would occur through the Indian Health Service, the current owners of the properties.  Since 1995, Maniilaq Association, a Native non-profit entity in Kotzebue, Alaska has carried out a comprehensive health care delivery program to residents in Kotzebue, Alaska and the Northwest Arctic Borough. They have carried out these responsibilities under the Alaska Tribal Health Compact and Funding Agreement negotiated annually with the Indian Health Service. These agreements give Maniilaq Association the right to acquire title to all federal property that they have utilized to provide these health care services.  Currently, the Indian Health Service owns the properties that Maniilaq Association uses to carry out its health care delivery services. While there is an administrative process in place for them to acquire these properties, the process is cumbersome and sometimes may take years to accomplish the goal of acquiring these properties. Thus, Maniilaq Association is asking for legislation to acquire the properties listed in my legislation.  Madam Speaker, we are not setting a precedent with this legislation. Congress, in the past, has enacted legislation which transfers excess government properties to non-profits such as Maniilaq Association.  My legislation would authorize the Secretary of the Health and Human Services, through the Indian Health Service, to transfer to the Maniilaq Association by a warranty deed to a number of parcels of land legally described in my legislation.  I am pleased to introduce this legislation on behalf of Maniilaq Association to allow them to continue with their health care delivery programs and to provide better services to their patients and residents of the Northwest Arctic Borough.                          ____________________
