 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Idaho for his contribution to this debate and the other Senators who spoke on our behalf during this discussion. This is a very important issue affecting the first amendment and the rights of all Americans to speak in the political process. I am confident that the motion to invoke cloture will not succeed.  I yield back the remainder of my time.
