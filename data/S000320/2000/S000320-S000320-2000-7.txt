 President, the Senate has before it the conference report to H.R. 4392, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. The conference report reflects the legislation, S. 2507, that was approved unanimously by the Select Committee on Intelligence on April 27, 2000, and amended and approved by the Senate on Monday, October 2.  I thank Senator Bryan, the vice chairman of the committee for his assistance in expediting this conference report. This is Senator Bryan's first year as vice chairman. It has been a pleasure to work cooperatively with him on a wide range of issues, and I regret that this also will be his last year on the committee and in the Senate.  The committee has been increasingly troubled by the NSA's growing inability to meet technological challenges and to provide America's leaders with vital signals intelligence, SIGINT. Success in NSA's mission is critical to our national security. Therefore, the conference report reflects the start of our investment in resources and support aimed at restoring the NSA's' capabilities.  I am proud to report that the conference report addresses the growing problem of leaks of classified information. The conferees endorsed the Senate provision that will close a gap in U.S. law to ensure the prosecution of all unauthorized disclosure of classified information. Successive directors of Central Intelligence have decried the growing problem of leaks of classified information and the damage it causes to our national security. DCI Tenet has publically stated that the U.S. Government ``leaks like a sieve.''  Arguments that section 304 will stifle the freedom of the press simply don't pass muster. This provision has nothing to do with restraining publication. It simply criminalizes knowing and willful disclosure of properly classified information by those charged with protecting it. The Senate Intelligence Committee unanimously approved this provision and worked closely with the Attorney General and the intelligence community to incorporate changes requested by the Department of Justice. The Departments of Justice and State and the CIA all support the provision as approved by the conference committee.  Another provision of the bill is designed to ensure that the State Department corrects the serious, systemic security weaknesses that have repeatedly placed at risk sensitive classified intelligence information collected at considerable risk and expense. This provision would require that the Director of Central Intelligence certify that the retention and storage of Sensitive Compartmented Information (SCI) by any element of the State is in full compliance with all applicable DCI directives relating to the handling, retention, or storage of such information.  The bill requires the Director of Central Intelligence, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, to create an analytic capability for intelligence relating to prisoners of war and missing persons. The analytic capability will extend to activities with respect to prisoners of war and missing persons after December 31, 1990.  Also, the bill strengthens the IG's requirements to be fully engaged in investigating and responding to possible wrongdoing by senior CIA officials. In the wake of the investigation of former Director of Central Intelligence John Deutch this provision will ensure that the CIA policies its senior officials.  The conference report also contains the Counterintelligence Reform Act of 2000. S. 2089 was introduced by Senators Specter, Torricelli, Thurmond, Biden, Grassley, Feingold, Helms, Schumer, Sessions, and Leahy in April in the wake of Congressional and other investigations into PRC espionage against the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons laboratories and other U.S. government facilities, and the U.S. government's response. Those investigations focused attention on the application of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978, and highlighted coordination, information-sharing, and other problems within and among the Department of Energy, FBI, and Department of Justice. The amendment will correct some of the problems in coordinating and sharing information between federal agencies, and willclarify procedures and the statutory roles of various agencies in the investigation and prosecution of espionage and other cases affecting national security.  I thank all Senators for their cooperation in this conference report, particularly the members of the committee. I also thank the staff of the Select Committee on Intelligence for their hard work in developing this legislation.                              Section 304
