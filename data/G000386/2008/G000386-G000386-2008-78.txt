 President, I have been examining several doctors at universities across the country to see if they are complying with the financial disclosure policies of the National Institutes of Health. I ask unanimous consent to have my latest letters to Stanford University and to the National Institutes of Health printed in the Record.  I yield the floor.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                      U.S. Senate,                                         Committee on Finance,                                    Washington, DC, July 30, 2008.     Dr. John L. Hennessy,     President, Stanford University, Office of the President,          Stanford, CA.       Dear Dr. Hennessy: First, I would like to thank you for      your prompt attention to the matter involving payments made      by pharmaceutical companies to Dr. Alan Schatzberg, Chairman      of the Department of Psychiatry at Stanford University      (Stanford/University). Investigators with the Senate Finance      Committee (Committee) believe that the following chart      provides a better representation of Dr. Schatzberg's      disclosures to Stanford and company reports to the Committee.       Committee investigators understand that differences in      reporting requirements and accounting methods may result in      differences between Dr. Schatzberg's reports and reports from      companies that can only be explained in writing. The      Committee understands that Stanford will provide a      comprehensive response to the initial letter sometime soon,      which will include these details. Stanford has notified the      Committee that any discrepancies in the chart are most likely      due to differences in accounting between Stanford and the      various companies contacted by the Committee.       As Stanford pointed out in a public statement, there was an      error in the chart that the Committee sent to you regarding      payments from Eli Lilly to Dr. Schatzberg in 2007. That chart      stated that Dr. Schatzberg had ``not reported'' this money      when in fact he had. Therefore, this letter is being placed      in the congressional record to correct the official record.       Stanford also noted that Dr. Schatzberg's reports on      payments from Eli Lilly in 2004 include compensation of less      than $10,000 for advisory board activities and $10,000 to      $50,000 for honoraria for papers, lectures and consulting.      This also matches the footnote in the Committee's chart and      appears to capture all the monies reported by Eli Lilly      ($52,134) for that year.       However, Committee investigators still have concerns      regarding Johnson & Johnson's report of paying Dr. Schatzberg      $22,000 in 2002. According to Stanford's statement, ``Dr.      Schatzberg did disclose this payment to the university and      also reported it to the Committee. He disclosed the      $22,000 payment from Jannsen, the wholly-owned subsidiary      of Johnson & Johnson that made the payment.'' The reason      that we continue to be concerned is because Dr. Schatzberg      reported less than $10,000 from Jannsen for academic year      2002 (September 2, 2001 through August 31, 2002) and less      than $10,000 for academic year 2003 (September 1, 2002      through August 31, 2003). Johnson & Johnson did not      delineate payments from subsidiaries such as Jannsen when      it reported the information to the Committee. Johnson &      Johnson reported a payment of ``fee for services'' of      $22,000 to Dr. Schatzberg on August 19, 2002. Even noting      differences in accounting methods, Dr. Schatzberg's      reports on Jannsen do not appear to fully explain the      discrepancy.       Inconsistencies also appear among the payments reported to      us by Eli Lilly in 2002. Eli Lilly reported paying Dr.      Schatzberg $19,788 that calendar year. However, Dr.      Schatzberg reported that he received less than $10,000 from      Eli Lilly for academic year 2002 (September 2, 2001 through      August 31, 2002) and more than $10,000 for academic year 2003      (September 1, 2002 through August 31, 2003). Noting possible      differences in accounting methods, Dr. Schatzberg's reports      on Eli Lilly may explain the discrepancy, but only if one      combined the 2002 and 2003 academic years.       Further, based on documents in our possession, it appears      that Wyeth paid Dr. Schatzberg for testifying as an expert      witness in 2006. This work was in response to lawsuits      brought against Wyeth regarding its antidepressant, Effexor.      As Dr. Schatzberg wrote in an undated expert report on behalf      of Wyeth, ``My hourly rate for review of materials or for      testimony is $500.'' Dr. Schatzberg was apparently an expert      witness in at least two cases for Wyeth, but payments for      this work cannot be found in his reports of outside income to      Stanford. Therefore, I would appreciate your clarification of      Dr. Schatzberg's expert witness fees and how they are      recorded on Stanford's financial disclosure forms.       Thank you again for your continued cooperation and      assistance in this matter. I look forward to a complete      response to outstanding questions in the near future. If you      have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact Paul      Thacker at (202) 224-4515.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                   Ranking Member.       Attachment. SELECTED DISCLOSURES BY DR.
