Speaker, continuing my reservation of objection, I would like to inform the Members of the House that I am certainly not going to have the Clerk read the 229 pages. But we do not know what is in the motion to recommit. We have a summary here that has been handed to me about 30 seconds ago and, under my reservation, perhaps if the gentleman from Texas could answer several questions, we could expedite the process.  Mr. Speaker, further reserving the right to object, I yield to the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Stenholm].
