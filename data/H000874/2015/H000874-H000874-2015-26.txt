It will be better for the country and better for the House if we do that.  The gentleman also referenced tax extenders. Obviously, we have tax extenders that expired in December of 2014, which have not been extended. Does the gentleman have any knowledge as to whether or not we have reached an agreement on a tax extender bill and, if so, the substance of that and when it might be scheduled?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman knows, this side of the aisle did not want to wait on tax extenders, and many times we have passed the bills here to make them permanent.  There are ongoing negotiations. There is good movement, and I hope to see that done very soon. When it is, I will advise the Members of the action to be taking place.
