Mr. Speaker, this legislation, the Department of State Authorities Act of 2006, contains several important provisions that will positively impact upon the safety of our country and our citizens and promote good governance.  The legislation has been worked out in a bipartisan way with my friend and colleague from California (Mr. Lantos) and enjoys, I believe, very strong support on both sides of the aisle.  One provision, Mr. Speaker, would give the Secretary of State needed flexibility in spending fraud prevention and detection fund moneys to permit investigation of a broader array of fraud, including fraud in connection with terrorist activity. Another would allow for the waiver of fees for passports when U.S. citizens are caught in difficult situations abroad, such as those who were victims of the 2004 tsunami. A criminal provision provides for penalties when an individual interferes with a Secret Service agent protecting a foreign dignitary. And passage of the bill would give the President authorization to extend privileges and immunities to the Holy See's Observer Mission to the United Nations and to the African Union's newly established diplomatic mission to the United States.  Mr. Speaker, the manager's amendment would also establish the outlines of two programs under the Foreign Assistance Act. One would provide for greater international cooperation with friendly foreign governments with respect to the interdiction of dangerous cargo. The second would authorize an accelerated program to secure and eliminate particularly dangerous conventional weapons, such as man-portable air defense systems, commonly referred to as MANPADS. I would point out parenthetically that it was Colin Powell in one speech who said that the largest danger, the most acute danger to aviation, whether it be criminal or whether it be military or civilian, are these stinger-like MANPADS. They are very, very dangerous and there are hundreds of thousands of those out. They are very much in the black market. If terrorists get their hands on those, we are in serious trouble. Under the bill's provisions, sanctions could be imposed on foreign governments who knowingly transfer such weapons to terrorists.  Finally, the bill would extend the duration of certain types of assistance we have been providing to Israel for a number of years. Specifically, the bill would extend for an additional 2 years the authorization provided in the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2005 for the United States to transfer to Israel obsolete or surplus stocks in the war reserve stockpile located in Israel.  Similarly, the bill would extend for an additional 4 years a provision in the Emergency Wartime Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2003 to provide loan guarantees to Israel, the authorization of which is scheduled to expire.  Mr. Speaker, let me just say briefly, I do regret that the bill does not contain an important provision for the reform of the Foreign Service compensation system, a very, very well-worked-out piece of legislation, but regrettably that was dropped from the bill.  I include an exchange of correspondence relating to this bill.                                                 December 8, 2006.     Hon. Tom Davis,     Chairman, Committee on Government Reform, House of          Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning the bill,      H.R. 6060, the ``Department of State Authorities Act of      2006.'' The Committee on International Relations ordered the      bill reported favorably on September 13, 2006.       There are certain provisions within the bill that will be      considered by the House today that fall within the      jurisdiction of the Committee on Government Reform. In the      interest of permitting the Committee on International      Relations to proceed expeditiously to floor consideration of      this bill, I request that your Committee waive its right to      sequential referral on this matter. I understand that such a      waiver only applies to this language in the bill and not to      the underlying subject matter.       I appreciate your willingness to allow us to proceed. I      will insert this exchange of letters into the Congressional      Record during the debate on this bill.           Sincerely,                                                    Henry J. Hyde,                                                         Chairman.                                       ____                                                 December 8, 2006.     Hon. Henry J. Hyde,     Chairman, Committee on International Relations, House of          Representatives, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On September 13, 2006, the Committee on      International Relations ordered reported favorably to the      House H.R. 6060, the ``Department of State Authorities Act of      2006.'' Thank you for consulting with the Committee on      Government Reform on those matters in H.R. 6060 within the      Committee's jurisdiction. I am writing to confirm our mutual      understanding with respect to the consideration of H.R. 6060.       In the interest of expediting the House's consideration of      H.R. 6060, the Committee on Government Reform did not request      a sequential referral of the bill. However, the Committee did      so only with the understanding that this procedural route      will not prejudice the Committee's jurisdictional interest      and its prerogatives in this bill or similar legislation.       I request that you include our exchange of letters on this      matter in the Congressional Record during consideration of      this bill on the House floor. Thank you for your attention to      these matters.           Sincerely,                                                        Tom Davis,                                                         Chairman.  At this point, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
