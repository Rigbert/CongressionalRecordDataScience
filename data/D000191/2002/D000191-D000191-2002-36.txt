Speaker, tomorrow the House of Representatives will consider a proposal by the Republican majority to permanently repeal the estate tax.  Now, we had a vigorous debate over the estate tax last year; and I along with many others supported a reform of the estate tax that would lead to the exemption of 99\1/2\ percent of the estates in the United States of America. But to take and permanently repeal the tax as will be proposed tomorrow for the largest estates will be an extraordinarily expensive measure and add dramatically to the deficit of the United States and ultimately undermine the Social Security trust fund of the United States.  Permanent repeal would cost $740 billion, B, billion dollars, over the next decade after 2012. But if we were to instead say, well, let us exempt the first $5 million of everybody's estate, now that seems like a pretty reasonable step. We do not want people, for instance, in my district or in Oregon who own forestry, tree farms, to go out and prematurely harvest the trees so they have to pay their estates taxes. We do not want people to have to break up their small businesses so they can pay their estates taxes. Those things are well and good. We could do that. We could easily do that.  The current law will exempt by the year 2009 the first $3.5 million of each estate. So let us just round that up to $5 million. So if we did that, that would reserve $400 billion in taxes or $400 billion of money that would not be drained from the Social Security trust fund to help pay for the retirement of the baby boom.  Now, it is true that there would be some 4 or 500 estates a year worth more than $5 million who would have to pay taxes to support the 53 million people on Social Security.                              {time}  1645  I believe that they can afford that burden. Some say, well, we know they should not pay taxes twice. Well, guess what, most of them will not pay taxes twice. In fact, the way the current laws are set up, many of these estates have unrealized capital gains, and if those estates are exempt from taxation, not even the lower rate of capital gains will be paid.  The American working people have to pay day in, day out a substantial portion of their income to Social Security, day in, day out a substantial portion of their income in income taxes, but these people with the estates worth more than $5 million would never, ever pay a penny in taxes. The unrealized capital gains would be rolled over into the estates, the estates would be tax-exempt, all at a cost of $400 billion to the rest of the United States of America, the rest of the taxpayers in this country.  This is not fair. It is not fiscally prudent, and the Republican majority should be ashamed of pushing this through at this time of financial crisis. We are looking at a $300 billion deficit this year. The Social Security lock box that they had us vote on seven times, which I voted for seven times, has been busted open and depleted. There is nothing, nothing going into it over the next 10 years, and for the next 10 yearsafter that; if they permanently repeal the estate tax for estates worth more than $5 million, in fact, the Social Security trust fund will continue to be drained.  So we will threaten the benefit of 53 million Americans' Social Security benefits to benefit a handful of extraordinarily wealthy families. This is not the America that I know and I love.  The estate tax was put in place nearly a century ago by a Republican president because the accumulation of wealth generation to generation was creating extraordinary disparities in our society, and the idea was, well, those people should help carry a little bit more of the burden, but if this becomes law, if they are successful tomorrow, as I suspect they might be, then many of these estates, many of these families will never, ever contribute to the collective burdens of citizenship in the United States, much as many corporations are now setting up phony overseas offices in Bermuda and Luxembourg to avoid paying taxes on overseas or U.S. earnings.  We will ultimately, if they are successful, be a country where only wage-earning Americans pay taxes and those that live off the accumulated wealth of their predecessors and the largest corporations will not contribute a penny. This is not right, and my colleagues should vote against this legislation tomorrow for fiscal prudence and for fairness.                          ____________________
