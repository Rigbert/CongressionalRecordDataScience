President, I rise today to lend my strong support to the amendment offered by the Senator from Ohio. I would also like to recognize the leadership that the Senator from Kansas, Mr. Brownback, and the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, have shown on the issue of Sudan throughout the years.  This amendment mirrors efforts in the House of Representatives appropriations bill to add $95 million to address the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, Sudan and across the border in Chad.  It is a good start and I commend the chairman and ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee for accepting this amendment. However, it is only a start, and a modest one at that.  We should be providing at least double this amount to address what is the worst humanitarian crisis that exists in the world today. I hope that by the time we conclude debate on this bill the Senate will have agreed to additional funds for Sudan.
