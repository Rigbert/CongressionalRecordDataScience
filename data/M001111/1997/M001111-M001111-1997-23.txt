 President, this morning the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [NOAA] presented the 1997 Walter B. Jones Memorial and NOAA Excellence Awards for Coastal and Ocean Resource Management. A number of distinguished citizens, students, and public servants were honored for their commitment to the protection, conservation, and sustainable use of our Nation's precious coastal resources. I would like to offer my praise and admiration to all of the award recipients for their hard work and dedication to this critical area of ecological and economic concern.  Over one-half of the U.S. population resides within 50 miles of the coast. All of these people and the associated development and other activities that accompany them place extraordinary pressure on the ecosystems, watersheds, and communities on our coasts. Coastal areas provide incredible commercial, recreational, and aesthetic benefits to the American people. The Walter B. Jones and NOAA awards recognize individuals who have taken on the challenge of protecting these coastal areas and ensuring these benefits are not lost.  While I congratulate all of the award recipients, I would like to acknowledge two Washington State recipients in particular. Recipients of the Excellence in Coastal and Marine Graduate Study Award, Lillian Ferguson and John Field, from the University of Washington School of Marine Affairs. I am honored to have these two bright graduate students represent Washington State and our commitment to the protection of coastal areas.  Lillian Ferguson's works focuses on management of maritime transportation and marine protected areas. As a summer intern (1996) for the Olympic Coast National Marine Sanctuary [OCNMS] she developed a program for documentation and analysis of vessel traffic in the congested entrance and approaches to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Her work formed the basis for recent implementation of the program by the OCNMS this year. This prototype program may be suitable for adoption in many similar situations in the United States and abroad. During the academic year 1996-97, Lillian is the Project Assistant for the Safe Marine Transportation Forum [SMART Forum]. In this capacity she promotes dialogue among more than 20 stakeholder interests on marine safety and transportation on Puget Sound. Lillian has also contributed as a research assistant to the National Coastal Zone Management Effectiveness Study recently completed for OCRM/NOAA. Her thesis work analyzes the development of interjurisditional collaboration in managing marine environments between the NMS Program and the U.S. National Park Service. Lillian has made significant contributions with the work she has already completed. Her thesis should be quite informative and valuable in improving interjurisdictional cooperation between the NMS Program and other Federal and State entities.  John Field's work focuses on the initial impacts of regional climate change. For approximately 2 years John has been a Research Assistant in the Integrated Regional Assessment Program for the Pacific Northwest sponsored by NOAA through the Joint Institute for Study of the Atmosphere and Ocean [JISAO, Principal Investigator Ed Miles]. His role and responsibilities have been especially difficult to perform given the scant attention to systematic monitoring of coastal impacts. John has done a superb job of combining disparate data sets, anecdotal information, and informed experience to document key issues and trends relevant to projected Global Climate Change scenarios. His efforts form the stage on which interdisciplinary team-based integration can take place. John coauthored with Marc Hershman a report on this work and is currently completing his thesis documenting and expanding somewhat on the findings. This research should assist the development of coastal impact scenarios under regional climate change assessments elsewhere. Besides this work John has been the coordinator for a very successful joint seminar between the School of Marine Affairs and the fishing industry. In addition, John has been working during the summer on a seabed coring project led by Prof. Robert Francis to obtain Paleo-records of fish and shellfish abundance in the North Pacific.  Both of these award recipients have worked hard for the sake of our coastal resources in Washington State. As they move on from graduate work and enter the work force either in public service, nongovernmental organizations, or private industry, I know they will continue in their commitment to the protection, conservation, and sustainable use of our coastal resources. With students such as Lillian and John in our graduate schools, I am confident about the future of our coastal areas as the challenges confronting these areas and those of us who care about them become increasingly complex. And to Lillian and John, congratulations.                          ____________________
