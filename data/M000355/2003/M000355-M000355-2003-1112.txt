 President, this is exactly the wrong time to be taking away IMET from the Indonesian military. For 10 years they were prohibited from having the kind of military-to-military relationship with us that helps upgrade their military and teach them about human rights and to do the right thing regarding their own people. It took a long time to get IMET restored, and the leader of that effort was Senator Inouye of Hawaii--that bipartisan effort to get IMET restored. Now we would take a step in the wrong direction.  (At the request of Mr. McConnell, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)
