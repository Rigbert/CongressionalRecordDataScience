Mr. Speaker, I want to thank you and the other members of our House leadership for introducing this important, bi-partisan resolution.  Tragically, our country will now be commemorating not only the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, but also the attacks on the United States consulate in Benghazi, Libya, that occurred on the same date last week.  The four U.S. citizens who lost their lives, especially Ambassador John Christopher Stevens, and those who were injured in this unjustified act of violence demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to our country's national security and Libya's democracy. I would like to convey my heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims.  I also want to express my ongoing support and gratitude for all the Foreign Service men and women who are promoting American values and interests abroad. It is on occasions such as this that we are reminded of the many sacrifices that they make in service to our country. In addition to living in foreign lands away from their families and adapting to new cultures and languages, many of them daily face the possible ultimate sacrifice of their lives. The violence that occurred last week at our diplomatic missions in several countries must renew our national commitment to doing our best to ensure their safety.  Mr. Speaker, there is no justification for the recent attacks on U.S. diplomatic missions and the taking of innocent American lives in Benghazi. All governments must take appropriate measures to ensure the security of U.S. diplomatic facilities within their borders, and to end these acts of terrorism.
