Speaker, I rise to remember Vincent Roper, who passed away on April 4 of natural causes at the age of 79.  For decades, Vince and his wife Roberta worked tirelessly to advance victims' rights in Prince George's County and throughout Maryland, advocating for rights and support services for crime victims and their families as they heal and seek justice.  Vince and Roberta suffered an unimaginable tragedy in 1982 when their daughter, Stephanie, was murdered. Following this tragic crime, the Roper family wasn't permitted to observe the trial and was denied the right to address the court at the sentencing. Their frustration led them to establish the Stephanie Roper Committee and Foundation, Inc., which is now known as the Maryland Crime Victims' Resource Center. The Center actively lobbies legislators in Annapolis and played a significant role in the passage of the Federal Crime Victims Rights Act, the Maryland Crime Victims Rights Act of 1997, and other legislation that is making a substantial difference in the lives of crime victims and their families in Maryland.  Born in Hazleton, Pennsylvania, in 1933, Vince later enlisted in the U.S. Navy at the age of 17 and was selected to attend the U.S. Naval Academy. A graduate of the class of 1956, he served our nation for thirty years as a naval officer and retired as a Captain. In addition to serving as the Treasurer of the Stephanie Roper Committee and Foundation, he served our community as a member of the Knights of Columbus, the Most Holy Rosary Council No. 11511, and the Naval Weather Service Association.  Prince George's County and the State of Maryland owe a great deal to Vince for his hard work and dedication to ensuring that every crime victim in Maryland is treated with the dignity and respect they deserve. I join our community in mourning his passing, and my thoughts and prayers are with Roberta and their family.                          ____________________
