I ask the Senator from Rhode Island, who has followed this issue more closely than any other Senator on our side of the aisle, is my understanding correct that if this is enacted into law, as a result of this legislation, if you are a gun dealer and you sell a gun to someone you knew or should have known was in a drug gang, a criminal, a drug trafficker, someone who is likely to misuse that gun, use it for criminal purposes, that this bill says that the victims of the violence from that purchaser cannot hold the gun dealer responsible for his negligence in selling this gun to someone they knew or should have known was going to misuse it and create victims, tragic victims, in their community?
