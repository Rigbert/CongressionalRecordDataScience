Orange County has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Fire Chief Charles ``Chip'' Prather is one of these individuals. Chief Prather is retiring from the Orange County Fire Authority (OCFA) and today I honor his years of public service.  Chief Prather became Fire Chief for the Orange County Fire Authority on October 1, 1997. In this capacity he is responsible for the daily operation of one of the largest fire organizations in the State of California. Under Chief Prather's direction are a total of 1,500 firefighters, reserves and professional staff.
