President, I ask unanimous consent to have two articles printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the articles were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Los Angeles Times, Apr. 11, 2000]       Air Passengers ``Fed Up'' With Poor Service, Survey Finds                        (By Randolph E. Schmid)       Washington.--U.S. airlines spent a lot of time last year      promising things would get better for their customers, but a      new study suggests just the opposite occurred: Consumer      complaints more than doubled.       ``You can see that consumers are just fed up, fed up with      poor service,'' Brent Bowen of the University of Nebraska at      Omaha said in announcing the survey results Monday.       Consumer complaints were up 130% from 1998 to 1999, said      Dean Headley of Wichita State University. They rose from 1.08      complaints per 100,000 passengers in 1998 to 2.48 per 100,000      last year.       Headley noted that improved Internet access made it easier      to file complaints, but said that could not account for such      a large increase.       The annual report, based on data collected by the      Transportation Department, scores the air carriers on on-time      performance, baggage handling, consumer complaints and denied      boardings.       It found an overall decline in airline quality last year,      with only baggage handling showing a slight improvement.       The airlines instituted a consumer bill of rights in      December, after a year of pressure from Congress to improve      service. A report to Congress by the Transportation      Department's inspector general on how they are doing is      scheduled for June.       Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), who pressed for legislation last      year, said that if the upcoming report ``shows anything      resembling what this study shows, I think we can get a real      passenger bill of rights through Congress.''       ``The report demonstrates that the airlines are not      following through on the voluntary program,'' he said.      ``They, of course, claim that it's early and they have just      begun it . . . but this is an industry that again and again      finds reasons to give passenger service short shrift.''       Diana Cronan of the Air Transport Assn., which represents      the major airlines, noted that the airlines' voluntary      ``customer first'' plan was not put into effect until the end      of the year.       ``We really would like to see the results next year when      the plan has been in place for a full year. We really do      believe that things will be better,'' she said.       Southwest Airlines ranked best overall, as it did in 1997.      In 1998, the top spot went to USAirways, which fell to No. 6      in the new report.       This year, Continental finished second, followed by Delta,      Northwest and Alaska Airlines. American was No. 7, followed      by America West, TWA and United.       The report's only good news involved baggage handling. The      study found that the industry mishandled 5.08 bags per 1,000      passengers in 1999, down from 5.16 per 1,000 a year earlier.       On the other hand, there was a drop in the portion of      flights that arrived within 15 minutes of schedule. On-time      performance slipped from 77.2% to 76.1% and denied      boardings was virtually stable, edging from 0.87 per      10,000 passengers to 0.88.       The study was particularly critical of airlines for      instituting what they called a series of anti-consumer rules      designed to increase productivity.       These include tighter limits on carry-on bags, bans on      carry-on food, not allowing a consumer to take an earlier      connection when a seat is available and raising fees to      change tickets.       ``Soon, consumers will become driven by price and schedule      only and regard airline loyalty as having no tangible      value,'' the author concluded.       The Transportation Department, which independently reports      on airline performance, found similar problems through      February.       Consumers registered 1,999 complaints about the 10 largest      carriers in February, slightly down from January but nearly      double a year earlier.       It found that 74.8% of flights arrived on time in      February--also slightly better than in January but not as      good as 78.9% in February 1999.       The airlines had a mishandled baggage rate of 4.81 reports      per 1,000 passengers in February, an improvement from a year      earlier.       Headley acknowledged the new passenger bill of rights      instituted by airlines late last year and allowed that change      does take time. But, he argued, the steps promised by the      airlines were things they should have been doing already.       The carriers pledged to be more forthright with passengers      all the way through their travel experience. They promised to      volunteer the lowest air fares or cheaper travel options when      people call for reservations and to give passengers at least      24 hours to cancel ticket purchases.       They also said they would update passengers at 15- to 20-     minute intervals when there are delays.                        Airline Complaints Soar       Airline quality declined in 1999 despite efforts by the      carriers to improve service. The 10 major U.S. airlines      carried nearly 500 million domestic airline passengers in      1999. The volume of consumer complaints rose 130% over 1998.      Although improved reporting may account for some of the      increase, it does not account for all of it.

A year after the nation's 10 major airlines promised to      begin improving service in the face of mounting congressional      threats to enact a series of passenger protections, a survey      released yesterday shows that service in 1999 deteriorated in      almost every category.       Arlington-based US Airways plunged from first in 1998 to      sixth last year, showing poor performance in all service      categories surveyed.       ``We've acknowledged the issues. The numbers speak for      themselves,'' said US Airways spokesman Richard Weintraub. He      said government statistics since the start of the year      indicate that the airline is now headed back into the ``top      tier'' of airline service.       The survey--the Airline Quality Rating--is the 10th annual      report by two university professors who track the level of      service through government statistics gathered by the      Department of Transportation.       The findings were based on an airline's on-time      performance, baggage handling, consumer complaints and      involuntarily denied boardings, such as when an airline      overbooks a flight and forces some passengers to be denied      seats for which they had already paid. The only improvement      shown by the survey was a slight drop in complaints about      baggage handling.       The survey tracked the statistics for 10 major airlines      using the Department of Transportation's definition of      ``major.'' The airlines, rated from best to worst, were:      Southwest, Continental, Delta, Northwest, Alaska, US Airways,      American, American West, TWA and United.       ``We try to base this on pure performance, something the      airline has some control over,'' said Dean Headley of Wichita      State University and a coauthor of the survey with Brent      Bowen, director of the Aviation Institute at the University      of Nebraska in Omaha.       Headley said he was not surprised by the survey results,      but that he was frustrated by the rise in complaints against      the airlines, especially after they had all promised to      improve service. He said the Internet has made it easier for      people to complain but could not account for such a large      increase in the number of complaints--up 130 percent between      1998 and 1999.       In December, after nearly a year of promising to improve      service in the face of rising consumer complaints and      congressional threats, the airlines adopted what they called      a consumer bill of rights in an effort to head off threatened      government intervention on behalf of passengers. That threat      began in January 1999, when Northwest stranded a planeload of      passengers on a snowy Detroit runway for nearly eight hours.       Nebraska's Bowen said the report's conclusion that overall      industry quality continues to decline indicates that ``the      entire airline-sponsored plan to increase customer services      is failing.''       A spokeswoman for the Air Transport Association, the trade      group that represents the airlines, said the voluntary bill      of rights initiated by the airlines has only been in effect a      few months. She said the airlines' new policy should be in      place a full year before people judge whether service has      improved.       The transportation department's inspector general is      scheduled to issue a report to Congress in June on just how      well the airlines are doing. A negative report from DOT in an      election year is almost certain to rekindle calls for      congressional action.       Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), an advocate of legislation to      force better service from the airlines, said that if the      inspector general's report mirrors the conclusions of      yesterday's study, ``it really strengthens my hand.'' Wyden      said yesterday's survey ``was a credible report because these      fellows have been doing it a long time and they are not      normally industry bashers.''       Last year, Wyden proposed a bill that would force the      airlines to tell customers when a flight was overbooked and      to give them information on all available fares on a specific      flight. The bill would also allow passengers to get a refund      if they canceled a ticket at least 48 hours before a flight.       Headley and Bowen concluded that unless airlines improve      service, consumers will lose loyalty to individual carriers      and ``become driven by price and schedule only.''       But Headley said that despite his concerns about      deteriorating air service, he did not think setting industry      service standards was the answer. ``I'm a big fan of not      regulating if we can avoid it,'' he said.
