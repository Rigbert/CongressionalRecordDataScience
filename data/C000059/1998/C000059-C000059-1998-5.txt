Speaker, let me first thank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Lazio), the subcommittee chairman, for his hard work on this bill. As cochairman of the House Manufactured Housing Caucus, I can assure you of his dedication to improving our Nation's housing supply and giving all Americans the chance to own a home.  Mr. Speaker, two of our Nation's largest social problems are the need for greater access to affordable homes and the need to move people away from the dependency on subsidized housing. Manufactured housing, the fastest growing segment of the housing industry, helps solve these problems. The affordability of these homes allows senior citizens, young families and single parents to realize the American dream of homeownership.  Congress must help people reach this goal by considering the positive impact of manufactured homes when making housing policy. By improving the quality, safety and affordability of these homes, the American Homeownership Act does just this.  A yes vote on this bill is a yes vote for seniors, single parents, and young home buyers who want a place to call their own. It is a vote for the American dream. I urge a yes vote.
