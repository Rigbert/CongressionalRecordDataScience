President, in a year when we have seen such terrible news about New York, we do well to remind ourselves of all the good things that come from that great city.  One such thing was the awarding of Chevalier in the Legion D'Honneur to my friend, Melvin Van Peebles, by the Consul General of the Republic of France on April 24 of this year. The award was made to Mr. Van Peebles because of his work as an author, a producer, and a director of award-winning films.  I have known Melvin for years, and I know him as a man of conscience, talent, erudition, and eclectic friendships. I have always considered myself honored to be one of his friends. The man who first introduced me to Melvin was my good friend, Dr. Henry Jarecki, of New York, and he and Gloria Jarecki hosted the investiture at Gramercy House in New York City.  I ask consent to print in the Record the comments made by Dr. Jarecki at that event, and to add my own congratulations to Melvin Van Peebles for an award justly deserved.  The comments follow:                      Remarks of Dr. Henry Jarecki       Back in the fifties, while Melvin was becoming well-known      in America, I had been out of the country. So it is no      surprise that when Katie McGee first mentioned the name      Melvin Van Peebles some thirty-five years ago, I knew so      little about his work that I expected to meet a Dutchman. It      was indeed some years before I knew who I was dealing with      but in the meantime he had become a     close friend who I could hang out with and gab about      philosophy, somebody who was an advisor and when needed, a      fellow mischief-maker. Gradually, I got to see and know all      about the famous Sweetback movie and his other films and I      read and saw his plays, especially Ain't Supposed to Die a      Natural Death and Don't Play us Cheap, two of the ones I      think are among the great works of American literature. Waltz      of the Stork, a musical I backed, was not one of the great      works. Otherwise I would be rich today. But we reflected on a      lot more plays, too, including the Bessie Smith piece called      the Champeen that we argued about for five years and still      have to make.       Close friends sometimes disagree--we solved that by making      bets. One bet he lost made him work for me on Wall Street for      a year during which he became the first Black trader on the      American Stock Exchange. Not surprisingly, he wrote a book      about it as he does about almost anything he does. That book,      called Bold Money, introduced many nonprofessionals to the      world of security option trading. He always writes books      about what he does. He makes movies about the making of      movies and he writes books about the ``making of the making      of a movie'' movie. Happily, all of this piques his viewers'      and readers' interest and makes him a bunch of money.       But he's made a lot more than movies, plays, and money. He      has made a number of wonderful children, all of whom I've had      the pleasure of hanging out with over the years, Megan,      Mario, Max, and maybe more. Megan has the beauty and the      wonderful heart she had when she worked at Mocatta and Mario      has become a distinguished motion picture actor and director      himself. Very few people know that one of the steps of his      professional life, maybe the step that taught him all there      was to learn about acting before he went to Hollywood was      working as a gold trader for me at a company called Mocatta.       The Van Peebles children have been friends of my children      and Melvin himself has helped each of my children, most      recently my son Eugene, who made a film called The Opponent      based loosely on Eugene's early life friendship with Mike      Tyson. Melvin's most recent French film, A Belly Full, was      not the reason for this Legion of Honor award but was its      occasion.       Even before making a great name in America, Melvin had      become well-known in France, partly for his book and movie,      Story of a Three-Day Pass which had won many awards there,      and throughout his life he has remained an American bridge to      France, even having one French son, Max, who has helped him      work on many of his movies. And so this clearly American icon      has gradually become a French figure of the arts as well.       We are all honored to be here tonight with Melvin Van      Peebles to help celebrate his receiving this award from      Consul-General Richard Duque who honors us with his presence.      I personally have in my own very modest film-making career      achieved only one thing: when I, following in Melvin's      footsteps, was making a movie about Cuban music in Havana      with my friend Gary Keys, I managed to buy some Cuban cigars      and also a wonderfully appropriate humidor in which to keep      them. And so, Melvin, I take pleasure in presenting you with      this unusual-looking humidor and the accompanying box of      Cuban cigars. If you choose to give some of these cigars out      to some of your guests here, feel free to do so: I have a      second one upstairs. And those who worry about smoking Cuban      cigars--and I'm not one--can always say the words of Melvin's      friend Pat Leahy, the Senator from Vermont, who tells us that      he cannot be criticized for burning Castro's crops.       Thank you all for coming.                          ____________________
