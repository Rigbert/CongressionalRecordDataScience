Chairman, I agree to this time restraint, notwithstanding the fact this is an issue of great emotional impact and great political interest in this body and throughout the country.  This issue deals with the question of abortion. But I would suggest to the Members of this House, it does not deal with the public funding of abortion and that is the issue on which we have substantial disagreement.  The fact of the matter is, we have carried in this bill for some period of time the issue of the Federal employee health benefit plans. During the last 3 years we struck from the bill a prohibition on the use of funds which the public employees supply to the purchase of their Federal employment health policies.  Now, let me put this in context. There are available to Federal employees approximately 345 health benefit plans. A substantial number of those plans provide for the termination of pregnancy. The choice of whether to secure those plans is that of the employees.  Mr. Chairman, a Federal employee, like private sector employees, is paid three ways in their compensation package. Now, the private sector may have additional. They may have stock options, educational options, training options, all sorts of things of that nature, but essentially a Federal employee has three options.                              {time}  1815  Those three options are: Salary. A Federal employee is paid X number of dollars as salary.  In addition, the Federal employee is told, if you work for us, part of your compensation package will be the payment of 72 percent of your health care premium, your being the employee's, not the Federal Government's. That is part of the employee's benefit package.  Third, part of that benefit package is their pension; and we make a contribution towards their retirement, of course, as we do on all other Federal and State and local and private sector employees, a FICA contribution since 1983.  Now, what does that mean? That means the employee has, as a compensation package, those three elements. What the amendment that the Chairman has put back, that the committee and full committee has put back in the bill is a provision that again says that none of the funds in this bill may be used to purchase health care insurance which covers the termination of pregnancy, that is, abortion.  Now, again, I said, this is a very controversial and emotional debate. But ladies and gentlemen of this House, this deals with the employee's choice, not the Federal Government's choice. When we had the health care debate in this House, many Members on the other side of the aisle and this side of the aisle said that they believed that individuals ought to have their choice in purchasing their health care program, not the Government's choice, not Members of Congress's choice, but the individual's choice. And because they work for the Federal Government they should have no less rights than any other person who works in America and gets a health care benefit as part of their compensation package, not the Federal Government's.  This is no more Federal money than their salary is. After all, and I would hope that everybody would pay attention, we pay them the salary. That is out of Federal dollars. Are we to say you can't spend that money except in certain ways and only as we choose because that is Federal money? Is that what our position is, that we are going to control their salary dollars?  The Federal employee compensation, health care contribution is their money. This amendment undermines their compensation package. It is wrong. It undermines their own free choice, not of an abortion but of how they spend their money.  I want to tell my friends on that side of the aisle who perceive themselves as conservatives, I would hope that a number of them I see on that side of the aisle who are conservatives, who perceive themselves as conservative--the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] is pointing to himself. I presume he will vote with me on this amendment. I hope he will.  The fact of the matter is, I perceive conservatives taking the position that really government ought to stay out of, to the greatest extent possible, personal decisions, personal lives. That is how I perceive conservatives, and that you perceive liberals as those who want to get government into people's lives and making decisions for them that you think can be better made by the individual.  I suggest if that is your philosophy you ought to vote with me to strike this language, because you are substituting the Government's decision here for the individual's decision here.  Mr. Chairman, I would urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the Hoyer amendment to strike this prohibition.
