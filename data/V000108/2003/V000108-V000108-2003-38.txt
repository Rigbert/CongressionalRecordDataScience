Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I congratulate one of the most dedicated and hardworking citizens of the First Congressional District of Indiana, Mr. John Mutka. John has spent the past 40 years of his life working as a sports writer and columnist for the Post Tribune newspaper in Northwest Indiana. He will retire on Monday, November 24, 2003. His career in journalism has allowed him the opportunity to reach out to numerous people, and therefore has made a positive impact within his community.  John is an institution in Northwest Indiana, a household name to the thousands of residents who have read his work for the past 40 years. He is also known statewide and nationally for his excellence in sports journalism. This year, John was named Sportswriter of the Year by the National Sportswriters and Sportscasters Association. Also this year, he was honored by being inducted into the Indiana Sportswriters and Sportscasters Hall of Fame, and subsequently earned a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Lake County Sportsmanship banquet.  John has given his time and efforts generously throughout his career. Along with his many accomplishments, John has also been recognized by the Indiana High School Athletic Association, the Indiana Football Coaches Association, and the Indiana Basketball Coaches Association for his dedication and hard work.  Mr. Speaker, John exemplifies the values of all great Hoosiers through his dedication, his work ethic, his loyalty and humility. His continued commitment and devotion to all of Northwest Indiana is worthy of the highest commendation. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating him on his well-deserved retirement, and continued success in all his future endeavors.                          ____________________
