 We should not make that mistake this year. Congress and the administration should continue to resist sanctions and economic penalties that will only make the situation worse, but we must develop a stronger policy to put pressure on China to begin a dialog with the Dalai Lama and providing autonomy for the people of Tibet.  An important step was taken last month when Assistant Secretary of State for Population, Refugees, and Migration Julia Taft was named as the State Department's Special Coordinator for Tibet.  This resolution argues for an additional step the United States can take. It urges the administration to support and work for the passage of a resolution condemning China's human rights abuses at the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva. While we should acknowledge China's progress in many areas and continue to encourage China in search of greater progress, we should also use the forum of the United Nations Human Rights Commission to let China and the world know that China's human rights abuses are unacceptable.  Ultimately, China's leaders must come to understand that the economic freedom that have until recently championed--and which they still know is necessary for China to fully modernize its economy--must advance together with social and political freedom. As in Hong Kong and Taiwan, China's ability to withstand economic turmoil will depend in part on the ability of Chinese citizens to make judgments for themselves. Political leaders cannot expect to draw a line between economic and political judgments. Both must be allowed to flourish hand-in-hand. And that means viewing the efforts of Xu Wenli, Wang Youcai, and Qin Yongmin to organize a more pluralist Chinese polity, and viewing the efforts of the Dalai Lama to promote dialogue and religious and cultural freedom, as encouraging signs of China's modernization, not as dangerous signs of China's instability.                               Exhibit 1         Testimony of Tibetan Refugees in Nepal--November 1998             (Names have been removed for their protection)       I rode on trucks and other vehicles many days' travel from      Kham to Lhasa, where I purchased a business permit for Yuan      250 to travel onward. There, a younger cousin and I paid Yuan      1,200 each to a Nepali guide to smuggle us across the border      at night. We completed our walk mostly at night.       I was a monk at Rinchen Lingpa monastery in Dzong, and had      to leave because of a new policy reducing the number of monks      from 45 to a maximum of 30. But already, severe economic      conditions were forcing me to look for other opportunities;      my father, who was imprisoned for 15 years after 1959, is 73      years old now and unable to support me and himself. Because      of Dzong's proximity to the recent summer's flooding along      the Yangtse, officials were coming and ``shaking down'' the      monasteries for contributions to the relief efforts. Also,      livestock, farm product and head taxes and other fees have      increased steeply and consistently over the past few years,      and especially so recently. So many people want to escape      from Tibet, but most are afraid of getting caught, shot at or      encountering great hardship along the way.       I would like to go to Drepung Monastery, in southern India,      and resume my Buddhist practice there.                                  ____       In Tibet, I lived for many years in Ko-lung, a Nyingma sect      nunnery, except for one trip to India in 1994. Earlier, there      were 60 nuns, and recently that number was officially reduced      and limited to 45, along with enactment of other strictures      such as a ban on all morning prayers [an important foundation      of Tibetan Buddhist practice].       In April of 1998, I was drawn into an argument with the      head nun, who accused me of being aligned with the Tibetan      community in exile. (When I returned to Nagchu from my trip      to India in '94, I was kept in solitary confinement for 20      days before being released). As a result, I was turned over      to the authority in charge of the political re-education      program, which I was inducted into. I, and others, were      forced to renounce our allegiance to and relinquish all      photos of the Dalai Lama (which we tried to hide), and to      state in writing that Tibet is and always has been an      inalienable part of China. However, knowing that I faced      imprisonment in doing so, I refused to write that I agreed      with their ``re-education'' points. I was not imprisoned, but      fined Yuan 1,400. My parents and I realized that we were      unable to pay my fine, and that without the nunnery there was      nothing left for me there, so I decided to leave.                                       ____       From the age of 15, I had been a monk at Ganden monastery,      and a teacher and part time translator for tourists. I was      expelled in September, 1996, along with 200 other monks as a      result of suspicions that authorities had developed following      the Ganden uprising on May 6 of that year: 50 officials had      arrived at Ganden, and the monks began throwing stones. That      night, the monastery was surrounded and about 100 monks were      arrested the next morning; most of those are now serving 9-15      years sentences. During the night, I had helped a      photographer escape with film, resulting in a news story that      was broadcast on VOA wherein the photographer thanked the      Ganden teachers for advising him to escape that night. I      became very cautious, careful to clean my quarters and hide      all my Dalai Lama photographs, but officials tracked me down      on the basis of that VOA news report.       The situation in Tibet is getting worse, month by month.      Monks are being expelled from monasteries, and now and      entrance exam in which you have to write well in Chinese is      required for every job, even low level jobs. The culture of      Lhasa has also deteriorated, with Chinese prostitution and      other vices found everywhere, now.                                  ____       In Lhasa, I bought a fake internal travel pass to the      border, and came with my pregnant wife. We paid Rs. 30,000/--     and were smuggled across.       When I was 15, I left Amdo to train as a monk at Ganden,      but I was there for less than 2 years. In 1987 and '89, I      witnessed the uprisings and demonstrations in Lhasa, and was      emotionally very moved by them. That's when I realized that I      had to stand up to the Chinese, and I have been helping the      Tibet cause since that time.       After 1992, I was constantly on a PSB (Public Security      Bureau) watch list, and several times was harassed,      interrogated and detained. I was first arrested in 1992, and      was held in solitary confinement and interrogated and beaten      for 8 days. Continuously, three policemen had me kneel on a      cement floor and kicked me on the body and face. One of them      did all the kicking and beating, one watched, and the other      sat at a desk and took notes. They were Chinese and Tibetan,      but I don't harbor ill feelings toward the Tibetans because I      feel their circumstances in being there were not their fault.       They couldn't get any information out of me, so they fined      me Yuan 6,700 and made me swear that I would never reveal the      place of confinement--which looks like a normal government      office, but with confinement rooms attached at the back. I      believe that there are many other such places of confinement;      I know others who have been similarly interrogated and      beaten.       In 1993, I went on pilgrimage to India to attend His      Holiness's Kalachakra initiation in Sikkim, and when I      returned to Lhasa I had to hide and move my residence      frequently, in order to avoid being arrested. Even my parents      were being watched, in Amdo. I had opened a shop in Amdo with      a friend, and he was arrested and sentenced to five years      imprisonment, so I realized that I was in imminent danger of      arrest.       In 1994, I returned to Amdo and changed my name, stopped      wearing monks' robes, and stayed mostly in remote areas. But      in August of 1995 I came back to Lhasa, and in October opened      a restaurant there. In December of 1995, right at the time      when the Chinese appointed their selection for the Panchen      Lama, one of my teachers was arrested and kept in      confinement, and I was arrested shortly thereafter. The PSB      questioned me about my time in India, and tried to force me      to agree that the Chinese-selected Panchen Lama was the      genuine one. They closed and ransacked my restaurant, which      they suspected of being a meeting place for people to talk      about freedom for Tibet.       I was sentenced to 2 years in prison on 3 counts: for going      to India to see the Dalai Lama, for running a restaurant      suspected of being connected to the Tibet freedom movement,      and for being suspected of engaging in political activity. I      was first held at Gutsa prison, about 5 kilometers from      Lhasa, for 10 months. I was kept chained and was beaten for      the first 15 days (one of my testicles was crushed), and was      given no food or water for the first 5 days. They offered      food and water, trying to tempt me to tell them what I had      been doing. I was beaten so much that I really thought I had      died and gone to Hell. I had a cell that was only big enough      to lie down in, with a pan to use as a toilet. Our child died      during delivery, in June, 1996, when I was in prison.       On January 10, 1997, I was transferred to Tolong Dzong      prison, where I stayed for the remaining 14 months of my      sentence. I was released on April 2 of 1998, and then on May      30 was re-arrested by a plain clothes PSB officer, on      political grounds, and held for 45 more days. After that, I      had to report every month to the police, and was not allowed      to travel. That's when my wife and I decided to leave for      Nepal.       My wife gave birth to a boy on November 3. Now, my first      priority is to find work, in order to repay a large loan that      I own in Lhasa. I'd also like to learn at least some      rudimentary English, to work for the Tibet cause, and to help      my friends who are still in Tibet, many of them in prison.                                  ____       My brother was killed by the Chinese in 1958, and since      then the situation in Tibet has only been getting worse. In      1975 and '76, the state took possession of all the private      farm lands in our area, and has been leasing them back to the      farmers. Beginning this year, we have not been allowed to      sell our crops (primarily barley and wheat) to the open      market, but are forced to sell 70-80% of it to the government      at a fixed rate that is about half the open market rate. And      now, we're not allowed to keep pictures of the Dalai Lama      even in our homes.                                  ____       I came over a high pass, though we started as a group of      only 18 and merged with other groups from Amdo and Lhasa.       This year at the Gawa monastery, where I was a monk,      officials recently forced us to publicly denounce the Dalai      Lama, and they now prohibit monks younger than 18 from      joining the monastery. This is a very shrewd tactic on the      part of the Chinese, because they understand that by the time      young people are 18 they have already been exposed to modern      distractions and bad habits, such as drinking and gambling      and prostitution, which spoils their desire for religious      practice. Historically (before 1959), our monastery had 800      people, but in recent years it has remained at around 300.      About 3 months ago, though, 225 monks were expelled,      including me and most of the senior monks. It is now nearly      impossible to get admitted to a monastery--and entrance to      Sera, Drepung or Ganden is impossible--because the officials      are reducing the numbers of monks allowed at monasteries      everywhere. Some of the Gawa monks have nowhere to go, and so      they wait until the officials are gone and then discreetly      join the activities in the monastery, hiding when necessary.       The Chinese have appointed their own Panchen Lama, and we      don't even know where the genuine Panchen Lama is. I have      been told that the public is prohibited from meeting the      genuine Panchen Lama's parents.       Also, taxes have increased beyond what Tibetans can afford.      We used to pay pasture taxes of 7 per yak and Yuan 200 per      horse each year, but these have been raised recently, plus      farmers and herders have to pay in-kind taxes of meat and      butter each year to the authorities--taxes totaling about 30%      of our total production. I don't have parents, nor any      livestock, and all else that I owned I gave to the monastery.      But now my brother and I have had to repay many debts that my      parents accumulated, and we have no livestock as a source of      income for this.       During the severe snowstorms of 1996, we heard on American      radio that we would be receiving relief in the form of      blankets and money. Some foreign donors did come, and in      front of them the officials handed us blankets and Yuan 200      each, but after they left the officials returned and      collected all the blankets and money. I think the Chinese are      very skilled at tricking outsiders.       My brother (age 36) joined me on this trip, and we are      relieved to finally be outside of Tibet. After an audience      with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, I want to become a monk at      the Sera Monastery in southern India.                                  ____       Eighteen years ago, my parents owned a house near the      Mosque. A few years ago, the authorities said they would tear      down the house and provide us with improved housing there, in      the same place. The new complex was built, but then promptly      sold to developers. We did get compensation of Yuan 30,000,      but this is half what the old house was worth.       My mother and I had a very small table on the Bargkor      (market area and circumambulation route) where we sold cloth      and shirts. We had to pay a Yuan 300 monthly fee to 3      different government departments--for a business permit, for      the space itself and also income tax.       When I was around 10 years old, I remember getting tear      gassed during the rioting, and then staying inside for      several days. Nowadays, you might occasionally see a small      group of monks or nuns demonstrating, but they never make it      more than half a circuit around the Bargkor before being      arrested. In August of this year, the authorities entered all      the homes in our area, banging on doors loudly and      threatening severe penalties, in a search for Dalai Lama      photos. We had hidden all of ours ahead of time.       My parents and I decided that if our family was to get      ahead financially, one of us would have to leave, and we      agreed that I should go, hopefully to get an education. I      wasn't able to study in Tibet because I didn't have a      residency permit for Lhasa, and studying there is very      expensive, anyway--as is living there, Right now we are      paying Yuan 450-500 for tuition for my younger brother, which      doesn't include his uniform or books. Each year it is getting      worse. We don't have a family member in government service,      but many Tibetans now are being fired, and you now have to      take a written exam in Chinese for even a low level job.      Tibetan language is hardly used in Lhasa, there are no high      lamas left there, there are far fewer monks than there used      to be, and anyone showing a sign to resistance to the Chinese      is sentenced to 6-7 years' imprisonment. The Chinese      immigrants are bringing infectious diseases to Tibet with      them [likely in reference to STDs], while prostitution,      gambling and night clubs are thriving.                                  ____       In October 1997, four women from our village were called      for sterilisation.       Two had children already and two did not. One evening the      Chinese took the four of them to another place and sterilised      them. Two got sick and the others remained healthy. About one      month before this, officials from the birth control office      came and summoned a meeting. During the meeting     the Chinese said that they would operate on women from the      age of 18 to 40. They said that those women who didn't      undergo the operation would be expelled from their jobs. All      of them were farmers.       I heard from the people of the village that one evening a      truck belonging to the birth control office arrived in our      village and the 4 of them were taken away to get operated on,      totally by force. The officials told the 4 of them that the      government would pay everything and no problems would result      from the operations. They said that one needed rest for 7      days after the operation, and should take proper medicine,      and the food and expenses would be provided by the      government. But the women were in bed for more than 2 weeks      and hardly recovered, and the expenditures were paid by their      families and not by the government.                                  ____       I used to distribute booklets and other literature that      dealt with our cause and also I put up posters. As a result,      I was caught three times by the Chinese authorities and      suffered from imprisonment and torture.       When I was first arrested, apart from handcuffing me, they      gave me a few kicks and slaps but I wasn't beaten very badly.      On the third day I was specifically charged with possession      of a book. It was Friday and I was given the ultimatum to      hand over any books or literature dealing with Tibetan      affairs by Monday. When I reported on Monday, I was asked      where the book was, I told them that I didn't have it and was      once again imprisoned.       For the next two months I was interrogated by using all      sorts of tactics but I refused to hand over the book. In the      end, my friends paid 2000 yuan and I was released on the      conditions that I report daily to the police, confine myself      within the monastery and not engage in any subversive      activity. I was also told to be an informer. If I did well as      an informer, I would be paid secretly and if not I would be      re arrested. For the next year I was constantly harassed by      the police. Sometimes, they visited me in the middle of the      night in my monastic room and asked me questions like whether      I had been working sincerely for them and whether I was doing      any subversive work.       In July 1994 I was arrested for the 3rd time by the Chinese      authorities. I was bound in chains both on my hands and feet      and taken to the local detention centre. This prison is an      interrogation centre for those prisoners who had not      confessed their crimes of mistakes. There were no permanent      prisoners there. The main reason I was taken to this prison      was to keep me away from contacting any Tibetans. While I was      being interrogated at this prison, no one knew anything about      my whereabouts. I learned later that on the day of my arrest      my grandmother died, out of shock and worry.       The torturing began every day at 8 in the morning and went      on till 9 in the evening. They adopted all sorts of methods      to torture me. My hands were tied at the back in a most      painful manner and they put electric rods in my mouth. They      used the electric stick on me so many times, I can't say how      many times. They made me kneel on the floor with a stick      under my knees and another stick on the calves of my legs so      that the skin was rubbed off my knees. At the same time my      hands were handcuffed together on my back, with one arm over      my shoulder and the other arm over my lower back. In addition      to this, I received countless numbers of slaps and kicks      throughout the day.       In the coldest month in Amdo, every morning before the sun      rose, I was subjected to 2 hour cold baths and I was told to      strip myself completely naked and then they kept on pouring      buckets of icy cold water on me until I completely blacked      out. Sometimes I was subjected to a treatment in which they      hit with me with thin, sharp bamboo all over my body. After      some time, my whole body became like a plucked chicken, very      blue with patches of white. Sometimes after throwing      countless buckets of ice cold water on me, they would bring      me before a red glowing fireplace, if they felt I was about      to faint. They gave me this type of torture for 15 days.       I was also fed very poorly with 2 glasses of black tea and      some meagre food. I was almost starving because sometimes if      I could chew a single pea, I used to feel very happy.      However, no matter what type of torture they it was, I didn't      admit or confess anything except the possession of the book,      which I had already done earlier. I suffered rigorous torture      for about 4 months in this prison and since I didn't confess      anything they eventually transferred me. In the new prison I      was chained and made to sit on a chair, and the security      personnel kept me from sleeping for 14 days. The food given      to me was the same as they gave to their pigs. I was charged      for being a spy of the Tibetan government. The final verdict      was that I was a counter-revolutionary who had been engaged      in propagating their cause. Thus, I was sentenced for two      years and 7 months imprisonment. They took away my political      rights for a period of 2 years. After serving my imprisonment      I was finally released at the beginning of 1997. After my      release I was constantly harassed by the local police.                                  ____       I was arrested and imprisoned because I called for Tibet's      independence. At Gutsa detention center, we were placed in a      room with a cement floor where there were no beds and      blankets. It was mid winter, and they kept us for over 3      months without blankets, which they allowed only when our      relatives brought them from home. We were given small amounts      of food, just 2 dumplings per day. It didn't fill our      stomachs.       When we were interrogated they questioned us about who was      behind the demonstration, but we told them that we had done      it independently. Then they beat us with the use of an      electric baton. They put it everywhere, on my head, hands,      mostly on the veins, and here where it is very painful. We      would lose memory because of that. They also kicked us and      slapped us in the face. They interrogated me three times a      day, every day for one or two hours at a time. They asked the      same questions and we wouldn't answer them properly. There      were 3 or 4 police questioning us.       They kept us in Gutsa for one year and 9 months and      interrogated us. After that they brought us to court to pass      our sentences. I got 4 years imprisonment. They then took us      to a hospital where we were supposed to get a medical check      up. But they didn't give us any treatment and instead took      one bottle of blood from each of us forcibly. Because of that      we became thinner and thinner. Then finally they took us to      Drapchi prison where we had to do work with wool for making      carpets. There wasn't any education and the food was very      poor. They treated the political prisoners very harshly while      they treated normal prisoners better.       We were kept in the prison for a very long time and were      not allowed to meet our family. We were able to receive small      things such as things to eat. They didn't allow us to meet      our family members except after we were sentenced. After our      sentencing, they allowed us to meet our family, but only one      person could visit at a time.       I suffered from a stomach disorder while at Drapchi, from      food which was not properly cooked. We used to eat packaged      noodles which led to stomach ailments, and whatever I ate, I      had to vomit with blood. I suffered from this for about 8      months after I was released from prison. I start vomiting      when the weather turns cold. In prison I asked to visit the      hospital, but they only used to take (prisoners) to the      hospital when they were almost dead. Otherwise they don't      care for political prisoners.       When I was in prison there were some foreign visits but we      were watched all the time so we couldn't talk to them. Before      they came we were made to clean the rooms and then we had to      do whatever work we had to do. They brought big pieces of      meat to the kitchen and stuck up list of food telling the      visitors that they give us such food. But in reality we      didn't get to eat this meat. After the heads had left they      took it away.       They put at least one female common law prisoner in each      cell to watch the nuns so that we wouldn't talk about things      like independence. She would tell the authorities information      about us and because of that her sentence was decreased. They      were put in a separate room because they feared that we would      harm them. They were very happy in their rooms which were      better than ours.       In Drapchi prison we were made to do exercises which were      not for the purpose of our health. It was like military      training. When we were doing the exercises we had to shout      something in Chinese which meant that we were confessing to      our mistakes and that we would come out to society as a new      person. Once we understood the meaning of the words we      protested and didn't say them. Then many soldiers came and      beat us. It was during winter and at that time it is very      cold in Tibet. We were made to stand on the cold cement floor      in the shade barefooted for a whole day, our shoes and socks      removed. This made our feet cold as ice. Then we had to run      while they didn't give us any water. Some of us fell      unconscious. If someone fell down they said we were not      allowed to help. They also stopped the monthly opportunity      for our families to visit us. We had to stand in the sun and      put our faces in the direction of the sun as a result of      which some of us had blisters on our face.
