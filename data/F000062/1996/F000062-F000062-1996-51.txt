 Too many Americans find that just when they most need health insurance, it is not there. It is terminated. They are denied its purchase, because they are sick. They are determined to be uninsurable.  The bipartisan bill before us today does not provide health insurance to every American. We still face that challenge. But the bill before us today takes an important step toward making health insurance more secure.  This bill provides some health security in several ways:  No Arbitrary Terminations: Insurers will not be able to impose preexisting condition limitations for more than an initial 12-month period. This means that employees can change jobs without fear or facing a new preexisting condition exclusion.  Guaranteed Access: Insurers will be required to offer insurance to all groups, regardless of the health status of any member of the group and employees could not be denied group coverage based on their health status.  Guaranteed Insurance Renewal: Groups and individuals who have insurance will be able to renew their policies as long as they have paid their premiums.  Individual Coverage Guaranteed: People who leave their job where they have had 18 months of prior employer group coverage and who have exhausted their extended [COBRA] coverage would be guaranteed access to an individual policy.                           need for the bill  The problems this bill addresses are real:  Twenty-three million Americans lose their insurance every year; 18 million people change insurance policies annually when someone in the family changes jobs.  Over 9 million Americans changed jobs in 1995; millions more wanted to. The General Accounting Office estimates that as many as 4 million employees are locked into their jobs because they fear that the insurer for the next employer will refuse to insure them because of their health condition, something the industry has called a preexisting condition. GAO has said that 21 million Americans could benefit by prohibiting preexisting condition exclusions.  Small employers are often unable to get insurance because a few of the employees are ill; insurers refuse to insure. Small employers lack the leverage of big employers in negotiating good prices and policies. In California, 84 percent of the uninsured are in working families. Fifty-two percent of uninsured employees work in small firms.  And finally, there are 10 to 20 million Americans seeking to buy insurance on their own--individual policies. These individuals, who are not part of a large pool where risk can be spread out, find that insurers refuse to sell to them or price the policies so high they are unaffordable.                         genetic discrimination  I especially appreciate the inclusion of provisions barring genetic discrimination in health insurance, along the lines of S. 1600, a bill I introduced with Senator Mack.  Last fall, as cochairs of the Senate Cancer Coalition, Senator Mack and I held a hearing on the status of genetics research and use of genetic tests. We learned we are all carrying around between 50,000 and 100,000 genes scattered on 23 pairs of chromosomes and that every person has between 5 and 10 defective genes, often not manifested.  Approximately 3 percent of all children are born with a severe condition that is primarily genetic in origin. By age 24, genetic disease strikes 5 percent of Americans. Genetic disorders account for one-fifth of adult hospital occupancy, two-thirds of childhood hospital occupancy, one-third of pregnancy loss and one-third of mental retardation.  About 15 million people are affected by one or more of the over 4,000 currently identified genetic disorders.  We are learning virtually everyday about the explosion of knowledge in genetic science. We know that certain diseases have genetic links, like cancer, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, cystic fibrosis, neurofibromatosis, and Lou Gehrig's disease.  But understanding genetics brings a new set of problems. Witness after witness at our hearing raised fears of health insurance discrimination. And it is not just fear. It is also reality. We heard about insurers denying coverage, refusing to renew coverage, or denying coverage of a particular condition.  In a 1992 study, the Office of Technology Assessment found that 17 of 29 insurers would not sell insurance to individuals when presymptomatic testing revealed the likelihood of a serious, chronic future disease. Fifteen of thirty-seven commercial insurers that cover groups said they would decline the applicant. Underwriters at 11 of 25 Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans said they would turn down an applicant ifpresymptomatic testing revealed the likelihood of disease. The study found that insurers price plans higher--or even out of reach--based on genetic information. Another study conducted by Dr. Paul Billings at the California Pacific Medical Center, reached similar conclusions.  Here are a few examples, real-life cases:  An individual with hereditary hemochromatosis--excessive iron--who runs 10K races regularly, but who had no symptoms of the disease, could not get insurance because of the disease.  A health maintenance organization that had covered a child since birth, denied therapy after the child was diagnoses with mucopolysaccharidoses [MPS].  A Colorado insurer terminated the policy of the family of a 3-year-old with the same disease.  An 8-year-old girl was diagnosed at 14 days of age with PKI [phenylketonuria], a rare inherited disease, which if left untreated, leads to retardation. Most States require testing for this disease at birth. Her growth and development proceeded normally and she was healthy. She was insured on her father's employment-based policy, but when the father changed jobs, the insurer at the new job told him that his daughter was considered to be a high risk patient and uninsurable.  The mother of an elementary school student had her son tested for a learning disability. The tests revealed that the son had Fragile X Syndrome, an inherited form of mental retardation. Her insurer dropped her son's coverage. After searching unsuccessfully for a company that would be willing to insure her son, the mother quit her job so she could impoverish herself and become eligible for Medicaid as insurance for her son.  Another man worked as a financial officer for a large national company. His son had a genetic condition which left him severely disabled. The father was tested an found to be an asymptomatic carrier of the gene which caused his son's illness. His wife and other sons were healthy. His insurer initially disputed claims filed for the son's care, then paid them, but then refused to renew the employer's group coverage. The company then offered two plans. All employees except this father were offered a choice of the two. He was allowed only the managed care plan.  A woman was denied health insurance because her nephew had been diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis and she inquired whether she should be tested to see if she was a carrier. After she was found to carry the gene that causes the disease, the insurer told her that neither she nor any children she might have would be covered unless her husband was determined not to carry the CF gene. She went for several months without health insurance because she sought genetic information about herself.  These denials not only deprive Americans of health insurance, they affect people's health. If people fear retaliation by their insurer, they may be less likely to provide their physician with full information. They may be reluctant to be tested. This reluctance means that physicians might not have all the information they need to make a solid diagnosis or decide on a treatment.  All of us are at risk of illness. We all have defective genes. I hope that the addition of my language can help ease the fears of many Americans and discourage insurers from using genetics as a reason to deny insurance.                           AN IMPORTANT STEP  This bill, while it does not address all the problems, does take an important step. As a measure of its importance, yesterday morning when agreement on the bill reached the public, my staff got a call at 9:15 a.m.--6:15 a.m. California time--from a worried constituent, asking, ``Will it help me?''  This bill can help make health insurance available to those Americans who want to buy it. It can bring peace of mind to millions of Americans. It can restore to insurance what insurance is supposed to be.  I hope we will promptly send this bill to the President for his signature and close this loophole in our erratic patchwork of health insurance.
