Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for yielding this time to me, and I would say to my colleague on the committee that, yes, we do have questions about this program, the most important question being will we maintain the people on the program who are already on it in this fiscal year? And the Department of Agriculture has given us excellent numbers; they have surveyed every Governor. States like California, without these funds, will be cutting thousands of recipients. California alone needs over $26 million just to complete this fiscal year.  So we know what the challenge is. In the amendment, the $38 million that is provided out of this major, major emergency appropriations bill will merely keep current beneficiaries on the program, pregnant women, low-birth weight babies and young children. That is the purpose of this. Without the amendment States will have to cut over 180,000 current beneficiaries from the program.  So it is somewhat disingenuous to say that we do not believe the numbers, because in fact the U.S. Department of Agriculture in April, this April, surveyed the various States.  I only have a minute and a half so I cannot yield to the gentleman, but I wanted to clarify what the prior speaker had said. I want to urge my colleagues to pass the Kaptur-Riggs-Roukema-Roemer-Quinn amendment, and I want to thank the gentlewoman from New Jersey [Mrs. Roukema] very much for her leadership on this, not just this year but in prior years. I think her commitment is clear. We know that this prevents sick children from being admitted to hospital rooms across this country.
