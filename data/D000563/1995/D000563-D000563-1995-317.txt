 What I find curious about this is that $350 billion figure is very close to the figure that we hear will be the cost of the tax cut bill, which was part of the Republican Contract With America. So this tax cut that took the money out of the Treasury is obviously being plugged with some cuts in Medicare. Maybe I have missed something here, but the two figures are very similar.
