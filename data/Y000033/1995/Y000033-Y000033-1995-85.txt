Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume to being note to what the gentleman from New Jersey has just said, this is truly a sound piece of conservation legislation. This makes sense. Unfortunately, many of the groups that support the conservation movements bring forth to this floor and talk about topics that are not true scientific conservation, and this is one. It is bipartisan supported and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
