I also thank my colleague from Maine because both senators have said from the very beginning of this discussion that the bottom line for millions of working families, for single moms, for folks who are walking on an economic tightrope across the country, they are going to see this issue through the prism of what it means for them in terms of their premiums and their costs.  Over these many months, Senator Bayh and Senator Collins and I have been toiling to put together some bipartisan ideas. We have filed these ideas as a package of amendments, submitted them to the majority leader, Senator Reid, and the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, and we just wanted to take a few minutes today to talk in particular about why it is so essential that there be a bipartisan effort put together for additional steps to contain costs.  Senator Bayh is absolutely right in describing the Congressional Budget Office analysis. Certainly, many people were fearful the CBO report would come out and say that on day one after enactment premiums would rise into the stratosphere as a result of the legislation. Fortunately, that was not the case in the report for most people.  We also believe there is a whole lot more that can be done. So we have said, Democrats and Republicans are going to try to prosecute that case. What it comes down to is ensuring that, in the text of this legislation, there is more choice and more competition.  The reality is, ever since the 1940s, the days of the wage and price control decisions that have done so much to shape today's health care system, most Americans have not had real choice in the health care marketplace and have not been able to enjoy the fruits of a competitive system. Most Americans have little or no choice. Most Americans don't get a chance to benefit when they shop wisely.  As Senator Bayh noted--and as Senator Collins and I have noted over the last few days--that is something we ought to change. It is certainly not a partisan idea. Senator Reid and Senator Baucus, to their credit, have agreed with me that there ought to be more choice for those folks who have what, in effect, are hardship exemptions under this legislation. There are people, for example, who spend more than 8 percent of their income on health who aren't eligible for subsidies, who have these hardship exemptions; and Senator Reid, Senator Baucus, and I have agreed they ought to be able to take any help they are getting from their employer in the form of a voucher and go into the marketplace. These people should be able to put into their pockets any savings that come about because they have shopped wisely.  But as Senator Bayh has noted, we have an opportunity to go further. If an employer in the exchange decides, on a voluntary basis, that their workers should have a choice, under the proposal advanced by the Senator from Indiana, the Senator from Maine, and myself, they would be able to do it.  It is the voluntary nature of our idea that Senator Bayh has outlined, an approach that gives more options to both employers and employees, that caused our proposal to win an endorsement from the National Federation of Independent Business.  I ask unanimous consent at this time to have printed in the Record that letter from the National Federation of Independent Businesses.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               National Federation                                      of Independent Business,                                                December 10, 2009.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Wyden and Collins: On behalf of the National      Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), the nation's      leading small business association, we are writing in support      of the Wyden-Collins amendment (Optional Free Choice      Voucher--amendment #3117), which provides vouchers as a new      voluntary option for employers and employees to purchase      health insurance.       For small business, the goal of healthcare reform is to      lower costs, increase choices and provide real competition      for private insurance. The Wyden-Collins amendment achieves      what we know are clear bipartisan goals in healthcare      reform--expanding access to coverage, increasing consumer      choice and improving portability.       Free choice vouchers recognize that the employer-employee      relationship in America has changed considerably since      employer-sponsored insurance began in the 1940s. They give      employees tax- advantaged resources to tailor healthcare      choices and purchases to their own preferences and needs.      Because the employees will be able to choose from more      policies, they will be more invested in their healthcare      decisions. They will be better     consumers because they will be more aware of costs, and this      will help ``bend the cost curve.''       In today's diverse and highly mobile workforce, people      change jobs every few years. Improving portability will      reduce the ``job lock'' that currently stifles      entrepreneurship. Since free choice vouchers would help make      health insurance portable, employees will not be locked into      jobs when better opportunities come along.       This amendment addresses the shortcomings of the existing      employer-based system for small businesses. In the current      system, small employers often have few options beyond ``take      it or leave it.'' This new and voluntary option will      encourage employers to provide insurance coverage for      employees. It is the exact opposite of employer mandates that      harm struggling businesses, discourage startups and kill      jobs.       While some may claim this amendment weakens employer-     sponsored health insurance, NFIB disagrees. The current      system works better for larger firms who can operate more      efficiently and effectively, and this inequity must be      addressed. Simply put, what works for Wall Street does not      work for Main Street. The Wyden-Collins amendment works to      address this by making coverage more affordable for many of      the nation's job creators.       NFIB appreciates your commitment to healthcare reform and      your continuous efforts to find solutions that work for small      business.           Sincerely,                                                Susan Eckerly,                                            Senior Vice President,                                                    Public Policy.
