Chair, I support the gentleman's amendment to strike section 108, and I thank Congressman Beyer of Virginia for offering it.  The provision the gentleman seeks to strike is one of three egregious attacks on the Clean Water Act, including locking in place a state of confusion about the scope of pollution control programs and sacrificing water quality for small streams and wetlands that contribute to the drinking water of one in three Americans.  I urge my colleagues to support the Beyer amendment. Freshwater is a precious resource, one which should be protected in the best scientific manner possible.  I thank the gentleman from Virginia for doing something really important for the country through this amendment to clean up this bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
