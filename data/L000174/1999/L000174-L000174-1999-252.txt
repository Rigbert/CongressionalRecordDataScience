President, one of the real treasures of my State of Vermont are the people who live andwork there. Recently, I had the pleasure of leading a trade mission to Ireland with a group of Vermont business owners seeking strategic business alliances to increase trade and tourism between our state and Ireland. One of the members of the delegation, Beth Kennett, traveled to Ireland with specific goals in mind--to increase tourism from Ireland to Vermont and to learn more about agri-tourism.  Beth Kennett is the president of Vermont Farms! as well as a co-owner, along with her husband Bob, of a dairy farm that also serves as a bed and breakfast. On the trip, Mrs. Kennett was hosted by representatives of the agri-tourism industry and visited several agri-tourism farms. She was very enthusiastic throughout her stay and commented later on the diversity of her experiences. She said that one day she found herself wearing Wellies and the next she was meeting the Lord and Lady of the Manor.  I can gladly say that our mission was a success. We were able to open up doors for new business relationships and tourism between Ireland and Vermont, while also bringing back information on how to develop agri-tourism in Vermont. I ask that an article by Associated Press writer David Gram regarding Mrs. Kennett's experience be printed in the record.  The article follows:               [From the Associated Press, June 23, 1999]               Farm life grows as tourism draw in Vermont                            (By David Gram)       Rochester, VT. Beth Kennett calls the big, five-story, red      barn with its cupola topped with a Holstein-shaped      weathervane ``one of the cathedrals of the country.''       And if people from around the world travel to Paris to see      the Notre Dame, why not to Rochester's Liberty Hill to see      her farm?       In fact, they do. In addition to milking one of the most      productive small herds of registered Holsteins in the state,      Kennett, her husband Bob and her sons Tom and David--young      men who are following their parents into farming--open their      sprawling, two-century-old farmhouse to travelers.       They're part of a growing number of Vermont farmers who are      bridging the gap between two of the mainstays of Vermont's      economy: agriculture and tourism.       The Kennetts' house dates from 1825, the barn from 1889,      there are splendid views of the surrounding hills, a mile of      frontage on the White River with several good swimming holes,      and hiking trails in the abutting Green Mountain National      Forest. Down in the well kept barn, there are 65 milkers and,      occasionally, a newborn calf to marvel at.       Kennett got into the hospitality business when a big drop      in prices paid to farmers for milk in 1984 prompted her and      her family to look for new sources of income.       ``We took stock of our assets, and decided that since we      had this big old farmhouse with 18 rooms, we might as well      take advantage of it,'' she recalled.       Now she's got a regular clientele of guests who return year      after year, she's president of a statewide association of      farmers who offer lodging, tours and other amenities for      visitors, and she's just back from joining Sen. Patrick      Leahy, D-Vt., on a trade mission to Ireland.       For a full dinner, big breakfast and charming country      lodgings complete with wide-board floors, flowered wallpaper      and a claw-foot bathtub, Kennett charges $70 per adult and      $30 per child. The house can accommodate 15 guests and      occasionally is the destination for reunions of several      branches of the same family.       ``Not only has it been a diversification of income for the      farm, but it's been invaluable in the number of friends we've      made over the years. And it's a wonderful opportunity to      educate the public about agriculture,'' she said.       Kennett is president of an association called VT Farms!,      which has grown to 56 members in less than three years of      existence.       Their offerings range from pick-your own strawberries and      apples to wine tasting to petting zoos. Some 15 to 20      accommodate overnight guests, according to Ron Fisher, who      tracks the industry for the Vermont Department of      Agriculture.       ``What we're looking for with agri-tourism is to literally      make this another revenue stream for farmers,'' Fisher said.      ``It's not going to replace the milk check, but it's another      source of cash flow to the individual who's going to open up      the farm to agri-tourism.''       Agri-tourism may be due for a boost from the federal      government. Rep. Bernard Sanders, I-Vt., announced earlier      this month that the U.S. House had approved a $1 million      appropriation for a pilot project to promote the fledgling      industry.       Kennett said if some funds become available, she may look      for Vermont to apply some of the ideas she picked up in      Ireland, where she said farm-based tourism is widely      practiced, accepted and considered an integral part of the      country's allure for visitors.       Fisher said state officials hope agri-tourism can help      stanch the loss of farms in Vermont. There were more than      20,000 in 1950, the fast majority of them dairy operations;      today there are fewer than 3,000 dairy farms in the state.      Kennett said there were 11 farms shipping milk when she and      her husband moved to Rochester from Addison 20 years ago;      today, she said, theirs is the last farm in Rochester      shipping milk.       Blending a working farm with a hospitality business is a      lot of work. Kennett said she's up at milking time to make      breakfast for her guests, and spends afternoon preparing      dinner for her family and up to 15 guests.       But she said she has no complaints. It's been a great way      to beat the isolation which can be a feature of Vermont farm      life. She doesn't need to visit the world's concert halls,      because there's a family of accomplished violinists who visit      every year from Newton, Mass., and put on a concert at the      farm.       Then there's the art professor and his class who arrive en      masse for a week occasionally. They paint the surrounding      scenery and then put on an art show at week's end. And      there's the magician from New York who comes and puts on a      show each Fourth of July.       ``I don't need to go off and see the world,'' Kennett      said.''The world comes to me.''                          ____________________
