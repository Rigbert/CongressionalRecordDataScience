 President, I wish to recognize an organization in my home State that has been honored for the fine work it is doing for the people of central Kentucky. Commerce Lexington, Inc., the chamber of commerce organization for greater Lexington, has been named Chamber of the Year by the Association of Chamber of Commerce Executives, ACCE. In doing so, it beat other chambers of commerce from across the country, including those representing Brooklyn, NY; Jacksonville, FL; and Tacoma, WA. This is the first time Commerce Lexington Inc. has won this award.  ACCE's Chamber of the Year award recognizes the leadership role chambers of commerce play in both their respective business communities and in civic life. To win the award, Commerce Lexington Inc. had to compete against hundreds of other chambers, including those from 93 of the top 100 U.S. metro areas.  ACCE presented the award to Commerce Lexington Inc. at its annual convention in Savannah, GA, this past August. Commerce Lexington Inc. has been a finalist for the award 3 years in a row--2014, 2015, and 2016. And in addition to receiving the Chamber of the Year award, Commerce Lexington Inc. also earned one of ACCE's top communications/marketing honors, the Grand Award.  Commerce Lexington Inc. has about 1,700 members, and its mission is simple: to promote economic development, job creation, and growth in the greater Lexington area. It works to foster both the creation of new businesses and the growth of existing ones. Formed in 2004, its roots trace back to 1797. Commerce Lexington Inc.'s president and CEO, Bob Quick, leads a talented and dedicated staff, and he is doing a great job leading the organization, as it receipt of this award so ably demonstrates.  Of course, Commerce Lexington Inc. is successful because they have a great product. Lexington is widely regarded as one of the most livable cities in America and ranks high on lists of best places to start a business, find a job, or pursue higher education. It is a major economic driver of the Bluegrass State, location of the preeminent University of Kentucky, and home to the famous Keeneland Race Course.  I congratulate Bob Quick, Andi Johnson, and the leadership and staff of Commerce Lexington Inc. for winning this prestigious award. Of the thousands of chambers of commerce across our Nation, it is quite an honor to be recognized as one of the very best. I am grateful for Commerce Lexington Inc. and all they do for the Commonwealth.                          ____________________
