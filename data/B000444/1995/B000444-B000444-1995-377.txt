 President, if the leader will yield, each of the authors of the gun amendments has agreed to withdraw their amendments, and I am authorized to do that and I would do that at this moment if that is appropriate.  There are five amendments: Bradley, Lautenberg, Kohl, Levin, and Kerry of Massachusetts. Each had amendments. And there was a Boxer amendment which we never intended on bringing up on guns, and a second Lautenberg amendment. We were not going to do those anyway.  To put it another way, Mr. President, we commit there will be no gun amendments offered from the Democratic side. The only amendments that would be in order are the habeas corpus amendments that have been referenced by the leader already.
