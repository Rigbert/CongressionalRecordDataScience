Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I disagree with the arguments made by my friend, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Watt), because I think that the purpose of this bill is to make the process of adjudicating a common disaster lawsuit, such as one arising from a plane crash or a train wreck, more convenient to all of the litigants concerned.  That provides for the consolidation of these cases in a manner that has been described for determining liability and punitive damages, but not for determining compensatory damages. So overall, it makes the system fairer for all litigants, although it might make the system a bit inconvenient to some litigants. So I think we have a balancing effect here.  I am just concerned over a common disaster case bringing about a huge plethora of lawsuits that would be filed in courts all over the country. Given where the plaintiffs would live who were injured or killed in the plane crash, or where the airline was located, where the crash occurred, or the manufacturer of the plane and its component parts were situated, we could have lawsuits on the same disaster going on in every court.  Sooner or later there would be appeals which would be expensive, that would have to be consolidated so there would be a single law that would be applicable to everybody.  We can short-circuit that problem by the type of consolidation that is being proposed in this bill. The administrative office of the U.S. courts and the multidistrict litigation panel of the judicial conference of the United States have supported this bill. They do not like to see an expansion of Federal jurisdiction, but they see this as necessary for the streamlining of the adjudication of these claims.  Someone said, ``Justice delayed is justice denied.'' Whenever we have a complex case like this, there are delays that are in and of the nature of the litigation. But I believe that this will speed up the final resolution in bringing to closure any litigation that may arise as a result of one of these disasters. I would hope that the bill would be passed for that reason.  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record two letters related to this matter.  The letters referred to are as follows:                                            Judicial Conference of                                            the United States,                                   Washington, DC, March 13, 2001.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Judicial Conference of      the United States, I write to express the support of the      federal judiciary for H.R. 860, the ``Multidistrict,      Multiparty, Multiforum Trial Jurisdiction Act of 2001.'' This      bill was reported favorably on March 8, 2001, by the      Committee you chair. H.R. 860 will facilitate the resolution      of claims by citizens and improve the administration of      justice.       Section 2 of the bill amends 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1407, the      multidistrict litigation statute, to allow a judge with a      transferred case to retain it for trial or to transfer it to      another district. Presently, section 1407(a) authorizes the      Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation to transfer civil      actions pending in multiple federal judicial districts with      common questions of fact ``to any district for coordinated or      consolidated pretrial proceedings.'' It also requires the      Judicial Panel to remand any such action to the district      court in which the action was filed at or before the      conclusion of such pretrial proceedings, unless the action is      terminated before then in the transferee court.       Although the federal courts had for nearly 30 years      followed the practice of allowing a transferee court to      invoke the venue transfer provision (28 U.S.C. Sec. 1404(a))      and transfer the case to itself for trial purposes, the      Supreme Court in Lexecon, Inc. v. Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes      & Lerach, 523 U.S. 26 (1998), held that statutory authority      did not exist for a district judge conducting pretrial      proceedings to transfer a case to itself for trial. The Court      noted that the proper venue for resolving the desirability of      such self-transfer authority is ``the floor of Congress.''       A proposal to amend section 1407 in response to the Lexecon      decision was approved by the Judicial Conference at its      September 1998 session and is supported by the Judicial Panel      on Multidistrict Litigation. As experience has shown, there      is wisdom in permitting the judge who is familiar with the      facts and parties and pretrial proceedings of a transferred      case to retain the case for trial. Also, as with most federal      civil actions, multidistrict litigation cases are typically      resolved through settlement. Allowing the transferee judge to      set a firm trial date promotes the resolution of these cases.       Section 3 of H.R. 860 adds a new section 1369 to title 28,      United States Code, entitled ``multiparty, multiforum      jurisdiction.'' It essentially provides that the United      States district courts shall have jurisdiction over any civil      action that arises from a single accident or event in which      at least 25 persons have died or been injured at a particular      location, where any such injuries result in alleged damages      exceeding $150,000 by each plaintiff and which involves      minimal diversity between adverse parties. The legislation      also requires that one defendant must reside in a state that      is different from the location of the accident or the      residence of any other defendant or that substantial parts of      the event took place in different states. The transferee      court would be authorized to determine issues of liability      and punitive damages and would remand cases to the transferor      court for determinations of compensatory damages, unless the      court finds, for the convenience of parties and witnesses and      in the interest of justice, that the action should be      retained for the determination of damages. The district      court, however, must abstain from hearing an action under the      bill if a substantial majority of all plaintiffs are citizens      of a single state of which the primary defendants are also      citizens and the claims asserted will be governed primarily      by the laws of that state.       Upon consideration of related proposals during the 100th      Congress, the Judicial Conference in March 1988 approved in      principle the creation of federal jurisdiction that would      rely on minimal diversity to consolidate multiple litigation      in state and federal courts of cases involving personal      injury or property damage and arising out of a single event.      The Conference endorsed the idea of redirecting diversity      jurisdiction to serve a purpose that state courts are not      able to serve, namely to facilitate the consolidation of      scattered actions arising out of the same accident or event      and thereby ``to promote more expeditious and economical      disposition of such litigation.''       Today, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation can      transfer to one judge for pretrial proceedings those cases      involving common questions of fact that are pending in      federal courts throughout the country. 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1407.      Section 3 of H.R. 860 would expand federal jurisdiction by      allowing state cases arising from a single event (such as a      plane crash or hotel fire) to be brought into such process as      a result of filing, removal, or intervention. Section 3 of      the bill would avoid multiple trials on common issues,      minimize litigation costs, and ensure that litigants are      treated consistently and fairly. Thus, this legislation will      promote the resolution of litigants' claims in these unique      and related cases.       Thank you for taking prompt action on this important and      necessary legislation. If you or your staff have any      questions, please contact Mike Blommer, Assistant Director,      Office of Legislative Affairs (202-502-1700).           Sincerely,                                            Leonidas Ralph Mecham,     Secretary.                                  ____                                                 Judicial Panel on                                     Multidistrict Litigation,                                                   March 13, 2001.     Hon. F. James Sensenbrenner, Jr.,     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, House of          Representatives, Rayburn House Office Building,          Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Chairman: On behalf of the Judicial Panel on      Multidistrict Litigation, I am writing to urge support of      H.R. 860, the Multidistrict, Multiparty, Multiforum Trial      Jurisdiction Act of 2001. As you know, my predecessor as      Chairman of the Panel, Judge John F. Nangle, testified in      favor of the previous version of this legislation on June 16,      1999, before the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual      Property.       Section 2 of this legislation, to restore the options      available to the litigants and the federal judiciary prior to      the 1998 Supreme Court Lexecon decision, passed unanimously      word-for-word in both the House of Representatives and the      Senate in the last Congress. The previous version of Section      3 of the legislation, aimed at streamlining adjudication of      single accident litigation, has passed the House of      Representatives in bipartisan fashion on four prior      occasions--twice when the Democrats were in the majority in      the 101st and 102nd Congresses, and twice when the      Republicans were in the majority in the 105th and 106th      Congresses.       Surely the time has come to enact this clearly beneficial      legislation for the reasons stated in Judge Nangle's      testimony. Your continued leadership in this area is highly      valued and appreciated.           Sincerely,                                               Wm. Terrell Hodges,                                                         Chairman.
