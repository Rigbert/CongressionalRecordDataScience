And the reason it is that is because this bill legalizes offsets. Over 40 percent of the offsets that have been created under the Kyoto Protocol have come from China. The $2.2 trillion that will be transferred through purchase of offsets in foreign countries will be the largest nonmilitary foreign aid bill that this House of Representatives has ever passed.  The chart that is beside me here shows that the $2.2 trillion in foreign giveaways is equal to 210 times the amount of money we give to help people with domestic heating oil and propane; 119 times the amount of money we give for making buildings more efficient; 111 times the money we give for clean vehicle technology; 33 times the money that we give for domestic natural gas consumers; 11 times the amount that we give for the domestic industrial sector; and five times the amount that we give to help out our domestic electric consumers.  Madam Speaker, this money should be spent at home. We have enough problems at home that we have to deal with, and I think the Congress has recognized this today. But let's not send more money overseas, money that will come through higher prices at the pump, higher bills from our utilities, higher food prices when we buy them in the supermarket.  Vote this bill down, and keep the money at home.
