Speaker, last evening on November 6, the greater Toledo community gathered at Temple Shomer Emunim to pay tribute to the heroic life of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. Our citizenry humbly assembled--Jew, Muslim, Hindu, Christian, people of all faiths and denominations--to stand together as free people, of diverse heritage, to light candles of commemoration and of peace. Our people wished to demonstrate that here in the United States--a Nation dedicated to justice, human betterment, and ``E Pluribus Unum''--One from many--we stand at one with people of peace, wherever they reside.  We witness through our unity as well as our deep sorrow that the hope for peace for which Prime Minister Rabin laid down his life will enlarge the resolve of the entire world to bring its human and spiritual resources to bear on the Middle East peace process. May the cause for which he so nobly shed his blood be sanctified.  The heartfelt remarks of Rabbi Alan Sokobin, cochair community relations of the Jewish Federation of Greater Toledo, delivered with eloquence, offered deep comfort and inspiration. Let them be inserted in this Record as historical evidence of the international understanding of our Toledo community and the deep desire of all our people for reconciliation.  Those officiating at the ceremony included: Michael Berebitsky, president of the Jewish Federation of Greater Toledo; Rabbi Samuel Weinstein, Temple Shomer Emunim; Cantor Judy Seplowin, Temple Shomer Emunim; Cantor David Friedes, Temple Bnai Israel; Rabbi Arnold Bienstock, Temple Bnai Israel; Judah Segal, executive director of the Jewish Federation of Greator Toledo and Jewish community representatives; Cantor Evan Rubin, Congregation Etz Chayim; Rabbi Edward Garsek, Congregation Etz Chayim; and Rabbi Sokobin.  Mr. Speaker, Rabbi Sokobin spoke on behalf of our entire community when he said of the death of Prime Minister Rabin: ``We all now share a pain which will not go away.''  Then he reminded us of the life of Prime Minister Rabin:       [All his life, almost all his years were years of war. He      was a first generation Sabra born of parents who fled      persecution in Europe. His parents met when they fought side      by side defending the Jews of the Old City who were      defenseless when attacked in the orchestrated riots, the      pogroms, of 1920. As a child of the thirties he was aware of      tragedy enveloping the Jews of Europe. In Palestine, there      were descriptions of horror as European Jewry was being      wrapped in bloody shrouds of hatred. He was very conscious,      deeply affected, by both the hatred of Jews in Europe and the      enmity of Arabs.       His youthful passion was agronomy. He wanted to plant, to      cultivate, to inspire the sacred soil to flourish. A young      man of exceptional intelligence, at Kadoorie Agricultural      School, he was the number one student. He achieved the      highest score, comparable to one SAT scores, in Palestine.      But he gave up his personal dream and accepted onerous      responsibility. He became a soldier. He dropped the plowshare      and took up the sword. His adult life was the sword. His army      service was dedicated to killing. As a young man he killed,      personally. Later, as a military commander he directed others      that they might kill. He was well acquainted with death.       His final evening of life, at a rally for peace he joined      in singing the song: Shiru shir la-shalom, sing a song of      peace].  Mr. Speaker, it is our desire as the Toledo community on an interfaith and interdenominational basis to journey to the Middle East and to Israel as we recommit ourselves as witnesses to peace and in his memory and in our own way help Prime Minister Rabin's dream of peace reach ultimate fulfillment.  May God rest his soul and give comfort to his family, the people of Israel, and peace-loving peoples everywhere.  Mr. Speaker, I include the remarks of Rabbi Sokobin for the Record, as follows:       I have stood before you and represented you in other      dolorous occasions. During moments of personal grief when      your beloved lay before you and your grief required      articulation you turned to me for words to tell of the      immensity of your sorrow. I spoke for you other times as      well. When we all were gripped by unbearable excruciating      communal anguish such as that time of evil when the Israeli      athletes were massacred at Munich. Who can forget our      emotions when there was that craven attack on Yom Kippur, our      holiest of days. We have gathered together as caring      community too many times when implacable enemies used the      sword and inflicted unbearable pain.       Each time that I spoke to and for the community, I faced my      own humanness and my own personal limitations. I could not      explain those verities which were beyond my ken. I could not      really interpret the activities of others that were outside      of my understanding. I could not and still cannot understand,      comprehend, the depth of hatred in some that they would wage      war and commit terrorism. I could not and still cannot      understand the malignity and cruelty of human beings who are      willing to, who desire to, inflict excruciating pain on      others.       But in the past it was enemies of the Jewish people who      were uncompromising and unrelenting in their hostility. It      was enemies who had views of destruction on their lips. This      is the first time where the ripping, searing pain was caused,      generated, not by a foe. What crushes my soul, causing      agonizing soul searching, is what so many have said with      simple majesty, ``Jews don't kill Jews.'' Until now it has      been a truism, an irrefutable axiom, that the political and      ideological cannibalism that infects and contaminates other      societies has not tainted Jewish life. Until now!       Yitzhak Rabin's life was taken by a senseless, irrational,      stupid and unthinking act. That the finger that pulled the      trigger had pointed to words in Torah is unthinkable! That a      Jew could denigrate all that we represent, our ideals, our      sanctified mission, the visions enunciated in our tradition,      our God given flawless purposes is monstrous. We all now      share a pain which will not go away. That this pain would be      generated by the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin is also      unthinkable. He in his life represented Israel's and the      Jewish people's highest hope. In the moments prior to his      death he exemplified and epitomized the torturous path of our      people in our generation.       All his life, almost all his years were years of war. He      was a first generation Sabra born of parents who fled      persecution in Europe. His parents met when they fought side      by side defending the Jews of the Old City who were      defenseless when attacked in the orchestrated riots, the      pogroms, of 1920. As a child of the thirties he was aware of      tragedy enveloping the Jews of Europe. In Palestine, there      were descriptions of horror as European Jewry was being      wrapped in bloody shrouds of hatred. He was very conscious,      deeply affected, by both the hatred of Jews in Europe and the      enmity of Arabs.       His youthful passion was agronomy. He wanted to plant to      cultivate, to inspire the sacred soil to flourish. A young      man of exceptional intelligence, at Kadoorie Agricultural      School, he was the number one student. He achieved the      highest score, comparable to our SAT scores, in Palestine.      But he gave up his personal dream and accepted onerous      responsibility. He became a soldier. He dropped the plowshare      and took up the sword. His adult life was the sword. His army      service was dedicated to killing. As a young man he killed,      personally. Later, as a military commander he directed others      that they might kill. He was well acquainted with death.       His final evening of life, at a rally for peace he joined      in singing the song: Shiru, shir la-shalom, sing a song of      peace! He was blessed with active intelligence, deep      commitment, dedication and unusual ability but he was not      endowed with a singing voice. But he sang, Shini Shir la-     shalom which is the Israeli equivalent of sixties song. ``All      we are asking, is give peace a chance.'' This was his final      vision, his hope. He wanted the blessing to live to see his      Israel proud, strong, productive, living in amity and concord      in the family of nations. He wanted to lead his country and      his people who had been tortured by generations of war, a      people who knew well the torment of mangled bodies and hasty      funerals, to peace. He had walked with grieving families      accompanying their loved ones to their place of peace in the      military cemetery. Now he asked them to walk with him on a      path of hope, not of promises, but trust and faith. He asked      them to sing a new song, a song of peace.       We have gathered together on this sorrowful and melancholy      evening not to mourn a man. By any measurable standard he was      immensely successful and fulfilled. he was a richly loved and      loving husband, parent and grandparent. He was an eminent      soldier and statesman, honored by the world for his      achievements. Beyond these accomplishments, which reflected      both his leadership qualities and his humaneness, Yitzhak      Rabin fulfilled a fundamental Biblical mandate       And they shall beat their swords into plowshares       And their spears into pruning hooks       Nation shall not lift up sword against nation       Neither shall they learn war anymore. (Micah 4:3)               This memorial service honors Yitzhak Rabin, a planter and a      soldier. He protected his people, their ideals, and planted      within them new hope. A hope which is ours as Jews. But our      service is not only a memorial. It is our response to our      initial question. How could a Jew slaughter another Jew? I      have heard, as you must have as well, numerous commentators      refer to the ``loss of innocence'' in Israel. Innocence      meaning naivety, perhaps. But innocence meaning purity,      integrity, utopian idealism is not lost. No one can take this      from us. Not as long as we maintain those ideals, those      sacred purposes. We are a sanctified people. We are not      pragmatic: we are prophetic. For us, this is our moment of      recommitment. Now we dedicate ourselves to share with our      fellow Jews of Israel, our brethren throughout the world in      all our habitations to seek a path of reconciliation and      equitable peace.       We would have a peace predicated upon the ancient      principles enunciated in our sacred tradition. We must devote      ourselves to ancient the mandate given us by the great Rabbi      Hillel.       Be of the disciples of Aaron.       Love peace, pursue peace.       Reach out to your fellow human being. (Ethics of the      Fathers).       We must stretch forth our hands, reaching across the gulf      of hostility, to create peace, amity, concord and hope.                          ____________________
