  Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for the nomination of Professor William Alan Fletcher to the Ninth Circuit Court. I very much appreciate the views of the chairman of the committee, the distinguished Senator from Utah, on this, and his considered judgment that Mr. Fletcher deserves approval by this body. And I hope, indeed, that will be the case.  Mr. Fletcher has been before this body for over 3 years now. He has had two Judiciary Committee hearings. I had the pleasure of attending both and listening to him. His responses at these hearings were crisp, to the point, direct, and showed a depth and breadth of knowledge of the law that I think is among the top one percent of those nominees who came before the committee.  His credentials are impeccable. As the chairman pointed out, they include: magna cum laude graduate of Harvard; Rhodes scholar; law degree from Yale; service in the Navy; law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice William Brennan; and a clerkship for District Court Judge Stanley Weigel.  Since 1977, he has been a distinguished professor at the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, where he won the 1993 Distinguished Teacher Award and has come to be regarded as one of the most foremost experts on the Federal court and the Constitution.  Mr. President, since the distinguished Senator from Alabama raised some concerns about this nominee, I would like to respond to some of those concerns. We asked Mr. Fletcher to respond, and, in fact, he provided us with a response on a number of items that have been raised by Mr. Thomas Jipping, of the Judicial Selection Monitoring Project, and subsequently repeated.  The first allegation is what was called the ``discretionary Constitution.'' Mr. Jipping attributes to Professor Fletcher the conclusion:       When judges think that the political branches are not doing      what they should, judges have the discretionary power to do      it for them.  And he states:       Mr. Fletcher writes that this virtually unlimited judicial      discretion is a ``legitimate substitute for political      discretion'' when the political branches are ``in default.''  I would like to give you directly the statement from Mr. Fletcher.  The article says quite the opposite of what Mr. Jipping wrote. I do not believe in a ``discretionary Constitution.'' As the article makes plain, I view judicial discretion as a problem rather than a solution. Further, I did not write that judicial discretion is legitimate when political branches are ``in default.'' Rather, I wrote that the exercise of judicial discretion in curing constitutional violations in institutional suits is ``presumptively illegitimate'' unless the political bodies that should cure those violations are in ``serious and chronic default.''  I would like to put all of this in the Record.  On the second point that has been raised critically, on standing, Mr. Fletcher writes:       Contrary to what Mr. Jipping wrote, I do not believe      Congress can write statutes that allow anyone or anything to      sue. Indeed, in some cases I take a narrower view of standing      than the Supreme Court. For example, I argued that the Court      should not have granted standing in Buckley v. Valeo. My      position on standing would not drastically expand caseloads.      Further, rather than inviting judges to legislate from the      bench, I am particularly anxious that the Federal courts not      perform as a ``super-legislature.''  The third point that he has been criticized for is the unconstitutionality of statutes. The critic writes:       Mr. Fletcher believes that judges can declare      unconstitutional legislation they believe was inadequately      considered by Congress. He argues that a statute effectively      terminating lawsuits against defense contractors by      substituting the United States as the defendant was passed      without hearings and based on what he believes are      misrepresentations about its operation. That alone would be      sufficient to strike down the statute.  Now, this is Mr. Fletcher's response:       I believe no such thing. I argued that the presumption of      constitutionality normally accorded to a statute should not      be accorded to the Warner Amendment, based on the following      factors: (1) The only body in Congress that considered the      amendment was a subcommittee of the House Judiciary      Committee, which held hearings and concluded that it was      unconstitutional; (2) When the amendment was later attached      as a rider to an unrelated defense appropriations bill, it      was consistently described as doing the opposite of what it      actually did.  And so, if I might, to clear these things up, Mr. Fletcher has submitted to us a draft response, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record both the allegations and the responses.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Dear Senator Feinstein: I write to correct some      mischaracterizations of my writing that have been put forward      by Mr. Thomas Jipping.       The most extensive misrepresentations are contained in Mr.      Jipping's May 10, 1996, op-ed piece in The Washington Times.      I will take them in order.                        (1) judicial discretion       Mr. Jipping wrote: ``First, Mr. Fletcher believes in what      he has called a ``discretionary Constitution.'' In fact, that      was the title of his first law review article. When judges      think the political branches are not doing what they should,      judges have the discretionary power to do it for them. Mr.      Fletcher writes that this virtually unlimited judicial      discretion is a ``legitimate substitute for political      discretion'' when the political branches are ``in default.''      Not surprisingly, judges get to determine when the political      process has defaulted. Today courts are running prison      systems, school districts and even mental institutions in the      name of such discretion.'' The article Mr. Jipping refers to      is ``The Discretionary Constitution: Institutional Remedies      and Judicial Legitimacy,'' 91 Yale L.J. 635 (1982).       Brief statement: The article says quite the opposite of      what Mr. Jipping wrote. I do not believe in a ``discretionary      Constitution.'' As the article makes plain, I view judicial      discretion as a problem rather than a solution. Further, I      did not write that judicial discretion is legitimate when      political branches are ``in default.'' Rather, I wrote that      the exercise of judicial discretion in curing constitutional     violations in institutional suits is ``presumptively      illegitimate'' unless the political bodies that should cure      those violations are in ``serious and chronic default.'' at      pp. 637, 695 (emph. added).       Extended analysis: The article analyzed institutional      injunctions where there has already been a finding of      unconstitutionality in the operation of a prison or mental      hospital, in the apportionment of a legislature, or in the      racial segregation of public schools. After there has been a      finding of a constitutional violation, the question arises:      Who should decide how that violation should be cured? Even      where there has been a constitutional violation, I argue that      the role of the federal courts should be severely      circumscribed, and that judicially formulated injunctions      should be regarded as presumptively illegitimate.       Constitutional violations in institutional cases can be      cured in many ways. For example, in a prison case where      conditions of confinement violate the Eighth Amendment, a      prison administrator can do a number of different things to      bring the prison into compliance with the Constitution. Or      in a reapportionment case a state legislature can draw      district lines in a number of different ways to bring the      districts into compliance with the Fourteenth Amendment.      Choices among the possible remedies inescapably involved      the exercise of discretion, and should be regarded as      presumptively illegitimate if made by a judge rather than      a political entity. I wrote: ``Trial court remedial      discretion [in institutional suits] can to some degree be      controlled in the manner of its exercise; in some cases it      may even be eliminated without sacrificing unduly the      constitutional or other values at stake. But there comes a      point where certain governmental tasks, whether undertaken      by the political branches or the judiciary, simply cannot      be performed effectively without a substantial mount of      discretion. * * * The practical inevitability of remedial      discretion in performing those tasks defines the      legitimate role of the federal courts. * * * [S]ince trial      court remedial discretion in institutional suits is      inevitably political in nature, it must be regarded as      presumptively illegitimate.'' at pp. 636-37 (emph. added).       In Swann v.  Mecklenberg Board of Education, 402 U.S. 1, 16      (1971), Chief Justice Burger wrote for the Court that the      district court has the power to fashion an institutional      injunction only ``[i]n default by the school authorities of      their obligation to proffer acceptable remedies'' (emph.      added). I argued that ``default'' by the political      authorities--which in the view of the Supreme Court justified      a judicially fashioned injunction--should be found only as a      last resort. I wrote. ``Political bodies and courts respond      to different institutional imperatives. * * * As a matter of      fundamental structure, even where a constitutional violation      has been found, a court cannot legitimately resolve such a      problem unless the political bodies that ordinarily should do      so are in such serious and chronic default that here is      realistically no other choice.'' at p. 695 (emph. added).       My argument is neither liberal not activist. Indeed, my      formulation is more conservative and restrained than Chief      Justice Burger's in Charlotte-Mecklenberg, where he required      that school authorities simply be ``in default.'' I      recommended increasing the threshold for judicial action by      requiring that the political body be in ``such serious and      chronic default that there is realistically no other      choice.''       Throughout the article, I emphasized the danger in judicial      overreaching: ``[A] federal court is not, and should not      permit itself the illusion that it can be, anything more than      a temporarily legitimate substitute for a political body that      has failed to serve its function. '' at 969.                              (2) Standing       Mr. Jipping wrote: ``Second, the Constitution limits court      jurisdiction to `cases' and `controversies.' One way to      assure this jurisdiction is to demand that plaintiffs      concretely trace their injury to the defendant's action,      preventing judges from reaching out to decide issues and make      law in the abstract. In a 1988 article, Mr. Fletcher argues      that standing is merely a way of looking at the merits of a      case rather than assuring a court's jurisdiction. As such, he      believes that Congress can write statues that allow anyone or      anything to sue, regardless of whether plaintiffs have      suffered any harm at all. This view would drastically expand      federal court caseloads and give judges innumerable      opportunities to legislate from the bench.'' The article Mr.      Jipping refers to is ``The Structure of Standing,'' 98 Yale      L.J. 221 (1988).       Brief statement: Contrary to what Mr. Jipping wrote, I do      not believe Congress can write statutes that allow anyone or      anything to sue. Indeed, in some cases I take a narrower view      of standing than the Supreme Court. For example, I argued      that the Court should not have granted standing in Buckley v.      Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976). My position on standing would not      drastically expand caseloads. Further, rather than inviting      judges to legislate from the bench, I am particularly anxious      that the federal courts not perform as a ``super-     legislature.''       Extended analysis: The article sought to bring some      intellectual order to an area of doctrine long criticized as      incoherent. I agreed with Justice Harlan that standing as      presently articulated is ``a word game played by secret      rules.'' Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 129 (1968) (Harlan, J.,      dissenting) at 221. My concern was not to argue for different      results in standing cases, but rather to provide a coherent      intellectual structure that would support those results. As I      wrote, ``[W]e mistake the nature of the problem if we condemn      the results in standing cases.'' at 223 (emph added).       In my view, Justice Douglas' opinion in Association of Data      Processing Service Org. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150 (1970), is the      source of much of the analytical difficulty. I stated, ``More      damage to the intellectual structure of the law of standing      can be traced to Data Processing than to any other single      decision.'' at 229. In essence, I argued that standing      doctrine should return to what it had been at the beginning      of this century, when a plaintiff in federal court has to      state a cause of action, and the focus was on the particular      statutory or constitutional provision invoked by plaintiff.      Under this earlier approach, a plaintiff has to show that he      was entitled to relief ``on the merits,'' in the sense not      only that defendant violated a legal duty but also that      plaintiff had a legal right to judicial enforcement of that      duty.       In a few cases, I disagreed with results reached by the      Supreme Court. In those few cases, I generally viewed      standing more narrowly than the Court and would have denied      standing. The most important such case is Buckley v. Valeo,      424 U.S. 1 (1976). I did not criticize the substance of the      Court's decision, but I did criticize its grant of standing.       In Buckley, the Court sustained a statutory grant of      standing to any person eligible to vote for President to      challenge on any constitutional ground the Federal Election      Campaign Act of 1971. Plaintiffs included Senator Buckley who      had introduced the standing provision in the Senate. They      challenged the Act under the statutory grant of standing; the      District Court certified twenty-two constitutional questions      to the Supreme Court; and the Court answered all of them. I      wrote: ``[I]f the twenty-two certified questions answered in      Buckley had been sent to the Court in a letter from the      Senate floor, as the twenty-nine questions in Correspondence      of the Justices were sent to the Court in a letter from      Secretary of State Jefferson[, i]t is unthinkable that the      Court would have answered them. Yet when Congress cast the      questions in the form of a lawsuit granting standing to one      of its members, the Court in Buckley willingly provided the      answers, performing, in Judge Leventhal's words, in a ``role      resembling that of a super-legislature.'' The lessons of      Buckley are sobering. Not only will the Court answer      questions that have proven particularly difficult for      Congress. It will also answer them in the highly abstract      form traditionally thought particularly ill-suited for      judicial resolution.'' at 286 (emph. added). My approach to      standing could hardly be clearer: I argued that the Court      should not have granted standing and should not have acted as      a ``super-legislature.''                  (3) Unconstitutionality of statutes       Mr. Jipping wrote: ``Third, Mr. Fletcher believes that      judges can declare unconstitutional legislation they believe      was inadequately considered by Congress. He argues that a      statute effectively terminating lawsuits against defense      contractors by substituting the United States as the      defendant was passed without hearings and based on what he      believes are misrepresentations about its operation. That      alone would be sufficient to strike down the statute.'' The      article Mr. Jipping refers to is ``Atomic Bomb Testing and      the Warner Amendment: A Violation of the Separation of      Powers,'' 65 Wash. L. Rev. 285 (1990).       Brief statement: I believe no such thing. I argued that the      presumption of constitutionality normally accorded to a      statute should not be accorded to the Warner Amendment, based      on the following factors: (1) The only body in Congress that      considered the Amendment was a subcommittee of the House      Judiciary Committee, which held hearings and concluded that      it was unconstitutional; (2) when the Amendment was later      attached as a rider to an unrelated defense appropriations      bill, it was consistently described as doing the opposite of      what it actually did.       Elimination of the presumption does not mean that a statute      is unconstitutional. A statute is unconstitutional only if it      independently violates some provision of the Constitution.      I did not argue--and do not believe--that inadequate      consideration by Congress ``alone would be sufficient to      strike down a statute.''       Extended analysis: At the outset, I note that I wrote the      article as an advocate for the American military veterans and      civilian downwinders. My involvement as advocate is indicated      at the beginning of the article at 285, *fn.       Between 1946 and 1963, the United States conducted a little      over 300 atmospheric tests of atomic bomb, about 200 of them      in Nevada. Over 200,000 soldiers and an undetermined number      of civilians were exposed to significant amounts of radiation      during the tests. Atmospheric tests were discontinued in 1963      after the United States signed a test ban treaty. In the      1980s, a number of suits were filed against the private      contractors who had assisted the government in the tests.      Seeking to short-circuit the suits, the contractors sought a      statute that would protect them. Joined by the executive      branch, they sought a statute that would substitute the      United States as a defendant in their place, and would then      permit the United States to obtain a dismissal on grounds of      sovereign immunity.       In 1983, a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee      held hearings on the proposed statute and issued a written      report concluding that it would be unconstitutional. The      following year, Senator Warner attached the proposed statute      as a rider to a defense appropriation bill. The conference      committee report said that the amendment ``would provide      remedy against the United States,'' even though it was clear      that the intent, and ultimate effect, would be to deprive the      plaintiffs of any remedy at all. After the passage of the      Amendment, the District Court substituted the United States      as a defendant and dismissed the suits. In re Consolidated      United States Atmospheric Testing Litigation, 616 F.Supp. 759      (N.D. Calif. 1985), aff'd sub nom. Konizeski v. Livermore      Labs, 820 F.2d 982 (9th Cir. 1987), cert. den., 485 U.S. 905      (1988).       I argued that the Warner Amendment violated separation of      powers by interfering with the judicial function in violation      of United States v. Klein, 80 U.S. 128 (1872). I contended      the Warner Amendment should not enjoy the normal presumption      of constitutionality: ``[C]ourts ordinarily accord a strong      presumption of constitutionality to any legislation that is      enacted in accordance with the formally required process. We      should be very reluctant to abandon the presumption when a      statute has fulfilled the formal prerequisites, but in      certain circumstances such an abandonment may be justified. .      . . [In the case of the Warner Amendment] we have . . .      affirmative evidence that the one body in Congress that      seriously considered the amendment found it unconstitutional.      Moreover, we know that the bill was passed thereafter only by      avoiding hearings and misrepresenting the bill's character.      Under such circumstances, the Warner Amendment can hardly lay      claim to the traditional presumption in favor of a statute's      constitutionality.'' at 320 (emph. added).                        (4) separation of powers       Mr. Jipping wrote: ``Finally, Mr. Fletcher rejects perhaps      the most important limitation on government power established      by the Constitution's framers, the separation of powers. The      Supreme Court has said what the Framers said, namely, that      each branch has relatively defined and exclusive areas of      authority and power. In a 1987 article, Mr. Fletcher      condemned these decisions as `fundamentally misguided'. Why?      The Court `read the Constitution in a literalistic way to      upset what the other two branches had decided, under the      political circumstances, was the most workable arrangement.'      In other words, political circumstances can trump      constitutional principles.'' The article Mr. Jipping refers      to is a review of Chief Justice Rehnquists's book, The      Supreme Court: How It Was, How It Is, 75 Calif.L.Rev. 1891      (1987).       Brief statement: I do not reject separation of powers.      Indeed, I relied on separation of powers to argue the      unconstitutionality of the Warner Amendment, calling it a      ``vital check against tyranny.'' 65 Wash.L.Rev. at 310. In      the review I criticized two separation of powers decisions by      the Supreme Court, Immigration and Naturalization Service v.      Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983), and Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S.      385 (1986), in which the Court found unconstitutional two      Acts of Congress. Believing in judicial restraint, Justice      White dissented because he found no clear constitutional text      invalidating what Congress had done. I agreed with Justice      White.       Extended analysis: In Immigration and Naturalization      Service v. Chadha, the Supreme Court struck down the use of      the one-house veto by Congress. In Bowsher v. Synar, the      Court struck down the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act providing for      federal deficit reduction. I wrote: ``I think both decisions      fundamentally misguided, for essentially the reasons given by      Justice White in his dissenting opinions. . . . Justice White      pointed out that [Chadha] invalidated, at one stroke, almost      200 statutes on the basis of a highly debatable reading of      the Constitution. Invoking Justice Jackson's emphasis on a      `workable government' in his concurrence in the Steel Seizure      Case, Justice White reminded the Court that the `wisdom of      the Framers was to anticipate that . . . new problems of      governance would require different solutions.' . . . Justice      White, [dissenting in Bowsher], again invoked Justice      Jackson's view of the Constitution as a charter for a      `workable government,' and objected to what he saw as the      Court's `distressingly formalistic view' in attaching      dispositive significance to what should be regarded as a      triviality.' '' at 1894.       Justices White and Jackson firmly believed in a non-     activist judiciary. As a matter of interpretive principle,      they deferred to the judgment of the political branches      unless the clear text of the Constitution commanded      otherwise. I agree with them.       I thank you for the opportunity to correct these      mischaracterizations.           Very truly yours,                                              William A. Fletcher.
