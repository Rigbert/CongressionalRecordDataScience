No? I am checking on it.  But I am saying here, publicly, I voted for the ACA. I think the ACA was good for the country, and one of the pay-fors we said we would pay for, and we did, one of the pay-fors was IPAB.  If we want to substitute some other way to pay for the healthcare that we are giving, fine. That will not increase the debt. But if we don't pay for repeal of this IPAB, it is going to increase the debt.  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. My question to the gentleman is: We have brought to the floor, twice, the repeal of IPAB. Am I understanding correctly that you voted to repeal that?
