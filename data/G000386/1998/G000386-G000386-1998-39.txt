 President, before we accept this amendment--I understand that we will do that, and I prefer that we do--I commend the Senator from Connecticut for his hard work on this issue. I have to say that I think the Senator is on to something here. We ought to encourage parents, obviously, to save for education and to protect these savings in bankruptcies. So philosophically we are all on the same page.  The problem in a situation like this is the devil is in the details, especially when it comes to making changes to the bankruptcy code.  I want to express my concern that the amendment of the Senator from Connecticut could unintentionally open a loophole for abuse. I understand that the Senator from Connecticut is also concerned about this and that he does not want any unintended consequences of his amendment which would allow for more bankruptcy abuse.  Accordingly, I intend to continue working to improve this amendment so that it accomplishes its goal without giving crooks an opportunity to hide and shield their assets during bankruptcy proceedings.  I had similar concerns about the amendment that Senator Hatch offered to protect retirement savings. I think we worked hard and good and accomplished a lot with Senator Hatch to tighten up that amendment.  As a result, the amendment that we passed to protect the retirement accounts is better and less subject to abuse. I am sure that we can improve the amendment by Senator Dodd in the same way.  I yield the floor.
