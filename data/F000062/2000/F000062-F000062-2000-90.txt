 President, I want to, from the Democratic side, more or less conclude the debate on the legislative branch appropriations bill.  We believe it is a good bill. We are very supportive--both Senator Bennett and I--of Senator Mikulski's amendment. I am delighted she offered it.  The men and women of the Capitol Police perform a vitally important job. Unfortunately, sometimes we hardly notice them. This is an opportunity to give them notice, respect, commendation, and say we are proud of you.  The legislative branch appropriations bill restores the damaging cuts contained in the House bill and reaffirms our commitment to ensuring security in the Capitol and of the Capitol Police.  I reiterate what a delight it has been to work with our chairman, Senator Bennett. My tenure as ranking member on this subcommittee has been marked by a sense of comity and equity which has really made this work a great pleasure.  I yield the floor.
