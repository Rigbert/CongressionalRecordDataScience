 Mr. McINTOSH.  Mr. Chairman, when I saw the gentleman's Dear Colleague, I was concerned about it. It is a question that none of us want to see our brave men and women who are fire fighters put in danger. As I understand it, the concern is that those notices, the Hazmat notices, are needed because without them there could be a potential to cause serious harm to the public; specifically, to the fire fighters who would go in and fight those battles.
