Mr. Speaker, the week before last we passed the crap-and-trade bill, which is a terrible bill. It's a tax.  Then we celebrated Independence Day. And the week before Independence Day, we became more dependent on foreign countries for our fossil fuels.  We have fossil fuels in the United States, and we need them. Next year we're going to spend $552 billion buying oil from overseas.  I think it's time that this Congress accepts the fact that we have to have fossil fuels for the bridge to the future in order to have the ability to provide power for this country. Let's do the right thing for this Nation.                          ____________________
