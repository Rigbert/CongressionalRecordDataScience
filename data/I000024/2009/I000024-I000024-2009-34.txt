Jones, on the occasion of his retirement from active duty in the U.S. Army. Lieutenant Colonel Jones is an exceptional officer who has served our great Nation for more than 28 years, including 22 years on active duty and 6 years in the Iowa Army National Guard.  I have personally come to know and respect Lieutenant Colonel Jones over the 2\1/2\ years he served as an Army congressional liaison for the Army's weapons and tracked combat vehicles programs, to include the Army's FutureCombat System. His expertise and commitment were instrumental in educating Members and staff in the Senate and House on Army combat systems, modernization programs and initiatives. His tireless efforts working with Members and staff of the Senate and House Armed Services Committees were instrumental in the successful authorization and appropriation of the Abrams tank, Bradley fighting vehicle, small arms and crew-served weapons, Stryker, elements of the Future Combat System and the Paladin Integrated Management programs.  Lieutenant Colonel Jones' congressional liaison assignment was only the capstone to what is an outstanding career of service to the Army and our Nation. He served as an armor officer in numerous command and staff positions. His operational assignments began in the Mojave Desert at Fort Irwin, CA, serving as a platoon leader at the National Training Center where he trained thousands of soldiers in desert warfare. He served as commander for Alpha Company, 4th Battalion 37th Armor, Heavy, followed by command of Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd of the 70th Armor Battalion with the 1st Armored Division at Fort Riley, KS. After transitioning in to the acquisition career field, Lieutenant Colonel Jones was assigned to Fort Knox, KY, as a combat development officer and as a project manager for the Army's Future Combat System, FCS, in Detroit, MI.  The strength of our soldiers comes from their families. Lieutenant Colonel Jones' strength came from his wife Dynette, and his two sons Colton and Conner. This Nation is grateful for their commitment and personal sacrifices made throughout Shel's military service. We also thank his mother Joyce, who recently passed, and his father William ``Gerry'' Jones for raising such a fine son and patriot. Shel is from a military family. His father is a retired soldier and his brother, Dr. Keith Jones, serves as a major in the National Guard. This Nation remains indebted to your service.  On behalf of the Senate and the United States of America, I commend Lieutenant Colonel Jones for his tireless efforts in the support of our Army, our military, and our Nation. As Shel and his family prepare to start a new life in the great State of Oklahoma, I congratulate him on completing an extremely successful military career and wish all of them the best in all their future endeavors.                          ____________________
