President, both are beautiful States. Maine is the largest land area, the largest State in New England. Most people are surprised to know that Vermont is the second largest. We beat out New Hampshire by about 90 square miles--larger than Massachusetts, larger than Connecticut, larger than Rhode Island. Smallest in population, but we take a back seat to no one in our independence.  I am glad to see my friend, the Presiding Officer, the distinguished Senator, and distinguished former Governor.  I commend the senior Senator from Connecticut for his outstanding statement last night and the senior Senator from Illinois, our Assistant Democratic leader, for his cogent observations on this matter. The statement this morning by the Senator from Vermont, a veteran, a man of principle and courage, made me proud to serve with him in representing the people of our great State. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin, the ranking Democrat on the Constitution Subcommittee for his statement, and the Senator from Delaware, another veteran, for his well-chosen words, as well.  This morning we awoke to read the latest example of this administration's incompetence. Because of bureaucratic bungling, widows of those who have served this Nation and sacrificed for all of us have been denied the survivors' benefits to which they should be entitled. A leader of the Gold Star Wives of America, a group of 10,000 military widows, was quoted as saying:       It is shameful that the government and Congress do not      deliver the survivor benefits equally to all our widows with      the same compassion and precision the military presents the      folded flag at the grave.  Edie Smith is right and we should be ashamed.  This news follows other recent public reports that posttraumatic stress disorders among our veterans are on the rise. Instead of seeking to turn the flag into a partisan political weapon and the Constitution into a billboard for political slogans, for partisan gain, we should be working to fulfill the pressing needs of our veterans and their families. I wish the Senate would use its time to discuss and solve the real problems that real Americans are facing right now, instead of trying to stir public passions for political ends.  The Republican leadership so rushed this amendment to the floor that there was not a single Senate hearing on it in this Congress. It was marked up in a side room off the Senate Chamber rather than in the regular public hearing room for the Judiciary Committee with very little debate, and it was reported without a committee report. This is the second time in a month that this Senate is rushing to debate a constitutional amendment without following the procedures that ensure thoughtfulness in such an important debate on a proposal to change our fundamental charter and, in this instance, cut back on the Bill of Rights for the first time in our history.  It was noted today in one of the newspapers that the U.S. Senate--the conscience of the country--is expected to spend 4 days debating this amendment--1 for each incident of flag burning that purportedly occurred this year in a Nation of 300 million people. I respectfully suggest that in the less than 10 weeks left to us in session this year, the Senate's resources would be better spent working to improve veterans' health care services, survivors' benefits and protecting veterans' and Americans' privacy. We have just witnessed the largest theft of private information from the Government ever, the loss of information on more than 26.5 million American veterans, including more than 2 million who are in active service, nearly 80 percent of our active-duty force and a large percentage of our National Guard and the Reserve. Why? Because this administration was so incompetent they did not think to lock the door.  This same administration says we need a constitutional amendment to ban flag burning in order to protect our veterans. We are not going to do anything to protect their credit records; we are not going to do anything to protect their privacy. We will leave the door open on that. But we have to watch out for the flag.  Let me quote what a spokeswoman for the American Legion said recently:       Our armed forces personnel have enough on their plates with      fighting the global war on terror, let alone having to worry      about identity theft while deployed overseas. A spokesman for      the VFW said: This confirms the VFW's worst fear from day      one--that the loss of data encompasses every single person      who did wear the uniform and does wear the uniform today.  What does the Bush-Cheney administration say? If you are over there fighting in Ramallah and your identity has been stolen, don't worry. We have an 800-number you can call and maybe buy some insurance or something to protect your credit. Well, call once you are not getting shot at.  Because of the Bush-Cheney administration's recklessness, our veterans and our active-duty servicemembers are now worried whether their personal information is being sold on the black market or available to foreign intelligence services or terrorists. That adds up to a heckuva bad job for America's veterans and our men and women in uniform.  Compounding the incompetence was the misguided impulse of the administration to keep everything secret for as long as they could. Three weeks after the theft, it was finally disclosed. Three weeks after that, the administration finally announced that it would do what it should have done from day 1 by making credit reporting available to those affected. And the administration is still fighting paying for its mistakes. It is resisting the efforts by Senators Byrd and Murray to provide the money needed to pay for credit monitoring and proposing to take the money from veterans health care or other programs. That is wrong.  Such incompetence at the Bush-Cheney Department of Veterans Affairs is worse than anything I have seen in the six Presidential administrations I have served with. At some point, this administration better stop appointing and hiring cronies, and at some point it might really take responsibility. Then we could have some real accountability for their incompetence. The American people suffer, the veterans are at risk, but those in responsibility get medals and promotions and the Republican Congress never gets to the bottom of what happened to make sure it will not happen again.  Rather than work on our privacy and identity theft legislation, rather than proceed on a bill protecting veterans, such as Senator Akaka's or Senator Kerry's, we are being directed to another divisive debate on a proposed constitutional amendment. The White House calls the tune, and this Republican-led Congress is quick to dance to it. This is a White House that does not even list ``veterans'' as an issue on its Web site.  The Nation's veterans--who have been willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country--deserve better. In his second inaugural, while the Nation was fighting the Civil War, President Lincoln concluded with words that became the motto of the Veterans Administration and remains on metal plaques around the Vermont Avenue doors of the VA office here in Washington:       To care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his      widow, and his orphan.  In this fundamental mission, this administration has lost its way.  What the Bush administration's budget says is that honoring veterans is not a priority, especially when it comes to medical care. The President's budget requests consistently fall short of the levels needed to provide necessary services and care. Secretary Nicholson had to admit a billion dollar shortfall last year after first issuing inaccurate and unfounded denials of his mismanagement. Secretary Principi before him had testified that the Veterans Department asked the WhiteHouse for an additional $1.2 billion but that it was denied.  Veterans groups and families know that even these budget requests are inadequate--nearly $3 billion less than what veterans groups like the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America recommend in the Independent Budget. These organizations know what it will take to meet veterans' health care needs.  And when Democratic Senators, such as Senators Murray, Akaka, or Nelson, offer amendments to fund veterans programs, Republicans refuse to support those amendments to bring funding up to the levels recommended by the independent budget and just plain common sense.  We heard in March 2004 from the chairman of the Citizens Flag Alliance, Major General Patrick Brady, that ``we have never fully met the needs of our veterans.'' This echoed General Brady's frank admission following our April 1999 hearing that ``the most pressing issues facing our veterans'' were not flag burnings but rather ``broken promises, especially health care.'' Sadly, it appears that playing politics with veterans' emotions rather than sustaining their health care is nothing new.  During the past 5 years, Congress has had to add billions of dollars more to the President's budget request just to fill gaps in basic services. If we had done as the President asked year after year, veterans' medical care would be in even worse shape. Unfortunately, this year the Congress is not off to an encouraging start. The most recent supplemental spending bill excluded almost $400 million in additional spending for the veterans' health care. Again, the administration said it did not need the additional funding--but our veterans need it.  The Bush-Cheney administration's budget for veterans does not account for the increase in demand for VA services during the Iraq war. With nearly 20 percent of those returning from Iraq reporting mental health problems and 35 percent of Iraq war veterans needing health care services, we are cutting the money. Consider the cost of inflation and the increased costs for medicine and services and you can understand why the American Legion projects that more than $1 billion is needed in further funding just to meet annual payroll and medical inflation costs.  Most disturbing is the move to make veterans contribute a larger share to provide their own health care. The Bush-Cheney administration continues efforts to impose onerous fees and copayments on our Nation's veterans. This parallels the demands on families to buy armor, helmets, and other supplies for their family members serving overseas in our Armed Forces. It is the first time since the Revolution that we have sent our forces out there having to buy their own equipment when they went to war.  The Bush administration plans to increase by almost $800 million this year the fees and collections from third parties for veterans' health care. They plan on imposing an annual enrollment fee and doubling prescription drug copayments for certain veterans. Veterans are being forced to subsidize their government health care. So much for the words on the veterans building in Washington.  I could go on and on describing the claims backlog, the longer waits, and the cuts in service. To add insult to injury, the GAO reported recently that hundreds of battle-wounded soldiers are being pursued for collection of military debts incurred through no fault of their own, due to long-recognized problems with military computer systems. The bottom line is that the administration's rhetoric toward veterans simply does not match its real priorities.  We seem headed back to the time after World War I when veterans had to come to Washington and live in tent cities to demand that the Government honor the words of President Lincoln and care for them and those others had left behind.  Instead of debating polarizing issues that we have talked about in election years, we should be acting to provide real resources for our men and women who served this country with honor and sacrifice.  I will ask to have printed in the Record a collection of recent newspaper articles on veterans needs.  I have stated my position on this flag-burning amendment before. I have stated before that Vermont, the 14th State to join the Union, joined the same year that the Bill of Rights was ratified, then joined by the 15th State. And that became the flag that we had for many years in this country, with 15 stars and 15 stripes. But we Vermonters want to make sure that our rights are being protected.  We amend the Constitution according to the Constitution when there is an urgent need to do so. We have never amended the Bill of Rights--never, ever. Since World War II, since the Civil War, no matter what the threat, we have never amended the Bill of Rights. Now we are being asked for the first time to amend the first amendment.  We are told there is an urgent need. My God, what is the urgent need? Especially since 9/11, more Americans fly the flag probably than any time in my lifetime. I fly the flag outside of my home in Vermont whenever I am there. I flew it for my son when he joined the Marines. I flew it when he finished his time in the Marines.  My flag is protected. If anyone were to steal it, destroy it, desecrate it, they could be prosecuted.  I fly my flag because I want to, and I protect it because I want to. I do not need a law to tell me to do so.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the aforementioned articles be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                Military Fails Some Widows Over Benefits                          (By Lizette Alvarez)       June 27, 2006.--As Holly Wren coped with her 6-month-old      son and the sorrow of losing her husband in Iraq last      November, she assumed that the military's sense of structure      and order would apply in death as it had in life.       Instead she encountered numerous hurdles in trying to      collect survivor benefits. She received only half the amount      owed her for housing because her husband, one of the highest      ranking soldiers to die in Iraq, was listed as single,      childless and living in Florida--wrong on every count. Lt.      Col. Thomas Wren was married, with five children, and living      in Northern Virginia.       She waited months for her husband's retirement money and      more than two weeks for his death benefit, meant to arrive      within days. And then Mrs. Wren went to court to become her      son's legal guardian because no one had told her husband that      a minor cannot be a beneficiary. ``You are a number, and your      husband is a number'' said Mrs. Wren, who ultimately asked      her congressman for help. ``They need to understand that we      are more than that.''       For military widows, many of them young, stay-at-home      mothers, the shock of losing a husband is often followed by      the confounding task of untangling a collection of benefits      from assorted bureaucracies.       While the process runs smoothly for many widows, for others      it is characterized by lost files, long delays, an avalanche      of paperwork, misinformation and gaps in the patchwork of      laws governing survivor benefits.       Sometimes it is simply the Pentagon's massive bureaucracy      that poses the problem. In other cases, laws exclude widows      whose husbands died too early in the war or were killed in      training rather than in combat. The result is that scores of      families--it is impossible to know how many--lose out on      money and benefits that they expected to receive or believed      they were owed, say widows, advocates and legislators.       ``Why do we want to draw arbitrary and capricious lines      that exclude widows?'' asked Senator Mike DeWine, an Ohio      Republican, who has sponsored legislation to close some of      the legal loopholes that penalize widows. ``It seems to me we      ought to err on the side of compassion for families.''       Mr. DeWine said Congress sometimes passes these loopholes      without considering the ramifications. But money also plays a      large factor, and Congress is sometimes compelled to keep      down costs associated with the war. ``That's what you hear      behind the scenes,'' Senator De Wine said.       The Army is also trying to address the problem, for      example, with new call centers intended to help survivors      navigate the bewildering bureaucracy. ``As we always have, we      constantly re-evaluate how we conduct our business to see if      we can improve,'' said Col. Mary Torgersen, director of the      Army casualty affairs operations center.       But legislators and advocates working with widows say the      problems are often systemic, involving payouts by the mammoth      Department of Defense accounting office and the Department of      Veterans Affairs.       A few widows simply fall through the cracks altogether. The      consequences are hard felt: they run up credit card bills,      move in with relatives to save money, pull their children      from private schools, spend money on lawyers or dedicate      countless frustrating hours to unraveling the mix-ups.       ``We have had more of these cases than I wish to know,''      said Ann G. Knowles, president of the National Association of      County Veterans Service Officers, which helps veterans and      widows with their claims.       The Department of Defense offers widows a range of      benefits, including retirement security money, health care,      life insurance payouts and a $100,000 death gratuity. The      Department of Veterans Affairs allocates a minimum $1,033      monthly stipend and temporary transition assistance, among      other things.       Widows also receive money from the Social Security      Administration.       But a benefit is only as valuable as a widow's ability to      claim it. Just days after her husband was killed in Iraq by a      roadside bomb, Laura Youngblood, who was pregnant with their      second child, got another piece of sobering news from the      Navy: Her mother-in-law, who had been estranged from the      family for several years, would be receiving half of her      husband's $400,000 life insurance payment.       Nearly a year later, Mrs. Youngblood, 27, is still trying      to persuade the Navy that the military's accounting      department lost her husband's 2004 insurance form naming her      and her son as co-beneficiaries, along with the rest of his      predeployment paperwork. The only forms the Navy can find are      from 2003, listing an old address for her husband, Travis, an      incorrect rank and no dependents.       The military paperwork was in such disarray, Mrs.      Youngblood said, that her husband went months without combat      pay and family separation pay because the defense accounting      service did not realize he was in Iraq, where he was detached      to a Marine Corps unit.       When the Navy said there was nothing it could do, the      Marine Inspector General's office stepped in to investigate,      forwarding findings to the Navy Inspector General's office.      ``These were my husband's dying wishes: to take care of his      children,'' said Mrs. Youngblood, who has hired a lawyer to      help her. ``You honor his wishes. That's his blood money.''       Congress has won plaudits in the past two years for      increasing the payment after a soldier's death from $12,420      to $100,000 and upping the life insurance payout from      $250,000 to $400,000. It made available to some recent widows      a retirement income benefit for free. Congress has also paved      the way for more generous health and housing benefits. Adding      to that, numerous states have recently introduced free      college tuition and property tax savings.       ``Since 9/11, the demands on survivors are greater and they      are getting much more in benefits,'' said Brad Snyder, the      president of Armed Forces Services Corporation, which helps      survivors with benefits. ``The expectations of what we had in      Vietnam were much lower.''       But to the widows, some of whom adapted their lives to      conform to the military, following their husbands from place      to place, the complications can sting.       Jennifer McCollum, 32, who was raised on bases and whose      husband, Capt. Dan McCollum, a Marine Corps pilot, died in      2002 when his plane crashed in Pakistan, has been busy      lobbying Congress to reverse gaps in the law that penalize      some widows financially simply because of when their husbands      died.       ``The president, whom I support, said in the State of the      Union address that he would not forget the families of the      fallen,'' she said. ``Why have I had to go to D.C. five times      this year?''                            Gaps in the Laws       Hundreds of widows are denied thousands of dollars in      benefits because of arbitrary cut-off dates in the law. The      family of a soldier who was killed in October 2003 receives      less money than the family of a soldier who was killed in      October 2005. ``It is shameful that the government and      Congress do not deliver the survivor benefits equally to all      our widows with the same compassion and precision the      military presents the folded flag at the grave,'' said Edie      Smith, a leader of the Gold Star Wives of America, a group of      10,000 military widows that lobbies Congress and the      Pentagon.       Shauna Moore was tending to her newborn, Hannah, on Feb.      21, 2003, when she learned that her husband, Sgt. Benjamin      Moore, 25, had been shot during a rifle training exercise at      Fort Hood, Tex. Months later, after her grief began to      subside, she noticed that she was not entitled to the same      retirement benefits as more recent widows with children.       Congress allowed certain widows to sign over to their      children their husband's retirement benefit, sidestepping a      steep so-called military widow's tax. But the law applies      only to the widows of service members who died after Nov. 23,      2003. Mrs. Moore is one of an estimated 430 spouses with      children who are ineligible.       If that option were available to Mrs. Moore, she would      collect an extra $10,000 a year until Hannah became an adult.       ``It makes a difference, if you are a single mom,'' she      said.       Last week, the Senate approved Senator DeWine's measure      that would extend the benefit to widows whose husbands died      as far back as Oct. 7, 2001, the start of the war in      Afghanistan. The House did not approve a similar measure,      which is tucked into the Senate Defense Authorization bill,      so now the issue must be resolved in negotiations.       Hundreds of widows also fail to qualify for a monthly      payment of $250 in transition assistance, from the Department      of Veterans Affairs, paid to help children for two years      after their father's death. It applies only to those spouses      whose husbands died after Feb. 1, 2005. Those who lost      husbands before February 2003 received nothing because their      transition is presumably over, and those who were widowed      from 2003 to 2005 received a smaller amount.       Congress has closed some glaring gaps in laws, including      one that excluded many families from the $100,000 death      benefit and the $400,000 insurance payout because the      soldiers' deaths were not combat-related. The outcry forced      Congress last year to include all active-duty deaths since      Oct. 7, 2001, in those benefits.                             The Long Wait       Even good intentions demand patience. A much-upgraded      health care benefit to help the children of service members      who died on active duty has yet to be implemented after 18      months because the new regulations have not been written.       Because Champus/Tricare, the federal insurer for military      families, does not recognize the law, widows are still paying      out more money for health care, which some can ill afford.       The January 2005 law will greatly improve health care for      all children. But Nichole Haycock's severely disabled son,      Colten, 13, may not be among them.       Her husband, Sgt. First Class Jeffrey Haycock, 38, died in      April 2002 after a run; Army doctors had failed to tell him      about a heart condition they had discovered two months      before. But because her husband did not die in a combat-     related situation, her son was denied admission to a program      for the disabled.       As she teeters on the brink of exhaustion, her two other      children get short shrift. ``It's been very difficult to care      for a child that is this severe by myself,'' Mrs. Haycock      said. ``I would love to see my daughter and son in school      events. But I can't do those things.''       Tricare officials cannot say for sure whether her son will      be covered by the 2005 law when the regulations are written.      Francine Forestell, the chief of its customer communications      division, said federal regulators plan to interpret it as      broadly as possible, ``but we can't promise anything,'' she      said.                      A Lost Life but No Insurance       Few cases are as heartbreaking as the widow who winds up      with little or no life insurance money after her husband's      death. In many instances, the husband simply neglected to      change the beneficiary. Little, if anything, can be done to      recoup the money in such a case after it has been paid out,      and advocates emphasize that couples must do a better job of      educating themselves about benefits at pre-deployment family      meetings.       But in some cases, widows said that they had done their      jobs, had double-checked the paperwork and something still      went wrong.       Staff Sgt. Dexter Kimble, 30, a marine, was killed Jan. 26,      2005, when his chopper crashed in an Iraqi sandstorm. It was      his third deployment. Before he left, he redid all his      deployment paperwork, after consulting with his wife,      Dawanna. She noticed that the life insurance form on file      still had designated his mother as a co-beneficiary.       ``I said, `What is this? Because I just had baby number      four,' '' Mrs. Kimble said. ``He had not added baby number      four to the paperwork, either. He said, `Don't worry. I'm      switching that and making you the sole beneficiary.' ''       After his funeral, Mrs. Kimble said her casualty assistance      officer informed her that her husband's paperwork had not      been filed on time. The system had processed the 2001 form,      and her mother-in-law had received half the $400,000. Her      casualty officer offered to call her mother-in-law and      explain what had happened.       ``I assumed it wouldn't be a question of if,'' Mrs. Kimble      said about the money, ``but when.''       Mrs. Kimble, who lives in Southern California, did not get      any money from her mother-in-law. She received $300,000--the      death benefit and half of the insurance money--but used a      chunk to help pay her extended family's way to the burial and      to pay off the car and other debts. Maj. Jason Johnston, a      public affairs officer for the Marine Corps Air Station      Miramar, said the corps processed what it had. ``I'm not      saying the system is infallible,'' he said. ``Anything is      possible.       ``If the Marine tells the spouse one thing and does      another,'' he added, ``that is very unfortunate. But we have      to go by what the marine puts in the system.''       Mrs. Kimble has taken a dead-end job in San Diego and is      worried about the future. To get to work, she gets up at 4      a.m. She pulled one child out of private school. She left her      home and is living with her children in a friend's empty      house. She is also paying for child care for four children.       Lawrence Kelly, a lawyer who is representing Mrs.      Youngblood and Mrs. Kimble, said the problem is not unlike      that confronted by thousands of soldiers who have recently      faced mistakes in their pay made by the military's mammoth      accounting office. ``Same system, same bureaucracy, same      results,'' he said.       Responding to concerns from widows, Congress last year      passed a law stating that if there is a change in the      beneficiary or in the amount of the insurance, a spouse must      be notified. But the law left a major loophole: If a service      member makes no change in his beneficiary after he marries--     if his mother or father were originally named and he did not      change it--his wife does not have to be notified.       ``It has left me frustrated and very bitter,'' Mrs. Kimble      said. ``We have already sacrificed our husbands. Our children      are fatherless. For them to struggle financially is another      blow.''                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, April 27, 2006]        GAO Says Government Pesters Wounded Soldiers Over Debts                         (By Donna St. George)       Nearly 900 soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan have      been saddled with government debts as they have recovered      from war, according to a report that describes collection      notices going out to veterans with brain damage, paralysis,      lost limbs and shrapnel wounds.       The report from the Government Accountability Office, to be      released at a hearing today, details how long-recognized      problems with military computer systems led to the soldiers      being dunned for an array of debts related to everything from      errors in paychecks to equipment left behind on the      battlefield.       The problem came to light last year, as soldiers'      complaints began to surface and several lawmakers became      involved. The GAO had been investigating other pay problems      caused by the defense accounting system and was asked by      Congress to investigate debts among the battle-wounded.       The new report shows a problem more widespread than      previously known.       ``We found that hundreds of separated battle-injured      soldiers were pursued for collection of military debts      incurred through no fault of their own,'' the report said.       Last fall, the Army said 331 soldiers had been hit with      military debt after being wounded at war. The latest figures      show that a larger group of 900 battle-wounded troops has      been tagged with debts.       ``It's unconscionable,'' said Ryan Kelly, 25, a retired      staff sergeant who lost a leg to a roadside bomb and then      spent more than a year trying to fend off a debt of $2,231.      ``It's sad that we'd let that happen.''       Kelly recalled the day in 2004 when, months after learning      to walk on a prosthesis, he opened his mailbox to find a      letter saying he was in debt to the government--and in      jeopardy of referral to a collection agency. ``It hits you in      the gut,'' he said. ``It's like, `Thanks for your service,      and now you owe us.''       The underlying problem is an antiquated computer system for      paying and tracking members of the military. Pay records are      not integrated with personnel records, creating numerous      errors. When soldiers leave the battlefield, for example,      they lose a pay differential, but the system can take time to      lower their pay.       The government then tries to recoup overpayments, docking      pay for active-duty troops and sending debt notices to those      who have left the military. Eventually, the government sends      private agencies to collect debts and notifies credit      bureaus.       The computer system is so broken that 400 soldiers killed      in action were listed as owing money to the government,      although no debt notices were sent, the report said.       A total of $1.5 million in debts has been linked to the 400      fallen soldiers and 900 wounded troops. Of the total,      $124,000 has been repaid. The government has waived $959,000,      and the remainder of $420,000 is still owed.       Michael Hurst, a former Army finance officer in Arlington      who has studied the issue, said the military should have      taken action years ago to prevent the debts from being      created.       ``It's a complete leadership failure,'' he said. ``We can't      expect the soldiers to notice mistakes in their pay that the      paid professionals have failed to notice and correct.''       Although the GAO report focuses on battle-wounded soldiers      who have separated from the military, there are probably      others who were still on active duty when their debts caught      up with them, Hurst said. Factoring those in, ``I would say      thousands'' are affected by the problem, he said.       The GAO report said that 73 percent of the debts were      caused by pay problems, including overpayments, calculation      errors and mistakes in leave. Other debts were created when      soldiers were billed for enlistment bonuses, medical      services, travel and lost equipment.       House Government Reform Committee Chairman Thomas M. Davis      III (R-Va.), who is holding the hearing, has called the      phenomenon ``financial friendly fire.'' Yesterday, his      spokesman, Robert White, reacted to the report, saying:      ``Literally adding insult to injury, the systems that are      supposed to nurture and support returning warriors too often      inflict additional wounds to their financial health.''       In one case cited in the GAO report, the debts meant that a      soldier's family had no money to pay bills and had to send an      11-year-old daughter to live out of state.       At today's hearing, Army and Defense Department officials      are expected to testify about what is being done to correct      the problem. A database of soldiers wounded in action has      been created, but the GAO suggested that more needs to be      done, including congressional action to forgive more      soldiers' debts and provide refunds in certain cases.       Previously the GAO had issued 80 recommendations for      improving the Army payroll processes. Army officials have      said they are at work on those recommendations. An Army      spokesman did not return calls yesterday requesting comment.                                  ____                [From the Washington Post, May 24, 2006]Veterans Angered by File Scandal--VA Has Consistently Scored Poorly on                           Information Security                           By Christopher Lee       Veterans brimmed with shock and anger yesterday at the loss      of their personal data by the Department of Veterans Affairs,      but in many ways the information security breach should not      have come as a surprise.       The department has consistently ranked near the bottom      among federal agencies in an annual congressional scorecard      of computer security. For five years, the VA inspector      general has identified information security as a material      weakness and faulted officials for slow progress in tackling      the problem.       As many as 26.5 million veterans were put at risk of      identity theft May 3 when an intruder stole an electronic      data file from the Aspen Hill home of a VA data analyst, who      was not authorized to remove the data from his office. The      electronic file contained names, birth dates and Social      Security numbers of veterans discharged since 1975, as well      as veterans who were discharged earlier and filed for VA      benefits.       VA officials waited two weeks to call in the FBI to      investigate the theft, the Associated Press reported, citing      two law enforcement sources.       ``To the best of my knowledge, the loss of 26 million      records by VA is the largest by a federal agency to date,''      said Rep. Thomas M. Davis III (R-Va.), chairman of the House      Government Reform Committee. ``Perhaps if the department      improved its compliance with the existing information      protection laws, this breach would not have happened. There      seem to be two problems here: a department that's      inadequately protected, and an employee who acted incredibly      irresponsibly.''       In 2005, Veterans Affairs earned an F on the annual federal      computer security report card compiled by Davis's committee,      the same grade it has received every year but one since the      scorecard began in 2001. (It got a C in 2003.) The      government-wide average for 2005 was a D-plus, but there were      wide variations--the Social Security Administration got an A-     plus, while the departments of Defense and Homeland Security      earned F's.       The report card measures compliance with the 2002 Federal      Information Security Management Act, which requires agencies      to test their systems, develop cyber-security plans and      report on their progress.       ``We continue to get a number of wake-up calls from these      breaches that shows that we still have a ways to go before we      have a truly robust information security posture      nationally,'' said Greg Garcia, vice president for      information security at the trade group Information      Technology Association of America.       Veterans groups reported mounting anger and frustration.       Steve Kennebeck, 46, an Army sergeant who retired from the      military in 1997 after 20 years, said he called a special VA      toll-free number but was unable to learn whether he was among      affected veterans. His father and two brothers, veterans all,      are wondering, too.       ``We've probably all been compromised,'' said Kennebeck,      who lives in Washington. ``I'm angry. . . . If we had done      something like that in the military, we'd be punished by      courts-martial. We protect America, and do they protect our      personal information? No. It's galling. Somebody's head      should roll.''       VA officials did not return two telephone calls seeking      comment yesterday. VA Secretary Jim Nicholson said Monday      that the employee has been placed on administrative leave      pending investigations by the FBI, the VA inspector general      and local police. Nicholson said he has directed all VA      employees to complete a computer security training course by      the end of June.       Advocates called on the federal government to, at a      minimum, pay to help veterans increase monitoring of their      credit. ``The VFW feels strongly that the government must      accept responsibility for any consequences of this      inexcusable breach of trust with America's veteran      community,'' Robert E. Wallace, executive director of      Veterans of Foreign Wars, wrote Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-     Idaho), chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee. Craig has      indicated he will hold hearings. The House Veterans Affairs      Committee has scheduled a hearing for 9 a.m. tomorrow.       The Veterans Affairs Department provides millions of      veterans with health care, home loans, disability      compensation and a burial plot. In doing so, it collects      Social Security numbers, service histories and medical      records.       But the sprawling bureaucracy, with 220,000 employees      nationwide, has not always been the best steward of sensitive      data. In more than a dozen reports, audits and reviews since      2001, the VA inspector general has repeatedly cited the      department for security problems in the handling of personal      information.       In 2003, tests by IG staff showed that a hacker could gain      access to veterans' protected medical information from      outside the VA network.       In 2005, reviews found that access controls were not      consistently applied at dozens of data centers, medical      centers and regional offices. Recommendations included      ensuring that background checks are performed on     VA and contract workers, restricting off-duty workers' access      to sensitive information and providing annual security      awareness training for employees.       In a report last November, acting Inspector General Jon A.      Wooditch wrote that many of the security concerns the IG had      reported on for years remained unresolved. He cited a March      2005 report, saying 16 recommendations still had not been      implemented eight months later.       ``We identified significant information security      vulnerabilities that place VA at considerable risk of . . .      disruption of mission-critical systems, fraudulent benefits      payments, fraudulent receipt of health care benefits,      unauthorized access to sensitive data and improper disclosure      of sensitive data,'' he wrote. ``The magnitude of these risks      is impeding VA from carrying out its mission of providing      health care and delivering benefits to our nation's      veterans.''                                  ____               [From the Washington Post, June 20, 2006] Iraq War May Add Stress for Past Vets--Trauma Disorder Claims at New                                   High                         (By Donna St. George)       More than 30 years after their war ended, thousands of      Vietnam veterans are seeking help for post-traumatic stress      disorder, and experts say one reason appears to be harrowing      images of combat in Iraq.       Figures from the Department of Veterans Affairs show that      PTSD disability-compensation cases have nearly doubled since      2000, to an all-time high of more than 260,000. The biggest      bulge has come since 2003, when war started in Iraq.       Experts say that, although several factors may be at work      in the burgeoning caseload, many veterans of past wars      reexperience their own trauma as they watch televised images      of U.S. troops in combat and read each new accounting of the      dead.       ``It so directly parallels what happened to Vietnam      veterans,'' said Raymond M. Scurfield of the University of      Southern Mississippi's Gulf Coast campus, who worked with the      disorder at VA for more than 20 years and has written two      books on the subject. ``The war has to be triggering their      issues. They're almost the same issues.''       At VA, officials said the Iraq war is probably a      contributing factor in the rise in cases, although they said      they have conducted no formal studies.       PTSD researcher John P. Wilson, who oversaw a small recent      survey of 70 veterans--nearly all from Vietnam--at Cleveland      State University, said 57 percent reported flashbacks after      watching reports about the war on television, and almost 46      percent said their sleep was disrupted. Nearly 44 percent      said they had fallen into a depression since the war began,      and nearly 30 percent said they had sought counseling since      combat started in Iraq.       ``Clearly the current Iraq war, and their exposure to it,      created significantly increased distress for them,'' said      Wilson, who has done extensive research on Vietnam veterans      since the 1970s. ``We found very high levels of      intensification of their symptoms. . . . It's like a fever      that has gone from 99 to 104.''       Vietnam veterans are the vast majority of VA's PTSD      disability cases--more than 73 percent. Veterans of more      recent wars--Iraq, Afghanistan and the 1991 Persian Gulf      War--together made up less than 8 percent in 2005.       VA officials said other reasons for the surge in cases may      include a lessening of the stigma associated with PTSD and      the aging of the Vietnam generation--explanations that      veterans groups also suggest.       PTSD is better understood than it once was, said Paul      Sullivan, director of programs for the group Veterans for      America. ``The veterans are more willing to accept a      diagnosis of PTSD,'' he said, ``and the VA is more willing to      make it''       In addition, as Vietnam veterans near retirement age,      ``they have more time to think, instead of focusing on making      a living all the time, and for some this is not necessarily a      good thing,'' said Rick Weidman, executive director for      policy and government affairs at Vietnam Veterans of America.       Max Cleland, a former U.S. senator from Georgia and onetime      head of the VA who was left a triple amputee by the Vietnam      War, said the convergence of age and the Iraq war has created      problems for many of his fellow veterans--as well as for      himself.       ``As we Vietnam veterans get older, we are more      vulnerable,'' he said. When the war started in 2003, he said,      ``it was like going back in time--it was like 1968 again.''       Now he goes for therapy at Walter Reed Army Medical Center      and is wary of news from Iraq. ``I don't read a newspaper,''      he said. ``I don't watch television. It's all a trigger. . .      . This war has triggered me, and it has triggered Vietnam      veterans all over America.''       PTSD has become a volatile topic lately, with some skeptics      questioning whether the rise in claims is driven by over      diagnosis or by financial motives. A report last week from      the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academies,      concluded that ``PTSD is a well characterized medical      disorder'' for which ``all veterans deployed to a war zone      are at risk.''       VA's growing PTSD caseload became an issue last August,      when the agency announced a new review of 72,000 PTSD      compensation cases, expressing concerns about errors and a      lack of evidence. That probe was dropped after a sample of      2,100 cases turned up no instances of fraud.       Still, some experts are not convinced that the Iraq war has      driven up the caseload. ``I'm skeptical that it accounts for      a broad swath of this phenomenon,'' said psychiatrist Sally      Satel, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise      Institute. ``These men have had deaths in their families,      they had all kinds of tragedies over 30 years that surely      affected them emotionally but they coped with.''       Although a small percentage of veterans might be deeply      affected, she said, she doubts ``they have become chronically      disabled because of it''       Around the country, many veterans dwell on the similarities      between the wars in Vietnam and Iraq: guerrilla tactics,      deadly explosives, fallen comrades, divisive politics. The      way they see it, ``Iraq is Vietnam without water,'' Weidman      said.       ``We have people who have symptoms that they haven't had in      a long time,'' said Randy Barnes, 65, who works in the Kansas      City offices of Vietnam Veterans of America. For some, ``the      nightmares and flashbacks have been very hard to deal with,''      he said. Group therapy sessions are ``much more crowded,'' he      said, ``with Vietnam veterans particularly, but now also with      the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.''       Barnes served as a combat medic in Vietnam from 1968 to      1969 and went into treatment only in the late 1990s. By the      time the Iraq war started, he said, he felt steadier--but      then his symptoms ramped up again.       ``Depending on what I saw or heard that day or read, I      would have night problems--nightmares, night sweats,'' he      said. Sometimes, he said, he would roll out of bed and wake      up crawling on the floor, ``seeking safety, I guess.''       A study published in February by VA experts showed that      veterans under VA care experienced notable mental distress      after the war started and as it intensified. While younger      veterans, ages 18 to 44, showed the greatest reactions to the      war, ``Vietnam era VA patients reported particularly high      levels'' of distress consistently, the study reported.       Powerful images of war have revived combat trauma in the      past. ``Traumatized people overreact to things that remind      them of their original trauma,'' said Scurfield, the PTSD      expert in Mississippi.       When the movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' was released, World      War II sought mental health help in great numbers, said      Wilson of Cleveland State. ``It rekindled it all,'' he said.
