On November 29, 2007, I was proud to attend the anniversary celebration.  Circle Seal has a long, proud tradition of quality manufacturing in southern California. Circle Seal's home for the last 15 years is also my hometown--Corona. The state-of-the-art facility has 300 employees and provides equipment for military and commercial aircraft, U.S. Navy ships, the Space Shuttle, and other rocket and missile applications.  The evolution of the industrial defense base has allowed the U.S. government to get out of the manufacturing business and let contractors, who can do it better and cheaper, provide essential platforms and components. Without Circle Seal's expertise, our F-18s, Global Hawks and V-22s don't get off the ground. Right now, our troops are relying on the products made by Circle, and the pride the employees take in their work is a part of the success on the battlefield. I thank Circle Seal for all their hard work and their relentless pursuit of excellence.  Circle Seal's past successes have ensured a continued relationship with the U.S. government--I'm proud to see that the company also contributes to the C-17, the KC-767 Tanker and the Navy LCS programs. Their demonstrated reliability and quality are exactly what the government needs. I look forward to a continued strong relationship with Circle Seal and, again, I commend the company on their anniversary and--most importantly--the people who make Circle Seal a valued and integral part of the community.                          ____________________
