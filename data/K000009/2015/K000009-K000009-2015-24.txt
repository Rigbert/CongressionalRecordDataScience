Speaker, I rise to inform my colleagues and those who are listening of a very important conference that is occurring here in the Capitol today in the Capitol Visitor Center, a convening of nearly 500 Americans and those of Ukrainian American and Ukrainian heritage who are meeting to save Ukraine now.  They are mobilizing humanitarian endeavors across our country to ship medical equipment, to ship used clothing, used shoes, mattresses, tents, to deal with the 1.7 million children who have been left homeless, and over 5 million refugees who have been affected by the brutal Russian invasion on Russia's western side and Ukraine's eastern side, as Russia has killed over 6,000 innocent Ukrainians and thousands have been injured.  A cold winter is approaching in Ukraine. Many families are now eating more and more potatoes, lacking sufficient sustenance, and there are so many children that have been displaced.  I am here saying, for those who are listening, go to the Web site of the U.S. Ukraine Foundation. Learn what is being done. If you can help in your communities to ship goods through your National Guard, this is the time for freedom fighters across our country to lend humanitarian aid to Ukraine.                          ____________________
