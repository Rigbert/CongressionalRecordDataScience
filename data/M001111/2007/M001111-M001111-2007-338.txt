 President, for the information of all Senators, we are now working with the Senator from Louisiana who has an amendment that is pending, on how we are going to dispose of that. We will work that out over the next several minutes. We have a number of other amendments we have been working with Senators on that I believe will be agreed upon on all sides. Again, our staffs are working diligently. I expect it will take them the next 15 or 20 minutes. At that time, we hope to have all the amendments before the Senate and move to final passage on this bill.  With that, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
