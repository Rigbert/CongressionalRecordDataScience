 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Gilbert Calvin Steindorff, Jr. who passed away on Monday, November 14, 2011, at the age of 86. Calvin lived a life dedicated to service to his country, and I am glad to have known and become friends with such an inspirational individual.  Gilbert Calvin Steindorff, Jr. served in the military with the U.S. Army in World War II in European theatre of operations. Upon his return, Calvin was appointed as the tax assessor of Butler County, a role he served for 28 years. He was appointed as probate judge of Butler County in 1975 and served in that role until his retirement in 1995. Calvin had a fierce dedication to public service and was a member of many civic organizations.  A truly selfless individual, Calvin also served as secretary at The First Christian Church, where he was an elder, providing guidance for those in his church community. For his career in public service and the invaluable role that he played in the community, Calvin was named Greenville's ``Man of the Year.''  Calvin is loved and will be missed by his wife, Maxine Darby Steindorff, and his son, Gilbert C. Steindorff, III, and many more family members and friends. My thoughts and prayers are with them as they mourn the death of a wonderful husband, father and friend. Calvin was a role model to many and a compassionate community leader who was devoted to the service of Baldwin County. His presence in Alabama will be greatly missed.                          ____________________
