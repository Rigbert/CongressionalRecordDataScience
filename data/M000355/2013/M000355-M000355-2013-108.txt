 President, this morning all of us are thinking about yesterday's tragic events at the Navy Yard, and we are also thinking, in particular, of the brave men and women of our military and the sacrifices they make day in and day out on our behalf.  Once again I would like to extend condolences to the families and friends of those who lost their lives or were injured in this terrible, terrible shooting. Know that your country is with you in these most difficult moments.  I would also like, again, to express sincere gratitude to all the first responders and the medical personnel and law enforcement officers from so many different agencies who worked together to keep all of us informed--and most of all safe--throughout the day.                          ____________________
