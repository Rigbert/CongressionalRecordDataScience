He was mortally wounded while on patrol in Baghdad on July 5, 2007. Over the weekend his community will honor his memory and comfort his family, and Sergeant Kline will be laid to rest in Oak Harbor's Union Cemetery on Monday, July 16, 2007.  In his poem the ``Psalm of Life'', Henry Wadsworth Longfellow writes:     WHAT THE HEART OF THE YOUNG MAN SAID TO THE PSALMIST     . . . Life is real! Life is earnest!     And the grave is not its goal;     Dust thou art, to dust returnest,     Was not spoken of the soul.     . . . In the world's broad field of battle,     In the bivouac of Life,     Be not like dumb, driven cattle!     Be a hero in the strife!     . . . Lives of great men all remind us     We can make our lives sublime,     And, departing, leave behind us     Footprints on the sands of time;--     Footprints, that perhaps another,     Sailing o'er life's solemn main,     A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,     Seeing, shall take heart again.     Let us, then, be up and doing,     With a heart for any fate;     Still achieving, still pursuing,     Learn to labor and to wait.  Sergeant Kline lived the spirit of this message and the poem's words serve as an epitaph as we recall his life and honor his ultimate sacrifice.  Keith Kline graduated from Oak Harbor High School in 2002. A talented wrestler, he also played soccer and football and participated in school plays. He enlisted in the United States Army following his graduation. At Fort Gordon, Georgia, he completed his Advanced Individual Training and was assigned to Bravo Company, 96th Civil Air Battalion, 95th Civil Affairs Brigade. In Iraq 3 months, he was assigned to the Civil Affairs Team supporting the 4th Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division. In his brief career his distinguished service brought him four Army Achievement Medals, Joint Meritorious Unit Award, Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, and Basic Parachutist Badge. His deathbrought him the posthumous award of the Purple Heart Award, Bronze Star Medal, and Combat Action Badge.  More than a soldier, Keith Kline was known as ``a good hearted person that was full of life, and a very hard worker.'' He was a NASCAR fan, he reveled in family get-togethers and his favorite holiday was July 4th. Cherishing his memory and celebrating the gift of his life are his mother Betty and brother John, his stepfather, grandparents, aunts, uncles and cousins. We offer them our sincere condolences and heartfelt gratitude as they struggle through this difficult time. May they find comfort in their loved one's memory and recall the words of Ecclesiastes 3:1, ``To everything there is a season, and a time to every purpose under Heaven.''                          ____________________
