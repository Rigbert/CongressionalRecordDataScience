 President, the use of personal care products is virtually universal in this country. These products include everything from shampoo and hair dye to deodorant and lotion.  Troubling examples of negative health effects call into question the safety of some of the chemicals used in these products.  For example, methylene glycol, which turns into formaldehyde when heated, is a chemical in the popular hair smoothing treatment known as the ``Brazilian Blowout''. Short term exposure has been reported to cause hair loss, rashes, blistered scalps, nosebleeds, bleeding gums, shortness of breath and vomiting. Over the long term, exposure is associated with an increased risk of cancer.  Some ingredients in cosmetics may only be safe for use in certain concentrations. Propyl paraben, a widely used preservative, is found in many products and mimics the hormone estrogen. This has the potential to disrupt the endocrine system, which can lead to a variety of health concerns such as reproductive system disorders.  In light of this and other examples, consumers deserve to know that the products they use every day are safe. To do this, Federal oversight of the personal care products industry needs to be strengthened.  Europe has a robust system of oversight for personal care products, including consumer protections like product registration and ingredient reviews, but in the United States, the industry is regulated largely on a voluntary basis, with a sparse patchwork of state regulations. The Food and Drug Administration, FDA, has little authority, operating under a Federal law from the 1930s that has seen little change since. Consumers rightly expect that basic protective measures to ensure the safety of personal care product ingredients are in place, but the reality is that FDA doesn't even have mandatory recall authority for products that pose significant harm to human health.  I have been working with consumer groups, companies and FDA to put together a bipartisan, middle of the road bill to update the regulatory structure for personal care products, provide a streamlined national system of oversight and accountability, and review the safety of specific chemicals in these products. I am grateful to my colleague, Senator Collins, for working with me in this effort.  Today we are introducing the Personal Care Products Safety Act, a comprehensive step forward. The bill, which is the result of feedback we received from a wide range of stakeholders, addresses consumer safety concerns and provides a modernized, predictable and straightforward system of compliance for companies.  The Personal Care Products Safety Act will, for the first time, enable the public to know which companies, whether they are American or foreign, are producing and distributing personal care products through a registration system operated by FDA. Companies will provide information about the ingredients in their products and attest to their safety. This updated system will be supported by user fees paid by the industry.  Under this legislation, FDA will review at least five chemical ingredients per year for their safety and appropriate use in personal care products. In determining which ingredients to evaluate and their safety, many factors must be considered, including how prevalent the ingredient is, the likely exposure, adverse event reports, and scientific studies from a wide range of sources.  The first set of chemicals for review includes: diazolidinyl urea, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including deodorant, shampoo, conditioner, bubble bath and lotion; lead acetate, which is used as a color additive in hair dyes; methylene glycol/formaldehyde, which is used in hair treatments; propyl paraben, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including shampoo, conditioner and lotion; quaternium-15, which is used as a preservative in a wide range of products including shampoo, shaving cream, skin creams and cleansers.  FDA may deem an ingredient safe, unsafe, or safe under certain uses or conditions. FDA will also be empowered to require warning labels on products with certain ingredients, as appropriate, and limit the amount of an ingredient that may be used in certain products. For example, some ingredients may only be safe when used by professionals in a salon or spa setting.  The structure of the legislation encourages, and relies on, public input. There are many opportunities built in for consumer groups, companies, medical professionals, scientists and the public to weigh in with feedback on the ingredients that should be prioritized for review and scientific information that FDA should consider regarding the safety of those ingredients. FDA is required to provide a yearly update to Congress and the public on its progress in reviewing these ingredients and the new oversight system.  Many companies follow strict voluntary standards for manufacturing under proper conditions, but the current lack of a Federal standard leaves this to chance. Under this legislation, FDA sets Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines to ensure companies meet a minimum standard. Companies will also need to report adverse health events related to their products to FDA.  As more consumers choose to shop online, it is of growing importance that they have access to the same product information they would see in a store. This bill requires all personal care products sold online to include information that is on the label. Consumers will be able to see all ingredients listed, along with any product warnings and other important information on use.  We also take steps to reduce animal testing in personal care products, and direct FDA to encourage the use of alternatives and provide specific guidance to companies on non-animal testing methods that are seen as acceptable.  This legislation is the product of many different groups working together. I am pleased to have the support of the Personal Care Products Council, which represents over 600 companies, Environmental Working Group, Society for Women's Health Research, HealthyWomen, and National Alliance for Hispanic Health. These individual companies have also stepped forward to independently support the bill: Johnson & Johnson, brands include Neutrogena, Aveeno, Clean & Clear, Lubriderm, Johnson's baby products; Procter & Gamble, brands includePantene, Head & Shoulders, Clairol, Herbal Essences, Secret, Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, Ivory, CoverGirl, Olay, Sebastian Professional, Vidal Sassoon; Revlon, brands include Revlon, Almay, Mitchum; Esteee Lauder, brands include Esteee Lauder, Clinique, Origins, Tommy Hilfiger, MAC, La Mer, Bobbi Brown, Donna Karan, Aveda, Michael Kors; Unilever, brands include Dove, Tresemme, Lever, St. Ives, Noxzema, Nexxus, Pond's, Suave, Sunsilk, Vaseline, Degree; L'Oreeal, brands include L'Oreeal Paris, Lancome, Giorgio Armani, Yves Saint Laurent, Kiehl's, Essie, Garnier, Maybelline-New York, Vichy, La Roche-Posay, The Body Shop, Redken.  I urge my colleagues to join Senator Collins and me in supporting this effort to modernize our outdated regulatory system for personal care products, and to cosponsor the bill.                          ____________________
