Speaker, each day at the beginning of the session one of my Republican colleagues gets up with great piety and reads about the Republican contract. I know they are very proud of it, but they do not tell us the whole story.  The Republican Contract on America is a budget buster. Yesterday our Joint Tax Committee came up with an estimate of what it will cost the Treasury for the Republican tax cut package: a little less than $200 billion in the first 2 years, but in the following 5 years, over $700 billion more. For what? For tax cuts for the wealthiest of Americans.  The Republican contract does not stand up for American families, it stands up for the monied interests, the fat cats. At a time when we should put the fat cats in America on a diet, the Republican contract puts them on the gravy train.                          ____________________
