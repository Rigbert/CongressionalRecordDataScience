 President, we are now, as I understand it, on the bankruptcy bill. As the Republican manager for this legislation, I want to speak to an amendment which was offered Friday by the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. Feingold, but also to speak generally about the behavior of the bankruptcy bar as it relates to the amount of bankruptcies that are being filed, which were at a historical high of 1.4 million last year. That was a 30-percent increase. There was probably a 25-percent increase in 1996 over 1995. As we all know, there is an explosion of filings for consumer bankruptcy.  I have blamed some of that on the law of 1978. That is why we have this bill before us, to change the law so it is not so easy to go into bankruptcy.  In 20 years, I have had hundreds of people talk to me about it being too easy to go into bankruptcy. It ought to be harder, in their judgment. I have not had one person say to me that it ought to be easier to go into bankruptcy, and I have had people who have gone through bankruptcy tell me how easy it is to get into bankruptcy.  I think the law of 1978 is at fault to some extent. I think the situation we have with Congress with 30 years of deficit spending, that Government doesn't have to live within its income, sends a signal to people in this country that it is all right for individuals to live beyond their income and avoid paying for it.  We have had a general lack of shame or personal responsibility that used to be associated with paying bills or not paying bills and the filing of bankruptcy. That is no longer the situation, although that can be somewhat to blame for Government not setting a good example in this area.  I also think there is more than just the downfall of personal responsibility. We have heard lots of speeches about how the credit industry, particularly the credit card industry, has not been very careful in the number of requests they have granted for bankruptcy, or the willy-nilly approach--I know they will say it is not willy-nilly. There is a very careful study they have of who ought to be mailed a credit card or not mailed a credit card. But as a practical matter, they have been pretty darn fluid with the number of credit cards that have been going through the mail.  All of these are reasons why we have this legislation before us. All of these are reasons why this bill was voted out of committee on a vote of 16 to 2. All of these are reasons why a very strong bill passed the House of Representatives by a veto-proof margin. And all of these, I think, are reasons that, hopefully, on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week we will pass this bill by a very substantial margin.  As I indicated, we have as one of the amendments that we will be voting on tomorrow an amendment offered by the Senator from Wisconsin.  In my earlier statements on the Senate floor, I have alluded to the role of the overly aggressive bankruptcy lawyers plague in fomenting the current crisis in our bankruptcy system. Last Friday, Senator Feingold offered an amendment which will insulate bankruptcy lawyers from fines when they encourage bankruptcy abuse.  As reported by the Judiciary Committee, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act fines--in other words, penalizes--bankruptcy lawyers who steer high-income people who can repay their debt into chapter 7. Under the bill, in the narrow circumstance where a chapter 7 trustee is successful in getting a chapter 7 case dismissed or converted to chapter 13, the lawyer for high-income bankruptcy will be fined if his or her case is not substantially justified. That is our bill.  This fine will reimburse the chapter 7 trustee for expenses incurred while detecting abuses of the bankruptcy system. I think any reasonable person will say that lawyers who file bankruptcy cases which are not substantially justified ought to be required and will be required to help defray the costs of these frivolous cases. That is all this bill does. Senator Feingold wants to cut this reasonable effort to control a bankruptcy bar which is seriously out of control.  Mr. President, in order for my colleagues to understand the importance of imposing some reasonable controls on the conduct of bankruptcy lawyers, I want to give a little background on the conduct of bankruptcy lawyers.  Today, many lawyers who specialize in bankruptcy view bankruptcy as an opportunity to make big money for themselves. This profit motive causes bankruptcy lawyers to promote bankruptcy as the only option even when a financially troubled client has an obvious ability to repay his or her debts. In other words, this profit motive creates a real conflict of interest where bankruptcy lawyers push people into bankruptcy who don't belong there simply because they want to make a quick buck.  As one of the members of the National Bankruptcy Commission noted in the Commission's 1997 report, many who make their living off the bankruptcy process have forgotten that declaring bankruptcy should have a moral dimension.  As I have already said, the Consumer Bankruptcy Reform Act contains reasonable penalties for lawyer misconduct. These penalties will cause lawyers to think twice before they willy-nilly cart their client off to bankruptcy court and pocket a nice profit. Bankruptcy lawyers get paid ahead of anybody else if there are assets or, obviously, they charge before they are going to help you.  Some lawyers, in their rush to turn a profit, operate what are known as bankruptcy mills. These bankruptcy mills are nothing more than processing centers for bankruptcy. There is little or no investigation done as to whether an individual actually needs bankruptcy protection or whether or not a person is able to at least partially repay some of his debt.  Recently, one of these bankruptcy attorneys from Texas was sanctioned in bankruptcy court. According to the court, this attorney had very little knowledge of bankruptcy law, but advertised extensively in the Yellow Pages and on television. Apparently, his advertising worked, because he filed about 100 new bankruptcy cases a month. Most of the work was done by legal assistants with very limited training. The court concluded that the attorney's services ``amount to little more than a large scale petition preparer service for which he receives an unreasonably high fee.''  The practices of these bankruptcy mills are so deceptive and sleazy that last year the Federal Trade Commission went so far--our Federal Trade Commission--as to issue a consumer alert warning consumers of misleading ads promising debt consolidation.  Mr. President, I think there is a widespread recognition that bankruptcy lawyers are preying on unsophisticated consumers who need counseling and help in setting up a budget and who do not need to declare bankruptcy. Bankruptcy lawyers are the fuel which makes the engines of the bankruptcy mills run. It is not surprising that bankruptcy lawyers are leading the charge against this bankruptcy reform legislation.  I want to point to some other evidence of lawyers playing a prime role in this effort to get people into bankruptcy and to avoid the payment of debt.  We have previously heard complaints from some on the Senate floor about whether our bill does enough to protect child support and also to protect alimony during bankruptcy proceedings. Ihave already spoken to that topic on a previous occasion, but for now, I want to point out that some bankruptcy lawyers actually advertise that they can help deadbeat dads get out of their child support and other marital obligations. One bankruptcy lawyer has even written a book entitled, as you can see, ``Discharging Marital Obligations in Bankruptcy,'' by James P. Caher, Esquire.  I think it is outrageous, Mr. President, that bankruptcy lawyers are helping deadbeats to cheat to force spouses out of alimony and to cheat children out of child support. That is a recipe for promoting poverty and human misery. Those who want to help the collection of child support during bankruptcy proceedings should join me in rejecting the Feingold amendment to protect bankruptcy lawyers. Those who are concerned about protecting child support should join me to ensure lawyers who engage in predatory conduct are subject to stiff fines.  Those who are concerned about protecting child support should join me in moving child support from No. 7 in the bankruptcy priority list to No. 1. This is the only way to get people's attention. This is the only way to restore professionalism to the bankruptcy bar.  Let me tell you, Mr. President, how far these practices have gone. First, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from the Consumer Bankruptcy News dated June 18 of this year.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           [From the Consumer Bankruptcy News, June 18, 1998] Bankruptcy Reform Presents Marketing Opportunity for Debtors' Counsel       By now, you are well aware of the proposed bankruptcy      amendments and how they could affect the relief available to      consumers. But how aware of these changes is the general      public, especially those people who consulted with you and      decided to not file for bankruptcy at that time?       James P. Caher, who represents debtors in Eugene, Ore.,      suggests that you go through your files to check for cases in      which you might have recommended that a client wait before      filing for bankruptcy, such as if there was recent credit      card use or preferential payments to be preserved. Those      debtors might be able to discharge their credit card debts in      Chapter 7 today, but will they even be eligible for Chapter 7      relief a month from now?       Caher recommends that you send them a letter like this one      that he recently sent to about 150 people who had consulted      with him.                   Possible Changes in Bankruptcy Law       My records show that you discussed your financial problems      and bankruptcy options with me on ________.       During the last few months, lobbyists for the credit card      companies have been incredibly successful in pushing their      idea of bankruptcy ``reform'' through Congress. Bills have      been recommended by the judiciary committees of both Houses      of Congress and a vote is possible as soon as next month.       I fear that some versions of these ``reforms'' will pass,      and, if it does, bankruptcy will be much more difficult, more      expensive and probably embarrassing.       If you've been able to solve your financial problems      without the need for bankruptcy, congratulations. However, if      you are still considering that option, you should keep an eye      on what's going on in Congress, and consider filing before      this new restrictive legislation passes.       Many of the people who received Caher's letter are trying      to do the right thing by paying their bills and avoiding      bankruptcy. It would be ironic if legislation that is      intended to dissuade debtors from filing for bankruptcy      actually encouraged it.       Caher acknowledged that there would be some satisfaction in      seeing the bills backfire on the credit card industry that      has spent so much time and effort in pushing them, but he      added that he--like his clients--would much rather see the      bills go away.
