President, I listened carefully to the explanation of my friend and colleague from Iowa. I hope there are several things we can agree on at the outset. The first is that we don't want someone who is a convicted felon or is so mentally unstable that they cannot be trusted to own or purchase a firearm. I hope we can agree on that.
