Mr. Speaker, on Sunday, May 14, Belarus will be holding its first parliamentary elections since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. Some 2,400 registered candidates are running for 240 seats. Concerns have been raised about actions of the Belarusian Government during the pre-election period. These concerns center primarily on restrictions on the press and the assault last month on 19 parliamentarians conducting a hunger strike in the parliamentary chambers. Nearly 100 paratroopers, armed with submachine guns or wearing black masks entered the parliament, accosted the parliamentarians, beat them and dragged them into the street. The parliamentarians were protesting President Alyaksandr Lukashenka's initiative to hold a referendum that they felt would violate the Belarusian Constitution.  Restrictions on the press in Belarus, Mr. Speaker, also appear to be growing. On April 25, President Lukashenka fired the editor of a youth newspaper--the fourth editor of a nationwide newspaper he has fired since the Presidential election last July. Earlier, on March 17, Lukashenka dismissed the editor of the Belarusian parliament's daily Narodnaja Hazeta, for publishing a letter criticizing the President's pro-Russian policies. Critics are understandably distressed about this and other attempts to reign in the more independent voices within the state-subsidized press, especially since the independent press remains relatively weak. In addition, according to the newspaper Segodnya, the Belarusian media have refrained from reporting on the election campaign so as not to anger the President.  Mr. Speaker, until recent months, Belarus appeared to be making slow but steady progress on human rights and democracy. Last year, Belarus held presidential elections that were generally free and fair, and Mr. Lukashenka defeated an entrenched incumbent by a large and unexpected margin. I have become increasingly concerned, though, about the apparent backsliding in the democratic process in this strategic country on the eve of parliamentary elections. It would be unfortunate if Mr. Lukashenka should turn around and use pressure tactics to hinder free and fair elections to the legislative branch. As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I urge the Belarusian Government to respect its international human rights commitments, but most importantly, respect its commitments to the people of Belarus through the guarantee of unhindered, open elections.                          ____________________
