President, I rise today to introduce the Medicare HomeHealth Equity Act of 1999, which is designed to provide a measure of financial and regulatory relief for cost-efficient home health agencies across the country. These agencies are experiencing severe financial problems that are inhibiting their ability to deliver much-needed care, particularly to chronically ill seniors with complex needs.  America's home health agencies provide invaluable services that have enabled a growing number of our most frail and vulnerable Medicare beneficiaries to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they want to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes.  In 1996, home health was the fastest growing component of Medicare spending, consuming one out of every eleven Medicare dollars, compared with one in every forty in 1989. The program grew at an average annual rate of more than 25 percent from 1990 to 1997. As a consequence, the number of home health beneficiaries more than doubled, and Medicare home health spending soared from $2.5 billion in 1989 to $18.1 billion in 1996.  This rapid growth in home health spending understandably prompted Congress and the Administration, as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, to initiate changes that were intended to make the program more cost-effective and efficient. Therefore, there was widespread support for the provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 which called for the implementation of a prospective payment system for home care. Until this system can be implemented, home health agencies are being paid according to an ``interim payment system,'' or IPS.  In trying to get a handle on costs, however, Congress and the Administration created a system that penalizes efficient agencies and that may be restricting access for the very Medicare beneficiaries who need care the most--the sicker seniors with complex, chronic care needs like diabetic, wound care patients or IV therapy patients who require multiple visits.  Unfortunately, the ``interim payment system'' is critically flawed in that it effectively rewards the agencies that provided the most visits and spent the most Medicare dollars in 1994, the base year, while it penalizes low-cost, more efficient providers--and their patients. None of us should tolerate wasteful expenditures, but neither should we impede the delivery of necessary services by low-cost providers.  Home health agencies in the Northeast and the mid-West have been among those particularly hard-hit by the interim payment system. As the Wall Street Journal observed last year, ``If New England had been just a little greedier, its home health industry would be a lot better off now--Ironically, the region is getting clobbered by the system because of its tradition of non-profit community service and efficiency.''  Even more troubling, this flawed system may force our most cost-efficient providers to stop accepting Medicare patients with more serious health care needs. According to a recent survey by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, almost 40 percent of the home health agencies surveyed indicated that there were patients whom they previously would have accepted whom they no longer accept due to the IPS. Thirty-one percent of the agencies admitted that they had discharged patients due to the IPS. These discharged patients tended to be those with chronic care needs who required a large number of visits and were expensive to serve. As a consequence, these patients caused the agencies to exceed their aggregate per-beneficiary caps.  I simply do not believe that Congress and the Administration intended to construct a payment system that inevitably discourages home health agencies from caring for those seniors who need care the most. Last year's Omnibus Appropriations bill did provide a small measure of relief for home health agencies. This proposal did not, however, go far enough to relieve the financial distress that cost-effective agencies are experiencing.  These problems are all the more pressing given the fact that the Health Care Financing Administration was unable to meet its original deadline for implementing a prospective payment system. As a result, home health agencies will be struggling under the IPS far longer than Congress envisioned when it enacted the Balanced Budget Act.  Moreover, it now appears that Congress greatly underestimated the savings stemming from the BBA. Medicare spending for home health fell by nearly 15 percent last year, and the CBO now projects that post-BBA reductions in home care spending will exceed $47 billion in FY 1998-2002. This is a whopping three times greater than the $16 billion CBO originally estimated for that time period.  I recently chaired a Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI) hearing where we heard about the financial distress and cash-flow problems cost-efficient agencies across the country are experiencing. Witnesses expressed concern that these problems are inhibiting their ability to deliver much-needed care, particularly to chronically ill patients with complex needs. More than a thousand agencies have closed in the past year because the reimbursement levels under Medicare fell so far short of their actual operating costs. Others are laying off staff or declining to accept new patients with more serious health problems.  This points to the most central and critical issue--cuts of this magnitude cannot be sustained without ultimately affecting care for our most vulnerable seniors. At the PSI hearing, Barbara Smith, a senior research staff scientist with the Center for Health Services Research and Policy at George Washington University, testified that the preliminary findings of her studies suggest significant potential effects on beneficiaries, particularly those with unstable chronic care needs. Her research shows that these patients are being displaced from home care or are experiencing significant changes in services that appear to be driven by reimbursement policies rather than by clinical considerations. In her testimony, she stated:       ``My main concern is that we are carving out a wedge of      people who are chronically ill and have intensive needs for      services who are not going to have a reliable source of care      in any sector. They are becoming the health care system's      untouchables.''  Moreover, the financial problems that home health agencies have been experiencing have been exacerbated by a number of new regulatory requirements imposed by HCFA, including the implementation of OASIS, the new outcome and assessment information data set; new requirements for surety bonds; sequential billing; IPS overpayment recoupment; and a new 15-minute increment home health reporting requirement. Witnesses at the PSI hearing expressed particular frustration about what Maryanna Arsenault, the CEO of the Visiting Nurse Service in Saco, Maine, termed HCFA's regulatory policy of ``implement and suspend.'' They pointed to examples such as the hastily enacted requirements for surety bonds and sequential billing where no sooner had a mandate been put into an effect, than it was suspended but only after agencies had invested significant time and resources in compliance.  The legislation that my colleague from Missouri and I are introducing today, along with a bipartisan group of 16 of our colleagues, responds to these concerns. It makes needed adjustments to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and related federal regulations to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to medically-necessary home health services.  Among other provisions, the bill eliminates the automatic 15 percent reduction in Medicare home health payments now scheduled for October 1, 2000, whether or not a prospective payment system is enacted. When the Balanced Budget Act was enacted, CBO reported that the effect of the BBA would be to reduce home health expenditures by $16.1 billion between fiscal years 1998 and 2002. CBO's March 1999 revised analysis estimates those reductions to exceed $47 billion--three times the anticipated budgetary impact. A further 15 percent cut would be devastating to cost-efficient providers and would further reduce seniors' access to care. Moreover, it is unnecessary since the budget target for home health outlays will be achieved, if not exceeded, without it.  The legislation will also provide supplemental ``outlier'' payments to home health agencies on a patient-by-patientbasis, if the cost of care for an individual is considered to be significantly higher than average due to the patient's particular health and functional condition. This provision would remove the existing financial disincentive for agencies to care for patients with intensive medical needs who, according to recent reports issued by both the General Accounting Office (GAO) and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), are the individuals most at risk of losing access to home health care under the IPS.  The current IPS unfairly penalizes historically cost-efficient home health agencies that have been most prudent with their Medicare resources. Our legislation builds on reforms in last year's Omnibus Appropriations Act by gradually raising low-cost agencies' per-beneficiary limits up to the national average over three years, or until the new home health prospective payment system is implemented and IPS is terminated.  To decrease total costs in order to remain under their per-beneficiary limits, agencies have had to significantly reduce the number of visits to patients, which has, in turn, increased the cost of each visit. Implementation of OASIS has also significantly increased agencies' per-visit costs. Therefore, the legislation will increase the IPS per-visit cost limit from 106 to 108 percent of the national median.  Other provisions of the legislation will:  Extend the current IPS overpayment recoupment period from one to three years without interest;  Revise the surety bond requirement for home health agencies to more appropriately target fraud;  Eliminate the 15-minute incremental reporting requirement; and  Maintain the Periodic Interim Payment (PIP) program through the first year of implementation of the prospective payment system to ensure that such a dramatic change in payment systems does not create new cash-flow problems for agencies. I ask unanimous consent that a section-by-section summary further detailing these provisions be included in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  Mr. President, the Medicare Home Health Equity Act of 1999 will provide a measure of financial and regulatory relief to beleaguered home health agencies in order to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries have access to medically-necessary home health services, and I encourage all of my colleagues to join us as cosponsors.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a summary of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the summary was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              The Home Health Equity Act of 1999--Summary       The Home Health Equity Act of 1999 is intended to make      needed adjustments to the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and      related federal regulations to ensure that Medicare      beneficiaries have access to medically-necessary home health      care services.                            Major Provisions       Eliminates the automatic 15 percent reduction in Medicare      home health payments now scheduled for October 1, 2000.       Under the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (as amended by the      Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental      Appropriations Act), expenditures for Medicare home health      care are to be reduced by 15 percent, whether or not a      Medicare home health prospective payment system is      implemented on October 1, 2000. This provision would      eliminate that proposed reduction. When it was enacted, the      Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that the effect of      the BBA would be to reduce home health expenditures by $16.1      billion between fiscal years 1998 and 2002. CBO's March 1999      revised analysis now estimates those reductions to exceed $47      billion--three times the anticipated budgetary impact. A      further 15 percent cut to home health cost limits would be      devastating to cost-efficient providers and would reduce      seniors' access to care. Moreover, it is unnecessary since      the budget target for home health outlays will be achieved,      if not exceeded, without it.       Provides supplemental ``outlier'' payments to home health      agencies on a patient-by-patient basis if the cost of care      for an individual is considered by the Secretary to be      significantly higher than average due to the patient's      particular health and functional condition.       Recent reports issued by both the General Accounting Office      (GAO) and the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC)      conclude that patients with intensive medical needs are the      individuals most at risk of losing access to home health care      under the Interim Payment System (IPS). This provision would      remove the existing financial disincentive under the IPS for      agencies to care for these patients.       Increases the per-beneficiary cost limit for agencies with      limits below the national average to the national average      cost per patient over a three-year period or until the      Medicare home health prospective payment system is      implemented.       The Balanced Budget Act of 1997's Interim Payment System      (IPS) bases an agency's average per-patient reimbursement on      that agency's average cost per patient in 1993 or 1994. As a      consequences, the system unfairly penalizes historically      cost-efficient home health agencies that have been most      prudent with their Medicare resources. This provision builds      on reforms made by the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency      Supplemental Appropriations Act (OCESSA) by gradually raising      low-cost agencies' per-beneficiary limits up to the national      average over three years or until the new home health      prospective payment system is implemented and IPS is      terminated.       Increases the IPS per-visit cost limit to 108 percent of      the national median.       The Balanced Budget Act reduced the per-visit cost limit      from 112 percent of the mean to 105 percent of the median.      The OCESSA increased the limit to 106 percent of the median.      This provision would further increase it to 108 percent of      the national median. Most analysts agree that the growth in      Medicare home health expenditures in the early 1990s was due      to the high number of visits provided to patients, not to the      cost per visit. CBO confirms that controlling use, not price,      is the key to Medicare home health cost containment. To      decrease total costs in order to remain under their per-     beneficiary limits, agencies have had to significantly reduce      the number of visits to patients, which has, in turn,      increased the cost of each visit. Implementation of OASIS has      also significantly increased agencies' per-visit costs.       Revises the surety bond requirements for home health      agencies to more appropriately target fraud.       This provision would clarify that the surety bond      requirement is only to be used to protect against      overpayments based on fraudulent claims or behavior. Perhaps      the main problem with the surety bond proposal that HCFA      developed last year (and which is currently in regulatory      limbo) was that it went beyond Congressional intent. Congress      enacted the original surety bond provision as a way to use      private sector monitors to help keep fraudulent providers out      of the market. HCFA tried, through the regulations it      developed, to use surety bonds as a means to recover any      overpayments they made to home health agencies. This      unnecessarily increased both the costs and difficulties      agencies encountered in trying to obtain a surety bond.       Extends the IPS overpayment recoupment period to three      years without interest.       The BBA did not require HCFA to publish information on      calculating the IPS per-visit limits until January 1, 1998,      even though the limits were effective beginning October 1,      1997. Similarly, HCFA was not required to publish information      related to the calculation of the agencies' annual aggregate      per-beneficiary limit until April 1, 1998, despite an October      1 start date. More than a year after the implementation of      the IPS, HCFA's fiscal intermediaries still had not notified      many agencies of the visit and per-beneficiary limits under      which they were expected to operate. Moreover, throughout      this period, fiscal intermediaries continued to pay agencies      in accordance with the previous years' limits, resulting in      significant overpayments to many home health agencies      throughout the country.       Fiscal intermediaries have begun to issue notices of      overpayments to these agencies and are demanding repayment.      This has posed a significant problem, particularly for      smaller agencies that do not have large cash reserves. To      ease these repayment problems, HCFA has directed the fiscal      intermediaries to allow home health agencies to extend their      repayments over 12 months. Many agencies, however, say that      this is insufficient. This provision would extend the      overpayment recoupment period to three years without      interest.       Eliminates the 15-minute incremental reporting period.       The BBA mandates that home health agencies record the      length of time of home health visits in 15-minute increments,      which the HCFA will implement on July 1, 1999. Unfortunately,      HCFA's instructions implementing the 15-minute reporting      requirement are excessively labor-intensive. As proposed by      HCFA, the only time that can be counted is time spent      actively treating the beneficiary. Time for travel or for      administrative duties that are essential to patient care,      such as charting or coordinating work with the physician, may      not be counted. Implementation of the 15-minute reporting      requirement will not only be difficult for staff, but will      also be disruptive to patient care. This provision would      eliminate the current 15-minute reporting requirement. An      alternative to the 15-minute reporting requirement that      better measures time of direct patient care and its      relationship to outcomes should be developed within the      context of the Medicare home health PPS.       Temporarily maintains the Periodic Interim Payment (PIP)      program       PIP is a program that is available to many home health      agencies that permits HCFA to make payments to the agencies--     based on     historical payment levels--prior to the final settlement of      claims and cost-reports. This program, which is scheduled to      terminate on October 1, 2000, has been invaluable to      participating agencies and has helped them to avoid cash-flow      difficulties. This provision would continue PIP through the      first year of implementation of the prospective payment      system to ensure that such a dramatic change in payment      systems does not create new cash-flow problems.
