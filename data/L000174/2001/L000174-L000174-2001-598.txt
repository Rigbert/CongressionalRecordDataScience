President, last week the distinguished majority leader said we needed to pass this bill to help small business creditors in bankruptcy. I agree with him. Tonight we can take a bipartisan step to do just that.  This amendment provides small business creditors with the priority distribution from the bankruptcy estate. They make up 90 percent of the businesses in our country. These are the mom-and-pop stores across the country--the feedstores, the small ranchers, and the small farmers. They are the backbone of our economy.  We are already giving different preferences in this bill. All I am saying is that if you have to have the first preference to a multibillion-dollar credit card company, or the stores on your main street of your hometown, when you list those preferences, give the stores the first preferences. It doesn't let any debtors off their debt, but it helps the small businesses of America.
