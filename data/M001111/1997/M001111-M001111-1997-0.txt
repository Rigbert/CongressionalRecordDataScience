 President, I rise to pay tribute to a distinguished citizen of the great state of Washington, Mr. Doug Scott. Doug was recently recognized by the Sierra Club with the 105-year-old organization's highest award, the John Muir Award. The Sierra Club presents this award to honor individuals with a ``distinguished record of leadership--such as to continue John Muir's work of preservation and establishment of parks and wilderness.''  Doug Scott has certainly perpetuated the vision and leadership of John Muir throughout his years of commitment to the environment. Beginning his career of dedication to the environment in 1967 by joining the Sierra Club, Doug moved from his first involvement in the public policy process to be one of the original founders of Earth Day. From 1973 to 1977 Doug was the Sierra Club's Northwest field representative. In 1980, Doug became the National Conservation Director of the Sierra Club and in 1988, the organization's Associate Executive Director. In 1990, Doug left the Sierra Club for the beautiful San Juan Islands in my state of Washington to direct the San Juan Community Theater in Friday Harbor. Doug is now the Executive Director of a local, grass-roots environmental organization, Friends of the San Juans.  It is in this most recent capacity that I have come to most appreciate Doug's skills and abilities. Doug is an essential member of the Northwest Straits Citizen's Advisory Commission that I convened with Congressman Metcalf. This local citizen's advisory commission is designed to assess the resource protections needs and values of the Northwest Straits marine environment and to explore the best ways to provide protections for this exquisite natural area. Doug's participation in this process has been invaluable. His deep commitment to protection of the marine environment combined with his thoughtful, innovative, and pragmatic approach has provided real progress for the Commission as it works through its mandate. Doug's ability to work with individuals with differing idealogies and perspectives in a cooperative and productive manner is a true asset to the Commission, and to the Northwest Straits as well.  In Doug's remarks at the Annual Awards Dinner, he said:       Much as this award is personally gratifying. I prefer to      think of it as recognition for an era in the growth and      growing effectiveness of the Sierra Club and the citizen      environmental movement. Each achievement during that era was      the work of many hands. This award is for all of the Sierra      Club volunteers and other activists that have proven that in      this democracy, working together, an engaged citizenry can      make a tremendous difference. I discovered the power of      citizen activism over 25 years ago in the Sierra Club and now      I see its impact every day in my work in the San Juan      Islands.  The Sierra Club has chosen well in awarding Doug Scott the John Muir Award. I applaud their decision and I applaud Doug Scott. I thank him for his commitment to the environment of the San Juan Islands, the Northwest Straits, Washington state, and the United States. Great work, Doug. Congratulations.  Mr. President, I ask that the nominating statement for Doug Scott by Bruce Hamilton, Conservation Director of the Sierra Club be printed in the Record.  The statement follows:         Doug Scott Receives the Sierra club's John Muir Award nominating statement by Bruce Hamilton, conservation director, sierra                                   club       Doug has been a mentor and an inspiration to an entire      generation of environmental leaders, myself included. I feel      so lucky to have learned my skills at the side of this      master.       Doug had a way of turning dreams and visions into reality.      Ed Wayburn had the vision for an Alaska Lands Act, but it was      Doug Scott who pulled together and directed the 8 year      campaign that passed the largest land protection bill in      history. Rupert Cutler may have conceived of the RARE II      wilderness review, but it was Doug Scott who marshalled the      resources and provided the leadership to steer dozens of RARE      II wilderness bills through the Congress. When states like      Utah couldn't even boast a single wilderness area in the      entire state, Doug packaged a group of areas together into      the Endangered American Wilderness Act and mobilized a      national campaign to pass it. Doug also developed the      strategy that enabled us to pass the Superfund (remember the      Superactivist we mailed out of SF every Friday?), the Clean      Air Act Amendments (remember the Vento-Green medals?), and      other anti-pollution campaigns. He was the inspiration and      strategist for the California Desert Protection Act even      though it did not pass until after he had left the Club.       Doug was also the most inspirational and motivational      speaker within the Club, flying tens of thousands of miles      every year to appear at Chapter annual meetings and retreats      to preach about the power of the grassroots and the      importance of combating apathy and cynicism. He was also one      of the funniest leaders the Club has known, the source and      subject of jokes and follies songs. He was the spark behind      the national conservation work of the Club for 15 years.       The Club has been blessed with a series of powerful,      inspirational, smart, and articulate leaders that exemplify      the best traits of our founder, John Muir. From the late      1970's to the early 1990's Doug Scott lead the Club in the      spirit of John Muir. He deserves the Club's highest      conservation honor for his service, accomplishments, and      inspiration.                          ____________________
