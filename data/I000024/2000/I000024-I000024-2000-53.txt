I do not agree, obviously. I do think, though, I find two reasons to disagree with his arguments: One, to use percentages, as to what percentage this represents that would be decreased from the NEA as opposed to increase for diabetes because of the seriousness of this; the second thing is why carry this into a discussion and a debate on the merits of the National Endowment for the Arts.  If we were to do that, I would be glad to join in that debate. In fact, I voted many times to defund the National Endowment for the Arts. However, that is not this amendment. Right now they have, from last year, $97 million, the NEA, and they are talking about not keeping it level but increasing it by $7.3 million. I am saying the $7.3 million is going to end up saving lives, particularly lives of Indians with diabetes, as opposed to rewarding and increasing the appropriation to the NEA.  I think we need to look at it in that light. As I said, it is just incredible forpeople to comprehend the seriousness of this affliction among the Indian population. Yes, I am prejudiced. Yes, the State of Oklahoma has the largest number of Indians of all 50 States, and there are a lot of States that do not have that concern. I can tell you right now, we are going to do everything we can.  What the Senator from Washington says is true. We have increased it by some $30 million and it is going to be increased again over the next 4 years. However, every incremental increase is going to have a very positive effect on the research and the treatment of the Indians with diabetes. So I am going to ask for the yeas and nays on this for a vote.  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.
