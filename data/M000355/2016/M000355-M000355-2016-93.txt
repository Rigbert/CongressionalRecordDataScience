 President, the Senate has a number of issues to wrap up, including the conference reports on the Water Resources Development Act, the Energy Policy Modernization Act, and, of course, the National Defense Authorization Act as well.  The action taken by the Senate yesterday will allow us to have a final vote on the critical Iran Sanctions Extension Act sometime this week. Later today, the House is set to vote on the 21st Century Cures bill, an important medical research and innovation bill which contains a number of bipartisan priorities.  Once their work is complete, the Senate will consider this measure and send it to the President's desk. Talks on the continuing resolution are ongoing. I will have more to say about that in the coming days.                          ____________________
