Speaker, I hope that the House will approve this legislation that will revise rules for representational activities of Federal employees.  This is commonsense government and, as a cosponsor, I am pleased to see H.R. 782 included on today's agenda. The legislation authored by Congressman Wolf will resolve existing problems that make it illegal for Federal employees to express the view of an employee organization or association to a governmental agency.  This has been a troublesome issue for child care groups, credit unions, recreational associations, and other employee organizations. This bill will allow members of such groups to discuss all matters except judicial proceedings and grant requests.  In my view, the 1962 ethics provisions, as interpreted by the Department of Justice in 1994, were never intended to prohibit such communication. It does not make sense to stop the president of a credit union from discussing his needs or issues with representatives of the agency or Department. In fact, open discussion benefits both the organizations, the employees involved, and the employer.  I thank the Committee on the Judiciary for reporting the legislation and I urge its adoption.
