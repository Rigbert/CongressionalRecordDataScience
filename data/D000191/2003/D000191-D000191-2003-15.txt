Yet, through stealth maneuvers, the Republican majority, under pressure from the pharmaceutical industry and the White House, is going to close the border. They are about to say, to quote the FDA Commissioner, the FDA cannot guarantee the safety of Canadian drugs. Well, guess what? They cannot guarantee the safety of American drugs. In fact, it is well documented that the supply chain is more broken in the United States of America than it is in Canada where there is more government control.  That was totally a specious argument that they have drug out here to try and protect one thing: Not the safety of the American public and our seniors, not their health. I will tell you what jeopardizes their health: When they cannot afford the drugs they need for a chronic or an acute condition.                              {time}  1200  There are tens of thousands of seniors and others across America in that condition.  No, there is only one issue here. There is only one thing to protect, and it is not the safety of America's seniors; it is not the sanctity and the quality of our drug supply, because it is already compromised by phony closed-door pharmacies and hundreds of other loopholes that are getting counterfeit drugs, as is well documented, into the system in our country.  Not in Canada. Their system works a lot better. They are reimporting FDA-approved drugs through Canada, and we know they are probably really American drugs. Here there are a lot of counterfeit drugs being made available though phony wholesalers.  No, there is one thing that is being protected. Well, two things. One is the obscene prices and profits of the pharmaceutical industry; and two is political campaign contributions to the White House and Republicans. That is what is being protected.
