 It is fitting that last week, the Senate approved an appropriations bill to fund the Fish and Wildlife Service. At this time each year, we join our friends at the Fish and Wildlife Service, conservation groups around the world, and bat enthusiasts to recognize the irreplaceable role of bats and to highlight our urgent fight to protect them.  Many do not know the profound impact that bats have on our environment and our economy. For an agricultural state like Vermont, bats are vital to both our ecosystem and our economy. They control pests, pollinate crops, and even spread seeds. Some farmers would consider bats among their best friends. For years, I have worked on the Appropriations Committee to prioritize funding for habitat conservation and to stop the spread of white-nose syndrome. I am proud that the fiscal year 2020 Interior bill once again responds to the call of the bat signal and provides more than $7 million to combat white-nose, a disease that has devastated bat communities across the country.  So once again I hope Senators will join me in recognizing the importance of bat and keep the advocacy behind Bat Week going throughout the year.                          ____________________
