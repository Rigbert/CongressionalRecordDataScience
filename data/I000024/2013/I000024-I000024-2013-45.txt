The junior Senator from Oklahoma made it very clear that he is talking about something he feels is relevant to the defense of this country, and I think that sounds reasonable.  What I would like to suggest to the majority leader and to my very good friend with whom I have worked for many years, the chairman of the committee Senator Levin, is that we can qualify and work on a UC which would either use the words germane, relevant or related, in some way so that those amendments--which have nothing to do with defending America--might be able to be considered in some form, maybe a limited form. I would like to be able to sit down and see if something like that can be worked out before giving up.
