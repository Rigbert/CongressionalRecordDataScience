This should raise alarm bells in the international community for a number of reasons.  It was not long ago that President Correa was supporting a lawsuit against Chevron, citing contamination that resulted from oil exploration by Texaco, the previous owner of thewells, in the Amazon region of Ecuador. That case, while fraught with allegations of corruption and ethical violations, shone a spotlight on the undeniable environmental damage, water contamination, and health problems associated with those oil wells, as well as on the rich biodiversity and indigenous populations in that region.  But the Correa administration has now backstepped, deciding to allow the state-run oil company Petroamazonas to begin exploratory drilling. Given the history, one can only be concerned about the threat this poses to one of the most biologically diverse regions in the world and the people who live there.  I am also disappointed by the circumstances leading up to the decision to begin oil production. Having failed in its far-fetched attempt to elicit contributions from the international community in exchange for halting plans to drill in the reserve, the Correa administration is moving ahead with this ill-conceived project. In other words, if someone else won't pay to prevent the Ecuadoran Government from potentially despoiling their own forests, they will drill there themselves despite the grave problems that occurred in the past.  Nobody questions Ecuador's need for energy. Nobody doubts Ecuador's right to drill for oil. But we all have a responsibility to protect areas especially rich in biodiversity for future generations. We also have a responsibility to respect vulnerable indigenous cultures. While no country, including the United States, can claim perfection in environmental stewardship, we need to collectively learn from our mistakes and avoid repeating them.                          ____________________
