 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding to me. The issue that he is talking about is the most important issue facing our society, and that is that never before in American history, at least the modern history of this country, have the people on top had so much wealth and have had so much power. What they are doing with that wealth and power is using it to make themselves ever more rich while they are squeezing and shrinking the middle class and creating a new class, urban serfs.
