 President, I rise today to introduce the Consumer Identity Protection and Security Act. This legislation provides consumers the ability to place credit freezes on their credit reports.  My sole intent in introducing this legislation is to address a jurisdictional question that has recently arisen with respect to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. I want to make sure that the referral precedent with respect to legislation that amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act, or touches upon the substance covered by that Act, is entirely clear. I believe the Parliamentarian's decision to refer this bill to the Senate Banking Committee establishes that there is no question in this regard and that this subject matter is definitively and singularly in the jurisdiction of the Senate Banking Committee.                                 ______                                       By
