 REID. Of course; I am happy to.  Mr. McCONNELL. I would observe that what I am hoping for is an open amendment process. We have the amendment tree filled and it remains my hope that we will be able to, through these discussions we have had, get to something closer to what we have been accustomed to in the past with a relatively open amendment process. So under those circumstances, and in the hope that by tomorrow we end up with a more fair process, I am happy to go along with what the majority leader has suggested.                          ____________________
