Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank the gentleman. I would hope that perhaps we could, particularly in light of the fact that these bills, although they are component parts, as I understand, of the larger energy bill that passed the House, but because they are not going to be considered in committee, that there would be some more flexibility as to the possibility of amendments in that regard.  The gentleman did not answer, because perhaps he does not know at this point in time. Is it our expectation that the energy bills the gentleman referenced would be sent to the Senate separately as individual bills, or would the rule bundle them at the end? I yield to the gentleman from Texas.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. No decision has been made, but I think the gentleman can assume that these bills will be sent separately to the Senate.
