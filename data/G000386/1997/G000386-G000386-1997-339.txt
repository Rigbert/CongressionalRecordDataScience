 President, I join the minority leader today in introducing two important bills regarding agricultural trade. The first is a bill that requires the U.S. Trade Representative to determine whether the European Union has violated its trade agreements with the United States by failing to certify U.S. beef and pork processing plants for export to the European Union. The failure to certify our plants has cost the pork industry alone as much as $60 million annually.  The problem arises under the E.U.'s so-called Third Country Meat Directive. This directive, which has been in place since 1985, calls for E.U. inspection and certification of U.S. meat plants as a condition for accepting exports from those plants. Simply put, if a plant has not been certified, it cannot export to the E.U. member nations. Since the mid-1980's the E.U. has used this directive to prohibit over 400 U.S. facilities from exporting beef and pork to the E.U.  Many bilateral discussions have taken place between the E.U. and the United States on this issue since 1985. But no satisfactory resolution has ever been reached. In early 1991, the then-U.S. Trade Representative, Carla Hills, initiated an action under section 301 of the 1974 Trade Act. After a year of consultations and the certification of some U.S. plants, we entered into a settlement agreement, known as the 1992 meat agreement. In exchange for the settlement agreement, the United States agreed to withdraw its 301 action.  Under the 1992 meat agreement, the E.U. agreed that U.S. plants would be certified if their inspection systems are equivalent to the E.U.'s. In spite of this agreement, and its commitments made under the WTO Agreement on Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures, the E.U. has not made any significant progress in certifying U.S. plants. Europe effectively remains a closed market for United States beef and pork.  What this bill does is require the USTR to determine under section 306 whether the E.U. has violated its trade agreements. This is important because once a determination has been made, the USTR is required to take action. The action could take the form of unilateral retaliation, for example. Furthermore, the bill requires the U.S. Department of Agriculture to reconsider our certification of European plants if this problem continues.  Mr. President, the impact of the E.U.'s blatant disregard of our trade agreements is substantial for the U.S. meat industry. Our cattle and hog farmers have been effectively shut out of the entire European market. This comes at a time when American agriculture is becoming more dependent on foreign markets. In fact, USDA calculates that American farmers will soon derive up to 30 percent of their net income from foreign trade. So global market access is critical to the viability of the family farmer.  This bill sends a strong signal to the E.U. that we are no longer willing to tolerate this egregious behavior. Bilateral negotiations have failed. It is time to take swift and strong action to eliminate this barrier to our value-added agricultural products.  We must also send a signal to our other foreign trading partners. Trade agreements must be followed. Commitments must be kept. The United States will no longer sit idly by as the rest of the world thumbs it nose at their responsibilities as a trading partner. The stakes are simply too high in terms of American jobs and standard of living.  This leads me to the second bill that I have cosponsored today with the minority leader. This bill requires the USTR to identify, on an annual basis, those countries that deny market access to our value-added agricultural products. It also requires identifying countries who are violating the sanitary and phytosanitary provisions of the GATT. This procedure is similar to the special 301 procedure for intellectual property rights.  It is necessary to identify and understand the trade barriers faced by American agriculture so we can work to eliminate them. Not only is foreign trade vital to American farmers, it is vital to the U.S. balance of payments. Agriculture trade is the shining star in an otherwise increasing trade deficit. But we cannot rest on the success of the past. In existing markets we could be doing much better in terms of market share. And many markets remain closed to U.S. ag products.  This bill will help pinpoint our successes and our failures so we can move forward on bilateral negotiations and, eventually, a new round of agricultural negotiations in the World Trade Organization, beginning in 1999. This annual report will serve as a blueprint to achieving worldwide access for the commodities produced on America's family farms.  I appreciate the minority leader's hard work on these two pieces of legislation. And I look forward to workingwith him during this Congress to get these bill enacted into law.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 220       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Fair Trade in Meat and Pork      Products Act of 1997''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) The European Union's Third Country Meat Directive has      been used to decertify more than 400 United States facilities      exporting beef and pork products to the European Union even      though United States health inspection procedures are      equivalent to those provided for in the Third Country Meat      Directive.       (2) An effect of the decertifications is to prohibit the      importation of United States beef and pork products into the      European Union.       (3) As a result of the decertifications, the highly      competitive United States pork industry loses as much as      $60,000,000 each year from trade with European Union      countries.       (4) In July 1987 and November 1990, at the request of      affected United States industries, the United States      initiated investigations under section 301 of the Trade Act      of 1974 into the European Union's administration of the Third      Country Meat Directive and sought resolution of the meat and      pork trade problems through the dispute settlement process      established under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.       (5) The United States Trade Representative preliminarily      concluded on October 10, 1992, that the European Union's      administration of the Third Country Meat Directive created a      burden on and restricted United States commerce.       (6) Bilateral talks, initiated as a result of that finding,      resulted in an Exchange of Letters in which the United States      and the European Union concluded that the meat inspection      systems of the United States and the European Union provided      ``equivalent safeguards against public health risks'' and      agreed to take steps to resolve remaining differences      regarding meat inspection.       (7) Even though the United States terminated the section      301 investigation as a result of the Exchange of Letters, the      United States determined that the practices under      investigation would have been actionable if an acceptable      agreement had not been reached.       (8) United States meat and pork producers have displayed      consistent interest in exporting products to the European      Union and have undertaken substantial investment to take the      steps specified by the Exchange of Letters.       (9) The European Union has failed to acknowledge changes in      plant safety and inspection procedures undertaken in the      United States specifically at the European Union's request      and has not fulfilled its obligation to inspect and relist      United States producers who have taken the steps specified by      the Exchange of Letters.       (10) The actions of the European Union in conducting United      States plant inspections places the European Union in      violation of commitments made in the Exchange of Letters.       (11) The European Union, in addition to being a party to      the Exchange of Letters, is a signatory to GATT 1994 and to      the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and      Phytosanitary Measures, which requires that meat and pork      inspection procedures under Department of Agriculture      regulations be treated as equivalent to inspection procedures      required by the European Union under the Third Country Meat      Directive if the regulations achieve the European level of      sanitary protection.       (12) Whenever a foreign country is not satisfactorily      implementing an international trade measure or agreement, the      United States Trade Representative is required under section      306(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2416(b)(1)) to      determine the actions to be taken under section 301(a) of      such Act.
