I would look forward to that.  Mr. McCAIN. I look forward to it, and I want to say there has been no more passionate advocate in the Senate than the Senator from Illinois. I respect him and admire him for his compassion and his concern about young people whose lives, as he very well described, need to have some kind of assurance for their future since it is clearly a compelling humanitarian situation. I thank my friend from Illinois.                           Health Care Ruling  Mr. President, later this week the Supreme Court will issue its ruling on the health care bill, designed and negotiated by the White House and rammed through Congress during President Obama's first year in office when the economy was near its weakest.  Instead of focusing on recovery and persistent unemployment, the President and the Democratic majorities controlling Congress squandered the opportunity and forced the unpopular and potentially unconstitutional legislation on the American people.  Today we are voting on final passage on the reconciled FDA user fee bill. During Senate consideration of this bill I offered an amendment to allow safe drug importation from legitimateCanadian pharmacies. But the pharmaceutical industry spread misleading and inaccurate information about the amendment, as they have done time and a time again. As I said then, there is no greater example of the influence of special interests on this body than the failure to enact an amendment that would have allowed drugs from legitimate Canadian pharmacies so people could purchase their much needed medication at sometimes half the cost of what it is in the United States of America. I am embarrassed to this day that nine of my Republican colleagues also voted against it.  I don't know if there was a sweetheart deal to protect PhRMA at the expense of American patients from the vote on my amendment. But we do know that PhRMA was protected by the White House and Senate Democrats from provisions they didn't like in ObamaCare only after they offered up advertising in exchange for more accommodating policies.  From a recent House Energy and Commerce Committee investigation, it is now confirmed that PhRMA orchestrated a grand deal with the White House and Senate Democrats to oppose importation and other policies. I might point out then-Senator Obama supported drug importation.  This is how the New York Times described the deal that was done in exchange for reportedly $150 million in advertising to support ObamaCare, June 8, 2012:       After weeks of quiet talks, drug industry lobbyists were      growing nervous. If they were to cut a deal with the White      House on overhauling health care, they needed to be sure      President Obama would stop a proposal by his liberal allies      intended to bring down medicine prices.       On June 3, 2009, one of the lobbyists e-mailed Nancy-Ann      DeParle, the president's top health care adviser. Ms. DeParle      sent a message back reassuring the lobbyists. Although Mr.      Obama was overseas, she wrote, she and other top officials      had ``made a decision, based on how constructive you guys      have been, to oppose importation on the bill.'' Just like      that, Mr. Obama's staff abandoned his support for the      reimportation of prescription medicines at lower prices and      with it solidified a growing compact with an industry he had      vilified on the campaign trail the year before.       A president who had promised to air negotiations on C-SPAN      cut a closed-door deal with the powerful pharmaceutical      lobby, signifying to some disillusioned liberal supporters a      loss of innocence, or perhaps even the triumph of cynicism.       Still, what distinguishes the Obama-industry deal is that      he had so strongly rejected that very sort of business as      usual.  Ironically, candidate Obama sang a very different tune on the campaign trail in 2008:       You know, I don't want to learn how to play the game      better. I want to put an end to the game playing.  Now, PhRMA is the lobbying group for the pharmaceutical industry. The New York Times article continued:       The e-mails, which the House committee obtained from PhRMA      and other groups, document a tumultuous negotiation, at times      transactional. . . .       In the end, the White House got the support it needed to      pass its broader priority, but industry emerged satisfied as      well. ``We got a deal,'' wrote Bryant Hall, then senior vice      president of the pharmaceutical group.       In July, the White House made clear that it wanted      supportive ads using the same characters the industry used to      defeat Mr. Clinton's proposal 15 years earlier. ``Rahm asked      for Harry and Louise ads thru third party,'' Mr. Hall      wrote.''       Talks came close to breaking down several times. In May,      the White House was upset that the industry had not signed      onto a joint statement. One industry official wrote that they      should sign: ``Rahm is already furious. The ire will be      turned on us.''  The e-mails also detail extensive and direct negotiations with PhRMA, its drug company members, the American Medical Association, AARP, the American Hospital Association, unions, and many more. Members of the alliance all participated because they thought they were getting something more valuable--revenue to their organization or membership because the Federal Government was going to force everyone into some form of government-designed health insurance coverage--than what they were going to have to spend on advertising to support the legislation. Some reports have the PhRMA advertising commitment as high as $150 million, spread out through direct advertising in certain important States and among groups created to sound like they were looking out for patients or to tout the economic benefits of ObamaCare.  On June 11, 2012, the Wall Street Journal described the e-mails about the 2009 negotiations:       The joint venture was forged in secret in spring of 2009      amid an uneasy mix of menace and opportunism. The drug makers      worried that health-care reform would revert to the liberal      default of price controls and drug re-importation that Mr.      Obama campaigned on, but they also understood that a new      entitlement could be a windfall as taxpayers bought more of      their products. . . .       Initially, the Obamateers and Senate Finance Chairman Max      Baucus asked for $100 billion, 90% of it from mandatory      ``rebates'' through the Medicare prescription drug benefit      like those that are imposed in Medicaid. The drug makers      wheedled them down to $80 billion by offsetting cost-sharing      for seniors on Medicare, in an explicit quid pro quo for      protection against such rebates and re-importation.       ``Terms were reached in June. . .lead PhRMA negotiator      Bryant Hall wrote on June 12 that Mr. Obama ``knows      personally about our deal and is pushing no agenda.''       But Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman then      announced that he was pocketing PhRMA's concessions and      demanding more, including re-importation. We wrote about the      double-cross in a July 16, 2009 editorial called ``Big Pharma      Gets Played,'' noting that Mr. Tauzin's ``corporate clients      and their shareholders may soon pay for his attempt to get      cozy with ObamaCare.''       Mr. Hall forwarded the piece to Ms. DeParle with the      subject line, ``This sucks.'' The White House rode to the      rescue. In September Mr. Hall informed Mr. Kindler that      deputy White House chief of staff Jim Messina ``is working on      some very explicit language on importation to kill it in      health care reform. This has to stay quiet.''       ``PhRMA more than repaid the favor, with a $150 million      advertising campaign coordinated with the White House      political shop. As one of Mr. Hall's deputies put it earlier      in the minutes of a meeting when the deal was being      negotiated, ``The WHdesignated folks . . . would like us to      start to define what 'consensus health care reform' means,      and what it might include. . . . They definitely want us in      the game and on the same side.''  More on the ``WH-designated folks . . .'' in a moment. The June 11 WSJ editorial continued:       In particular, the drug lobby would spend $70 million on      two 501(c)(4) front groups called Healthy Economy Now and      Americans for Stable Quality Care. In July, Mr. Hall wrote      that ``Rahm asked for Harry and Louise ads thru third party.      We've already contacted the agent.  Other groups like the AMA were also willing to commit their membership dollars to advertising in support of the legislation in exchange for their policy priorities. According to the Wall Street Journal:       ``At least PhRM/I deserves backhanded credit for the      competence of its political operatives--unlike, say, the      American Medical Association. A thread running through the      emails is a hapless AMA lobbyist importuning Ms. DeParle and      Mr. Messina for face-to-face meetings to discuss reforming      the Medicare physician payment formula. The AMA supported      ObamaCare in return for this ``doc fix,'' which it never got.       ``We are running out of time,'' this lobbyist, Richard      Deem, writes in October 2009. How can he ``tell my colleagues      at AMA headquarters to proceed with $2m TV buy'' without a      permanent fix? The question answers itself: It was only $2      million.''  The emails uncovered by the House committee also describe potentially serious conflicts of interest for senior White House staff, their former businesses, who was really writing the legislation--the White House, Congress or affected industries--and questions about the appearance of the White House staff orchestrating the outside advertising campaign. On June 21, 2012 the Wall Street Journal further reported on the 2009 secret deals:                 Strassel: Axelrod's ObamaCare Dollars                       (By Kimberly A. Strassel)       Rewind to 2009. The fight over ObamaCare is raging, and a      few news outlets report that something looks ethically rotten      in the White House. An outside group funded by industry is      paying the former firm of senior presidential adviser David      Axelrod to run ads in favor of the bill. That firm, AKPD      Message and Media, still owes Mr. Axelrod money and employs      his son.       The story quickly died, but emails recently released by the      House Energy and Commerce Committee ought to resurrect it.      The emails suggest the White House was intimately involved      both in creating this lobby and hiring Mr. Axelrod's firm--     which is as big an ethical no-no as it gets.       Mr. Axelrod--who left the White House last year--started      AKPD in 1985. Mr. Axelrod moved to the White House in 2009      and agreed to have AKPD buy him out for $2 million. But AKPD      chose to pay Mr. Axelrod in annual installments--even as he      worked in the West Wing.       The White House and industry were working hand-in-glove to      pass ObamaCare in 2009, and among the vehicles supplying ad      support was an outfit named Healthy Economy Now (HEN).       House emails show HEN was in fact born at an April 15, 2009      meeting arranged by then-White House aide Jim Messina and a      chief of staff for Democratic Sen. Max Baucus. The     two politicos met at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign      Committee (DSCC) and invited representatives of business and      labor.       The call was from Nick Baldick, a Democratic consultant who      had worked on the Obama campaign and for the DSCC. Mr.      Baldick started HEN. The only job of PhRMA and others was to      fund it.       Meanwhile, Mr. Axelrod's old firm was hired to run the ads      promoting ObamaCare. At the time, a HEN spokesman said HEN      had done the hiring. But the emails suggest otherwise. In      email after email, the contributors to HEN refer to four men      as the ``White House'' team running health care.       In one email, PhRMA consultant Steve McMahon calls these      four the ``WH-designated folks.'' He explains to colleagues      that Messrs. Grossman, Grisolano and Del Cecato ``are very      close to Axelrod,'' and that ``they have been put in charge      of the campaign to pass health reform.''       A 2009 PhRMA memo also makes clear that AKPD had been      chosen before PhRMA joined HEN. It's also clear that some      contributors didn't like the conflict of interest. When, in      July 2009, a media outlet prepared to report AKPD's hiring, a      PhRMA participant said: ``This is a big problem.'' Mr.      Baldick advises: ``just say, AKPD is not working for PhRMA.''      AKPD and another firm, GMMB, would handle $12 million in ad      business from HEN and work for a successor 501(c)4.       A basic rule of White House ethics is to avoid even the      appearance of self-dealing or nepotism. Could you imagine the      press frenzy if Karl Rove had done the same after he joined      the White House?       Until the White House explains all this, voters can fairly      conclude that the President's political team took their      Chicago brand of ethics into the White House.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a New York Times article, June 8, 2012; a Wall Street Journal article, June 11, 2012; and June 21 Wall Street Journal editorial, and the memos about the e-mails associated with this report.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                     May 16, 2012.     To: Energy and Commerce Committee Republican Members     From: Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations Majority          Staff     Re Investigation Update: Closed-Door Obamacare Negotiations       From: Messina, Jim       Sent: Friday, January 15, 2010 6:04 PM       To: Bryant Hall       Subject: FW: TAUZIN EMAIL       What the hell? This wasn't part of our deal.                                Overview       The purpose of this memorandum is to update Republican      Members on the Energy and Commerce Committee on the      Committee's ongoing investigation into the potential      agreements made by the White House and health care industry      stakeholders prior to passage of the Patient Protection and      Affordable Care Act (PPACA). As reported on April 17, 2012,      the Committee's investigation is attempting to answer the      following questions:       Were ``deals'' made between the Administration and outside      stakeholders that exchanged specific policy outcomes for      public support of the law?       Who made these deals, and to what extent was Congress      excluded?       What specifically was negotiated by the White House and      these outside interests? What policies are now law as a      result of these negotiations, and what did the White House      obtain in exchange?       This investigation has produced further information      regarding the substance of the ``deal'' between the White      House and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of America      (PhRMA), the details of which have never been fully disclosed      to the public. Further, based on email exchanges and other      primary source material, it appears that deal was reached not      solely between PhRMA and the United States Senate Finance      Committee, but that top personnel in the White House were      involved in negotiating and approving this deal. The      following update is based on internal records obtained from      outside stakeholders who engaged in negotiations outside the      public's view during the development and passage of PPACA.                          I. Was there a deal?       The existence of an agreement or series of agreements      between powerful health care industry stakeholders and the      authors of PPACA is a widely known--albeit poorly      understood--aspect of the health care law. Media accounts      dating back to 2009 speculated on the existence and details      of such deals leading up to the law's enactment. However,      those accounts have lacked concrete evidence of exactly what      policies the White House accepted or rejected as part of      these agreements, and what the interest groups delivered in      return. Moreover, media accounts and public statements from      policymakers at the time were often conflicting or      incomplete, failing to provide a clear picture to the      American people about how this law was being written, and by      whom.       For example, while President Obama referred to the      agreement in June 2009, reports at the time also indicated      that ``many details of the . . . deal remained unclear.'' A      month later, The Wall Street Journal reported that House      Democrats had been told that the Administration ``doesn't      feel bound'' by the agreement. Because of increased pressure      from the Hill to scuttle the agreement, eventually the White      House attempted to publicly support the deal in early August      when The New York Times reported that the drug industry ``. .      . successfully demanded that the White House explicitly      acknowledge for the first time it had committed to protect      drug makers. . . .'' Yet, a week later reports still      indicated that ``[s]ince mid-July, the White House and the      drug industry's lobby, PhRMA, have denied any specific      agreement. . . .''       This investigation has confirmed the existence of a deal      between the White House and PhRMA that explicitly bound both      parties to certain commitments. As the email exchange at the      top of this memorandum demonstrates, the deal was so clearly      understood to be binding that White House Deputy Chief of      Staff Jim Messina made direct contact with PhRMA's chief      lobbyist for the negotiations regarding the deal to express      his displeasure with an apparent violation of the agreement      more than two months before the legislation was given final      approval by Congress.           II. Why did the White House hide its involvement?       On June 20, 2009, the White House issued a 296-word      statement from President Obama announcing an agreement      between the nation's pharmaceutical companies and the Senate.      The statement makes no mention of White House involvement.       The investigation has determined that the White House,      primarily through the Office of Health Reform Director Nancy      Ann DeParle and Messina, with involvement from Chief of Staff      Rahm Emmanuel, was actively engaged in these negotiations      while the role of Congress was limited. For example, three      days before the June 20 statement, the head of PhRMA promised      Messina, ``we will deliver a final yes to you by morning.''      Meanwhile, Ms. DeParle all but confirmed that half of the      Legislative Branch was shut out in an email to a PhRMA      representative: ``I think we should have included the House      in the discussions, but maybe we never would have gotten      anywhere if we had.''       Given these facts, it is unclear why the White House did      not fully disclose its involvement with outside stakeholders      in the development of the legislation. Their efforts are      particularly surprising given the President's repeated      promises of transparency.       After this Committee initiated its investigation into the      potential promises or agreements made between PhRMA, labor      unions, insurers, medical associations, and other trade and      advocacy organizations, the White House derided the      Committee's request for basic information about its      legislative efforts as ``vast and expensive.'' The White      House refused to produce any of the requested documents and      only produced to the Committee a list of meetings based on      ``calendar entries and other readily available information.''      These calendar entries do not provide information on the      attendees or details of discussion. For example, the calendar      provided by the White House identifies a July 7, 2009, event      as follows: ``Meeting with PhRMA representatives.'' No      further information is provided. This investigation, however,      has revealed that this was not only a meeting between      representatives of PhRMA and top White House aides; it was      the critical meeting to solidify the deal. As a PhRMA      representative said at the time: ``It's just to go over the      principal elements of the deal w[ith] Rahm, Messina and      DeParle. ''              III. What did the White House promise to do?       Even news stories that indicated that there was a potential      agreement with the pharmaceutical industry could not report      the entirety of the agreement. The August New York Times      story that reported White House acknowledgment of the deal      ``for the first time'' could not report any specifics      ``beyond an agreed-upon $80 billion'' in cost savings. This      investigation will show that the agreement between the White      House and the pharmaceutical industry was much more explicit.      In the coming weeks the Committee intends to show what the      White House agreed to do as part of its deal with the      pharmaceutical industry and how the full details of this      agreement were kept from both the public and the House of      Representatives.       After two years, the health care law has failed to lower      costs while only increasing its unpopularity with the public.      According to a PhRMA official: ``[W]e got a good deal.''       The important question to answer is what did the White      House get in return.                                  ____                                                     May 31, 2012.     To: Energy and Commerce Committee Republican Members     From: Majority Staff     Re Investigation Update: Closed-Door Obamacare Negotiations                           Executive Summary       The White House negotiated a deal with the Pharmaceutical      Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) in mid-June      2009. After attempting to secure a commitment from the      industry for $100 billion in payment cuts, eventually the      White House settled for approximately $80 billion in payment      reductions through expanded and increased Medicaid rebates      and a new health reform fee. PhRMA also had direct input into      the actual legislative policies that produced the $80      billion, including the proposal for closing the Part D      doughnut hole.       Under the deal, ``the White House and Senator Baucus      agreed'' that neither price controls nor a government-run      Medicare Part D     plan would become law, the White House would oppose price      controls on dual eligible beneficiaries, and that savings      from a follow-on biologics proposal would be applied to the      total $80 billion commitment.       White House Office of Health Reform Director Nancy-Ann      DeParle told PhRMA's chief lobbyist for negotiating the deal      that the White House would oppose new drug importation      policies because of ``how constructive'' PhRMA had been.      According to PhRMA's lobbyist, White House Deputy Chief of      Staff Jim Messina told him that the ``WH is working on some      very explicit language on importation to kill it in health      reform.''       According to internal e-mails, PhRMA's chief lobbyist      believed the White House eventually cut a deal with the      pharmaceutical industry during the week of June 20, 2009,      because the White House had suffered a bad week politically.       Despite countless promises of televised negotiations and      transparent government, the White House met in private with      PhRMA representatives and drug company CEOs in July 2009,      ``to look the other side in the eye and shake their hand on      whatever deal we work out.''       The White House was not above threatening PhRMA to get its      way. According to PhRMA's chief lobbyist, the White House was      going to have President Obama call for rebating all of      Medicare Part D, a policy PhRMA staunchly opposed, in his      Weekly Radio Address unless PhRMA cut a deal with the White      House to support health reform.                                  ____                                                     June 8, 2012.     To: Energy and Commerce Committee Republican Members     From: Majority Staff     Re: Investigation Update: Closed-Door Obamacare Negotiations                           Executive Summary       As part of its agreement with the White House, the      Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA)      needed to undertake a ``significant public campaign.'' PhRMA      was willing to spend as much as $150 million on advertising,      with nearly $70 million spent on two 501(c)(4) groups that      could spend unlimited corporate money with little public      disclosure: Healthy Economy Now and Americans for Stable      Quality Care.       Healthy Economy Now was created after a meeting at the      Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) organized in      part by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Jim Messina.      Participants were told that the White House wanted to see ads      linking the poor economy to the need for health care      legislation, with one attendee remarking that ``given who is      behind this ask'' their group should support the effort.       In early June 2009, PhRMA representatives met with ``the      team that is working with the White House on health care      reform'' to learn about White House messaging and ``how our      effort can be consistent with that.'' The team was a who's      who of Democratic strategists that included a previous head      of the DSCC; the producer of the 2008 Democratic National      Convention; and two partners at AKPD Message and Media, the      advertising firm founded by then Senior Advisor to the      President David Axelrod.       When PhRMA's representative indicated that PhRMA was not      prepared to run advertisements before seeing how the health      care legislation developed, the White House team specifically      referred to a meeting the PhRMA CEOs had with Jim Messina the      day before and to White House efforts on drug importation      policy which had been communicated to PhRMA's chief lobbyist      that day.       PhRMA's chief lobbyist reported that White House Chief of      Staff Rahm Emanuel asked for ``Harry and Louise ads thru      third party'' on July 7, 2009, the same day White House      officials met with PhRMA CEOs. PhRMA aired the ad a week      later.       Public revelations about the hiring of political firms      close to the White House were perceived to be a ``big      problem.'' Presumably, because the firms producing and      placing some of PhRMA's advertising, including the      advertising through both Healthy Economy Now and Americans      for Stable Quality Care, had also received over $340 million      to handle advertising for President Obama's 2008 election      campaign.       The White House attempted to steer the advertising and      advocacy tactics of a number of organizations, including the      AFL-CIO and AARP.                                  ____             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 11, 2012] ObamaCare's Secret History--How a Pfizer CEO and Big Pharma Colluded              With the White House at the Public's Expense.       On Friday House Republicans released more documents that      expose the collusion between the health-care industry and the      White House that produced ObamaCare, and what a story of      crony capitalism it is. If the trove of emails proves      anything, it's that the Tea Party isn't angry enough.       Over the last year, the Energy and Commerce Committee has      taken Nancy Pelosi's advice to see what's in the Affordable      Care Act and how it passed. The White House refused to      cooperate beyond printing out old press releases, but a dozen      trade groups turned over thousands of emails and other files.      A particular focus is the drug lobby, President Obama's most      loyal corporate ally in 2009 and 2010.       The business refrain in those days was that if you're not      at the table, you're on the menu. But it turns out Big Pharma      was also serving as head chef, matre d'hotel and dishwasher.      Though some parts of the story have been reported before, the      emails make clear that ObamaCare might never have passed      without the drug companies. Thank you, Pfizer.       The joint venture was forged in secret in spring 2009 amid      an uneasy mix of menace and opportunism. The drug makers      worried that health-care reform would revert to the liberal      default of price controls and drug re-importation that Mr.      Obama campaigned on, but they also understood that a new      entitlement could be a windfall as taxpayers bought more of      their products. The White House wanted industry financial      help and knew that determined business opposition could tank      the bill.       Initially, the Obamateers and Senate Finance Chairman Max      Baucus asked for $100 billion, 90% of it from mandatory      ``rebates'' through the Medicare prescription drug benefit      like those that are imposed in Medicaid. The drug makers      wheedled them down to $80 billion by offsetting cost-sharing      for seniors on Medicare, in an explicit quid pro quo for      protection against such rebates and re-importation. As      Pfizer's then-CEO Jeff Kindler put it, ``our key deal points      . . . are, to some extent, as important as the total      dollars.'' Mr. Kindler played a more influential role than we      understood before, as the emails show.       Thus began a close if sometimes dysfunctional relationship      with the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of      America, or PhRMA, as led by Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana      Democrat turned Republican turned lobbyist. As a White House      staffer put it in May 2009, ``Rahm's calling Nancy-Ann and      knows Billy is going to talk to Nancy-Ann tonight. Rahm will      make it clear that PhRMA needs a direct line of      communication, separate and apart from any coalition.''      Nancy-Ann is Nancy-Ann DeParle, the White House health reform      director, and Rahm is, of course, Rahm.       Terms were reached in June. Mr. Kindler's chief of staff      wrote a memo to her industry colleagues explaining that      ``Jeff would object to me telling you that his communication      skills and breadth of knowledge on the issues was very      helpful in keeping the meeting productive.'' Soon the White      House leaked the details to show that reform was making      health-care progress, and lead PhRMA negotiator Bryant Hall      wrote on June 12 that Mr. Obama ``knows personally about our      deal and is pushing no agenda.''       But Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman then      announced that he was pocketing PhRMA's concessions and      demanding more, including re-importation. We wrote about the      double-cross in a July 16, 2009 editorial called ``Big Pharma      Gets Played,'' noting that Mr. Tauzin's ``corporate clients      and their shareholders may soon pay for his attempt to get      cozy with ObamaCare.''       Mr. Hall forwarded the piece to Ms. DeParle with the      subject line, ``This sucks.'' The duo commiserated about how      unreasonable House Democrats are, unlike Mr. Baucus and the      Senators. The full exchange is among the excerpts from the      emails printed nearby.       Then New York Times reporter Duff Wilson wrote to a PhRMA      spokesman, ``Tony, you see the WSJ editorial, `Big Pharma      Gets Played' ''? I'm doing a story along that line for      Monday.'' The drug dealers had a problem.       The White House rode to the rescue. In September Mr. Hall      informed Mr. Kindler that deputy White House chief of staff      Jim Messina ``is working on some very explicit language on      importation to kill it in health care reform. This has to      stay quiet.''       PhRMA more than repaid the favor, with a $150 million      advertising campaign coordinated with the White House      political shop. As one of Mr. Hall's deputies put it earlier      in the minutes of a meeting when the deal was being      negotiated, ``The WH-designated folks . . . would like us to      start to define what `consensus health care reform' means,      and what it might include. . . . They definitely want us in      the game and on the same side.''       In particular, the drug lobby would spend $70 million on      two 501(c)(4) front groups called Healthy Economy Now and      Americans for Stable Quality Care. In July, Mr. Hall wrote      that ``Rahm asked for Harry and Louise ads thru third party.      We've already contacted the agent.''       Mr. Messina--known as ``the fixer'' in the West Wing--asked      on December 15, 2009, ``Can we get immediate robo calls in      Nebraska urging nelson to vote for cloture?'' Ben Nelson was      the last Democratic holdout toward the Senate's 60-vote      threshold, and, as Mr. Messina wrote, ``We are at 59, we have      to have him.'' They got him.       At least PhRMA deserves backhanded credit for the      competence of its political operatives--unlike, say, the      American Medical Association. A thread running through the      emails is a hapless AMA lobbyist importuning Ms. DeParle and      Mr. Messina for face-to-face meetings to discuss reforming      the Medicare physician payment formula. The AMA supported      ObamaCare in return for this ``doc fix,'' which it never got.       ``We are running out of time,'' this lobbyist, Richard      Deem, writes in October 2009. How can he ``tell my colleagues      at AMA headquarters to proceed with $2m TV buy'' without a      permanent fix? The question answers itself: It was only $2      million.       Mr. Waxman recently put out a rebuttal memo dismissing      these email revelations as routine, ``exactly what Presidents      have always done to enact major legislation.'' Which is      precisely the point--the normality is the scandal. In 2003      PhRMA took a similar road trip with the Bush Republicans to      create the Medicare drug benefit. That effort included      building public support by heavily funding a shell outfit      called Citizens for a Better Medicare.       Of course Democrats claim to be above this kind of merger      of private profits and political power, as Mr. Obama did as a      candidate. ``The pharmaceutical industry wrote into the      prescription drug plan that Medicare could not negotiate with      drug companies,'' he said in 2008. ``And you know what? The      chairman of the committee who pushed the law through''--that      would be Mr. Tauzin--``went to work for the pharmaceutical      industry making $2 million a year.''       Outrage over this kind of cronyism is what animates the Tea      Party and Occupy Wall Street, whose members aren't powerful      enough to get special dispensations from the government--or      even a fair hearing from their putative representatives.       In one email, an AARP lobbyist writes the White House to      say ``We really need to talk,'' noting that calls from      seniors are running 14 to one against ObamaCare. But she      isn't calling to say that AARP is withdrawing support--only      that the White House needs to adjust its messaging. This is      how a bill passes over the objections of most Americans.       The lesson for Republicans if they do end up running the      country next year is that their job is to restore the free      and fair market that creates broad-based economic growth. The      temptation will be to return for the sake of power to the      methods of Tom DeLay and Jack Abramoff. If they do, voters      will return the GOP to private life as surely as they did the      Democrats in 2010.       The warning to business is also fundamental. Crony      capitalism undermines public trust in capitalism itself and      risks blowback that erodes the free market that private      companies need to prosper and that underlies the productivity      and competitiveness of the U.S. economy. The political      benefits of cronyism are inherently temporary, but the damage      it does is far more lasting.       As for Big Pharma, the lobby ultimately staved off Mr.      Waxman's revolt and avoided some truly harmful drug      policies--for now. But over the long term their products are      far more vulnerable to the command-and-control central      planning that will erode medical innovation, and their $80      billion fillip is merely the teaser rate.       Mr. Kindler resigned from Pfizer in December 2010 under      pressure from directors, its stock having lost 35% of its      value since he became CEO. Mr. Tauzin left PhRMA in February      2010, with the Affordable Care Act a month from passage.       The truth is that this destructive legislation wasn't      inevitable and far better reforms were possible. They still      are, though they might have gained more traction in 2009 and      2010 with the right support. The miracle is that, despite      this collusion of big government and big business, ObamaCare      has received the public scorn that it deserves.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, June 8, 2012]        Lobby E-Mails Show Depth of Obama Ties to Drug Industry                            (By Peter Baker)       Washington.--After weeks of quiet talks, drug industry      lobbyists were growing nervous. If they were to cut a deal      with the White House on overhauling health care, they needed      to be sure President Obama would stop a proposal by his      liberal allies intended to bring down medicine prices.       On June 3, 2009, one of the lobbyists e-mailed Nancy-Ann      DeParle, the president's top health care adviser. Ms. DeParle      sent a message back reassuring the lobbyist. Although Mr.      Obama was overseas, she wrote, she and other top officials      had ``made decision, based on how constructive you guys have      been, to oppose importation on the bill.''       Just like that, Mr. Obama's staff abandoned his support for      the reimportation of prescription medicines at lower prices      and with it solidified a growing compact with an industry he      had vilified on the campaign trail the year before. Central      to Mr. Obama's drive to overhaul the nation's health care      system was an unlikely collaboration with the pharmaceutical      industry that forced unappealing trade-offs.       The e-mail exchange that day three years ago was among a      cache of messages obtained from the industry and released in      recent weeks by House Republicans--including a new batch put      out on Friday morning detailing the industry's advertising      campaign in favor of Mr. Obama's proposal. The broad contours      of the president's dealings with the drug industry were known      in 2009 but the newly public e-mails open a window into the      compromises underlying a health care overhaul now awaiting      the judgment of the Supreme Court.       Mr. Obama's deal-making in 2009 represented a pivotal      moment in his young presidency, a juncture where the heady      idealism of the campaign trail collided with the messy      reality of Washington policymaking. A president who had      promised to air negotiations on C-Span cut a closed-door deal      with the powerful pharmaceutical lobby, signifying to some      disillusioned liberal supporters a loss of innocence, or      perhaps even the triumph of cynicism.       But if it was a Faustian bargain for the president, it was      one he deemed necessary to forestall industry opposition that      had thwarted efforts to cover the uninsured for generations.      Without the deal, in which the industry agreed to provide $80      billion for health reform in exchange for protection from      policies that would cost more, Mr. Obama and Democratic      allies calculated he might get nowhere.       ``There was no way we had the votes in either the House or      the Senate if PhRMA was opposed--period,'' said a senior      Democratic official involved in the talks, referring to the      Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the      drug industry trade group.       Republicans see the deal as hypocritical. ``He said it was      going to be the most open and honest and transparent      administration ever and lobbyists won't be drafting the      bills,'' said Representative Michael C. Burgess of Texas, one      of the Republicans on the House Energy and Commerce      subcommittee that is examining the deal. ``Then when it came      time, the door closed, the lobbyists came in and the bills      were written.''       Some of the liberals bothered by the deal-making in 2009      now find the Republican criticism hard to take given the      party's long-standing ties to the pharmaceutical industry.       ``Republicans trumpeting these e-mails is like a fox      complaining someone else raided the chicken coop,'' said      Robert Reich, the former labor secretary under President Bill      Clinton. ``Sad to say, it's called politics in an era when      big corporations have an effective veto over major      legislation affecting them and when the G.O.P. is usually the      beneficiary. In this instance, the G.O.P. was outfoxed. Who      are they to complain?''       Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, said      the collaboration with industry was in keeping with the      president's promise to build consensus.       ``Throughout his campaign, President Obama was clear that      he would bring every stakeholder to the table in order to      pass health reform, even longtime opponents like the      pharmaceutical industry,'' Mr. Pfeiffer said. ``He understood      correctly that the unwillingness to work with people on both      sides of the issue was one of the reasons why it took a      century to pass health reform.''       In a statement, PhRMA said that its interactions with Mr.      Obama's White House were part of its mission to ``ensure      patient access'' to quality medicine and to advance medical      progress.       ``Before, during and since the health care debate, PhRMA      engaged with Congress and the administration to advance these      priorities,'' said Matthew Bennett, the group's senior vice      president.       Representative Henry Waxman of California, the top Democrat      on the House committee and one of those who balked at Mr.      Obama's deal in 2009, now defends it as traditional      Washington lawmaking.       ``Presidents have routinely sought the support and lobbying      clout of private industry in passing major legislation,'' Mr.      Waxman's committee staff said in a memo released in response      to the e-mails. ``President Obama's actions, for example, are      no different than those of President Lyndon B. Johnson in      enacting Medicare in 1965 or President George W. Bush in      expanding Medicare to add a prescription drug benefit in      2003.''       Still, what distinguishes the Obama-industry deal is that      he had so strongly rejected that very sort of business as      usual. During his campaign for president, he specifically      singled out the power of the pharmaceutical industry and its      chief lobbyist, former Representative Billy Tauzin, a      Democrat-turned-Republican from Louisiana, as examples of      what he wanted to change.       ``The pharmaceutical industry wrote into the prescription      drug plan that Medicare could not negotiate with drug      companies,'' Mr. Obama said in a campaign advertisement,      referring to Mr. Bush's 2003 legislation. ``And you know      what? The chairman of the committee who pushed the law      through went to work for the pharmaceutical industry making      $2 million a year.       ``Imagine that,'' Mr. Obama continued. ``That's an example      of the same old game playing in Washington. You know, I don't      want to learn how to play the game better. I want to put an      end to the game playing.''       After arriving at the White House, though, he and his      advisers soon determined that one reason Mr. Clinton had      failed to pass health care reform was the resilient      opposition of industry. Led by Rahm Emanuel, his chief of      staff and a former House leader, and Jim Messina, his deputy,      White House officials set out to change that dynamic.       The e-mails, which the House committee obtained from PhRMA      and other groups after the White House declined to provide      correspondence, document a tumultuous negotiation, at times      transactional, at others prickly. Each side suspected the      other of betraying trust and operating in bad faith.       The White House depicted in the message traffic comes      across as deeply involved in the give-and-take, and not      averse to pressure tactics, including having Mr. Obama      publicly assail the industry unless it gave in on key points.      In the end, the White House got the support it needed to pass      its broader priority, but industry emerged satisfied as well.      ``We got a good deal,'' wrote Bryant Hall, then senior vice      president of the pharmaceutical group.       Mr. Bryant, now head of his own firm, declined to comment.      So did Mr. Emanuel, now mayor of Chicago; Mr. Messina, now      the president's campaign manager; and Ms. DeParle, now a      White House deputy chief of     staff. Mr. Tauzin, who has left his post as the industry's      lobbyist, did not respond to messages.       The latest e-mails released on Friday underscore the      detailed discussions the two sides had about an advertising      campaign supporting Mr. Obama's health overhaul.``They plan      to hit up the `bad guys' for most of the $,'' a union      official wrote after an April meeting with Mr. Messina and      Senate Democratic aides. ``They want us to just put in enough      to be able to put our names in it--he is thinking @100K.''       In July, the White House made clear that it wanted      supportive ads using the same characters the industry used to      defeat Mr. Clinton's proposal 15 years earlier. ``Rahm asked      for Harry and Louise ads thru third party,'' Mr. Hall wrote.       Industry and Democratic officials said privately that the      advertising campaign was an outgrowth of the fundamental      deal, not the goal of it. The industry traditionally      advertises in favor of legislation it supports.       Either way, talks came close to breaking down several      times. In May, the White House was upset that the industry      had not signed onto a joint statement. One industry official      wrote that they should sign: ``Rahm is already furious. The      ire will be turned on us.''       By June, it came to a head again. ``Barack Obama is going      to announce in his Saturday radio address support for      rebating all of D unless we come to a deal,'' Mr. Hall wrote,      referring to a change in Medicare Part D that would cost the      industry.       In the end, the two sides averted the public confrontation      and negotiated down to $80 billion from $100 billion. But the      industry believed the White House was rushing an announcement      to deflect political criticism.       ``It's pretty clear that the administration has had a      horrible week on health care reform, and we are now getting      jammed to make this announcement so the story takes a      positive turn before the Sunday talk shows beat up on      Congress and the White House,'' wrote Ken Johnson, a senior      vice president of the pharmaceutical organization.       In the end, House Democrats imposed some additional costs      on the industry that by one estimate pushed the cost above      $100 billion, but the more sweeping policies the firms wanted      to avoid remained out of the legislation. Mr. Obama signed      the bill in March. He had the victory he wanted.                                  ____             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 22, 2012]                 Strassel: Axelrod's ObamaCare Dollars                       (By Kimberley A. Strassel)       Emails suggest the White House pushed business to the      presidential adviser's former firm to sell the health-care      law.       Rewind to 2009. The fight over ObamaCare is raging, and a      few news outlets report that something looks ethically rotten      in the White House. An outside group funded by industry is      paying the former firm of senior presidential adviser David      Axelrod to run ads in favor of the bill. That firm, AKPD      Message and Media, still owes Mr. Axelrod money and employs      his son.       The story quickly died, but emails recently released by the      House Energy and Commerce Committee ought to resurrect it.      The emails suggest the White House was intimately involved      both in creating this lobby and hiring Mr. Axelrod's firm--     which is as big an ethical no-no as it gets.       Mr. Axelrod--who left the White House last year--started      AKPD in 1985. The firm earned millions helping run Barack      Obama's 2008 campaign. Mr. Axelrod moved to the White House      in 2009 and agreed to have AKPD buy him out for $2 million.      But AKPD chose to pay Mr. Axelrod in annual installments--     even as he worked in the West Wing. This agreement somehow      passed muster with the Office of Government Ethics, though      the situation at the very least should have walled off AKPD      from working on White-House priorities.       It didn't. The White House and industry were working hand-     in-glove to pass ObamaCare in 2009, and among the vehicles      supplying ad support was an outfit named Healthy Economy Now      (HEN). News stories at the time described this as a      ``coalition'' that included the Pharmaceutical Research and      Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), the American Medical      Association, and labor groups--suggesting these entities had      started and controlled it.       House emails show HEN was in fact born at an April 15, 2009      meeting arranged by then-White House aide Jim Messina and a      chief of staff for Democratic Sen. Max Baucus. The two      politicos met at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee      (DSCC) and invited representatives of business and labor.       A Service Employees International Union attendee sent an      email to colleagues noting she'd been invited by the Baucus      staffer, explaining: ``Also present was Jim Messina. . . .      They basically want to see adds linking HC reform to the      economy . . . there were not a lot of details, but we were      told that we would be getting a phone call. Well that call      came today.''       The call was from Nick Baldick, a Democratic consultant who      had worked on the Obama campaign and for the DSCC. Mr.      Baldick started HEN. The only job of PhRMA and others was to      fund it.       Meanwhile, Mr. Axelrod's old firm was hired to run the ads      promoting ObamaCare. At the time, a HEN spokesman said HEN      had done the hiring. But the emails suggest otherwise. In      email after email, the contributors to HEN refer to four men      as the ``White House'' team running health care. They      included John Del Cecato and Larry Grisolano (partners at      AKPD), as well as Andy Grossman (who once ran the DSCC) and      Erik Smith, who had been a paid adviser to the Obama      presidential campaign.       In one email, PhRMA consultant Steve McMahon calls these      four the ``WH-designated folks.'' He explains to colleagues      that Messrs. Grossman, Grisolano and Del Cecato ``are very      close to Axelrod,'' and that ``they have been put in charge      of the campaign to pass health reform.'' Ron Pollack, whose      Families USA was part of the HEN coalition, explained to      colleagues that ``the team that is working with the White      House on health-care reform. . . . [Grossman, Smith, Del      Cecato, Grisolano] . . . would like to get together with      us.'' This would provide ``guidance from the White House      about their messaging.''       According to White House visitor logs, Mr. Smith had 28      appointments scheduled between May and August--17 made      through Mr. Messina or his assistant. Mr. Grossman appears in      the logs at least 19 times. Messrs. Del Cecato and Grisolano      of AKPD also visited in the spring and summer, at least twice      with Mr. Axelrod, who was deep in the health-care fight.       A 2009 PhRMA memo also makes clear that AKPD had been      chosen before PhRMA joined HEN. It's also clear that some      contributors didn't like the conflict of interest. When, in      July 2009, a media outlet prepared to report AKPD's hiring, a      PhRMA participant said: ``This is a big problem.'' Mr.      Baldick advises: ``just say, AKPD is not working for PhRMA.''      AKPD and another firm, GMMB, would handle $12 million in ad      business from HEN and work for a successor 501(c)4.       A basic rule of White House ethics is to avoid even the      appearance of self-dealing or nepotism. If Mr. Axelrod or his      West Wing chums pushed political business toward Mr.      Axelrod's former firm, they contributed to his son's salary      as well as to the ability of the firm to pay Mr. Axelrod what      it still owed him. Could you imagine the press frenzy if Karl      Rove had done the same after he joined the White House?       Messrs. Axelrod and Messina are now in Chicago running Mr.      Obama's campaign. Mr. Axelrod, the White House and a partner      for AKPD didn't respond to requests for comment on their role      in HEN, the tapping of Mr. Baldick, and the redolent hiring      of AKPD. Until the White House explains all this, voters can      fairly conclude that the President's political team took      their Chicago brand of ethics into the White House.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I know my other colleagues are waiting to speak, but last month when we voted down this amendment to allow drug reimportation from pharmacies that are accredited by both the Canadian and American Governments, my statement was, and I will repeat it:       In a normal world, this would probably require a voice      vote. But what we are about to see is the incredible      influence of the special interests, particularly PhRMA, here      in Washington.       What you are about to see [as I predicted just before the      vote] is the reason for the cynicism the American people have      about the way we do business in Washington. PhRMA--one of the      most powerful lobbies in Washington--will exert its influence      again at the expense of average low-income Americans who      will, again, have to choose between medication and eating.  In response the Senator from New Jersey said, in opposition to my amendment:       It is not the special interests that have caused the Senate      countless times to reject this policy. . . . .
