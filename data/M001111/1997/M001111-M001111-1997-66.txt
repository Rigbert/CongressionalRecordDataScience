 President, on September 3, during floor deliberations the senior Senator from Washington presented a story of a most tragic situation on the Yakama Indian Reservation in his call for support of an appropriations rider that would require tribal governments to relinquish their right to sovereign immunity in order to receive Federal funding.  In 1994, a tragic accident involving a tribal police officer en route to the scene of an ensuing robbery resulted in the death of 18-year-old Jered Gamache. Before I proceed, I want to express my deepest sympathies to the Gamache family for this devastating loss. As a mother of two, I find it almost unbearable to contemplate such a loss. It is always painful to lose a loved one, but the loss of a child is something no parent should have to face.  The issues involved here are very controversial and everyone involved has strong views. In the interest of airing views from all sides regarding section 120 of the Interior appropriations bill, I have agreed to submit a statement on behalf of the Yakama Indian Nation in response to the chairman's comments. I ask that the statement from the Yakama Indian Nation be printed in the Record.  The statement follows: Yakama Indian Nation Astonished by Gorton Floor Statement Wherein He  Made Analogy of Tribal Police Officer Acting Within Her Scope of Duty           and New York Cops Who Brutalized a Haitian Immigrant       Toppenish, Washington.--The Yakama Indian Nation today      responded with both amazement and sadness to statements made      Wednesday on the Senate floor by Senator Slade Gorton (R-     Wash.), wherein the Senator made an analogy of a 1994      accidental vehicular death involving a Tribal police officer      responding to an emergency call (regarding an urgent armed      robbery in progress), to the intentional brutal beating and      sodomization recently inflicted by New York City policemen      against Haitian immigrant Abner Louima.       In what appears to be an attempt to justify a far-reaching      amendment he has inserted into an appropriations bill that      would eradicate tribal sovereign immunity, the senior Senator      from Washington has chosen to exploit the victimization of      Abner Louima and a tragic car accident that occurred on our      reservation.       The facts of the case cited by Gorton should be brought to      light as should the point that a close associate of the      Senator, Yakima County Prosecutor, Jeff Sullivan, declined to      pursue a criminal prosecution (for ``disregarding the safety      of others'') against the tribal police officer involved in      the accident.       On October 25, 1994, Tiffany Martin, a fully trained police      officer of the Yakama Indian Nation responded to an emergency      call for assistance from the Yakama County Sheriff's office.      There was a burglary in progress at a convenience store and      the closer police force in the city of Wapato had not      responded. Officer Martin proceeded in her police vehicle      northbound on Route 97 with both sirens and overhead flashers      on. During her response a second call came in indicating that      gun shots had been fired and the situation was clearly quite      urgent. As the officer approached a particular intersection,      where she initially had a green light, she slowed her vehicle      down (she estimates to between     30 and 35 miles per hour), noticing a van stopped at the      intersection with its turn, signal on. Apparently next to the      van and hidden from the officer's line of sight was another      vehicle. Confirming that the stopped vehicle was aware of her      presence, she accelerated and went through the intersection      as the light turned yellow and then red. The van remained      stopped but the vehicle next it, being driven by 18 year old      Jered Gamache went forward and his vehicle and the police      care collided. Gamache died as a result of injuries suffered      in the collision. The tribal police force has expressed great      remorse to the Gamache family and the officer herself has      suffered tremendously and emotionally as a result of the      accident.       While we have the greatest sympathy for the family of Jered      Gamache and can understand their pain we can not understand      how a member of the United States Senate could suggest that      this accident is somehow analogous to the celebrated Louima      beating in New York. Senator Gorton has stated that since Mr.      Louima is going to be suing New York City for millions of      dollars so too should the Gamache family be able to sue the      Yakama Nation for a similar amount. With all due respect,      this is not an analogy worthy of a former state Attorney      General. The New York policemen who beat Louima broke the      law. Our tribal police officer was acting within her scope of      duty and following routine procedures. While it is tragic,      there are unfortunately a large number of innocent bystanders      all across this country who are accidentally hurt or killed      by law enforcement officers discharging their duties. The      fact remains that police officers and the governments they      work for are protected by a sovereign immunity provided they      have acted within the line of duty in a non-negligent manner.      Would the Senator characterize, as he did on the floor, that      a claim against, say, a King County, Washington policeman      involved in an accidental vehicular death as ``identical or      similar'' to the claim Mr. Louima will be pursuing against      New York?       Contrary to the Senator's assertions, the Gamache family      has not been denied legal recourse due to tribal sovereign      immunity. In fact, the Gamache family has a filed civil suit      which is currently pending in the Eastern District Federal      Court of Washington state, trial is set for December 8, 1997.      The Gamache family is pursuing this claim under the Federal      Tort Claims Act (28 USC 2671), which is the same statute      under which they would pursue a claim if any other federal      law enforcement official (FBI, National Park Service ranger,      etc.) has been involved in their son's death. The Federal      Tort Claims Act (FTCA) is the statute involved as the Yakama      Nation was operating its tribal police department under a      contract with the Interior Department pursuant to the Indian      Self-Determination Act and the tribal police officer was      acting as a federal agent. United States District Judge Fred      Van Sickle will determine whether the officer involved showed      contributory negligence which led to the accident and will      further determine whether she was properly acting within the      scope of her duty. The standards for these terms under FTCA      are the standards as they exist within Washington state law.      Not only are the Gamache's being given legal recourse, but it      is taking place in the ``neutral'' federal court which the      Senator wants to direct all cases coming from Indian      reservations.       Perhaps this is a good example of the dangers of making law      based on anecdotal situations, particularly when the facts      have not been properly brought to light.                          ____________________
