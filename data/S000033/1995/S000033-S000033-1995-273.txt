 Chairman, the American people are angry and frustrated about the Congress and its lack of responsiveness to their needs. The rich get richer, the poor get poorer, and the middle class continues to shrink. Congress does not act and the people are angry.  The standard of living of the average American continues to go down, down, down, and we continue to lose huge numbers of decent-paying jobs to desperate third-world countries. Congress does not act and the people are angry.  The United States today is the only major industrialized Nation on Earth without a national health care system. Congress does not act and the people are angry.  What are term limits going to do about any of this? Nothing, except perhaps make a bad situation worse. Mr. Chairman, the problem with American politics is not that we cannot force out every Member of Congress every 6 years. That is not the problem.  The problem is that the U.S. Congress today is dominated by big money interests, and that this institution works primarily for the wealthy and the powerful, and not the ordinary American. That is the problem, and all of the term limits in the world are not going to change that reality.  Mr. Chairman, if we are going to make the Congress responsive to ordinary Americans, we need campaign finance reform, not term limits. We need to stop millionaires from buying their own seats, and end the absurdity of 20 percent of the Members of Congress being millionaires themselves.  We need to stop corporations from putting huge amounts of campaign contributions into political parties as soft money. We need to stop powerful interests like the insurance companies from buying the air waves to prevent real health care reform.  Mr. Chairman, let us pass campaign finance reform, not term limits, and return power back to ordinary Americans.
