Madam Speaker, I rise today for the weary Americans who are working harder than they ever have but still find themselves falling behind. I rise today for Americans all across this country and especially those in my home State of Georgia who are hurting. I rise for those whose wallets get thinner each time they go to the gas station.  I rise for those who must decide between $4 a gallon gasoline or food for their family, those who must decide between $4 a gallon gasoline or paying the mortgage. Americans will continue to make these choices until we decide enough is enough. Let's change our energy policy.                          ____________________
