 Mr. Speaker, let's be clear--everyone in this body wants to end this government shutdown. We are all aware of the significant impacts the shutdown is having around the country; and I am pleased that, today, both sides have finally come to the table, and hopefully we will reach a compromise here in the next day or so. Today, we are here to consider a solution that aims to ease the urgent and substantial impacts to Indian Country.  House Joint Resolution 80, the American Indian and Alaska Native Health, Education, and Safety Act, provides immediate funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Bureau of Indian Education, and Indian Health Services. As a member of the House Appropriations Interior and the Environment Subcommittee, I am well aware that Indian Country was already experiencing significant challenges before the shutdown as it adjusted to reduced spending levels. Now, with the Federal Government shutdown, Native American tribes across the Nation are facing even more uncertainty. These tribes are now being confronted with different decisions about which services they can continue to provide without government resources. Just a few examples: tribal programs for home health care for the elderly and disabled, bus service for rural areas, and infrastructure projects that were suspended indefinitely. I believe we must take action and reopen these critical government operations throughout Indian Country.  I am thankful that my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and the House Republican leadership share my belief. Specifically, I want to thank my good friend from Idaho, Mike Simpson, for bringing this bill to the floor and for his terrific leadership as chairman of House Appropriations Interior and the Environment Subcommittee.  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important bill on behalf of all Americans in Indian Country. Let's pass this bill and reach an agreement to get our entire government back to work for the American people.
