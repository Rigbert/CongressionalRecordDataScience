I am going to spend a few minutes today--and I believe I am going to be joined at various times by a number of colleagues--to talk about the important role these two storied pieces of legislation have played in creating a legacy of protection and access to America's treasures.

It passed 73 to 12 in the Senate and 373 to 1 in the other body.
