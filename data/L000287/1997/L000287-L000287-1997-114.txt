Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing legislation that would provide permanent residency to John Edward Armstrong Denney.  John Denney currently is a citizen of Australia. John was abandoned by his parents in the hospital and was raised in foster care. Eventually, John found himself in the care of Mrs. Armstrong, a widow who took in foster children for a living. Mrs. Armstrong was the only mother John had, and she died in 1990. In 1989, John had his name changed to John Edward Armstrong in honor of his relationship with Mrs. Armstrong. Since her death, John has had no relatives in Australia.  In 1992, John came to Atlanta, GA, at the invitation of a friend from Australia who had married an American citizen. During his visit, John was an active member in the church and became very close with the Denney family. After a year, John's visa expired and he returned to Australia. John returned to the United States a year later, during which time he spent a great deal of time with the Denney family. He is close to Kristina, the youngest member of the Denney family, who suffers from very poor health. On February 23, 1995, the Denney family adopted John. On March 3, John returned to Australia.  John has no family in Australia. The Denney family, especially 5-year-old Kristina, want John to join his adopted family in America. U.S. immigration laws offer no help for John in his attempt to join the first family he has ever known. My legislation will allow John Edward Armstrong Denney to be reunited with that family permanently, by granting him permanent status as a U.S. resident. I look forward to working with my colleagues to help John rejoin his family and find a home.                          ____________________
