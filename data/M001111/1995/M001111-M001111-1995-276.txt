 President, I say to Members of the Senate, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee has just a few minutes ago concluded its testimony from Dr. Foster, who is the nominee for Surgeon General. I wanted to take this opportunity to personally thank Senator Kassebaum, chair of that committee, for doing an outstanding job of giving Dr. Foster the opportunity to present himself to the Senate and to the United States of America. I felt that the hearing was very fair and very well conducted by both Senator Kassebaum and all the members of the committee.  I also wanted to take this opportunity to commend Dr. Foster who, for the last several months, has been a person we have only known as a cardboard cutout; who, in the last day and a half has, I believe, really presented a very strong image to this country of a man who is caring, who is compassionate, and who can be a very forthright Surgeon General, to speak to the issues of the day that are of concern to so many of us; who will be a person, I believe, who will speak to women's health care issues in a way that needs to be done in this country today; who will speak to the issue of teen pregnancy and provide leadership; and a man who I think is a person who we can all look up to in terms of being a model public servant; who understands that we cannot just sit in our houses and close our blinds and shut our doors, but we need to personally get out and work with young kids today and be a personal role model for all of them.  I think he has done an outstanding job of answering all the questions that have been brought to him, and I believe that both Dr. Foster and the committee deserve a debt of gratitude from the Senate.  I look forward to having an expeditious vote on his nomination and to being allowed, as a U.S. Senator, to vote up or down on his nomination very soon on the floor of the Senate.  I thank the Chair and yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.
