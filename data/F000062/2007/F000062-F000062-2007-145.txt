 This bill is known by everybody in this body, and everyone in this body should know there is a need. We believe we have the votes in the House to pass the bill as well if it is a stand-alone bill, a 5-year pilot that enables farmers to hire workers.  Let me say one other thing. There is a myth out there that anybody can do agricultural labor. If you stand by a freeway and watch people pick lettuce, you will see precision movements, you will see an organized crew, you will see they are trained in how to do it, and you will also see it is backbreaking labor that Americans will not do.  There is no industry in the United States that faces the crisis agriculture does right now, I say to Senator Boxer. She knows that. I know that. We know what is happening to our farms and growers. Whether they operate 50,000 acres or 50 acres, it is the same problem. It takes, in California, 40,000 workers to harvest grapes. They are grown in four counties. It takes 40,000 workers to harvest 1 crop.  Does the Senator from Texas want me to yield?
