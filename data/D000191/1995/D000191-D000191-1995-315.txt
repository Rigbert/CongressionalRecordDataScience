 I think these are an extraordinary couple of days in the history of this republic. The House of Representatives and the Senate did stop the bailout of Mexico or at least indicated that they were not willing to go along readily. That was great. But now we have seen an end run around the Congress of the United States with the creative interpretation of a statute and another way to send $40 billion out the back door that Congress would not let go out the front door. Yet again the Federal Reserve is going to meet tomorrow to try and visit another catastrophe on the American people, to raise interest rates, to banish the threat of inflation that does not exist.                              {time}  2130  There is a 30 year low in terms of inflation statistics to drive up unemployment. That is the policy of the Federal Reserve.  Did this Congress authorize the Federal Reserve to drive up unemployment? Are those the underlying laws and statutes in the United States, and is that the authority which extended to the Federal Reserve: You are charged with driving up unemployment because we do not want to see wages go up, we don't want people to make a better standard of living?  That is not what I got elected to do. I believe there are some extraordinary questions here, and they all seem to come back to the same very small influential group, the Federal Reserve, a few people on Wall Street and some people in the administration, some of whom used to work on Wall Street very recently, earning up to $26 million a year advising their company to invest $5.2 billion in Mexico, and now want to bail out Mexico.  These are extraordinary times, and the people should be very attentive to what is going on here.
