Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), my friend, the majority leader.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I am thankful that he is back with us, but at times I wish he weren't as healthy as he is. I am just joking.  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30 p.m.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning hour and noon for legislative business.  On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes are expected no later than 3 p.m.  On Friday, no votes are expected in the House.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow.  In addition, the House will consider several bills aimed at giving Americans more affordable healthcare choices:  First, the Protect Medical Innovation Act, sponsored by Representative Erik Paulsen. This bill would permanently repeal ObamaCare's burdensome medical device tax. Doing so will create jobs, promote research, and allow for innovation that could lead to the next generation of lifesaving medical technologies;  Next, the Increasing Access to Lower Premium Plans and Expanding Health Savings Accounts Act, sponsored by Representative Peter Roskam. This package would expand access to lower cost healthcare options, encourage healthcare savings, and put a 2-year delay on ObamaCare's health insurance tax, which drives up costs of insurance for almost every American;  Finally, the Restoring Access to Medication and Modernizing Health Savings Accounts Act, sponsored by Representative Lynn Jenkins. This bill would transform and modernize health savings accounts and allow for more innovation in healthcare delivery.  I look forward to the House passing all three of these critical bills without delay.  Mr. Speaker, we also hope to vote on the conference report to accompany H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act. =========================== NOTE ===========================     July 19, 2018, on page H6572, the following appeared: Mr. Speaker, we also hope to vote on the conference report to accompany H.R. 2810, the National Defense Authorization Act.    The online version has been corrected to read: Mr. Speaker, we also hope to vote on the conference report to accompany H.R. 5515, the National Defense Authorization Act. ========================= END NOTE =========================   This House is committed to rebuilding our military and ensuring our   brave men and women in uniform have the equipment and training they              need to successfully carry out their mission.  I want to thank the Armed Services Committee for their hard work on this bill, especially their chairman, Mac Thornberry, and I look forward to another big bipartisan vote.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible in the House. As soon as our schedule is finalized, I will be sure to inform all Members.
