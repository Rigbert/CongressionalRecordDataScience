 In the end, there wasn't really a philosophical problem here. The question was, How can we pull together these disparate pieces into one mosaic that actually had a chance to get somewhere?  I want to say to Senator Boxer, in particular, that this has been one of the most exhilarating and satisfying experiences I have had in the time that I have been in the Senate. I never would have predicted 20-some-odd years ago that I would be having it with Barbara Boxer. But this shows, in my opinion--I know Senator Inhofe agrees--the Senate is at its best when people can identify common interests and work together to get a positive result for the country.  I want to say to both of these great colleagues how much I appreciate their extraordinary work, particularly Senator Boxer because we were such opposites in almost every way. What actual fun it was to get to know her better and to work on this together. She has a year left. Maybe we can find something else. Congratulations to both of you on an extraordinary accomplishment for the American people.
