President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 446       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse Education, Expansion,      and Development Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds as follows:       (1) While the Nurse Reinvestment Act (Public Law 107-205)      helped to increase applications to schools of nursing by 125      percent, schools of nursing have been unable to accommodate      the influx of interested students because they have an      insufficient number of nurse educators. It is estimated      that--       (A) in the 2006-2007 school year--       (i) 66.6 percent of schools of nursing had from 1 to 18      vacant faculty positions; and       (ii) an additional 16.7 percent of schools of nursing      needed additional faculty, but lacked the resources needed to      add more positions; and       (B) 41,683 eligible candidates were denied admission to      schools of nursing in 2005, primarily due to an insufficient      number of faculty members.       (2) A growing number of nurses with doctoral degrees are      choosing careers outside of education. Over the last few      years, 22.5 percent of doctoral nursing graduates reported      seeking employment outside the education profession.       (3) In 2006 the average age of nurse faculty at retirement      is 63.1 years. With the average age of doctorally-prepared      nurse faculty at 54.7 years in 2005, a wave of retirements is      expected within the next 10 years.       (4) Master's and doctoral programs in nursing are not      producing a large enough pool of potential nurse educators to      meet the projected demand for nurses over the next 10 years.      While graduations from master's and doctoral programs in      nursing rose by 12.8 percent (or 1,369 graduates) and 13.1      percent (or 56 graduates), respectively, in the 2005-2006      school year, projections still demonstrate a shortage of      nurse faculty. Given current trends, there will be at least      2,616 unfilled faculty positions in 2012.       (5) According to the February 2004 Monthly Labor Review of      the Bureau of Labor Statistics, more than 1,000,000 new and      replacement nurses will be needed by 2012.     SEC. 3.
