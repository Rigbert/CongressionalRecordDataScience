 President, I want to take time to comment on the resolution I am introducing today which designates the month of November 2005 as the ``Month of Global Health.''  Today we live in a global community where all nations both benefit from those countries that prosper, and suffer with those that do not. The Month of Global Health is a great opportunity to increase awareness of the pressing global health crisis that threatens our own public health and that of all nations around the world.  I believe this resolution is important and draws attention to the needs of a growing population of children in the developing world that are living without proper health care and the essential nutrients they need to survive. The resolution also highlights the necessary steps that must be taken to increase child survival rates in developing countries.  Child survival is one of the key elements to addressing global health. As a nation, there is much more we can do to assist developing nations in their effort to increase child survival rates. We must work on a global scale to avert the millions of unnecessary deaths among children caused each year from preventable diseases.  This resolution reaffirms our commitment to the children of the world and sends a message that child survival is a fundamental component in our efforts to improve global health.
