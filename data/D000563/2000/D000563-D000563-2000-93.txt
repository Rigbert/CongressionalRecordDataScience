President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation.  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today.  October 12, 1999:  Michael S. Chambers, 43, Seattle, WA;  Rueben M. Clark, 22, Memphis, TN;  Kenneth Ditter, 30, Philadelphia, PA;  Charles Guerra, 28, Houston, TX;  Joel Holbrook, 33, Kansas City, MO;  Walton Jerry Holmes, 68, Euless, TX;  J.C. Jones, 48, Miami-Dade County, FL;  Gregory Mabrey, 27, Baltimore, MD;  Khidetra S. McBride, 22, Memphis, TN;  Jorge Millan, 40, Miami-Dade County, FL;  John Ray, 23, Fort Wayne, IN;  Michael Shelby, 34, Detroit, MI;  Nicholas Singleton, 19, New Orleans, LA;  Honore Sissoko, 46, Philadelphia, PA;  George Thomas, 19, St. Louis, MO; and  Duane G. Weigelt, 69, St. Paul, MN.  One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned, 19-year-old Nicholas Singleton of New Orleans, was shot and killed one year ago today by a 19-year-old friend while the two were having an argument.  We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.
