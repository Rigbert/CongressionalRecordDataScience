And I assume these oil and gas companies, in leasing this land, believe it is likely to have oil and gas.  So I ask you, if they have paid their money to lease Federal lands, 68 million acres--half of it offshore, half of it onshore--and another 23 million acres in Alaska, where is this mother load of oil you are so certain we are holding back from these oil and gas companies that would bring us the oil instantaneously and bring down gas prices?
