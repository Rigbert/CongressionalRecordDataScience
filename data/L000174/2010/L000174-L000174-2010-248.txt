President, I will support this nominee, but I should mention again that Senate Republicans have not allowed us to vote on a judicial nominee for almost 2 weeks.  By this date in George W. Bush's Presidency, the Senate had confirmed 52 Federal circuit and district court judges. As of today, we had only been allowed only 20 by the Senate Republicans. Counting the recent vote on Gloria M. Navarro this brings us just up to 21 confirmations.  There are nearly two dozen additional nominations stalled. It should not take 2 weeks to try to get through these secret holds. When we have people who are confirmed unanimously in the committee, then confirmed unanimously on the floor, it is unconscionable to hold them up week after week after week.
