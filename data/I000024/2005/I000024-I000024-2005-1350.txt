President, I rise today, as an experienced pilot over age 60, along with my colleagues, Senator Stevens and Senator Burns, to introduce a bill that will help end age discrimination among airline pilots. I also want to thank my colleague in the other chamber, Congressman Jim Gibbons, for his leadership on this issue and for introducing the companion version of this bill.  This bill will abolish the Federal Aviation Administration's Age 60 Rule-the regulation that for more than 40 years has forced the retirement of airline pilots the day they turn 60 and replace it with a rational plan that ties the commercial pilot retirement age to the Social Security retirement age currently 65.  Most nations have abolished mandatory age 60 retirement rules.
