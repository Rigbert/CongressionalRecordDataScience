President, at the heart of the amendments being offered by Senators Cotton and Kennedy is an effort to provide notification to crime victims. I spoke to this early this morning, and I think it bears repeating.  It is interesting to note that they are arguing that their amendments are necessary for the sake of crime victims. At the same time, virtually every leading organization in America representing crime victims supports our bill and opposes the amendment being offered by Senators Cotton and Kennedy. Why do they oppose it? Because we already have a law.
