President, as I have mentioned a few times over the last few days, and as anyone watching the horrible display here on the floor last night knows, those opposing the confirmation of William Pryor to the Eleventh Circuit have been subjected to a despicable smear. Supporters of the nomination have turned reality on its head. They accuse us of imposing a religious test, but it was a Republican supporter of the nomination who was the only Senator to ask Mr. Pryor what his religion was and to use what they now term a code phrase ``deeply held religious beliefs.''  The scurrilous accusations against opponents of the nomination must be popular with the political gurus at the White House. It has been echoed in recent days by the Committee for Justice, a group closely associated with the President and his family, headed by the first President Bush's White House counsel. I know about the bias against immigrants and against Catholics. That was real discrimination. What is being spread this week is a falsehood uttered for partisan political purposes.  Those who know what real religious discrimination is have spoken out against the advertising campaign. Earlier today I mentioned the members of the Interfaith Alliance, who spoke so eloquently against this sort of smear. Now I am pleased to recognize the Anti-Defamation League, so well known and well respected for their work against religious bigotry, for speaking out against the Committee for Justice's slurs. Abraham H. Foxman, the National Director of the ADL, and Glen A. Tobias, its National Chairman, have written to the head of the Committee for Justice, Mr. Boyden Gray, to object to his advertisements. They explain to Mr. Gray, that, ``[t]o promote the view that Mr. Pryor's opponents object to his Catholic religious beliefs, rather than his views as expressed in his prolific legal writings and speeches and his answers to questions at his Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings, needlessly and wrongfully injects religion into the Senate's `advise and consent' role in the nomination process.''  I could not agree more. I appreciate that the ADL has added its voice to those trying to show the Committee for Justice the error of its ways. I ask unanimous consent the ADL's letter to Mr. Gray be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                    July 30, 2003.     C. Boyden Gray, Esq.     Chairman, The Committee for Justice, Wilmer, Cutler &          Pickering, Washington, DC 20037.       Dear Mr. Gray: On behalf of the Anti-Defamation League      (ADL), we write to strongly object to the recent advertising      campaign launched by the Committee for Justice (CFJ) that      harshly criticizes opponents of judicial nominee William      Pryor for ``playing politics with religion.'' These      misleading ads claim that ``some in the U.S. Senate are      attacking Bill Pryor for having `deeply held' Catholic      beliefs to prevent him from becoming a federal judge'' and      graphically illustrate the assertion with a picture of a sign      hanging on the door to ``Judicial Chambers'' that reads,      ``Catholics need not apply.''       We are unaware of any Senator who has attacked Mr. Pryor      ``for having `deeply held' Catholic beliefs.'' To promote the      view that Mr. Pryor's opponents object to his Catholic      religious beliefs, rather than his views as expressed in his      prolific legal writings and speeches and his answers to      questions at his Judiciary Committee confirmation hearings,      needlessly and wrongfully injects religion into the Senate's      ``advise and consent'' role in the nomination process.       ADL does not as a practice endorse or oppose nominees to      the bench. However, because Mr. Pryor has written and spoken      so prolifically and so forcefully as an advocate on several      issues of deep concern, we believe his positions merit close      scrutiny by the Senate. Our objections to this nomination      stem from Mr. Pryor's well-documented views, not his      religious beliefs.       We believe that CFJ's ad campaign is misleading and      inflammatory. We urge you to reconsider further promotion of      this effort.           Sincerely,                                                   Glen A. Tobias,                                                National Chairman.                                                Abraham H. Foxman,                                                National Director.
