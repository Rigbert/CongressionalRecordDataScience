Speaker, me, too.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, it will be quite interesting to watch.  I know my struggles. I hope the gentleman doesn't have the same struggles, but I will make this promise to the gentleman: When we agree, I will be there.  We do not have differences because we have parties; we have parties because we have differences.  The gentleman's challenge is he continues to bring up the wall. The question would be, then: Does border security work? Having a wall a part of that security, does it help?  Coming from a State that borders Mexico, we put a wall, which the gentleman had voted for, down in San Diego. You know what the results were? A 92 percent drop in illegals coming across. We built a wall in Tucson, down 90 percent; El Paso, 95 percent.  At one time, El Paso was one of the most dangerous cities in America. Now, today, it is one of the safest, and it has been able to live with that.  Yuma, down 95 percent.  So the question is: What is the plan? The plan and the hope, yes, we will take a bill up. But my hope was that, in the spirit of the season, it wouldn't be the gentleman's way or no way, that he would break from this tradition that Republicans have to pass everything on their own.  Look, I put a bill in that I fully fund the wall at $25 billion. I know I am not going to get that. Am I going to run away and say, then, I am going to vote for nothing? No, because that is not the way our government works.  You see, we have to have compromise because of the structure. And I don't want to have a plan where I am going to sit up here as majority leader and say, oh, I passed all the bills, but none of them became law.  I want to make law. I want to solve the problem.  Listen, this is not the time to continue to go through and argue. This is the time to solve the problems. Look, the campaign is over.
