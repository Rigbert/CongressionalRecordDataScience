 President, I rise to speak on the nomination of Caitlin Halligan to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.  As the first woman to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee--a committee on which I have served for 18 years--it is my great pleasure to speak in support of Ms. Halligan, who has excelled at every turn during her distinguished legal career.  She graduated cum laude from Princeton University in 1988. She received her law degree, magna cum laude, from Georgetown University Law Center, where she was managing editor of the Georgetown Law Journal and inducted into the Order of the Coif.  She began her legal career with a clerkship with Judge Patricia Wald on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit--the first woman to serve on that Court.  She then spent a year in private practice at the Washington, DC firm, Wiley, Rein, and Fielding, followed by a clerkship with Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.  After another year in private practice, Ms. Halligan began work in the office of the Attorney General of the State of New York, first as Chief of the Internet Bureau.  She rose to become Solicitor General of the State of New York, the State's top appellate lawyer. She served in that role from 2001 through 2007.  During nearly all of Ms. Halligan's time as Solicitor General, George Pataki--a Republican--was Governor. Her job was to represent the State of New York zealously, and by all accounts she did so with skill and dignity.  Judith Kaye, the former Chief Judge of New York's highest court, writes on behalf of the Court's entire bench that ``it was invariably a treat'' to have Ms. Halligan argue before the Court.  In fact, the National Association of Attorneys General awarded Ms. Halligan the ``Best Brief Award'' for five consecutive years, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005.  Ms. Halligan left the Solicitor General post in 2007 to become the head of the appellate practice at the prestigious New York law firm, Weil, Gotshal, and Manges.  She has now returned to public service as the General Counsel of the New York County District Attorney's Office--one of the largest prosecutor's offices in the country.  Over the course of her distinguished career, Halligan has served as counsel for a party or amicus in the Supreme Court more than 45 times.  She has argued in the Supreme Court herself in five cases, most recently in March of this year. She also has argued or participated in numerous other cases before State and Federal appellate courts, including the New York Court of Appeals and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.  In short, Ms. Halligan is an accomplished woman whose sterling qualifications for the bench are unassailable.  Ms. Halligan was first nominated more than 14 months ago. She was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee nearly 9 months ago. She has been waiting for an up-or-down vote on the floor ever since.  It is an unfortunate sign of the times that my colleagues on the other side have held up her confirmation.  I understand that the National Rifle Association is opposed to Ms. Halligan's confirmation.  Behind the NRA's opposition is the fact that, while she was New York's Solicitor General, the State of New York pursued public nuisance litigation against gun manufacturers.  Think about that--any time a person represents a State or local government, or the Federal Government, and takes a controversial position, that may jeopardize a later confirmation vote.  That is not fair. A government lawyer's job is to pursue the government's interest vigorously and to do justice.  Ms. Halligan was appointed by the Attorney General to represent the State of New York, while the State had a Republican Governor, George Pataki. Her job was to advance New York's interest, and she did so with vigor. She should not be penalized for it.  Senator Sessions made this point when the Senate was considering Judge Kavanaugh's nomination. He said that ``[s]uggesting that service in an elective branch of Government somehow tarnishes a lawyer's reputation would be a terrible message for this body to send to the legal community and to all citizens.''  I couldn't agree more.  My Republican colleagues might also say that the D.C. Circuit's caseload does not support another judge, but they have short memories.  There are now three vacancies on the D.C. Circuit. That means that Ms. Halligan would only fill the ninth seat, out of 11 on the Court. Two seats would remain vacant.  However, my colleagues were not so concerned about this issue when President Bush's appointees were before the Senate. In fact, my Republican colleagues supported filling the 10th seat on the Court twice, and the 11th seat once.  I will conclude by simply saying that Ms. Halligan is a woman with sterling credentials, an exemplary record, and a wealth of experience.  She is President Obama's first and only nominee to the D.C. Circuit. She should be confirmed.          Nominations of Edgardo Ramos and Andrew Carter, SDNY
