 Under current law, trucks weighing as much as 100,000 pounds are allowed to travel on Interstate 95 from Maine's border with New Hampshire to Augusta, our capital city located. At Augusta, trucks weighing more than 80,000 pounds are forced off Interstate 95, which proceeds for another 200 miles through the northern half of the State, and on to smaller roads that pass through cities, towns, and villages.  Trucks weighing up to 100,000 pounds are permitted on interstate highways in New Hampshire, Massachusetts, and New York as well as the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec. The weight limit disparity on various segments of Maine's Interstate Highway System forces trucks traveling to and from destinations in these States and provinces to use Maine's State and local roads. Consequently, many Maine communities along the Interstate see substantially more truck traffic than would otherwise be the case if the weight limit were 100,000 pounds for all of Maine's Interstate highways.  The problem Maine faces because of the disparity in truck weight limits is perhaps most pronounced in our State capital. Augusta is the Maine Turnpike's northern terminus where heavy trucks that are prohibited from traveling along the northern segment of Interstate 95 enter and exit the turnpike. The high number of trucks that must traverse Augusta's local roads creates a severe hazard for those who live and work in as well as visit the city.  It is estimated that the truck weight disparity sends 310 vehicles in excess of 80,000 pounds through Augusta everyday. These vehicles, which are often carrying hazardous materials, must pass through the Cony Circle, one of the State's most dangerous traffic circles and the scene of 130 accidents per year. The fact that the circle is named for the twelve hundred student high school that it abuts adds to the severity of the problem.  A uniform truck weight limit of 100,000 pounds on Maine's interstate highways would reduce the highway miles and travel times necessary to transport freight through Maine, resulting in economic and environmental benefits. Moreover, Maine's extensive network of State and local roads will be better preserved without the wear and tear of heavy truck traffic. Most importantly, however, a uniform truck weight limit will keep trucks on the interstate where they belong rather than on roads and highways that pass through Maine's cities, towns, and neighborhoods.  The legislation that Senator Snowe and I are introducing addresses the safety issues we face in Maine because of the disparities in truck weight limits. The legislation directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish a commercial truck safety pilot program in Maine. Under the pilot program, the truck weight limit on all Maine highways that are part of the interstate highway system would be set at 100,000 pounds for three years. During the waiver period, the Secretary would study the impacts of the pilot program on safety, and would receive the input of a panel that would include State officials, safety organizations, municipalities, and the commercial trucking industry. The waiver would become permanent if the panel determined that motorists were safer as a result of a uniform truck weight limit on Maine's Interstate highway system.  Maine's citizens and motorists are needlessly at risk because too many heavy trucks are forced off the interstate and on to local roads. The legislation Senator Snowe and I are introducing is not an attempt to roll backweight standards but rather a commonsense approach to a severe safety problem in my State. I hope my colleagues will support passage of this important legislation.                                 ______                                       By
