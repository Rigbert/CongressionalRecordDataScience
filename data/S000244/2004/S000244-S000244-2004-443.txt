Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, first of all, this bill has nothing to do with weight loss products, whether they are food supplements or drugs that require a prescription or drugs that are sold over the counter. It only deals with food that makes people increase their weight so that they become obese and have all of the medical problems related to obesity.  Now, on page 5 of the bill, ``Qualified Product'' is defined in section 201(f) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act; and this section of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act reads as follows: ``The term food means when an article is used for food or drink for man or other animals, chewing gum and articles used for components of any such article.''  So all of what the gentlewoman from Texas complains about is not covered in this bill because it is not a qualified product as defined by the bill.  And I will not yield to the gentlewoman. She has been up twice to try to explain what she is trying to do. She is just plain wrong.  And, secondly, there is one other thing that I think is very relevant, and this comes from the black and white provisions of her own amendment as in the Congressional Record. It talks about neuropsychological damage or other complications which may generally be associated with a person's weight gain or obesity.  Now, to say that someone who is obese has got psychological damage, I think, gets to the point of the gentleman from Florida saying that there are a lot of people who can be both fat and happy.  If the gentlewoman from Texas wants to draft an amendment to aim at the target, this was not it because the gun is shooting in the wrong direction.
