President, I voted to table Senator Domenici's amendment not because I was not sympathetic with the same. And I give him great credit for bringing up a real problem in our campaign finance system of very wealthy candidates being able to self-finance their races. That discourages a lot of otherwise very qualified people from even running for office in the first place.  I commend the Senator from New Mexico for bringing up an important issue. I did not support his amendment because I disagreed with some of the provisions in it. I believe, however, that the amendment he is likely to propose with Senator DeWine is a far superior amendment.  I think it was very unfortunate that the Senator from New Mexico was not allowed unanimous consent to modify his amendment. That is very unusual. Members usually are allowed to modify their own amendments. I think it is very unfortunate that did not occur in this case. It does not bode well for the debate on this issue for us to start off like that.  I yield the floor.
