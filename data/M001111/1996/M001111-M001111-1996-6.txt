 President, the omnibus appropriations bill contains a provision in the Commerce, State, Justice appropriations area that needs clarification. Section 208 prevents the administration and councils from using funds to implement any individual fishing quota [IFQ] programs until fees are expressly authorized for such programs under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act. This fee authority recently passed both the House and Senate and will soon be signed into law by the President, but there is some confusion about the implication of this appropriations provision on a particular IFQ program designed to regulate bycatch.  Section 118 of the Sustainable Fisheries Act amends section 313 of the Magnuson Act to provide authority for the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to establish a Vessel Bycatch Accountability [VBA] program under section 313(g)(2). As Senator Stevens made clear during debate on the Sustainable Fisheries Act, the authority to collect a fee under section 304(d)(2)(A)(i) of the Magnuson Act for actual costs directly related to the management and enforcement of IFQ programs applies as well to any VBA program created under section 313(g)(2). Therefore, the express authorization of fees for a VBA program is contained within the express authorization of IFQ fees in section 304(d)(2)(A)(i), except that, as Senator Stevens mentioned during the debate, the fees in the VBA fishery should not exceed one percent of the annual ex-vessel value of the target fish in the fishery.  It is therefore clear that once the Sustainable Fisheries Act has been enacted, section 208 will no longer apply to the VBA program I have described. It will in no way prevent the Council from developing and the Secretary from approving and implementing a VBA program, consistent with the requirements of section 313(g)(2) and other provisions of the Magnuson Act.
