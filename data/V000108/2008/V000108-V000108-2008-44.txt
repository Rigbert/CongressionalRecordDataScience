To commemorate this special occasion, Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park will be holding an anniversary celebration on Saturday, July 5, 2008, at Jellystone Park in Portage, Indiana.  Jellystone Park was established in 1978 in order to provide camping and entertainment to vacationing families from across America. The Portage, Indiana, Jellystone Park is one of over 70 parks in the Yogi Bear's Jellystone Park Camp-Resort Franchise System. The Jellystone Park Board of Directors are: President Rochelle Carmichael, Vice President Don Butler, Secretary Connie Williams, Treasurer George Hill, Park Director Carolyn Julovich, and members: Marlene Jacobs, Tina Green, and Charles Taylor.  Every year, thousands of families vacation at the Portage Jellystone Park to share time together and enjoy its amenities. The Park offers a fulltime recreation program, a private lake, beaches, fishing, rentals, arcade room, and several pools.  In addition to the weekly activities, the 30th Anniversary will feature a special commemorative ceremony, followed by live music at the Yogi Bear Stage and a fireworks display over the lake at dusk.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating Yogi Bear's Jellystone Camp-Resort on their 30th Anniversary. Their many great accomplishments and hard work throughout the years are worthy of commendation.                          ____________________
