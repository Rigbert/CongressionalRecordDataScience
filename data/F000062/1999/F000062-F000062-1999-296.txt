 President, today I am introducing a bill with Senator Chafee to enable states to extend family planning services without getting a federal waiver from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  Under our bill, states could do two things they cannot do under current law without the waiver of federal rules:  (1) States could expand by income level coverage for family planning services to ``near-poor'' women, women whose incomes are slightly above the currently allowed levels; and  (2) States could provide family planning for more than 60 days after a woman delivers a baby.  Our bill will enable states to automatically take these two steps without getting a federal waiver.  Every year in this country, there are 3 million pregnancies, half of which are unintended. To a poor woman, struggling to find a job, keep a job, or provide for the children she already has, an unplanned pregnancy can be devastating. In an effort to reduce unintended pregnancies, Medicaid provides a higher federal matching rate (90 percent, instead of the roughly 50 percent, in federal funds) for family planning services. This bill can further enhance these goals by preventing pregnancies and by helping women plan their pregnancies.  In addition, family planning saves money. Ironically, under current law, the group of women whom this bill covers become eligible for Medicaid once they are pregnant, so Medicaid then pays for their prenatal care, their delivery and 60 days of family planning following delivery. Medicaid pays for 38 percent of all births in the United States. Studies show that for every $1.00 invested in family planning, $3.00 are saved in pregnancy and health-related costs. Recognizing the value of expanding family planning services, 13 states have received waivers to make the expansions and California has applied for one.  It is my hope that the bill we introduce today can improve the health of women and their children by reducing unwanted pregnancies, welfare dependency, the incidence of abortion, the incidence of low-birth weight babies and the incidence of infant mortality. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.                                 ______                                       By
