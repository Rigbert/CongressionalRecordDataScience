 And I would say to my friends that Wyoming and Kansas and Kentucky have a lot of rural areas. One of the things that Dr. Berwick has made very clear--and there was an article he wrote called ``Buckling Down to Change,'' in which he says there ought to be a concentration of change, in which he says there ought to be a concentration of services in metropolitan areas. He says most metropolitan areas in the United States should reduce the number of centers engaged in cardiac surgery, high-risk obstetrics, and neonatal intensive care services.  What he is really saying is narrow the specialties down to metropolitan areas only. I just think of how that would work in a State such as mine. We have a city--Pikeville, KY, in the mountains--about 2\1/2\ hours from the closest major city--Lexington. I wonder how it would work in my State to have to drive 2\1/2\ hours to put a baby in a hospital's neonatal intensive care unit. I mean, clearly, what he is talking about is major rationing of services.  That would be bad enough for the urban areas that are lucky enough to still have the service at all, but for States such as Wyoming and Kentucky and Kansas, where we have a lot of people in rural areas who are pretty far removed from major urban centers, we are talking about a catastrophe, as I see it.  Senator Barrasso has practiced medicine for 25 years. I wonder what his take is on that kind of approach.
