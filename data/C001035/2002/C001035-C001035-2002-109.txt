President, I rise today to introduce legislation to benefit our Nation's small businesses--the backbone of our economy. I am very pleased to be joined by several of my colleagues, including Senator Bond, Senator Tim Hutchinson, and Senator Gordon Smith. All of these Senators have been steadfast proponents and supporters of small businesses throughout their Senate career. Today, we are introducing legislation to allow small businesses to expense more of their investments in equipment and property. In short, we are introducing legislation to help small businesses grow.  The importance of small businesses to our economy cannot be overstated. According to the Small Business Administration, small firms account for three-quarters of our Nation's employment growth and almost all of the net new jobs. That is certainly true in my home State of Maine. These are good jobs, jobs that make our communities strong.  Mr. President, last Friday the Senate overwhelmingly passed a critical piece of legislation designed to boost our economy. The legislation extends benefits for an additional 13 weeks to an estimated 3 million unemployed workers who have exhausted, or will soon exhaust, their regular unemployment benefits before being able to find new work. This program will help put food on the table for an estimated 23,000 unemployed workers in Maine by providing money for extended benefits.  The economic recovery legislation also includes ``bonus depreciation'' provisions that will encourage mostly larger firms to invest in new property and equipment. Again, that is another provision I support. It includes a number of other important proposals, including one that is near and dear to me providing tax relief to teachers who reach deep into their own pockets to buy supplies and materials for their students. Yet my biggest regret about the economic recovery package we passed last week is that it does very little for smaller businesses. I think that is disappointing and I think that is wrong because it is small businesses that tend to lead our economy out of recession.  Often, I think we take smaller businesses for granted. When times are good, we expect small businesses to create vast numbers of good, new jobs for American workers, and when times are tough, we count on small businesses to resuscitate our sluggish economy. Time and time again, entrepreneurs lead the Nation down avenues of new economic opportunity, and our expectations rise with each remarkable success story. But if we expect so much from small businesses, if we count on them to this degree, we owe it to them to create a climate that nurtures and rewards entrepreneurship.  That is why we have come together to introduce this straightforward legislation. Under section 179 of the Tax Code, a taxpayer with a relatively small amount of annual investment may elect to deduct up to $24,000 of the cost of qualifying property and equipment placed in service in any givenyear. The deduction is phased out for taxpayers who invest over $200,000 per year.  Our bill would permit small businesses to expense their new equipment purchases up to $40,000 per year. In other words, we would be increasing the section 179 expensing limit from $24,000 to $40,000. That is a fairly significant increase, but it should be; the last time Congress increased the small business expensing limit was back in 1996. An adjustment is well overdue.  Section 179 is critically important to small businesses. Direct expensing allows a small employer to avoid the complexities of the depreciation rules as well as unrealistic recovery periods for many assets. For example, under current law, a computer must be depreciated over 5 years. Now, all of us know that the useful life of most computers is only 2 or 3 years, at best.  Expensing also addresses a top concern of small businesses that has been exacerbated by the recent recession. The concern is access to capital.  I served for a time as the New England Administrator of the Small Business Administration, and I know there are so many small companies where the owner of the company has a wonderful concept, a workable business plan, yet lacks access to capital to get the business underway or to grow it to the next level. The concern is access to capital, which the Small Business Administration has called the ``greatest economic policy challenge'' for rapidly growing businesses.  One indication of the need for additional financing is the amount of venture capital invested into the United States. In the year 2000, a record $103 billion was invested. But in 2001, that total fell by 65 percent, to $36.5 billion. When we see this decrease in access to venture capital, inevitably, it seems, women-owned companies and minority-owned firms are disproportionately affected and are shut out of the capital market.  By raising the section 179 limit, our bill, in effect, will reduce the cost of capital for small businesses nationwide and it will free up additional capital for small businesses to purchase more plant and equipment.  I have spoken to small business owners in my home State of Maine, and they have told me time and again that an increase in the small business expensing limit would make a real difference to them. It would allow them to expand their businesses, thus create more good, new jobs.  Terry Skillins of Skillins Greenhouses is a fourth-generation Maine family business founded in 1885. It is a good example of what I am talking about. Skillins Greenhouses employs between 70 and 120 employees, depending on the season, in its landscaping, greenhouse, and floral businesses. Terry told me the company is looking to expand but that to do so takes money. From tractors, to conveyor belts, to specialized machinery, the equipment needed to expand is expensive. Terry said raising the small business expensing limit to $40,000 would help tip the scales in favor of his proceeding with an expansion, particularly if the increase were made permanent. Terry said his business plan extends over a number of years and, hence, knowing the expensing limit would be increased permanently, he could and would use a significant multiyear savings to expand his business.  We offered a small business expensing amendment to the economic recovery bill back in January. The amendment was offered by my colleague from Missouri, Senator Bond, and myself. It included exactly the same increases as I am proposing in the bill we are introducing today. I point out that our amendment passed the Senate by an overwhelming vote of 90 to 2. So, clearly, there is an understanding among our colleagues that this tax change is long overdue and that it would make a real difference to the small businesses in our country.  Today, I am inviting all of our colleagues to join us in cosponsoring this bill, which is strongly supported and has been endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Business, our Nation's largest small business organization. In that regard, I ask unanimous consent that a letter from Dan Danner, senior vice president of the NFIB, be printed in Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                            National Federation of                                         Independent Business,                                   Washington, DC, March 14, 2002.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the 600,000 members of      the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I      commend you for introducing The Section 179 Small Business      Expensing Bill. The Collins-Bond-Hutchinson-Smith bill will      increase the amount of equipment purchases, allow small      businesses to expense each year from the current $24,000 to      $40,000 and most importantly, make this language permanent.       Many small businesses are currently struggling to cope with      the recession and the events of September 11th. Increasing      the expensing limit would provide small and growing firms      with the funds to make critical investments and keep their      firms running and growing, creating new jobs.       This legislation will also help small business by      eliminating burdensome record keeping involved in      depreciating equipment. And it adjusts the investment limit      on expensing from 200,000 to $325,000.       Small business is the major job generator for the economy.      Let's give them the tools to grow, hire more employees, and      lead this country out of recession.           Sincerely,                                                       Dan Danner,                             Senior Vice President, Public Policy.
