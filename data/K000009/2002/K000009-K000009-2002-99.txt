Speaker, I would like to commend the following article to my Colleagues. Women from Northwest Ohio have been trailblazers in the fields of education, health, business and politics. Toledo has a rich history of strong women and I commend their achievements.          What's in a Name? An Honor for Women of Achievement           Local places named for those who made a difference                             (By Ann Weber)       ``You can use my name as long as you do a great job,''      longtime local volunteer Elizabeth Zepf is said to have told      admirers years ago when they asked if they could name a      community mental health center for her.       Members of the Lucas County mental health board and the      board of the newly established center agreed to the deal, and      apparently have lived up to it. Since 1974, the Elizabeth A.      Zepf Community Mental Health Center, 6605 West Central Ave.,      has been serving the severe and persistently mentally ill.       Mrs. Zepf, who is in her 90s and living in Toledo, was      prominent at the local, state, and national level of the      March of Dimes, a member of the mental health board, and      active in more than a dozen other organizations. The Zepf      Center is one of numerous places in northwest Ohio that are      named for women.       At least one person believes there should be many more such      places.       ``Maybe they're not as obvious as men, but there are a lot      of women who have made major contributions to the community      and have not been recognized,'' said Ann Hurley, chairwoman      of the Women Alive! Coalition and a reference librarian in      the local history and genealogy department at the Main      Library.       But she noted that many of those women haven't worked in      fields from which names usually have been plucked, such as      high government office. Most of the places that are named      locally after women are related to the fields of education,      social service, and health--the ``invisible career fields,''      says Barbara Floyd, University of Toledo archivist.       Even an exception--Ella P. Stewart, the first African-     American woman pharmacist--was hailed not for her business      acumen but for her work in human rights, she pointed out.      Toledo has a rich history of strong women.       ``Toledo was a hotbed of the women's suffrage movement,''      Ms. Floyd said. ``A lot of those women are perhaps lost to      history because their contributions have been forgotten.''       Today, ``one of the areas that is striking is our      prominence in the political field,'' she said, citing U.S.      Rep. Marcy Kaptur, State Sen. Linda Furney, Lucas County      Commission President Sandy Isenberg, and State Reps. Teresa      Fedor, Jeanine Perry, and Edna Brown. ``That's an amazing      success for women in this area.''       Many of the area's prominent women have been profiled in a      series of books written by the women's history committee of      the Women Alive! Coalition. Volume I of In Search of Our      Past: Women of Northwest Ohio was published in 1987; Volume      VIII is in the works.       ``We are a treasure trove of women's history. We don't ever      see these volumes ending,'' said Susan Coburn, editor. She is      the manager of the humanities department at the Main Library,      and predicts that in the future women's names will be seen      increasingly on government, professional, and technical      buildings.       Here are just some of the places in the area named for      women, with information on what inspired the honors:       Mildred Bayer Clinic for the Homeless, 2101 Jefferson Ave.       Mildred Bayer (1908-1990) ``was always helping somebody,''      a classmate from the St. Vincent School of Nursing recalled      in Volume III of In Search Of Our Past: Women of Northwest      Ohio. From Mrs. Bayer's concern for others came medical      clinics for migrant workers in Lucas County, Mobile Meals of      Toledo, and mobile medical clinics in Nigeria. The Toledo      clinic provides dental, vision, and primary health care to      the homeless.        Catharine Eberly Center For Women, University of Toledo       The center was founded in 1978 and in 1980 was named in      honor of Catharine Eberly (1922-1979), who served on the UT      board of trustees from 1974 until her death in an automobile      accident. Its services include career counseling, support      groups, and leadership training for students and community      women.        Josephine Fassett Middle School, 3025 Starr Ave., Oregon       Every St. Patrick's Day, staffers at Fassett Middle School      in Oregon put a green balloon on the office portrait of      Josephine Fassett, born March 17, 1884. The school's namesake      was appointed supervisor of schools in Oregon and Jerusalem      townships in 1914 and later, when the districts were      consolidated, was superintendent of Oregon schools until she      retired in 1954. Miss Fassett died in 1975. The school has      just over 500 students in sixth, seventh, and eighth grades.                   Gillham Hall, University of Toledo       The University of Toledo had a library collection of about      8,100 volumes when Mary Gillham (then Mary Mewbom) joined the      staff in 1921. When she retired in 1969, it had grown to      600,000. Gillham Hall, now used for classrooms and faculty      offices, was the first free-standing library building at UT.      Designed by Mrs. Gillham herself, it opened in August, 1953.   Aurora Gonzalez Community & Family Resource Center, 1301 Broadway       Aurora Gonzalez (1924-1991) was the first Hispanic woman      elected to the Ohio Hall of Fame. The neighborhood outreach      center     named for the activist hosted two presidents last year:      George Bush and Mexico's Vicente Fox. It provides a food      pantry, clothing locker, youth athletic and job-readiness      programs, and family counseling.       A nearby stretch of South Avenue between Broadway and the      Anthony Wayne Trail honors Aurora's sister, Ruth Gonzalez      Garcia.          Eleanor M. Kahle Senior Center, 1315 Hillcrest Ave.       Eleanor M. Konieczka Kahle (1916-1995) was an advocate for      seniors who was elected to Toledo City Council in 1987, 1989,      1991, and 1993. Until 1993 she was director of the West      Toledo Senior Citizen Center, which was named for her after      her death. The center offers a variety of programs and      activities--from computer classes to line dancing, bingo to      flu shots. Josina Lott Residential & Community Services, 120 S. Holland-Sylvania                                   Rd.       Lott Industries, Inc.       Hers is a familiar name to area residents, since two      organizations have honored Josina Jones Lott (1898-1973), an      educator and advocate for children with mental and physical      disabilities.       Lott Industries, chartered in 1955, serves Lucas County      residents with mental retardation and other developmental      disabilities through sheltered workshops and a vocational      training center.       Josina Lott Residential & Community Services, a separate      entity, also serves adults with mental retardation and other      developmental disabilities. It includes group homes and life-     skills training programs for people living independently.            Cordelia Martin Health Center, 905 Nebraska Ave.       Cordelia Martin (1915-1999) was devoted to providing health      care to Toledo's poor. The center is one of 10 sites      (including the Mildred Bayer Clinic for the Homeless)      administered by the Neighborhood Health Association.      Primarily serving low to moderate income, uninsured and      underinsured people, the center includes doctors' offices,      dental care, a lab, pharmacy, the federal WIC program, and      social service education and referrals. Anna C. Mott Branch, Toledo-Lucas County Public Library, 1085 Dorr St.       Anna C. Mott (1835-1902) was a founder of the Toledo Woman      Suffrage Association in 1869 and in 1884 was one of the      founding officers of the Toledo Humane Society. The Mott      Library opened in 1918. Originally 6,000 square feet, it now      is almost 14,000 square feet. Circulation has increased 45      percent over the past five years.      Sofia Quintero Hispanic Art & Cultural Center, 1225 Broadway       Sofia Quintero (1948-1994), active in politics and public      affairs, was the first Hispanic president of the Toledo board      of education. The mission of the nonprofit organization is      public education about Latino heritage through the arts and      events such as the Day of the Dead celebration, when Latinos      remember loved ones who have passed away.    Ella P. Stewart School, Toledo Public Schools, 707 Avondale Ave.       The school was named in 1961 for Ella Nora Phillips Stewart      (1891-1987), civil rights crusader and Toledo's first      African-American woman pharmacist. She and her husband,      William, were the first African-Americans to own and operate      a drugstore in Toledo. The school has 340 students in first      through sixth grades, and a museum honoring Mrs. Stewart with      items such as dolls from her collection, medicine bottles      from her pharmacy, and a shirt signed by President John F.      Kennedy.          Whitney Adult Education Center, 1602 Washington St.       Dedicated in 1941 as the Harriet Whitney Vocational High      School for Girls, the building is named for Harriet Whitney      (1814-1903), Toledo's first woman school teacher. The      building was closed as a high school in 1991 and now houses      Toledo Public Schools' Adult Education Center and the Center      For Change.       Based there is the Adult Basic Literacy Program/GED and one      of 22 local class sites, plus other services for adults such      as vocational programs. There's also a night school for      youths in day classes who need to make up credits and a      program for at-risk students.                               ____________________
