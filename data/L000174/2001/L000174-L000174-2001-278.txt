President, I want to add my support to promoting electronic commerce and keeping it free from discriminatory and multiple State and local taxes. I am pleased to join the senior Senator from Oregon and the senior Senator from Arizona as an original cosponsor of the Internet Tax Moratorium Extension Act. I commend Senator Wyden and Senator McCain for their continued leadership on Internet tax policy.  Although electronic commerce is beginning to blossom, it is still in its infancy. Stability is key to reaching its full potential, and creating new tax categories for the Internet is exactly the wrong thing to do. E-commerce should not be subject to new taxes that do not apply to other commerce.  Indeed, without the current moratorium, there are 30,000 different jurisdictions around the country that could levy discriminatory or multiple Internet taxes on E-commerce. Let's not allow the future of electronic commerce, with its great potential to expand the markets of Main Street businesses, to be crushed by the weight of discriminatory taxation.  We also need a national policy to make sure that the traditional State and local sales taxes on Internet sales are applied and collected fairly and uniformly. This two-year extension of the current moratorium gives our Governors and State legislatures time to simplify their sale tax rules and reach consensus on a workable national system for collecting sales taxes on E-commerce.  E-commerce is growing, our moratorium law is working, and we should keep a good thing going. I am proud to cosponsor the Internet Tax Moratorium Extension Act to encourage online commerce to continue to grow with confidence. I urge my colleagues to support its swift passage into law.                                 ______                                       By
