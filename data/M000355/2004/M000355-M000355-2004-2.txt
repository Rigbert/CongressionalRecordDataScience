 President, tomorrow morning the Senate will begin consideration of the intelligence reform conference report. We hope to lock in a time certain for a vote on the conference report tomorrow. We don't have it now, but we hope to lock in a time certain. All Senators should therefore expect a rollcall vote on adoption of the conference tomorrow afternoon.  For scheduling purposes, we would like to begin that vote at sometime around 2 or 2:30 in the afternoon. Because of the uncertainty of the schedule, however, we will be prepared to hold that vote open for an extended period to accommodate all Senators. That vote could extend until approximately 5 or 5:15 tomorrow afternoon to accommodate Senators coming in from various places around the country. Given the unique circumstance, we are willing to hold the vote open; however, Members should prepare to come to the Chamber as early as possible for the vote.  We will notify all of our colleagues, all of the Senators, when the time for the vote is locked in, but, again, it should cover a period of a number of different hours in order to accommodate people who, unfortunately, are coming in from all over the country to catch this vote on this important matter.                          ____________________
