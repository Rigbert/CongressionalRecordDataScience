Speaker, it is with great pride and respect that I wish to commend Army Reserve Private First Class Luis A. Perez for his bravery in the field of battle and his willingness to fight for his country. Private Perez was assigned to the 223rd Transportation Company, United States Army Reserve, Norristown, Pennsylvania. Private First Class Perez lost his life on Thursday, August 26, 2004, in Fallujah, Iraq, when the fuel truck he was driving hit a land mine causing a deadly explosion. His sacrifice will be remembered by a community that has been struck hard by the devastating loss of one of its own.  A native of East Chicago, Indiana, Private Luis Perez attended Morton High School in Hammond for two years, but graduated from a high school in New York where he had gone to live with his father after his parents divorced. He enjoyed playing video games, basketball and he also liked to write poetry. All Private Perez ever wanted was to grow up and be a soldier like his father. After graduating from high school, he enlisted in the United States Army and two weeks later he was off for training.  It came as no surprise to those who knew Private Perez that he would serve his country. Growing up, he traveled with his parents and two younger sisters all over the world, living in Hawaii and Germany. A true patriot, his love for his country was evident from the time that he was a child. At a young age he told imaginative tales of what his life would be like, he said he wanted to be a green man and continue traveling the world. Relatives urged Private Perez to enroll in college, but he wanted to be a hero like his father, Sergeant Jose Perez, a 20-year veteran of the United States Army. Private Perez felt tremendous pride for his country, and he was willing to endanger his own life to protect the lives of his fellow citizens. His courage and heroism will always be remembered, and his sacrifice will forever live in the hearts and minds of those for whom he battled. He gave his life so that the freedoms and values that he treasured could be enjoyed by those around the world.  Although he loved his unit and his country, Private Perez treasured his family above all else. He is survived by his wife, Theresa, his father, Sergeant Jose Perez, his mother, Lisa Perez, two sisters, and his grandmother, Clara Madrigal.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Reserve Private First Class Luis A Perez. He will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country. Let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________
