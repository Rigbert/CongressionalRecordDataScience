President, nearly 30 years ago, I joined a good friend, the late Hub Vogelmann, along with a Republican Congressman, a Democratic Governor, and President Reagan's EPA Administrator, on a hike to the summit of Vermont's iconic peak, Camel's Hump. We had a goal in mind. We wanted to observe first-hand the effects of acid raid. When we arrived at the summit, we saw the evidence we feared. You did not have to be a scientist to see it: a scar burned across the peak of Camel's Hump and across all of the peaks of the Green Mountains and the Adirondacks. Due to human action, weather patterns had changed, altering the very chemistry of rainfall on a grand scale. As a result, we caused profound and large-scale damage to life sustaining ecosystems.  There were Democrats and Republicans, scientists and bureaucrats on that mountain. We returned to Washington, united and eager to address the problem. It was not easy. We had to overcome strong objections from industry and develop an entirely new cap-and-trade regulatory framework. In the end, a Democratic majority in Congress passed, and Republican President George H.W. Bush signed into law, the Clean Air Act amendments.  Once again, we are confronted with irrefutable evidence that humans have altered not just the weather of a region, but the climate of the entire planet. This time, we do not need to climb mountains to see the damage. We see it in New England's flood ravaged river valleys, California's scorched farmland, Alaska's retreating glaciers, Wyoming's burnt forests, and super-storm ravaged coastlines.  Before we even get to the accumulated--and accumulating--scientific evidence for climate change and the carbonization of our fragile envelope of atmosphere, we only need to apply common sense. As we look around us, anywhere, everywhere, and at any time, doesn't it just stand to reason that human activity is contributing to documented changes in our atmosphere, and to climate change? I certainly have seen it in my lifetime. But I have also seen people try to deny all reason and the evidence all around us.  The scientists have done their work. We now better understand the human causes of climate change and we understand its profound and accelerating impact. Unfortunately, too many policy makers deny the evidence, or refuse to cross political lines to solve the problem. I say it is time we wake up and act on climate change.  We have taken some steps in the right direction. This past summer, President Obama announced his Climate Action Plan to cut carbon pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency has begun creating new carbon emission standards for future power plants. The Department of Energy is working on ground-breaking energy technologies, and the Department of Transportation is studying transportation planning to address future risks and vulnerabilities from extreme weather and climate change. The Transportation Department is also addressing vehicle fuel efficiency which is saving vehicle owners and operators billions of dollars a year. These are all positive changes, but before we rest on our laurels, we have to understand that there are not nearly enough to address the problem at hand. Congress needs to cast aside partisan blinders by enacting legislation that prioritizes renewable energy development, supports energy efficient technologies, and taxes carbon pollution.  It is time to take a stand against misguided policies and projects that put future generations at risk, and in my State, we believe that includes the Keystone XL pipeline. The State Department recently released its long-awaited environmental impact statement on the Keystone XL pipeline. I am deeply troubled that the State Department's analysis did not take into account the overwhelming evidence that this project will further accelerate the release of greenhouse gas pollution, which will intensify climate change. There is a mountain of evidence that the carbon pollution, drinking water threats, public health threats, and safety threats from this pipeline are so great that it is not in our national interest, and its permit should be denied. I realize this goes against some public opinion polls, but I believe we must stamp out our addiction to fossil fuels and fight back against these threats to our land, water, air, and healthy communities around the world.  We have to understand that climate change is not simply an environmental challenge. Creating a green energy sector is not just about cutting greenhouse gas emissions. It is about providing jobs for Americans in the renewable energy and energy efficiency fields. It is about strengthening national security in America by having greater control over our energy sources and breaking the stranglehold of oil on the transportation system. What should unite all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, is assuring that our children and grandchildren have clean air to breathe.  We have come together before. We did it back in the time of PresidentGeorge H.W. Bush. We joined hands across the aisle and across regions of this great country to solve problems. Why can't we do it again? Isn't that the least we owe to our planet? Isn't that the least we owe to our children and grandchildren?  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
