 And I would just note that we're going to be confronted very soon with another limitation amendment on another bill where we're going to have achoice: We're going to abandon the American trucking industry to Mexico--which is, again, exacting tribute from the U.S., $4 billion a year worth of tariffs, to try and drive our companies south of the border to use Mexican drivers.  So time and time again these trade agreements are failing us. I think it's bigger than the problem of the subsidies in the farm bill, and this Congress needs to pay attention. One way or another, we're either going to get real about our deficits and what's really essential to the American people--feeding our people, clothing our people, and putting American people to work--or we're going to abandon ourselves to this failed notion of the WTO and other trade agreements.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
