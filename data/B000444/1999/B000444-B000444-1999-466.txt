 President, I am pleased to support the resolution offered by the Majority and Minority Leaders in honor of the life and legacy of King Hussein.  With King Hussein's death, the United States has lost a close, steady friend in a troubled part of the world. My deepest condolences go out to the King's family and the Jordanian people. My best wishes go to King Hussein's designated heir, King Abdullah.  In all of my encounters with King Hussein I was impressed above all else by his optimism and determination in the cause of peace. He never gave up, and in his memory, we must now press forward on the road to peace.  I was also touched by his humanity and personal warmth. He was always gentle and polite, never aloof or imperious.  Though his life ended too soon, his legacy will survive. His rare gift of vision helped guide Jordan through many dark periods. The heroic steps he took to help promote peace and reconciliation between Arabs and Israelis will continue to bear fruit.  His efforts to establish the foundations of democratic government in Jordan remain a worthy example for the region, where democracy is in short supply.  Finally, the partnership between Jordan and the United States, cultivated so carefully by King Hussein over 46 years and nine American Administrations will continue well into the future.  President Clinton has asked us to demonstrate our support for Jordan in a very tangible way--by promptly approving his request for supplemental assistance to Jordan. I hope that we can act on that request quickly to show the Jordanian people that we honor the memory and great achievements of their late King, and that our friendship with their country is enduring.
