In March, we observed Women's History Month, honoring the progress toward full equality of over half our population.  Thus, one would have thought that when over 1,100 garment workers in Bangladesh--seamstresses, sewers, cutters, helpers--died working in dangerous factory conditions for an average wage of $38 a month, America's retailers would have been the first to sign the landmark international safety agreement to improve the working conditions of these workers, who are predominantly women.  Surely, when 20 percent of Bangladesh's exports, mostly garments, are destined for U.S. buyers, our Nation's clothing firms should be on the front lines fighting for decent working conditions and a fair day's pay, not exploiting women workers.  But only Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein have stood up for women garment workers, millions of invisible hands working in death traps, making so much of the clothing we wear that is marketed in our country.  So, where are Walmart and Sears? Where is the Gap? Where is Target? They appear to be missing in action. We need to reward those companies that care about workers and women workers in particular. When you think about buying clothing, think Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein and ask, Where are the others? Without conscience and, obviously, on the wrong side of honor.                          ____________________
