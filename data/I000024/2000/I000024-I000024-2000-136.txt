 I just say this. In following through with my commitment to try to block the confirmations, while it is not my intention--if the handwriting is on the wall--to just arbitrarily lay down blanket filibusters, I do intend to consult with my colleagues and reserve my rights under the rules to assess what actions, if any, can succeed in this effort.  I want to make one other comment about this, too; that is, you hear a lot of yelling and screaming about: Oh, what are we going to do without these appointments that we have to have? I remind you, back in 1993, at the end of the Bush administration--he was ready to go out of office--there were 109 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. In other words, the Democratic controlled Congress failed to fill these vacancies.  Right now, there are 74 vacancies in the Federal judiciary. If you determine where we would be if normal history takes its course through deaths or resignations, at the most there would be another 25 vacancies. That means, at the most, we would have about 100 vacancies at the end of President Clinton's term. Compare that to the 109 vacancies left after the Bush administration. I make that comment to offset the argument before it is made as to what type of judicial crisis will come about if we ended up without judicial nominees being confirmed.
