 2195, The Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 2004, is to address the abuse of steroids by athletes and, especially, by youngsters and teenagers. Some substances marketed as dietary supplements, such as androstenedione, will be anabolic steroids under this bill. That means that they will be regulated as controlled substances and not as dietary supplements. As such, there will be significant controls on their distribution and use, including substantial criminal penalties.
