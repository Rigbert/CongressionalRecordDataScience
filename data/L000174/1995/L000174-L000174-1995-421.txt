President, early last month, Paul Bruhn of South Burlington, Vermont, received the 1995 Harris Award. Paul is the Executive Director of the Preservation Trust of Vermont, and I know that he was given the Award because of his life-long devotion to improving the Burlington area and helping Vermont in all things. He was recognized as the Downtown Business Person of the Year, and the honor is justly deserved.  During the past 20 years, I cannot remember a thing done to help Burlington that did not involve Paul Bruhn. Those of us who think of Burlington as home know how much we owe to Paul. I ask that two articles from the Burlington Free Press regarding Paul, be printed in the Record.  The articles follow:             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 5, 1995]                     Architect, Consultant Honored                           (By Stacey Chase)       Breaking with tradition, the Downtown Burlington      Development Association has announced the winners of the      Nathan Harris and Hertzel Pasackow awards that will be      presented at the association's annual dinner May 11.       The 1995 Harris Award will be given to Paul Bruhn,      executive director of the Non-profit Preservation Trust of      Vermont and a private public affairs consultant. This year's      Pasackow Award goes to Bob Miller for the development of his      namesake building, Miller's Landmark, on the Church Street      Marketplace.       ``I was surprised, flattered, a little embarrassed but very      appreciative,'' said Bruhn, 48, of South Burlington.       The Harris Award has been given since 1978 to the person      ``who best emulates the enthusiasm, dedication and foresight      of Nate Harris in maintaining and improving the economic      vitality of the Burlington central business district.''       ``Paul Bruhn has been involved and concerned with the      vitality of downtown Burlington all of his life,'' said Ed      Moore, executive director of the development association.      ``And the interesting part of Paul's accomplishment and      contribution is that he's never in the limelight; he's always      been behind the scenes working very, very hard.''       The Pasackow Award has been given since 1984 for      significant contribution to the physical or architectural      quality of downtown Burlington. Miller's Landmark contains 15      stores and office space.       ``When J.C. Penny chose to leave the city, the thought of a      vacant shell of a building caused concern for many in      downtown,'' Moore said. ``Then Bobby Miller purchased the      building, created a vision and began implementation of a plan      that is represented by that building as we know it today.''       Miller, 59, of Shelburne is president of REM Development      Co. The Williston company is a commercial and industrial      development firm.       ``I think the building certainly has increased the identity      of that upper block,'' Miller said. ``And it's been kind of a      fun project.''       Both Harris and Pasackow were founding members of the      development association. The late Nathan Harris started      Nate's men's clothing store; the late Hertzel Pasackow      started Mayfair women's clothing store.       Moore said the decision to announce the winner before the      annual dinner was made this year to give the recipients      greater recognition for their work.       ``We thought we could get a better turnout if people      knew,'' Moore said.             [From the Burlington Free Press, May 12, 1995]                     Pasackow, Harris Awards Given                            (By Candy Page)       In a bittersweet moment Thursday evening, the Pasackow      family, whose Church Street clothing store is closing,      presented      the H. Hertzel Pasackow Award to Robert Miller of Miller's Landmark,      one of downtown's newest businesses.       The award, for architectural excellence, was one of two      presented by the Downtown Burlington Development Association      to downtown leaders.       The audience of 200 gave a standing ovation to Paul Bruhn,      who received the Nate Harris Award as the downtown      businessperson of the year.       Bruhn, executive director of the Preservation Trust of      Vermont, was recognized for 20 years of behind-the-scenes      work in helping to create the Church Street Marketplace and      to keep it strong.       ``I'm proud to have been part of this Marketplace,'' Jay      Pasackow said as he presented the Pasackow award to Miller.       Pasackow said Miller's $3.5 million renovation of the      former J.C. Penny building meant that ``what was potential      urban decay became a jewel for downtown.''       Miller said he was sad the Pasackow family is closing their      business but that he is excited about the Marketplace's      future.       Bruhn's work has been less visible than Miller's.       As an aide to Sen. Patrick J. Leahy in the 1970s, Bruhn      helped obtain the seven federal grants that helped finance      creation of the Church Street pedestrian mall.       Mayor Peter Clavelle praised Bruhn for more recent work,      organizing opposition to suburban mega-developments like Wal-     Mart and Pyramid mall.       ``Paul has been the most persistent and effective organizer      of opposition to Pyramid and Wal-Mart . . . and downtown      Burlington would not be what it is today if Pyramid or Wal-     Mart had been built,'' the mayor said.                               ____________________
