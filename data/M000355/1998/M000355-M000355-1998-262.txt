 President, I wish to engage the Senator from Arizona in a short colloquy. This is a complicated bill. It addresses areas where technology is rapidly evolving. Some of my questions may be fairly arcane and will be of interest only to those intimately familiar with the intricacies of the interstate simulcasting of horse racing so I ask that my fellow members be patient with us as we work our way through some of these issues.  Senator Kyl, as you are well aware, there are a myriad of federal and state laws and regulations that impact interstate simulcasting. In every instance, I will assume that we are addressing only the application of the language of S. 474 and not the general legality of any specific example given. With that understanding, I will proceed with the first of my questions.  Senator Kyl, am I correct that S. 474 does not apply to racetracks that may advertise or make past performances, how-to-bet, promotional, and other similar kinds of information available whether via a racetrack World Wide Web site on the Internet or other technological media.
