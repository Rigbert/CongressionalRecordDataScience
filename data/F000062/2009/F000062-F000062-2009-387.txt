 EPA estimates that combined sewage overflows are responsible for releasing more than a trillion gallons of untreated and undertreated wastewater into our Nation's water bodies every year. I believe that additional funding provided through the Recovery Act for the Clean Water State Revolving Funds program will help alleviate the combined sewage overflow problem. I share the Senator's belief that the EPA should strongly encourage the completion of combined sewage overflow projects and I look forward to working with the Senator to address this serious problem in the years ahead.
