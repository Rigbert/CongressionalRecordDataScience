Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.  I have to suggest to the distinguished minority leader, and he is distinguished, and I have a lot of respect for him, and I understand being in the minority. I served in this House for 24 years in the minority, so I know what it means to be in the minority.  But when he says that we did not pass a budget, he is wrong. That is not accurate. We passed a budget. And when we could not get it through the whole process because the other body would not pass one, we deemed our own budget. So the House did its job. It was not our fault that the other body controlled by the other party refused to even take up a budget. Just like in the House, their party did not offer a substitute for our budget.  So, yes, Mr. Minority Leader, we passed a budget and when we could not get in conference with the other body, we deemed our own budget here in this House. So I just wanted to correct that.  Then I wanted to say to the gentleman about ducking responsibilities, I have avoided getting into the partisanship and the political business here in this House. A lot of it takes place, and that is natural. We are approaching an election. I have done my best to keep the official business of the appropriations process on a nonpartisan, on a bipartisan, on a productive basis, what is good for the country. But, Mr. Speaker, my party did not duck its responsibilities. We have had a very productive year in this House of Representatives, only to find our efforts stymied by the other body who refused even to take it up. One of the appropriations bills that we passed early on they worked on for 3 weeks, and could not pass it, so they pulled it off of consideration. Talk about ducking responsibilities. We passed that bill.  Anyway, Mr. Speaker, as the Speaker knows, I seldom get exercised to that extent.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the very honorable gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), my distinguished colleague.                Announcement by the Speaker Pro Tempore
