 President, I rise today in support of the Medicaid Safety Net Hospital Act of 2000, a bill that would freeze Medicaid Disproportionate Share Hospital (DSH) payments to hospitals at their 2000 level for Fiscal Year 2001 and 2002. I hope the Senate can act promptly on this bill.  The number of people in our nation who have no medical insurance has hit some 44 million. This is tragic. More than 100,000 people join the ranks of the uninsured monthly. We cannot continue to reduce payments to hospitals that provide care for the uninsured. We cannot balance the budget on the backs of poor people who show up at emergency rooms with no insurance or on the backs of the hospitals that tend to them.  California bears a disproportionate burden of uncompensated care. Twenty-four percent of our population is uninsured. Nationwide, the rate is 17 percent. Currently, over 7 million Californians are uninsured. During the past few months, I have met with many California health care leaders. They fear that the Medicaid cuts contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have undermined the financial stability of California's health care system, which many believe to be on the verge of collapse.  As a result of Medicaid reductions in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, California's Medicaid DisproportionateShare Hospital program could lose more than $280 million by 2002. Federal Medicaid DSH payments to California have declined by more than $116 million in the past two years and are slated to be cut by an additional $164 million--17 percent--over the next two years.  Without this bill, for example, by Fiscal Year 2002 Los Angeles County- University of Southern California Medical Center will lose $13.5 million. San Francisco General will lose $5.2 million. Fresno Community Hospital will lose $10.5 million. Over 132 California hospitals, representing rural and urban communities, depend on Medicaid DSH payments. Under this bill, millions of dollars will be restored to California public hospitals.  Public hospitals carry a disproportionate share of caring for the poor and uninsured. Forty percent of all California uninsured hospital patients were treated at public hospitals in 1998, up from 32 percent in 1993. The uninsured as a share of all discharges from public hospitals grew from 22 percent in 1993 to 29 percent in 1998. While overall public hospital discharges declined from 1993 to 1999 by 15 percent, discharges for uninsured patients increased by 11 percent. Large numbers of uninsured add huge uncompensated costs to our public hospitals.  The uninsured often choose public hospitals and frequently wait until their illnesses or injuries require emergency treatment. This makes their care even more costly. California's emergency rooms are strained to the breaking point. Last week at a California State Senate hearing, Dr. Dan Abbott, an emergency room physician at St. Jude Hospital in Fullerton, California said: ``We feel that emergency care in California is overwhelmed, it's underfunded and at times, frankly, it is out-and-out dangerous.'' Statewide, 19 emergency rooms have closed since 1997 despite an increase in the number of uninsured requiring care. The burden to provide care is put on those hospitals who have managed to remain open, and many of those hospitals are currently facing financial problems of their own.  California's health care system, in the words of a November 15th Wall Street Journal article, is a ``chaotic and discombobulated environment.'' It is stretched to the limit:  Thirty-seven California hospitals have closed since 1996, and up to 15 percent more may close by 2005.  Earlier this month, Scripps Memorial Hospital East County closed its doors due in part to reimbursement problems.  Eighty-six California hospitals operated in the red in 1999.  Academic medical centers, which incur added costs unique to their mission, are facing margins reduced to zero and below.  Sixty-two percent of California hospitals are now losing money. Due to the large number of Medicare and Medicaid patients, sixty-nine percent of California's rural hospitals lost money in 1998, according to the California Healthcare Association.  Hospitals have laid off staff, limited hours of operation, and discontinued services.  California physician groups are failing at the rate of one a week, with 115 bankruptcies or closures since 1996.  In short, restoring Medicaid cuts is crucial to stabilizing California's health delivery system.  Circumstances have changed since 1997 when we passed the Balanced Budget Act. We have eliminated the federal deficit. Because we have a robust economy, lower inflation, higher GDP growth and lower unemployment, we also have lowered Medicaid spending growth more than anticipated. This climate provides us an opportunity to revisit the reductions contained in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and to strengthen the stability of health care services, a system that in my State is on the verge of unraveling.  We need to pass this bill. Without it, we could have a more severe health care crisis on our hands, especially in California. I urge my colleagues to join me in passing this bill.                                 ______                                       By
