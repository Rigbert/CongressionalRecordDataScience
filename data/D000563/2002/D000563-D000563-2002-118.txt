I say this to the people at the White House who make up the schedule: Can you give us 4 hours a week on the economy? Pick the 4 hours and let's talk about it in realistic terms. Let's talk about health security 1 hour a week. Can we do that? Can the White House find time in the busy schedule of dealing with national security and making campaign trips to raise money for candidates to give us 1 hour a week to talk about health care? I don't think that is too much to ask. And I think Congress ought to reciprocate. We ought to be answering in terms of what we can do to try to lift the burden, whether it is the cost of prescription drugs or the cost of health insurance for businesses and families across America.
