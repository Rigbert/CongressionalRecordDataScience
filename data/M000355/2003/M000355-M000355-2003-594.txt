 President, I do not intend to delay consideration of the U.S.-Singapore free-trade agreement, but I do want to take a moment to highlight a significant step that Singapore can take today to further the cause of freedom in Burma.  It has been reported, by U.N. Special Envoy Razali Ismail and others, that the repressive and illegitimate State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, has assets tucked away in Singapore financial institutions. Given the many illicit activities of the SPDC, one can rightfully question the source of these funds.  Like the United States, Singapore should immediately freeze the SPDC's assets until such time that democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other all democrats are freed from detention and a process of national reconciliation is agreed to and implemented by all parties--the National League for Democracy, ethnic nationalities, and the SPDC.  Such action not only underscores Singapore's commitment to the rule of law throughout the region, but places much needed pressure on the junta in Rangoon to change their oppressive ways.  Southeast Asian countries can no longer ignore the many threats to regional stability posed by the generals in Burma. The situation in Burma should be a matter of concern to all of Burma's neighbors--and the U.N. Security Council.                          ____________________
