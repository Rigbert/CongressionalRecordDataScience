Chairman, I rise in support of the Norwood-Dingell bipartisan consensus bill.  Ann is a 60-year-old diabetic from Lake Station, IN who had always taken care of her condition. She refused to drink or smoke, and carefully monitored her insulin and sugar levels. However, the disease continued to progress and her doctor scheduled regular kidney tests to make sure that her kidney function did not deteriorate to emergency levels. Then Ann switched to a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), lured by promises of lower costs and prescription coverage. Her first primary care doctor continued the same regimen, keeping a close eye on her kidneys and monitoring her heart function and sugar levels as well. This doctor was dropped from the HMO. The new doctors she was allowed to see did not think regular testing was necessary. In fact, when Ann came down with an infected foot, a common symptom in diabetics whose condition is worsening, the approved doctors she visited were unmoved. Finally, a member of Ann's family realized she was in potential danger and took her to the emergency room. There she was found to be in congestive heart failure. She was also anemic and her kidney function had dropped to a dangerous level. The painful process of kidney dialysis became necessary. Several days later, Ann received a call from her HMO. Although her daughter had taken her to an approved hospital, neither the emergency room physician nor the two specialists she saw were on the approved list. Ann was forced to pay out of pocket for this emergency care.  Sadly, Ann's case is not unique. Certainly, many HMOs provide excellent medical care at a reasonable cost. However, there are far too many which routinely abuse their members, refuse to pay for necessary treatments, and, in many cases, prevent doctors from conducting treatments that they consider too costly.  Ann's story and others' from Northwest Indiana demonstrate just how desperately we need to reform the managed care industry. Ibelieve doctors and patients should make decisions about health care, not insurance company bureaucrats. That is why I support the Norwood-Dingell Bipartisan Consensus Bill.  Certainly not all HMOs abuse their patients, but there are far too many horror stories from real patients to think all HMOs act in a responsible and reasonable manner. The Norwood-Dingell bill will set a standard in which emergency room coverage is guaranteed as long as the prudent layperson considers the situation an emergency. Along with guaranteed emergency room care the Norwood-Dingell bill outlines common sense patient protections that provide access to specialty care, continuity of care, opportunities for patient grievances and appeals, and accountability for decisions made by HMOs regarding patient care.  This bill has the support of approximately 300 organizations, including the American Medical Association and the American Public Health Association. I am glad to see that the leadership of the House has finally addressed this important issue. I have been fighting to see that real HMO reforms be addressed in the House for the past three years. I am glad to see that we finally will be allowed a straight up or down vote on real HMO reform.                              {time}  1900
