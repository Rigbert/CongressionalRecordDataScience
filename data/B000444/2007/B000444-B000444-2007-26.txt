 President, I thank my colleagues for their courtesy.  Mr. President amendment No. 3142 is very simple. It provides the $23.6 billion in funding needed to replace every Army up-armored HMMWV in Iraq with a mine resistant ambush protected, or MRAP, vehicle.  It is exactly the same thing we did on the authorization bill that was passed Monday night.  Our commanders in the field tell us that MRAPs will reduce casualties by 67 to 80 percent.
