President, on May 8, 2003, John F. Potter, Postmaster General of the United States will formally designate and rededicate the post office in Shawneetown, IL in honor of Einar V. Dyhrkopp. This public distinction will recognize the exemplary contributions of Einar Dyhrkopp in his decade of service as a member of the Postal Service Board of Governors. This is certainly a fitting way to publicly express our gratitude to Governor Dyhrkopp for his commitment and dedication to the Postal Service by naming the post office in his hometown in his honor.  Governor Dyhrkopp was appointed a Governor to the U.S. Postal Service Board of Governors by President William J. Clinton on November 24, 1993. He served in this capacity with distinction until December 2002. During his tenure, he served as a member of the Capital Projects and Compensation Committees; Chairman of the Audit and Finance Committee; Vice Chairman; and Chairman of the Board of Governors for two terms.  Among the accomplishments of the Postal Service during his period of service was an unprecedented 5 straight years of positive net income for the Postal Service. In addition, the Postal Service improved performance to the point where 94 percent of first-class mail destined for next-day delivery received overnight service through most of the country. Also, the Postal Service achieved breakthroughs in productivity which allowed the Postal Service to reduce its workforce through attrition. Finally, the Postal Service created a comprehensive Transformation Plan, proposing a new business model that would maintain universal service and strengthen the mail system.  Governor Dyhrkopp is President of Tecumseh International Corporation, a coal marketing firm. Recently, he retired from an active banking career after nearly 35 years of service. Dyhrkopp's interests extend to agriculture, and he has been a livestock and grain farmer. In addition, Governor Dyhrkopp has initiated land development and managed a construction company specializing in commercial and housing building. For 22 years, he was chief executive officer and partner of a southern Illinois manufacturing firm specializing in electronic cabinetry for leading American firms.  A former mayor of Shawneetown, Governor Dyhrkopp has served on several State of Illinois commissions, most recently the Commission on the Future of Afro-American Males. Dyhrkopp is also a member of the Regional Advisory Board of the Southern Illinois University Public Policy Institute.  During World War II, Governor Dyhrkopp served in the Navy on the destroyer-minelayer U.S.S. Aaron Ward, DM 34, which endured major suicide plane damage at the Battle of Okinawa.  Governor Dyhrkopp is married to Francis Lambert Saunders and they are the parents of one son and three grandchildren. In addition to his rewarding family life, Einar is a member of the American Legion, the Masonic Lodge, the Scottish Rites Bodies, the Shrine, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars.  Governor Dyhrkopp's contributions to the United States Postal Service and the Shawneetown community deserve special and lasting recognition. I have admired his dedication and appreciated his friendship.  In the words of my friend Senator Paul Simon, ``Einar Dyhrkopp represents responsible citizenship at its best. He has aided his community and provided leadership on the State and national scene. He has gone out of his way to help those who need assistance.''  Establishing the Einar V. Dyhrkopp Post Office in Shawneetown, IL, will ensure that Governor Dyhrkopp's exemplary service to his community and Nation is properly and publicly acknowledged.                          ____________________
