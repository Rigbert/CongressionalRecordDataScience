 President, I want to briefly address two issues that have been raised by the President and by the opponents of this legislation. I honestly believe, compared to the many substantial victories for the Senate position in this legislation, these two issues fall short of justifying a change in the overwhelming support bankruptcy reform has received in the last two sessions of Congress.  First, there is the issue of this homestead cap. I heard people on the floor voting, saying: There is no protection in here, no protection at all. You just let people get away. You allow the Burt Reynolds of the world to go out there and buy multimillion-dollar homes and then declare bankruptcy. This is unfair.  First of all, do you think any of the creditors want that to happen? The companies are concerned about this, along with interest groups that are concerned about this. And on the consumer side, do you think they want people being able to escape having to pay what they owe because they are able to bury assets in a multimillion-dollar home?  So where is this coming from? First, the homestead cap. One of the most egregious examples of abuse under the current law is the ability of wealthy individuals, on the eve of filing forbankruptcy, having the ability to shelter their income from legitimate creditors by buying an expensive home in one of a handful of States that have an unlimited homestead exemption in bankruptcy. This is one of the most egregious abuses, but it is actually pretty rare, involving only a few of the millions of bankruptcies that have been filed in recent years. Nevertheless, it is an abuse that should be eliminated.  There are reasons that the Senate included a strong provision. That was a hard cap of $100,000 in the value of a home; that is, if your home was worth more than $100,000, your creditors could go after the remainder of that money, but if it was $100,000 or less, your creditors could not get it because we have a principle in this country of not taking away your home based on bankruptcy.  This provision, though, was struck by the House. They did not like the hard cap of $100,000. So what we did was we reached a compromise to avoid the worst abuses as a last-minute move to shelter assets from creditors. That last-minute move to avoid legitimate debts has been eliminated.  To be eligible under any State's homestead exemption, a bankruptcy filer must have lived in that State for the last 2 years before filing. If you buy a home within 2 years of filing, your exemption is capped at $100,000. Put another way, you have to have a pretty good estate plan in order to escape bankruptcy by buying a multimillion-dollar home.  You have to know, under the law, if we had passed it today--and 2 years from now you go bankrupt--so you go out 2 years ahead of time and move into a State that allows you to buy a multimillion-dollar home to escape bankruptcy. So you move into that State 2 years ahead of time, and 2 years ahead of time you buy the home. You take all your assets that you are worried it is going to cost you, and you put them into a home.  Let me tell the Senate, that is a pretty good plan. I don't know how many people know over 2 years ahead of time that they are going to go bankrupt and take all their money out and put it into a home. Granted, I would prefer a hard cap, but the truth is, if you don't buy the home 2 years prior to declaring bankruptcy, the cap is $100,000. So there are a lot of canards that have been used to defeat this cloture motion. I might say to my colleagues, if they want to eliminate the worst abuse of the homestead exemption, then they should have voted for the conference report.  That brings me to the last major issue, the one that has, unfortunately, generated a lot more heat than light. That is what we have come to call--and I saw my colleague a moment ago--the Schumer amendment, because of the energy and dedication of my friend and worthy opponent, in this case--hardly ever in any other case--Senator Schumer. We all know of the confrontations, sometimes peaceful, sometimes tragically violent, that have occurred in recent years between pro-life and pro-choice groups over access to family planning clinics. Because of the threat to the constitutional right of the people who run those clinics and their patrons, Congress, with my support and President Clinton's signature, passed a bill, the strongest proponent of which was the Senator from New York, the Free Access to Clinic Entrances Act of 1993. The law makes it a crime punishable by fines as well as imprisonment to block access to family planning clinics.  Some of those who have been arrested and prosecuted under the law have brazenly announced that they plan to declare bankruptcy to escape the consequences of their crimes, specifically to avoid paying damages. Some of those individuals have, in fact, filed bankruptcy. But in no case--in no case that I am aware of or anyone else can show me or no case that the Congressional Research Service was able to find--has any individual escaped paying a single dollar of liability by filing bankruptcy. Not a dollar, not a dime, not a penny, it hasn't happened. I don't believe it will happen.  The reason is simple: Current bankruptcy law already states that such settlements for ``willful and malicious conduct'' are not dischargeable in bankruptcy. If that were not enough, current case law supports a very strong reading of the provisions of the current law. When one clinic demonstrator who violated a restraining order attempted to have a settlement against her be wiped out in bankruptcy, her claim was rejected out of hand by the court. The violation of the restraining order setting physical limits around the clinic has been ruled to be willful and malicious under the current code. The penalties assessed against the violator were not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record a letter from the Congressional Research Service confirming, as of October 26, that an exhaustive authoritative search did not reveal any reported decisions where such liability was discharged under U.S. bankruptcy code.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                   Congressional Research Service,                                          Library of Congress,                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2000.                               memorandum     To: Hon. Charles Grassley, Attention: John McMickle     From: Robin Jeweler, Legislative Attorney, American Law        Division     Subject: Westlaw/LEXIS survey of bankruptcy cases under 11        U.S.C. Sec. 523.       This confirms our phone conversation of October 25, 2000.      You requested a comprehensive online survey of reported      decisions considering the dischargeability of liability      incurred in connection with violence at reproductive health      clinics by abortion protesters. Our search did not reveal any      reported decisions where such liability was discharged under      the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.       The only reported decision identified by the search is      Buffalo Gyn Womenservices, Inc. v. Behn (In re Behn), 242      B.R. 229 (Bankr. W.D.N.Y. 1999). In this case, the bankruptcy      court held that a debtor's previously incurred civil      sanctions for violation of a temporary restraining order      (TRO) creating a buffer zone outside the premises of an      abortion service provider was nondischargeable under 11      U.S.C. Sec. 523(a)(6), which excepts claims for ``willful and      malicious'' injury. The court surveyed the extant and      somewhat discrepant standards for finding ``willful and      malicious'' conduct articulated by three federal circuit      courts of appeals. It granted the plaintiff's motion for      summary judgment and denied the debtor/defendant's motion to      retry the matter before the bankruptcy court. Specifically,      the court held:       ``[W]hen a court of the United States issues an injunction      or other protective order telling a specific individual what      actions will cross the line into injury to others, then      damages resulting from an intentional violation of that order      (as is proven either in the bankruptcy court or (so long as      there was a full and fair opportunity to litigate the      question of volition and violation) in the issuing court) are      ipso facto the result of a `willful and malicious injury.'      ''--242 B.R. at 238.
