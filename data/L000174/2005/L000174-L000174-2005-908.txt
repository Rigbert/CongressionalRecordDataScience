President, this morning we have heard many excellent speeches. I commend my colleague from Vermont, Mr. Jeffords, for his statement. Yesterday I listened to Senators Feinstein, Schumer, Kennedy, Mikulski, Dayton and Stabenow on our side, and I thought their statements were very good. Both Senator Durbin of Illinois and I were at a hearing this morning and left to come over here. I think his statement was straightforward and comprehensive and compelling. I appreciate what has been said.  I have also listened to the statements of those who support this nominee, most from the other side. I would say one thing, I am glad that none of them are defending torture. I never expected they would. None of them defend what happened at Abu Ghraib. I didn't expect they would. None of them are defending the Bybee memorandum, with its narrow legalistic interpretation of the torture statute. I never thought any of them would.  None of them defend the outrageous claim that the President of the United States is above the law. I don't know how anybody could defend that position. One of the things we have learned, from the first George W., George Washington, to the current President, is that no President is above the law, not even this one. None of us are. Senators are not. Judges are not. Nobody is.  In fact, some of the people who have spoken have been explicitly critical of the Bybee memo. Unfortunately, the nominee has not joined in that criticism. Instead, he told me at his hearing that he agreed with its conclusions. We know that for at least 2 years he did not disagree with the secret policy of this administration.  Water flows downhill and so does Government policy in this administration. Somewhere in the upper reaches of this administration a process was set in motion that rolled forward until it produced scandalous results.  We may never know the full story. The administration circled the wagons. They stonewalled requests for information from both Republicans and Democrats. What little we do know, we know because the press has done a far, far, far better job of oversight than the Congress itself. We know it from international human rights organizations because they have done a far better job of oversight than Congress has. We owe it to a few internal Defense Department investigations, and of course the Freedom of Information Act litigation. Thank goodness we have the Freedom of Information Act, because Congress, this Congress especially, both bodies, has fallen down for years on their oversight responsibility. It failed, actually refused, to do oversight of an administration of their own party. It is fortunate the Freedom of Information Act is there.  Every administration, Democrat and Republican, will tell you all the things they believe they have done right. None will tell you the things they believe they have done wrong. Normally it is the job of the Congress to root that out. We have not been doing our job. Fortunately the press and others, through the Freedom of Information Act, have.  Despite repeated requests both before and during and after judge Gonzales's confirmation hearing, there is much we still do not know. We gave this nominee every possibility before, during, and after his hearing to clarify this. I even sent to him and to the Republicans on the committee, well in advance of the hearing, a description of the types of questions I would ask on this particular matter so there would be no surprises and so that he would have a chance to answer them. He didn't.  We do know that he was chairing meetings and requesting memos and checking up on those memos as various Government agencies were being tasked with eroding long-established U.S. policy on torture.  Just this week, the New York Times reported the Justice Department produced a second torture memo to address the legality of specific interrogation techniques proposed by the CIA. So much for the proponents' argument that these memoranda were research memos with little real-world impact.  That second torture memo, which the administration refused to provide to the Judiciary Committee, reportedly used the very narrow and thus permissive interpretation of the torture statute outlined in the first memorandum. The administration will not come clean from behind the stone wall it has constructed to deter accountability for its actions. Does anyone believe this memo was generated without knowledge of the White House, without its approval?  The President said he chose Judge Gonzales because of his sound judgment in shaping the administration's terrorism policies. But the glimpses we have seen of secret policy formulations and legal rationales that have come to light show that his judgements have not been sound.  Look at his role with respect to the Bybee memo. This is the memo that noted legal scholar Dean Koh of the Yale Law School called, ``perhaps the most clearly erroneous legal opinion I have ever read.'' He went on to say it is ``a stain upon our law and our national reputation.''  In remarks yesterday, Republican Senators, quite correctly in my view and the view of many others who studied it, said the Bybee memo was ``erroneous in its legal conclusions. . . .'' They call the memo's interpretation of what constitutes torture ``very, very extreme . . . certainly not a realistic or adequate definition of torture which would withstand legal analysis or legal scrutiny.''  I commend them for doing that. I commend them for saying the memorandum was ``extreme and excessive in its statement and articulation of executive power.'' I would feel far better ifthe man who they are supporting for Attorney General had taken the same position, as have many of my colleagues in the Senate, on both sides of the aisle.  Even supporters of Judge Gonzales distance themselves from the Bybee memo's conclusion that the President has authority to immunize those who violate the law knowing that ``certainly is not lawful.''  These are the statements of Republican Senators, but they should not be confused with the statements of Judge Gonzales, who has refused to criticize its legalistic excuses for recalibrations of decades of law and practice.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of newspaper articles and editorials that bear on this nomination, including one that appears in today's Rutledge Herald, a prize-winning newspaper in Vermont.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, Feb. 2, 2005]                             No on Gonzalez       One of the best ways the U.S. Senate could assure the world      that the United States is serious about democracy and human      rights would be to reject the nomination of Alberto Gonzalez      as attorney general.       The Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee were united      in opposing Gonzalez, who received a vote of 10-8 from the      committee. Sen. Patrick Leahy, ranking Democrat on the      committee, was firm in opposition to Gonzalez. Democrats have      flirted with the idea of a filibuster to block Gonzalez's      confirmation, but on Tuesday they rejected that idea.       It is a difficult to understand how the Arab world or      anyone else could take seriously President Bush's high-flown      rhetoric on behalf of freedom or democracy if Gonzalez became      part of his cabinet. Gonzalez has become known as Mr.      Torture. His low-key, equable manner before the committee      should not disguise the fact that during long hours of      testimony he refused to say that it was illegal for the      president to authorize torture of prisoners in the hands of      the U.S. military.       It is well known that Gonzalez was the author of memos      defining the ways that it was permissible for U.S. troops to      torture their captives. He was behind numerous policies since      ruled unconstitutional and illegal, such as the detention of      prisoners without charge and without access to a lawyer. He      was behind the military tribunals established to deal with      prisoners at the Guantanamo naval base, which have also been      thrown out by the courts.       Continuing revelations reveal that torture and other      mistreatment were the work of more than a few miscreants at      Abu Ghraib in Iraq. The International Red Cross has charged      that torture of prisoners is widespread. New reports continue      to emerge, such as that describing the sexual taunting of      prisoners by female interrogators. It is degrading for the      prisoners and for the U.S. military, and it shows the world a      face of the United States that ought to shame all Americans.       Is Alberto Gonzalez responsible for these violations? Yes.      He is not alone, of course. President Bush bears ultimate      responsibility, and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld is      culpable as well. But Gonzalez was responsible for the      twisted interpretations that gave a legal gloss to policies      that spread from Guantanamo to Iraq and Afghanistan.       Gonzalez is likely to win approval from the Senate. As      Leahy noted at the time of Gonzalez's nomination, the present      Senate would probably give the nod to Attila the Hun. But a      strong voice of disapproval by senators concerned about the      way that Gonzalez and Bush have abused our democratic ideals      would remind the world that America is not unanimous in      support of the inhumane policies of the Bush administration.       Bush has pledged his support for democratic movements all      around the world. A no vote on the Gonzalez nomination would      show the world the United States, too, is struggling to be a      democracy.                                  ____             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 26, 2002]                     Gonzales Rewrites Laws of War                          (By Jeanne Cummings)       Washington.--Most people assume Attorney General John      Ashcroft is the Bush appointee responsible for legal      decisions that critics say place national security above      civil liberties. But the real architect of many of those      moves is someone most Americans have never heard of: White      House Counsel Alberto Gonzales.       Since the Sept. 11 attacks, the former commercial-real-     estate attorney from Texas has been rewriting the laws of      war. From his corner office in the White House, he developed      the legal underpinnings for presidential orders creating      military commissions, defining enemy combatants and dictating      the status and rights of prisoners held from Afghanistan      battles. And he may well hold the most sway in President      Bush's coming decision on whether to begin appointing      military commissions to prosecute Afghanistan war prisoners.       He believes he is striking the right balance between      American security and personal liberties. But his methods      have evoked outrage from the State Department and even the      Pentagon, which say they resent being cut out of the process.       Career Pentagon lawyers in the Judge Advocate General's      Office were furious that they read first in news reports that      Mr. Gonzales had devised the legal framework for military      commissions. National Security Council legal advisers      unsuccessfully tried in January to stall his controversial      decision asserting that the Geneva Convention didn't apply to      Afghanistan detainees. And Secretary of State Colin Powell      launched an intense internal campaign to undo that decision.       ``Essentially, a bunch of strangers are deciding the issues      and you're outside the door not being heard,'' complains      retired Rear Adm. John Hutson, who served as the Navy's judge      advocate general until 2000 and who remains close to his      former colleagues at the Pentagon.       The 47-year-old Harvard Law School graduate remains secure      in his post mainly for one reason: President Bush. ``I love      him dearly'' was how Mr. Bush introduced his former Texas      chief counsel last year. Because of that bond, Mr. Gonzales      is considered a likely candidate for nomination to the U.S.      Supreme Court.       What makes the San Antonio native's role remarkable is his      willingness to go toe-to-toe against Defense Secretary Donald      Rumsfeld's department lawyers and Mr. Powell himself--to try      to bend powerful insiders to the will of his client, Mr.      Bush. Mr. Gonzales is the president's final sounding board      on issues that in previous administrations were largely      handled by experts in the National Security Council or the      departments of State and Defense. ``There is a reason you      have trusted aides in key positions. It's to get their      judgment after hearing everyone else's judgment,'' says      Dan Bartlett, the president's communications director.       The way Mr. Gonzales sees it, the war on terrorism requires      a re-examination of the conventional rules, and it is his job      to push Congress, the courts, and the international community      to do that. ``Some of these principles have never been      addressed in a court of law,'' says Mr. Gonzales. ``People      think it is obvious that an American citizen, for example,      would have a right to counsel if detained as an enemy      combatant. But that's not so obvious.''       Before Sept. 11, Mr. Gonzales's only brush with the Geneva      Conventions was in death-penalty appeals, such as the 1997      case of Mexican native Tristan Montoya. Under the Geneva      agreement, Mr. Montoya had a right to contact his consulate      office, but Texas authorities failed to inform him of that      right. Mr. Gonzales argued that omission wasn't significant      enough to overturn Mr. Montoya's murder-robbery conviction.      He asserted Texas was under no obligation to enforce the      agreement anyway since the state wasn't a party in ratifying      it. Mr. Montoya was executed and the U.S. State Department      sent a letter of apology to Mexico for the agreement's      violation.       After the terrorist attacks, Mr. Gonzales took a new look      at those agreements. The reference book ``The Laws of War''      is the newest addition to his research shelf. It was given to      him by John Yoo, a former University of California, Berkeley      professor now serving in the Justice Department's Office of      Legal Council. Mr. Yoo built a formidable reputation in elite      international law academic circles--the ``academy'' as they      call themselves--for his provocative writings asserting      profound presidential powers during time of war. He quickly      became the White House counsel office's ``go to guy,'' says      Mr. Gonzales.       But the Gonzales team's first venture into the      international-law arena was a rocky one. On Nov. 13, 2001,      Mr. Bush announced his intention to revive World War II-style      military commissions. He released a framework that excluded      explicit assurances of unanimous verdicts, rights to appeal,      public trials, and a standard of proof beyond a reasonable      doubt. The legal community--particularly military experts--     exploded.       Over the next four months, Pentagon attorneys, who had      complained about being kept out of the loop, wrote      regulations for the commissions that guaranteed most of those      rights. Still lacking, critics say, is the right to appeal to      an outside court. ``Our political leaders just can't have the      ultimate say on guilt and innocence,'' says Tom Malinowski, a      Washington advocate and director of Human Rights Watch.       Mr. Gonzales was ``surprised'' by the sharp reaction to the      commission ruling, but acknowledged it may have been written      and released too hastily. He says he conducts wide-ranging      consultations, but that there are times when others within      the administration just don't agree with his final      recommendation for action.       Two months after the commission order, Mr. Gonzales was      readying another critical wartime recommendation--that the      president deny Geneva Convention coverage to detainees housed      in a makeshift prison in Cuba's Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.      National Security Council lawyers tried to slow the order,      but, on Jan. 18, Mr. Bush adopted that stand. ``They are not      going to become POWs,'' Mr. Gonzales said.       The move immediately drew objections from the State      Department. Mr. Powell, fearing captured U.S. servicemen or      spies could face reprisals, demanded the president     reconsider the ruling. The secretary's discomfort was      compounded by a Jan. 25 memo written by Mr. Gonzales that      misstated Mr. Powell's position and concluded that the      secretary's arguments for ``reconsideration and reversal are      unpersuasive.''       Mr. Powell argued that while the detainees didn't deserve      prisoner-of-war status, the administration must use the      Geneva Conventions to reach that conclusion. After two      intense NSC meetings, Mr. Bush opted to reverse course--but,      for Mr. Gonzales, it was only a technical loss.       Today, federal judges are grappling with Mr. Gonzales's      interpretation of the rights of U.S. citizens, the ``enemy      combatants,'' who have been held for months without charges      or access to attorneys. That is an issue that is unlikely to      be resolved until it reaches the Supreme Court.       Mr. Gonzales readily admits the White House might lose some      ground in those court cases. While being ``respectful'' of      constitutional rights, the administration's job ``at the end      of the day'' is ``to protect the country,'' he says.      ``Ultimately, it is the job of the courts to tell us whether      or not we've drawn the lines in the right places.''                                  ____               [From the National Journal, Nov. 13, 2004]          Opening Argument--The Problem With Alberto Gonzales                         (By Stuart Taylor Jr.)       White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales is an amiable man with      an inspiring personal story. One of eight children of      uneducated Mexican-American immigrants, he grew up in a Texas      house with no hot water or telephone. He would be the first      Hispanic attorney general. He has the complete trust of the      president, whom he has loyally served for four years in      Washington, and in Texas before that. He is far less divisive      and confrontational than the departing John Ashcroft.       The problem with Gonzales is that he has been deeply      involved in developing some of the most sweeping claims of      near-dictatorial presidential power in our nation's history.      These claims put President Bush literally above the law,      allowing him to imprison and even (at least in theory)      torture anyone in the world, at any time, for any reason that      Bush associates with national security. Specifically:       Gonzales played a central role in developing Bush's claim      of unlimited power to seize suspected ``enemy combatants''--     including American citizens--from the streets or homes of      America or any other nation, for indefinite, incommunicado      detention and interrogation, without meaningful judicial      review or access to lawyers.       He presided over the preparation of the poorly drafted      November 2001 Bush order establishing ``military      commissions'' to try suspected foreign terrorists for war      crimes.       He signed the January 25, 2002, memo to the president      arguing that the 1949 Geneva Conventions offer no protection      to any prisoners seized in Afghanistan; the memo dismissed      some of the Geneva provisions as ``quaint.'' This memo      signaled Bush's break--over vigorous objections from      Secretary of State Colin Powell--with the generous      interpretation of the Geneva Conventions used under every      president from Harry Truman through Bill Clinton. It also led      to Bush's refusal to provide the individual hearings      required, both by Geneva and by Army regulations, for the      hundreds of alleged ``unlawful combatants'' at his Guantanamo      Bay prison camp.       He was the addressee of, and apparently had a role in      vetting, the August 1, 2002, Justice Department memo      asserting that the commander-in-chief has virtually unlimited      power to authorize indiscriminate use of torture in wartime      interrogations--tearing off fingernails, branding prisoners'      genitals with red-hot pokers, you name it.       Here is how these profoundly unwise claims have worked out:       The no-due-process ``enemy combatant'' policy brought Bush      an 8-1 rebuff from the Supreme Court on June 28, in Hamdi v.      Rumsfeld. The majority asserted that ``a state of war is not      a blank check for the president.'' Antonin Scalia, the      justice whom Bush has said he most admires, stressed in a      concurrence that ``the very core of liberty secured by our      Anglo-Saxon system of separated powers has been freedom from      indefinite imprisonment at the will of the executive.''       The ``military commissions'' have been a fiasco in practice      (as detailed in my September 11, 2004, column) and were held      to be unlawful in important respects on November 8 by Judge      James Robertson of the U.S. District Court for the District      of Columbia. (The administration plans to appeal.)       Bush's spurning of the Geneva Conventions and refusal to      provide hearings for Guantanamo detainees probably explain      his 6-3 defeat in another June 28 Supreme Court decision,      Rasul v. Bush, which rejected Bush's claim of power to detain      non-Americans at Guantanamo without answering to any court.      And Judge Robertson wrote that the administration ``has      asserted a position starkly different from the positions and      behavior of the United States in previous conflicts, one that      can only weaken the United States' own ability to demand      application of the Geneva Conventions to Americans captured      during armed conflicts abroad.''       The Justice Department torture memo, together with a      similar Pentagon memo in March 2003 and the Abu Ghraib      photos, have brought the United States worldwide opprobrium      for authorizing torture as official policy (which Bush did      not do) while making the CIA and the military newly wary of      using even mild, legally defensible forms of coercion to      extract information from captured terrorists.       If Senate Democrats (and Republicans) are not too cowed by      Bush's election victories to do their jobs, the confirmation      proceeding for Gonzales will drag us more deeply than ever      through the torture memos, Abu Ghraib, the evidence of      torture and killing of prisoners by U.S. forces in      Afghanistan, and all that. Will that be good for Gonzales?      For Bush? For the country?       At the very least, Democrats should demand a full      accounting of Gonzales's role in the development of these      torture memos. And when Bush claims confidentiality, the      answer should be: If you must cloak in secrecy your counsel's      role in shaping your own grandiose claims of power, then      don't ask us to confirm him.       Here is a far-from-complete history of the torture memos,      as reconstructed from anonymous sources and news reports:       The CIA began using various forms of duress to extract      information from captured Qaeda leaders overseas in late 2001      and early 2002. But agency officials were concerned that they      might be prosecuted by some future administration or      independent counsel, and that the CIA itself might be      attacked for abusing its powers, as it was during the 1970s.      So CIA Director George Tenet requested a legal memo assuring      interrogators and their superiors sweeping presidential      protection from any future prosecution under an anti-torture      law that Congress had adopted in 1994 to comply with the      United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel,      Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.       The task was assigned to the Justice Department's Office of      Legal Counsel. The Bush-appointed head of OLC, Jay Bybee, now      a federal judge, and some other Justice Department and White      House lawyers were reluctant to make such a bold and      unprecedented claim of presidential power. But under apparent      pressure from their superiors, Bybee and his staff produced      the August 1, 2002, memo, addressed to Gonzales. Earlier      drafts had been carefully vetted by the offices of Gonzales,      Ashcroft, and David Addington, Vice President Cheney's      counsel.       I have been unable to determine how deeply Gonzales was      involved in the details. The Senate should demand to know.       Aside from the OLC memo's indefensible claims of      presidential power to order torture, it also claims that      rough treatment of prisoners does not even fit the definition      of torture unless ``equivalent in intensity to the pain      accompanying serious physical injury, such as organ failure,      impairment of bodily function, or even death.''       There is no evidence that the administration ever approved      ``torture,'' as thus defined, as a matter of policy. It did      approve a number of highly coercive, still-classified      interrogation methods, such as feigning suffocation and      subjecting prisoners to sleep deprivation and ``stress      positions,'' which apparently helped extract valuable      information from Qaeda leaders. And in 2003, the Pentagon      adopted the Justice Department's analysis--initially devised      for CIA interrogations of a few high-level terrorists--to      justify coercive interrogations of prisoners at Guantanamo      and, later, in Iraq. This came despite strong objections from      top military lawyers, based on their long-standing view that      rough interrogation methods are ineffective, arguably      illegal, and likely to become indiscriminate and excessive.       How much all of this had to do with bringing about the now-     documented torture, abuses, and killings of prisoners in Iraq      and Afghanistan is in dispute. What's clear is that the      leaked torture memos, as well as the Abu Ghraib photos,      disgraced our nation--so much so that Gonzales and other      White House officials, at a June 22 news conference, sought      to blame the OLC lawyers for what Gonzales called their      memo's ``overbroad'' and ``unnecessary'' passages. The Senate      should now explore whether (as has been suggested to me) the      OLC lawyers had only been following orders from the same      White House officials who later ran for cover.       This is not to deny the difficulty of the issues presented      to Gonzales and his colleagues by the unprecedented magnitude      of the terrorist threat. Nor is it to deny the need for      judicious use of preventive detention and coercive      interrogation techniques (short of torture) to prevent mass      murders. But the torture memos are emblematic of a Bush White      House that has consistently failed to strike a wise balance      between the demands of security and of liberty.       Gonzales's role in all of this appears to be to tell Bush      what Bush wants to hear. With the dubious benefit of such      advice, Bush has not only shown little appreciation for civil      liberties but also provoked a judicial and international      backlash that has hurt the war on terrorism. Gonzales does      have many fine qualities. But is this the attorney general we      need?                                  ____               [From the Washington Times, Jan. 24, 2005]                       Abu Ghraib Accountability                            (By Nat Hentoff)       Although there was considerable media coverage of Alberto      Gonzales's confirmation hearing for attorney general, a look      at the full transcript still raises, for me, serious      questions about his fitness to be our chief law enforcement      officer.       At the start, Mr. Gonzales told the senators and the rest      of us: ``I think it is important to stress at the outset that      I am and will remain deeply committed to ensuring that the      United States government complies with all of its legal      obligations as it fights the war on terror, whether those      obligations arise from domestic or international law. These      obligations include, of course, honoring Geneva Conventions      whenever they apply.''       Sen. Ted Kennedy asked the nominee if the media reports      were accurate that Mr. Gonzales had chaired meetings that      covered specific ways to make detainees talk. For example,      having them feel they were about to be drowned or buried      alive. Mr. Gonzales answered: ``I have a recollection that we      had some discussions in my office.'' But, he said, ``it is      not my job to decide which types of methods of obtaining      information from terrorists would be most effective. That job      falls to folks within the agencies.''       So, ``the agencies,'' including the CIA, can do whatever      they consider effective; and Mr. Gonzales suggests that he      had no role as to the lawfulness of those methods when he was      counsel to the president, our commander in chief? Should he      not have told the president that the Geneva Convention      Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading      Treatment or Punishment forbids ``any act by which severe      pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is      intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as      obtaining from him or a third person information or a      confession''? And should he not have been interested in      trying to find out how many of those detainees had been      sufficiently screened when captured in order to indicate      whether they actually were terrorists or suspects or      indiscriminately rounded up?       Sen. Russ Feingold asked Mr. Gonzales whether the president      has ``the authority to authorize violations of the criminal      law under duly enacted statutes (by Congress) simply because      he's commander in chief.'' Mr. Gonzales said: ``To the extent      that there is a decision made to ignore a statute, I consider      that a very significant decision, and one that I would      personally be involved with . . . with a great deal of care      and seriousness.'' ``Well,'' Mr. Feingold said, ``that sounds      to me like the president still remains above the law.'' When      Mr. Kennedy asked the same question, Mr. Gonzales said it was      ``a very, very difficult question.'' So, what does he believe      about the separation of powers?       Another question from Mr. Kennedy: ``Do you believe that      targeting persons based on their religion or national origin      rather than specific suspicion or connection with      terrorist organizations is an effective way of fighting      terrorism? And can we get interest from you [that[, as      attorney general, you'd review the so-called anti-     terrorism programs that have an inordinate and unfair      impact on Arab and Muslim?'' Mr. Gonzales responded: ``I      will commit to you that I will review it. As to whether or      not it's effective will depend on the outcome of my      review.'' But Mr. Gonzales didn't answer the first crucial      part of the question: Is targeting people based on      religion, without specific suspicion, effective? And, I      would add, isn't it broadly discriminatory?       Asked by Sen. Patrick Leahy about increasing reports of      abuse of detainees in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Mr. Gonzales      said: ``I categorically condemn the conduct that we see      reflected in these pictures at Abu Ghraib.       ``I would refer you to the eight complete investigations of      what happened at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, and there are      still three ongoing,'' he added. But none of the      investigations have gone so far up the chain of command as      the Defense Department and the Justice Department to      determine the accountability of high-level policy-makers      there.       As The Washington Post noted in a lead editorial on Jan. 7,      ``The record of the past few months suggests that the      administration will neither hold any senior official      accountable nor change the policies that have produced this      shameful record.'' Nor did the senators ask themselves about      Stuart Taylor's charge in the Jan. 8 National Journal that      ``Congress continues to abdicate its constitutional      responsibility to provide a legislative framework'' for the      treatment of detainees. The White House strongly resists      Congress' involvement.       ``No longer,'' Mr. Taylor insisted, ``should executive fiat      determine such matters as how much evidence is necessary to      detain such suspects (and) how long they can be held without      criminal charges.'' As U.S. attorney general, will Mr.      Gonzales move to reinstate the constitutional separation of      powers to prevent further shame to the United States for the      widespread abuses of detainees under the executive branch's      parallel legal system of which Alberto Gonzales was a      principal architect?
