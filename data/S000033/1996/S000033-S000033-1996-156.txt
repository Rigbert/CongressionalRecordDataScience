 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Andrea Jaquith, a high school student from Brattleboro, VT, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       The phenomenon of gangs and gang violence is widespread      throughout this country, and is spreading rapidly and fast      becoming a societal problem of great magnitude. Some people      blame the gang problems on the poverty that this country is      struggling with. With the possible exception of some states      in the Northeast, every state now has some sort of gang      problem. In 1961, there were about 23 cities in the U.S. with      known street gangs. Today, there are at least 187 different      cities with known street gangs. In 1992, there were an      estimated 4,881 gangs in the U.S.       L.A. County in California is the gang capital of the      nation. In 1991, there were 150,000 persons in 1,000 gangs in      L.A. County. John Pole of Emerge Magazine said, ``If you      could eliminate the narcotics problem tomorrow, you would      still have a significant gang problem. If the next day you      eliminated the gang problem, you'd still have a significant      crack problem.''       Guns, ``gas traps'' or ``toolies''--whatever you choose to      call them--firearms are a major part of gangs and violence,      in general, today with American youths. Gunshot wounds are      the leading cause of death for all teenage boys in America.      Guns kill 14 kids in America every day. It is estimated that      one out of 25 African-American male children now in      kindergarten will be murdered with a gun by the age of 18. In      a recent survey conducted, it was found that one in five H.S.      students carry a weapon with them. The vast majority of      juveniles get guns from their own homes, and the majority of      accidental shootings occur in homes where kids can easily get      guns. In a 1989 poll, nearly three out of five Americans own      a gun.       So many youths have firearms because of the perceived      absence of any other kind of power necessary to attain status      and wealth. 5,000 kids are killed by a gun every year in the      U.S. There's a trend that appears to be a weak economy and      scarcity of legitimate jobs for these young minority men--     that's why they tend to join gangs. Basic needs that kids get      by joining gangs are: structure, nurturing, economic      opportunity and a sense of belonging. Most kids join gangs      because that's what there is to join where they live--there      aren't sports teams that they can join,     and there aren't jobs that they can get because of the weak      economy--so that's why they turn to gangs.       There are two well-known gangs in Western U.S.; they're      known as the ``Crips'' and the ``Bloods;'' the Crips and the      Bloods are rivals in the Western U.S.--the Crips wear blue      and the Bloods wear red. There is a lot hatred between these      two gangs; a Blood will not ask for a cigarette because the      word begins with a c,' as in Crips. Instead, they ask for a      figarette.'' Parents are very fearful for their children's      lives when they go out to play or go to school; if they are      caught wearing the wrong colors, they could be misinterpreted      for belonging to a gang, and get hurt or killed. Parents      dress their children carefully in brown, yellow or other      neutral colors, and they avoid buying British Nike's brand      sneakers, because the initials have come to mean      ``bloodkiller,'' a sign of disrespect in a Blood      neighborhood. Nearly 50% of the Black male population age 21      through 24 is involved in some sort of gang activity. More      than 200,000 people live in South Central L.A., and most have      turned their homes into what look like jails: heavy metal-     grid bars across the windows and doors, their yards turned      into military compounds with wrought-iron fences, etc. They      do this to protect their property, their family and      themselves from gangs involvement.       Solutions to ending the gang problems of the U.S. are      difficult to come up with. Trying to attract the interest of      teenagers is also hard to do. Some suggestions have been:      recreational activities for the students to participate in      after school so they can stay off the streets. A way to bring      teenagers into the picture of helping out is by way of      teacher training. They need training to recognize gang      members (signal), and discourage their activities. Other than      recreational activities, there should be also an alternative      for those nonathletic students. There should be tighter      security--security officers at schools to deal with      troublesome students; increased discipline would mean      stricter enforcement of existing disciplinary rules. Metal      detectors are also a way of weeding out weapons, and in some      schools there's a truancy court that deals with people with      high absenteeism. There is also . . . alternative schools      with programs for disciplinary problem children. Former gang      members participate in community awareness campaigns. And one      last solution would be to control the unemployment by making      . . . more jobs available for students and young people.       Congressman Sanders: Andrea, thank you very much; that was      excellent. I'd like to ask you a very brief question, one      question: in your judgment, has the government or other      interests done a good job of controlling or eliminating youth      gangs in America?       Answer. I don't think so, because there's a lot of      unemployment out there, and that's why these teens are      turning to gangs, because they don't have anything to do. So      I think that the government should create more jobs for the      students to get involved with.       Congressman Sanders: Are you familiar with the Summer Youth      Employment Program?       Answer. A little bit.       Congressman Sanders: The Summer Youth Employment Program is      a Federal program which allows low- and middle-income      students to have summer jobs. It's a very important program,      in districts such as you were speaking about in Los Angeles,      where unemployment is very high. One of the things that I      should tell you, a little bit sadly, is we were fighting this      fight, but we think that the leadership in Congress is going      to eliminate the funding for the Summer Youth Employment      Program, which I think addresses some of the concerns that      you've raised.                          ____________________
