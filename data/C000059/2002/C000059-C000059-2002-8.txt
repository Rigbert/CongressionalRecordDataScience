Chairman, I commend Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member John Conyers for their work on bringing this important bipartisan legislation, H.R. 3231--The Barbara Jordan Immigration Reform and Accountability Act of 2002--to the House floor for consideration.  H.R. 3231 creates a new immigration system. It ensures that terrorist and illegal immigrants are kept out of our country. For too long our immigration system has been stuck in the dark ages allowing illegal immigrants and terrorists to slip silently into our nation. H.R. 3231 recognizes this and requires that Internet-based technologies be implemented to track immigration applications--technologies that can alert Americans now, not later when it's already to late, about illegal and terrorists threats to our liberties and homeland security.  Mr. Chairman, Americans have trusted and been patient with INS for far too long as they have attempted numerous internal reorganizations--reorganizations that have obviously not worked. INS's present mission to both administer immigration benefits and enforce immigration law is blatantly at odds with each other.  Therefore, today we vote today to abolish the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).  I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to recognize what Americans have already concluded--that American's immigration system needs a clear chain of command coupled with greater accountability. America demands an immigration system that secures our homeland by keeping illegal immigrants and terrorists out, while offering an efficient process for those legal immigrants coming to America to start a better life.  H.R. 3231 secures our American principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
