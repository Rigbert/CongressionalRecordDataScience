 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate complete its business today, it stand in adjournment until 9:30 a.m., Friday, April 11. I further ask unanimous consent that following the prayer and pledge, the morning hour be deemed expired, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day, and there then be a period for morning business until 10 a.m., with the time equally divided between Senator Hutchison and the minority leader or their designees.
