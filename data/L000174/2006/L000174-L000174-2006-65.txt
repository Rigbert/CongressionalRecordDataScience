President, we have recently been reminded of the tremendous threat to consumer privacy posed by what is known as phone pretexting--the use of fraud and deception to acquire consumer phone records. The investigation into pretexting at Hewlett-Packard is just the latest example of why there is a need to enact legislation to safeguard the privacy and security of Americans' sensitive personal data.  Consumer telephone records have become a hot commodity and this information is a treasure trove for those who would misuse it to make a profit or who exploit it for harmful purposes. More and more, this sensitive personal information is being collected, stored and disseminated without our knowledge or consent.  Last Spring, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported a bipartisan bill that would protect the privacy interests of millions of American consumers who use cell phones, by making the act of pretexting illegal. The Telephone Records and Privacy Protection Act--TRAPP Act--S. 2178, clarifies that it is illegal to use deception and fraud to obtain and sell confidential phone records. The bill ensures that the Department of Justice has the legal authority to seek criminal penalties and up to 10 years imprisonment for anyone who engages in pretexting. The legislation also preserves the rights of State and local governments to enforce their own privacy laws, to best protect the privacy rights of consumers.  In April, the House unanimously passed an essentially identical phone pretexting bill, H.R. 4709. The language used in that bill was worked out with Senators from both sides of the aisle before it was considered by the House, so that when adopted by the Senate it could be sent directly to the Presidentfor his signature. I have worked for months now to make progress on that bill and it has been cleared for passage twice by all Democratic Senators. First, we cleared it with an amendment that would have also passed the Second Chance Act and consensus court security measures. When Senate Republicans refused to clear that measure, Senate Democrats also cleared the bill for passage in the identical form that it passed the House and without any amendments. An anonymous Republican hold on the measure is preventing its passage.  I know of no legitimate reason for this delay. The Senate could pass this bill today and send it to the President to be signed into law. Instead of passing this bipartisan privacy legislation, it appears this Republican-led Congress will recess without acting on this bill--forcing millions of Americans to continue to play Russian roulette with their sensitive personal information.  This week the former chair of Hewlett Packard, Patricia Dunn, called on Congress to pass bright-line laws regarding phone pretexting to avoid a repeat of the fiasco at HP. The TRAPP Act would do exactly that. This bill would help shut down the growing black market for consumer telephone records.  I support this bill and I commend the bill's lead cosponsors in the Senate and the House--Senators Specter, Schumer and Durbin, and Representatives Lamar Smith and John Conyers--for their leadership on this privacy issue. I hope whoever is objecting on the Republican side will stop the needless delay of this legislation. If there is a legitimate concern, come forward and work with us.  The Senate should also act on a more comprehensive privacy bill that Chairman Specter and I have cosponsored--the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act, S. 1789. This important measure was favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee last November. But, the Republican Senate leadership would not allow this bill to be considered by this Congress either.  Our bill requires companies that have databases with sensitive personal information about Americans to establish and implement data privacy and security programs. The bill also requires data brokers to provide notice to consumers when their sensitive personal information has been compromised.  We have a bill that significantly advances the ball in protecting the privacy of all Americans, and I will continue to work to move this legislation toward passage.                          ____________________
