 President, I would like to pay tribute to a true legend in South Louisville, KY: PleasureRidge Park High School Baseball coach Bill Miller. The winningest coach in the history of the Kentucky High School Athletic Association, KHSAA, Bill unfortunately passed away after a yearslong struggle with cancer at 68.  Pleasure Ridge Park High School, or PRP as we all call it, was Bill's home away from home. He spent 50 years of his life there as a student, an assistant coach, and, ultimately, for nearly four decades, as head baseball coach. Working with the students, Bill influenced countless lives and helped prepare young people for adulthood. The school's athletic director Nick Waddell said, ``He was like a father to so many people.''  Bill attended the University of Alabama after graduating from PRP, playing baseball and one season of football. Leaving Tuscaloosa, Bill returned to his hometown and to his high school as an assistant coach. Then, in 1980, Bill was named PRP's second head baseball coach.  For the next 38 seasons, Bill's team dominated baseball in Kentucky winning a record 1,144 games, including six State championships. Baseball was Bill's passion, but it was more than just a game. On the diamond, Bill saw it as his responsibility to help make boys into men. He taught them the values of hard work, of competition, and how to leave it all on the field.  Two and half years ago, when Bill was diagnosed, he refused to let his disease stop him. He kept coaching and mentoring, even winning his sixth State championship last year. When he couldn't coach, Bill would be there on the sidelines, supporting his team.  Last month, Bill was inducted into the KHSAA Hall of Fame. Although he wasn't able to attend the ceremony, he recorded a message to his players, his fans, and his friends. Dozens of current and former players, many of whom consider Bill to be a role model throughout their lives, attended the ceremony to honor their coach.  When he passed away on April 23, Bill was surrounded by his loving family and friends. In addition to all of his players, Bill is survived by his wife and high school sweetheart, Vickie, and their children, Matt and Megan. Following in Bill's footsteps, Megan is in her 15th season as the head softball coach at PRP. Coach Bill Miller's legacy will continue to be felt by this community, and I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in remembering this remarkable Louisvillian.  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)                          ____________________
