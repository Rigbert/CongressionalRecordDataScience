Mr. Speaker, partial-birth abortion is child abuse.  That some otherwise respectable and pleasant and well-mannered people would permit killing babies in this way--which Congress can stop if it has the will--is both baffling and extremely sad.  That some otherwise smart and even brilliant people have been so easily fooled by the abortion industry's outrageous lies, distortions, half-truths, and surface appeal arguments is, at best, disappointing and unsettling.  How can anyone in this Chamber or in the White House defend sticking a pair of scissors into a partially born baby's head so as to puncture the child's skull so a suction catheter can be inserted to suck out the child's brains? How can anyone support this and then say they're for kids?  My wife, Marie, is an elementary school teacher, and she said this morning that if a young student were to stab her doll in the back of the head, alarm bells would go off and we would say that this child might have deep psychological problems, was in need of professional help, and posed a potential threat to others.  If anyone did such an act to a young animal--a puppy or a kitten--we would say that he or she was sick and guilty of animal abuse.  Yet the abortion President Bill Clinton, seeks to continue legal sanction for this gruesome assault on children. Finally, we're seeing what the right to choose really means: Executing untold thousands of children by stabbing them and sucking out their brains?  Let's face it. Partial-birth abortion is a gross violation of human rights--it's child abuse.  Why the blind spot?  Why the unwillingness to see the brutality and savagery of brain-sucking abortion?  I guess we now know how far the so-called pro-choice movement will go to sustain the Orwellian super-myth that abortion is somehow sane, compassionate--even pro-child.  Americans will now see that the real extremists are not the people who insist on calling attention to the grisly details of abortion, such as dismemberment of the unborn child, injections of high concentrated salt solutions and other kinds of poisons that chemically burn and then kill the baby, or this particular method, a brain-sucking method of abortion. They will see that the real extremists are those who actually do these acts.  The dangerous person is not the one who shows us the pictures or who describes abortions, the dangerous person--the child abuser--is the person holding the scissors at the base of the baby's skull.  I would respectfully submit to my abortion-minded friends on both sides of the aisle, that the coverup is over. For more than two decades the abortion industry has sanitized abortion methods by aggressively employing the shrewdest and most benign euphemisms market research can buy.  I say to my friends on the other side of this issue, choose the path of Dr. Bernard Nathanson, a founder of NARAL--the National Abortion Rights Action League--and former big league abortionist who turned pro-life because he finally had to admit, in a fit of intellectual honesty, that the unborn child was a patient, too, in need of nurturing and caring and love, just like his or her mother.  For the first time ever, the debate over partial-birth abortion requires us to begin coming to grips with the grisly specifics of how abortion actually pains, tortures, and destroys innocent human babies. If slaughtering a partially born child is wrong, why is it OK to slice and suction a baby in utero with a high-powered vacuum, 20 to 30 times more powerful than an average household vacuum cleaner, a procedure that turns the baby into bloody pulp. In a later term D&E abortion, the baby is decapitated and dismembered, limb by limb, inside the womb.  The dirty secret of the abortion rights movement--the violent, painful methods of abortion--are finally getting scrutiny because of this debate. The partial-birth abortion debate is allowing us to just scratch the surface of the usually secret, hidden, and Byzantine world of abortion and the methods used to painfully kill unborn children. Even the Washington Post shed some light on the methods this week. The Post article says, in part,       Most abortion doctors circumvent this problem by      dismembering the fetus and removing it in pieces small enough      to pass through the cervix . . .       The physician generally injects the fetus with one or more      toxic substances a day before surgery, a maneuver that      softens the tissue and makes dismemberment easier. It also      eliminates any possibility a live birth will occur.      Alternatively, some doctors cut the umbilical cord, which      kills the fetus, 15 or 20 minutes before the procedure.  Perhaps some of you are having--or beginning to have--second thoughts concerning the bill of goods the abortion lobby has been selling all these years.  They even lied about the number of partial-birth abortions performed each year in the United States.  This past Sunday, The Record of Bergen, NJ, published a lengthy investigate report about the partial-birth abortions. I was appalled to read that a single facility in New Jersey--Metropolitan Medical in Englewood--performs at least 1,500 partial-birth abortions every year. This is three times the number of brain suction abortions that the National Abortion Federation, Planned Parenthood, NARAL, and other pro-abortion groups have estimated are performed annually throughout the country.  This revelation belies the statement of Bill Clinton that the process of sucking a baby's brains out moments before his or her full delivery is limited to 500 children per year nationally. Even if the lower number were true, however, I am stunned that he or anyone else could belittle the horror of partial-birth abortion by saying it ``only'' kills 500 children each year. This is a higher death toll than the Oklahoma City bombing--an act that has been rightfully condemned.  What is equally as frightening is the fact that the same Record article reveals that most partial-birth abortions in New Jersey were done to teenagers, and they were done as elective procedures, not for medical reasons. Let me quote from the article.       ``We have an occasional amnio abnormality, but it's a      minuscule amount,'' said one of the doctors at Metropolitan      Medical, an assessment confirmed by another doctor there.      ``Most are Medicaid patients, black and white, and most are      for elective, not medical, reasons: people who didn't      realize, or didn't care, how far along they were. Most are      teenagers.''  And let us not forget Dr. Martin Haskell, the medical doctor who boasts about this grisly procedure and goes on tour teaching it to others. Dr. Haskell says 80 percent of his partial birth abortions are ``purely elective.''  This contradicts everything the abortion President has said to justify his veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban bill passed by both the House and the Senate. President Clinton should stop hiding from the truth.  Override this antichild veto.                          ____________________
