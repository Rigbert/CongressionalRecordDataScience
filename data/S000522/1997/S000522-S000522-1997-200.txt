Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I just want to make one point. In the earlier debate it was pointed out that World Vision wants to release these funds. I think it should be made very clear, World Vision is a group that I strongly support. They are into helping to alleviate suffering brought about by famine.  Let me read a letter dated February 7 from the president of World Vision, and it reads as follows: ``Our organization supports the release of funds with the so-called Mexico City policy, which prevents U.S. Government funding from subsidizing foreign organizations which perform or promote abortion as a method of family planning, and lobbying to ease or diminish anti-abortion laws--either in the United States or in foreign countries.''  ``We believe,'' the World Vision letter goes on to say, and it is signed by Robert Seiple, ``We believe these pro-life safeguards are important to protect the integrity of our efforts and those of many other humanitarian aid organizations.''  Mr. Speaker, I ask that the full letter be made part of the Record, but I would point out that World Vision supports this legislation, they support the Mexico city policy.  The letter referred to is as follows:                                                 World Vision,                                 Washington, DC, February 7, 1997.     Hon. Joseph R. Pitts,     House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Pitts: World Vision has not changed its      position on abortion. I am writing to reiterate our position      to you and other members of Congress following a January 31      letter regarding the release of funding for international      family planning services. I signed the letter, along with the      presidents of CARE and Save the Children.       Since it was established in 1950, World Vision has always      and will continue to oppose abortion as a means of birth      control. Abortion runs contrary to our core beliefs as a      Christian organization. All of World Vision's efforts, both      in the United States and in more than 100 countries around      the world, seek to save, extend and enhance life. Toward our      goals of enhancing and extending life, World Vision supports      programs in developing nations to save children's lives.      These programs include immunizations, disease prevention and      treatment and efforts to improve nutrition. In addition, we      encourage efforts to educate parents about maternal health,      to avoid high-risk pregnancies and to advocate birth spacing.       These strategies help to avoid risky and unplanned      pregnancies both to protect the life of the mother and to      prevent women from resorting to abortion as a means of birth      control. As President of World Vision, I have visited many of      the programs in some of the most difficult places in the      world. I have met with women in Africa, Asia and Latin      America and other regions of the world who personally have      benefited from these services.       We believe these pro-life safeguards are important to      protect the integrity of our efforts and those of many other      humanitarian aid organizations. Serious health concerns for      women, children and families are at stake, including      unintended pregnancies which will likely increase, not      reduce, the number of abortions performed on women in      developing nations.       Should you have any questions on this issue, or on World      Vision's position on abortion, please contact Ken Casey,      Senior Vice President, in Seattle at 206-815-1000.           Sincerely,                                                 Robert A. Seiple,                                                        President.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the distinguished gentleman from Minnesota [Mr. Oberstar], a cosponsor of our legislation, H.R. 581.
