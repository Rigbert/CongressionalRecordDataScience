President, if you are a student of history, this is a moment that you should reflect on and savor. Just a short time ago, I came to the floor and sat in the back row and listened as Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts spoke. I wanted to be here to see it because Senator Ted Kennedy was one of the few who was a Member of the Senate when the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965, more than 40 years ago. He recounted the struggle that led to the passage of that legislation--and it was a struggle. He talked about President Lyndon Baines Johnson coming back to Capitol Hill, with which he was so familiar as a Member of the Senate, and just a few feet away from where I am standing, in one of the small rooms known as the President's Room, signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  I wanted to come and hear Ted Kennedy tell that story because I do appreciate it--not just as history but because of what that meant to America. Some say it was the most significant civil rights legislation in our history. It is hard to argue that it was not because if Americans don't have the right to vote, they don't have the most basic right that we appreciate and treasure as American citizens.  On the day that President Lyndon Baines Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, he said it was one of the most monumental laws in the history of American freedom. And then he said:       Today is a triumph for freedom as huge as any victory      that's ever been won on any battlefield. Today we strike away      the last major shackle of fierce and ancient bonds.  Those beautiful words were quoted in the autobiography of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
