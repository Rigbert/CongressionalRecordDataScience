President, today I am proud to join Senators Kohl, Mikulski, and LeMieux to introduce the Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2009, a bill to protect older Americans from abuse and exploitation. It is clear that we are not doing enough to combat crime against seniors, and the Elder Abuse Victims Act will give us important tools to better prevent and punish this deplorable behavior.  I have long fought to improve and protect the lives of older Americans. In 2000, I joined Senator Bayh in sponsoring the Protecting Seniors from Fraud Act, which was signed into law nearly nine years ago today. A key provision that I worked to incorporate into that legislation required the Attorney General to conduct a study of crime against seniors and to include specific information about crimes that disproportionately affect seniors in the National Crime Victimization Survey. The information collected as a result of those provisions has been valuable in understanding the scope of crime perpetrated against seniors and how best to combat it. In 2003, I sought further protections by introducing the Seniors Safety Act. That bill aimed to strengthen enforcement of many of the most prevalent crimes perpetrated against seniors, including health care fraud, nursing home abuse, telemarketing fraud, and pension fraud.  The Elder Abuse Victims Act builds on these earlier efforts and ensures that fighting the abuse and exploitation of our seniors is a top law enforcement priority. Specifically, the bill provides grants to train prosecutors and establish elder justice units within State and local courts and law enforcement offices. It also requires the U.S. Department of Justice to further study state and local enforcement of elder abuse laws and establish more uniform procedures to improve the identification and handling of elder justice matters. Additionally, the bill provides funding for elder abuse victims advocacy groups to ensure that vulnerable seniors have access to critical support services.  It is particularly important that we strengthen our ability to protect older Americans because they are the most rapidly growing population group in our society, making them an ever more attractive target for criminals. The Department of Health and Human Services has predicted that the number of older Americans will grow from 13 percent of the U.S. population in 2000 to 20 percent by 2030. In Vermont, seniors comprise about 12 percent of the population, a number that is expected to increase to 20 percent by 2025.  The growing number of older Americans demands that we have enough advocacy programs and law enforcement services in place to protect our seniors. We all deserve to age with dignity, free of the threat of abuse or fraud. The Elder Abuse Victims Act can help by giving our justice system the tools it needs to prosecute offenders who prey on the elderly. I look forward to working with Senators Kohl, Mikulski, LeMieux, and others to better protect seniors from crime and abuse.                                 ______                                       By
