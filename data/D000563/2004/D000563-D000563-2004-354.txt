President, this editorial raises the following question:       [C]an you guess how many schools would be playing [in the      NCAA men's tournament] if there was a requirement that they      had to graduate at least half of their athletes [in a 6-year      period of time]?       If you guessed a third, you'd be right.  This article goes on to note that some universities involved in this tournament have exemplary records combining athletics and scholarship; and he names Kansas, with 73 percent of its players graduating within 6 years of their original enrollment; Dayton, 82 percent; Lehigh, 90 percent; and atop the chart--which is a university which lost yesterday--Stanford, with 100 percent.  This editorial says:       Three years ago, the Knight Foundation Commission on      Intercollegiate Athletics proposed that postseason      competition be limited to teams that graduate at least 50      percent of their players [within 6 years]. But the NCAA      obviously has a long way to go. Of the 65 teams playing [in      the tournament] this year, only 21 would qualify under that      rule--down from 22 last year.       For that matter, 10 of the teams [in the NCAA tournament]      fail to graduate even 20 percent of their players.  This is what commission Chairman William Friday, president emeritus of the University of North Carolina, noted:       [F]our of the teams in the men's tournament failed to      graduate a single athlete over the period we reviewed.  The information here talks about the general graduation rate. We call this college basketball. But if we were to learn that there was a team headed for the Sweet Sixteen or the Final Four that did not have a single college player graduate, we would cry fraud. This is supposed to be about college athletes participating against one another. But if you have schools involved in the tournament where none--absolutely none--of the athletes involved in the basketball game are ever going to graduate, are these truly college students, is this really college basketball?  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a commentary from that same newspaper written by Derrick Z. Jackson, entitled ``Suppressing the bad news on NCAA graduation rates.''  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:           Suppressing the Bad News on NCAA Graduation Rates                        (By Derrick Z. Jackson)       Not to be outdone by the federal government's attempts to      delete key portions of reports on global warming, health      disparities, and racism within the Justice Department, here      comes the National Collegiate Athletic Association. That      august body is eliminating the graduation rates of basketball      players. What is good for the Bush administration is      wonderful news for the Universities of Cincinnati, Kentucky,      Louisville and Memphis.       March Madness ought to be canceled with the scandal that is      in the computer banks of the NCAA's 2003 Graduation Rates      Report. The report covers whether scholarship athletes who      entered school in the falls of 1993, 1994, 1995 or 1996      graduated within six years. The report is the best long-term      way to see whether a university is providing an education to      its athletes or pimping them in an era where CBS is paying      the NCAA $6 billion over 11 years to televise men's games and      where an additional $3.5 billion will be wagered illegally on      this year's tournament alone, according to The Wall Street      Journal. The amount of betting is half the annual budget of      the chronically underfunded Head Start.       That is March Madness enough, but now the NCAA has quietly      adjusted the graduation rates to satisfy ``a new      interpretation'' of federal laws which say that information      on any category containing only one or two students ``must be      suppressed.''       In basketball, which has far fewer players than football or      baseball teams, the new rules amount to liberation from any      accountability whatsoever on the part of college athletic      departments and their presidents.       Because of the new rules, 37 of the 65 men's teams in this      year's tournament did not publish graduation rates of their      African-American players. Sixteen schools published no      graduation rates at all.       Nine of the 16 schools that mysteriously had no graduation      rate whatsoever just happen to include last year's most      hideous offenders, such as:       Alabama (0 percent for black men and 13 percent overall in      the 2002 report).       Cincinnati (0 percent for black men, 17 percent overall).       Louisville (0 for black men, 10 percent overall).       Kentucky (13 percent and 33 percent overall).       Southern Illinois (14 percent for black men and 27 percent      overall).       Memphis (0 period).       Nevada (0 percent for black men, 20 percent overall).       Virginia Commonwealth (0 period).       Alabama State (0 period).       The ``new rules'' did not stop the schools with good and      great graduation rates from publishing them, even when the      numbers of players on scholarship are obviously similar to      the schools that withheld the information. Kansas, Air Force,      Manhattan, Gonzaga, Vanderbilt, Central Florida, Duke,      Princeton, Valparaiso, Stanford, Monmouth and Xavier all had      African-American player graduation rates of at least 67      percent.       Among New England schools in the men's and women's      tournament, the Connecticut men's team published its general      and woeful graduation rate of 27 percent, but withheld its      black rate. The UConn women's team published its general      graduation rate of 67 percent but withheld the black rate.      Boston College's men's team published both its 46 percent      overall and 67 percent African-American rate. BC's women's      team published its 71 percent overall rate but withheld its      black rate.       Rates for Providence's men were 42 percent overall, 50      percent for black men, Vermont's men were 55 percent overall      and the school withheld a figure for black men. Maine's women      were at 69 percent overall, with no black women to count.       In the case of most of the New England schools, the      withholding of the black rate actually did not affect the      overall rate much as the white rate was similar to the      overall rate. But it was very clear that many other schools      purposely hid disastrous rates. For instance, Georgia Tech      did not publish the rate of its black athletes. But with a      white graduation rate of 60 percent, it managed to plummet to      an overall rate of 27 percent. Texas Tech did not publish the      rates for black athletes. But with a white graduation rate of      60 percent, it had an overall rate of only 33 percent.       Last year, 13 men's schools had a 0 graduation rate for      black men. The average black male graduation rate for the 65-     team field was 35 percent. With the liberation provided by      the new privacy rules, only one university in this year's      field published a black male rate under 38 percent. That was      Eastern Washington, where the rate was zero.       That is probably because that school is not a perennial      NCAA powerhouse. Give it time. A couple more appearances in      March Madness and school officials will join Kentucky,      Cincinnati, and Louisville in erasing its records, too. If      President Bush wins re-election and needs some more      bureaucrats to delete the truth, he knows where he can find      them. At the NCAA and in our nation's athletic departments.
