 President, just some information for my friend from Vermont. We had anticipated after my remarks of going to the comments of Senator Alexander and Senator Corker in connection with the life of Senator Howard Baker. So I ask unanimous consent at this point that the Senators from Tennessee follow my remarks on Senator Baker.
