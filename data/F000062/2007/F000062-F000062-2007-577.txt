 President, I am pleased to join Senators Hutchison, Feingold, Leahy, Snowe, Kennedy and Durbin in reintroducing the ``Family Abduction Prevention Act,'' a bill to help the thousands of children who are abducted by a family member each year.  We introduced this legislation last Congress, and it passed the Senate by unanimous consent, but unfortunately, the bill was never taken up by the House. This is important and needed legislation.  Family abductions are the most common form of abduction, yet they receive little attention, and law enforcement agencies too often don't treat them as the serious crimes that they are--too often dismissing the seriousness of these cases as family disputes.  The Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2007 would provide grants to States for the costs associated with family abduction prevention. Specifically, it would assist States with costs associated with the extradition of individuals suspected of committing the crime of family abduction, costs borne by State and local law enforcement agencies to investigate cases of missing children, training for local and State law enforcement agencies in responding to family abductions, outreach and media campaigns to educate parents on the dangers of family abductions, and assistance to public schools to help with costs associated with ``flagging'' school records.  Each year, over 200,000 children--78 percent of all abductions in the United States--are kidnapped by a family member, usually a non-custodial parent.  More than half of the abducting parents have a history of domestic violence, substance abuse, or a criminal record.  Unfortunately, many State and local law enforcement agencies frequently treat these abductions as personal, family disputes. Approximately 70 percent of law enforcement agencies lack written guidelines on responding to family abduction and many are not informed about the Federal laws available to help in the search and recovery of an abducted child.  Too often law enforcement assumes that a child is not in grave danger if the abductor is a family member. Unfortunately, this is not always true, and this assumption can endanger a child's life. Research has shown that the most common motive in family abduction cases is revenge against the other parent--not love for the child.  The effects of family abduction on children are often traumatic. Abducted children suffer from severe separation anxiety. To break emotional ties with the left-behind parent, some abductors will coach a child into falsely disclosing abuse by the other parent to perpetuate their control during or after the abduction. And in many cases, the child is told that the other parent is dead or did not really love them.  For example, on Takeroot.org, a website devoted to the victims of family abductions, a young lady named Kelly told the story of how her parents were going through a bitter divorce and custody battle when she was nine, and her brother was six. Her dad picked them up for a regular visit, but then just kept on driving.  Kelly says, ``If I close my eyes, I can still see my mother waving goodbye as we watched her from the rear window of our father's truck. . . . Little did we know that it would be close to a year before we would see her again.''  Days later, Kelly started asking her father why they were continuing to drive--and why they were sleeping in the truck. After a while, her father finally broke his silence and screamed at her that her mother had given him the children because she didn't love them and that they would just have to learn to deal with it.  For the next eleven months, they lived like fugitives on the run, often dirty and hungry, ``with very little money and even less love,'' according to Kelly. ``We left in the middle of the night, never saying goodbye to friends we may have made or people we met. I still see those people in my mind's eye. I miss them. . . . Mostly, I miss the child I was, the child I lost.''  The harm caused by these abductions cannot easily be put into words. In many family abduction cases, children are given new identities at an age when they are still developing a sense of who they are. In extreme cases, the child's gender is masked to further avoid detection.  Abducting parents also often deprive their children of education and much-needed medical attention to avoid the risk of being tracked via school or medical records.  As the child adapts to a fugitive's lifestyle, deception becomes an integral part of their life. The child is taught to fear those that one would normally trust, such as police, doctors, teachers and counselors. Even after recovery, the child often has a difficult time growing into adulthood.  In some cases, the abducting parent leaves the child with strangers, or locations where their health, safety, and other basic needs may be extremely compromised.  For example, in Lafayette, CA, two girls abducted by their mother ended up under the control of a convicted child molester. When Kelli Nunez absconded with her daughters, 6-year-old Anna and 4-year-old Emily, in violation of court custody orders, she drove her daughters cross-country, and then returned by plane to San Francisco, where she handed the children to someone holding a coded sign at the airport.  The person holding the sign belonged to a helpful-sounding organization called the California Family Law Center--but the organization was actually led by Florencio Maning, a convicted child molester. For six months, Maning orchestrated the concealment of the Nunez girls with help from other people.  Luckily, police were able to track down the girls, and they were successfully reunited with their father. That success may have been due to the fact that California has been the Nation's leader in fighting family abduction.  In my State, we have a system that places the responsibility for the investigation and resolution of family abduction cases with the County District Attorney's Office. Each California County District Attorney's Office has an investigative unit that is focused on family abduction cases. These investigators only handle family abduction cases and become experts in the process.  However, most States lack the training and resources to effectively recover children who are kidnapped by a family member. According to a study conducted by Plass, Finkelhor and Hotaling, 62 percent of parents surveyed said they were ``somewhat'' or ``very'' dissatisfied with police handling of their family abduction cases.  The ``Family Abduction Prevention Act of 2007'' would be an important first step in addressing this serious issue.  I urge my colleagues to pass this important legislation, just as you did in the 109th Congress.                                 ______                                       By
