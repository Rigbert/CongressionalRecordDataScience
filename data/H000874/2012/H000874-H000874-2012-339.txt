Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Martin Breland on his recent selection to the Board of Directors at the National Association of Federal Credit Unions (NAFCU).  Mr. Breland has been president and CEO of Tower Federal Credit Union in Laurel, Maryland, since 1994. Under his leadership, Tower has experienced significant and healthy asset growth. With over 16 branches spanning four counties, Tower is the largest federal credit union in the state of Maryland and provides a range of financial products to meet the needs of their 124,000 member-owners, a number of whom live in my district. Prior to becoming CEO in 1994, Mr. Breland served in other capacities at Tower including Vice President of Finance and Vice President of Member Services.  With over 30 years of experience in the financial industry and an M.B.A. from The Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Mr. Breland is a welcomed addition to the NAFCU board. In his new role he will have the opportunity to play an important role in public policy formation.  I wish Mr. Breland the best of luck in his new role on the NAFCU Board and look forward to working with him in this capacity. I ask that my colleagues join me today in congratulating Mr. Breland on this achievement.                          ____________________
