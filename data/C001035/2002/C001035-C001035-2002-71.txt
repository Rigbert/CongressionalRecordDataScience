President, I rise today to introduce the Human Tissue Transplant Safety Act of 2002, which would provide a much needed regulatory framework to help ensure the safety of transplanted human tissue. In 1997, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA examined the public health issues posed by human tissue transplantation and concluded that the existing regulatory framework was insufficient and needed to be strengthened. Yet more than 5 years later, the agency has failed to implement critical regulatory changes and strengthen oversight of tissue processors, known as tissue banks. The legislation I am introducing today is designed to help remedy the gaps in the regulatory safety net.  While people are familiar with the concept of organ donation, tissue donation is not well understood by most Americans. Yet the tissue industry is very diverse and is growing rapidly. In fact, tissue donations now make possible about 750,000 transplants per year. The recovery and medical use of tissue, including skin, bone, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and heart valves, are unlike organ transplants because the tissue is usually not transplanted ``as-is'' from the donor's body into that of the recipient. Rather, donated tissue frequently undergoes considerable processing before it can be used. Bone from a donor's femur, for example, can be reshaped into a component designed to give support to a recipient's spine.  Technology that greatly reduces the risk of rejection now allows surgeons to use actual bone in their patients rather than metal or other synthetic substances. In addition, donated tissue, once it is processed, can frequently be stored for a period of time. In contrast, organs must be transplanted into the recipient's body within hours of their recovery.  The organizations that make up the tissue industry are collectively referred to as tissue banks. Some are engaged in tissue recovery, while others process, store, and distribute human tissue. Tissue donation is a generous, selfless act that improves the lives of many Americans. Just one donor, in fact, can help a large number of people in various ways. Skin donations, for instance, can be used to heal burn victims or aid in reconstructive surgical procedures. Ligaments and tendons can be used to repair worn-out knees. Bone donations can be used in hip replacements or spinal surgery enabling recipients to regain mobility. Donated arteries and veins can restore circulation, and heart valves can be transplanted to save lives.  The phenomenal growth and increasing competitiveness of the industry in its search for new sources of donated tissue, however, have resulted in some problems. Tissue obtained from unsuitable donors has been allowed to enter the American tissue supply, raising serious doubts about the adequacy of federal regulations. Other concerns involve whether or not the practices of some tissue banks are sufficient to reduce the danger of spreading such illnesses as the human variant of mad cow disease. Because communicable diseases such as HIV and hepatitis, among others, can also be transmitted through tissues, it is vital that potential donors be screened for suitability and tissue be tested effectively, to make sure it is safe.  FDA recognized these issues in 1997, and the agency published its ``Proposed Approach to the Regulation of Cellular and Tissue-Based Products.'' The FDA proposed to: (1) require infectious disease screening and testing for cells and tissue transplanted from one person to another; (2) require that cells and tissues be handled according to procedures designed to prevent contamination and preserve tissue function and integrity; and (3) require all tissue processing facilities to register with the agency. Thereafter, FDA promulgated three separate regulations that address these requirements. But of those, only a registration requirement has been implemented.  Five years later, the majority of the proposed regulatory changes still have not been adopted, and, remarkably, FDA officials recently advised me that the agency cannot even tell me when the remaining regulations will be made final.  The FDA's failure to act in this area that affects public health and safety is simply inexcusable. It is a case, apparently, of bureaucratic inertia at its worst.  I have long been concerned about the vulnerabilities that exist in the tissue industry and the adequacy of the Government's oversight.  Last year--exactly a year ago--as the chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I held a hearing to look at tissue banks and the efficacy of the current regulatory framework. The testimony was deeply troubling.  For example, one witness testified that some unscrupulous tissue banks have engaged in a practice in which tissues that were initially tested positive for contamination were simply tested over and over again until the technicians achieved the negative result they wanted.  Let me explain that again. This is human tissue that has tested positive for contamination, and the reaction to that was to keep testing it until a negative result came up. You cannot keep testing into compliance. Obviously, there is a problem if, even once, the tissue tests positive for contamination; and it should not be used.  The FDA official in my hearing called this ``testing tissue into compliance'' a practice that is obviously unsafe and must be stopped.  The hearing also revealed that scores of tissue banks have never once been inspected by the FDA. And of those that have been inspected, some were found to have had deficiencies, but they were never reinspected to see that the problems had been corrected.  Moreover, the FDA had no concept, prior to the registration requirement, of how many tissue banks were actually operating. The FDA thought there were possibly 150. More than 350 registered as a result of the one requirement that the FDA did put into effect.  As a result of the subcommittee's in-depth investigation, I concluded that serious gaps existed in the FDA's regulation. But I also thought, and hoped, and have received promises from the agency, that it would act. After all, it had developed a good, sound strategy back in 1997.  So last year, in the hearings that I held a year ago this month, the FDA promised me that the regulations would be made final.  Unfortunately, I have been proven wrong about the FDA's commitment to reform. And the lack of action has had serious, indeed, tragic consequences.  In November of last year, a 23-year-old man died in Minnesota after undergoing routine knee surgery in which tissue was transplanted into his body. It contained a deadly bacteria which ultimately killed this young man. Others have fallen seriously ill because of the tainted tissue transplants.  In March of this year, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released findings that linked bacterial infections in donated human tissue to allografts that had been used for transplants in 26 cases. And the number, undoubtedly, is going to increase since the CDC's investigation is still ongoing.  I have tried to work with the FDA to expedite the implementation of the proposed regulations. I have asked, repeatedly: What does the FDA need? Are more resources needed? Just tell us what you need. But, unfortunately, the threat to public health that the FDA identified so long ago continues to exist today.  In an effort to prevent any further tragedies, I am today introducing legislation to require the FDA to go forward and issue these much needed regulations.  First, my legislation will explicitly authorize the FDA to regulate any entity that engages in the recovery, screening, testing, processing, storage, or distribution of human tissue, or human tissue-based products. In other words, all tissue banks would be required to adhere to the standards that the FDA has identified as necessary for ensuring public safety. This provision would remove any doubt about the FDA's authority to regulate tissue banks.  Second, the legislation will make it mandatory for all tissue banks to register with the FDA. If any tissue bank is out of compliance with FDA requirements, the agency will be authorized to suspend and, if necessary, revoke the tissue bank's registration, to prevent the bank from operating.  Third, the legislation will require tissue banks to report adverse incidents, including the detection of an infection within 15 days. Currently, tissue banks are not required to report adverse incidents to the Federal Government. And if they do not voluntarily report incidents, it is very difficult for the Federal Government to take effective action.  Finally, the bill also requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop a database to store the adverse incident reports. That central repository of information would be very useful to the CDC.  I want to emphasize that the vast majority of tissue banks operate in a safe, professional manner. We are now very fortunate that advances in technology allow tissue to be used in ways that truly enhance lives for thousands of Americans.  This legislation will help ensure that the transplantation of human tissue saves lives, not ends them.                                 ______                                       By
