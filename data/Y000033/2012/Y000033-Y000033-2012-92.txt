Mr. Speaker, Mano Frey originally hails from Yakima, Washington, where he grew up with a relatively small family of ten sisters and seven brothers.  After graduating high school, Mano attended Seattle University where he majored in civil engineering. In 1970, Mano took a small break during his senior year to set off with his close friend for Alaska. Their destination? The now-famous city of Valdez, Alaska.  After experiencing the wonders and magnificence of what some call ``old Alaska,'' Mano decided to delay college in favor of joining Laborers' Local 341. Almost immediately he was dispatched to pour concrete for a new school using a 90lb pavement breaker.  Soon, Mr. Frey became a steward for the drillers and powder men at the main terminal camp for the Trans Alaska Pipeline. The job, which at the time was the biggest in world history, had over 25 thousand people working on the line from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez.  His reputation grew within the union's leadership and in 1977 he was appointed to be the area's business agent. A year later they asked him to transfer to the union's headquarters in Anchorage. Soon after Mano became the union's president. In 1981, he attained the job of Business Manager, a position he held until he became International Vice-President and Regional Manager for LIUNA's Northwest Region.  During his time in Alaska, Mano left his mark as a leader. On more than one occasion, Mr. Frey was recognized by the Alaska Journal of Commerce as being one of the top ten most powerful people in Alaska. He was the first and only labor leader to be given the Public Service Gold Pan Award by the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce.  For a decade, Mano Co-Chaired the premier advocacy group Arctic Power, which advocated for the opening of the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) to oil exploration. To bring significant economic development to the State of Alaska and Nation.  Leading the program, Mano oversaw the huge advocacy effort to open the nation's largest oil reserve. Legislation to open ANWR has passed the House 12 times due in no small part to the work of advocacy groups like Arctic Power and the Alaska Congressional Delegation. The bill even passed the Senate once, only to be vetoed by President Clinton soon afterwards.  But, in his own inimitable style, Mano never lost faith and continued to push for the opening of ANWR, with the knowledge that if you ever let up on your goals, you certainly will never reach them.  It was with that same determination that Mano served as the Alaska AFL CIO's executive president from 1984 until 2003. During his tenure, Mano also had the privilege of serving on the National AFL CIO's Executive Council. Upon his retirement from the Alaska AFL CIO, and in recognition of all the years of hard work and dedication to the working men and women everywhere, the organization named him President Emeritus.  In 2003 Mano became a Vice President and Regional Manager for the Laborers International Union of North America. He served this organization and its members with honor. He demonstrated on numerous occasions that he not only cared about how all of the Local unions under his jurisdiction fared, but that the most important mission was the welfare and quality of life of the members and their families.  On behalf of all the working men and women of Alaska and beyond, whose livesyou enriched and livelihood you protected, I thank and wish you a happy retirement as you transition into your next chapter in life.                          ____________________
