 President, today I am introducing a bill to help our public schools reduce overcrowding. The bill is the companion of H.R. 2695, a bill introduced by my California colleague, Representative Loretta Sanchez, a member of the House Education and Workforce Committee.                            the legislation  This legislation has several major provisions:  It provides a tax credit for the bond holders of school construction bonds. Under the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, schools which meet specific criteria can issue ``qualified zone academy bonds.'' The bonds generate a tax credit, rather than interest, for the bond holder, but can only be used to rehabilitate existing schools, not construct new facilities. Our bill allows the credit for school construction, as well.  It revises the criteria to address high growth areas and increase the number of schools who qualify. Under current law, only school districts with a poverty rate of 35 percent or more (as measured by participation in the school lunch program) and can demonstrate public support by raising at least 10 percent of the bond amount from private individuals or companies could take advantage of the credit. State education officials indicate schools, particularly small districts who need federal assistance, have difficulty reaching the private support requirement. This bill deletes the private support requirement of current law.  To qualify to use the bonds, the bill requires schools to meet state academic achievement standards and to have an average student-teacher ratio of 28 to one. Clear student achievement standards are essential to make schools accountable for learning and many states are developing those standards. California, for example, has adopted math and language content standards. Research shows that smaller classes improve learning and teaching and California is now implementing a class size reduction program in grades K-3.  Under the bill, bonds may be used if school districts meet one of three criteria:  The school is over 30 years old or the bonds will be used to install advanced or improved telecommunications equipment;  The student growth rate will be at least 10 percent over the nest 5 years; and  The construction or rehabilitation is needed to meet natural disaster requirements.  The legislation focuses the tax credit assistance on our most serious construction needs. In my State, for example, 60 percent of our schools are over 30 years old and our schools must be built to withstand earthquakes, floods, El Nino and other natural disasters. California's State earthquake building standards can add 3 to 4 percent to construction costs.  The bond program will provide important assistance for school districts across America. Because the bonds provide a tax credit to the bond holder, the bond is supported by the Federal treasury, not the local school district. This helps small and low-income area school districts, because low-income communities with the highest school rehabilitation/construction needs may have to pay the highest interest rates in order to issue the bonds, if they can be issued at all.                      school enrollment is soaring  Our public schools face a daunting challenge for the 21st century. This year, a record 52.2 million children will attend America's schools, a growth trend that will continue, reaching more than 54 million by 2007.  Growth over the next decade will be most severe at the secondary school level, with enrollment growth expected to grow by 1.7 million or more than 13 percent.  Nearly one-half of all states will experience a 15 percent growth in the number of public high school graduates by 2007.  More than one-third of the nation's existing schools are currently over 50 or more years old and need to be repaired or replaced.  Unlike the previous baby boom, there will be no sharp decline in enrollment after 2007; enrollment will maintain a stable level afterwards. Thus, school districts face escalating long-term needs.  Schools are costly. Modern schools are a significant investment for even the wealthiest of communities. Average elementary school construction costs are $6.3 million, while average high school construction costs exceed $15 million. School facilities can be well beyond the reach of many local communities. The federal government should become a partner by providing targeted assistance for high growth areas.                        the california challenge  In California, construction needs are soaring. My state will have the nation's largest enrollment increases of all states during the next ten years.  California's 18.3 percent school enrollment rate will triple the U.S. rate of 5.7 percent between 1996 and 2006.  Each year between 160,000 and 190,000 new students enter California classrooms.  California's high school enrollment is projected to increase by 35.3 percent by 2007. Approximately 920,000 students are expected to be admitted to schools in the State during that period, boosting total enrollment from 5.6 million to 6.8 million.  California needs to build 12 new classrooms a day until 2001 just to keep up with the growth in student population.  The California Department of Finance forecasts that the State must spend $22 billion on schools during the next decade to keep pace with growth and to modernize and repair schools that have been allowed to deteriorate.  Based on growth forecasts, California would need to add about 327 schools over the next three years just to keep pace with the projected growth. Yet these phenomenal construction rates would only maintain current use and would not even begin to relieve current overcrowding.  In addition to new facilities, existing education facilities need to be renovated to meet today's learning needs. Today's schools require a modern infrastructure, with wiring capable of meeting today's computer needs. However, more than 60 percent of California's schools were built over 30 years ago. According to the General Accounting Office, 87 percent of the public schools in California indicate they need to upgrade and repair buildings.  The burden on local school districts is overwhelming school districts and local taxpayers. As an example, in order to build it's way out of overcrowding, Oceanside School District in San Diego, would need to build four elementary schools, two middle schools, and a high school at an estimated cost of $110 to $140 million.  In addition to these pressures, our state, commendably, is reducing class sizes in grades K through 3 because smaller classes improve teaching and learning. We have the largest pupil-teacher ratios on the country and fortunately, are beginning to address what is a most serious education problem. But smaller classes mean more classrooms.  In short, California's needs are immense and States and local communities need the federal partner.                         important to education  School overcrowding places a heavy burden on teachers and students. Studies show that the test scores of students in schools in poor condition can fall as much as 11 percentage points behind scores of students in good buildings. Other studies show improvements of up to 20 percent in test scores when students move to a new facility.  Here are several examples of the toll that crowding is taking in my State.  At Horace Mann Year-round School in Oakland, increasing enrollment and class size reductions require some teachers and students to pack up and move to a new classroom every month.  At John Muir Elementary School in San Bruno, one class spent much of the year on the stage of the school's multipurpose room as it waited for portables to arrive.  Anaheim City School District has a 6% enrollment growth rate, double the state average and recently approved the purchase of 10 portable buildings, at a cost of $235,000 to relieve overcrowding.  This bill will concentrate tax benefits on high growth areas across the country and improve education. Teachers and students must be free to concentrate on learning, yet school overcrowding undermines the health and morale of students and teachers, disrupting the education process. Overcrowded schools prevent both teachers and students from reaching their full potential.                   differences from the sanchez bill  This legislation builds upon existing law, as well as H.R. 2695, legislation proposed by Representative Loretta Sanchez in the House. The legislation differs from H.R. 2695 in the following respects:  (1) It expands the type of school construction for which the bonds can be used. In addition to construction to relieve overcrowding in the Sanchez bill, under this bill bonds may be used to rehabilitate schools over 30 years old, improve the communications infrastructure, make repairs following a natural disaster and retrofit to meet potential disasters.  (2) This bill does not include the requirement of the Sanchez bill that at least 10 percent of the bond proceeds be raised from the private sector. I believe this would be a burdensome hurdle for most school districts.  (3) Under H.R. 2695, bonds could be used only by school districts with 35 percent or more of their students eligible for food stamps. Under this bill, bonds would be available to any district meeting the high growth, aging facilities, telecommunications or disaster criteria.  (4) Representative Sanchez's bill allows only financial institutions to claim the tax benefit. Under this bill, any taxpayer as a bond holder could claim the credit.  I believe these changes strengthen the bill and create more financing options for school districts.                               conclusion  Our Nation's school districts face huge challenges as we move toward the 21st century, with a record 52.2 million children this year and a growing school population forecast well into the next century. The legislation proposes modest, targeted Federal support for school bonds in growth areas, offering important assistance to school districts, teachers, parents and students. I ask unanimous consent to place the legislation and a legislative summary in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1753       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Expand and Rebuild America's      Schools Act of 1998''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       The Congress finds the following:       (1) Many States and school districts will need to build new      schools to accommodate increasing student enrollments; the      Department of Education has predicted that the Nation will      need 6,000 more schools by the year 2006.       (2) In response to reduced class mandates enforced by State      governments and increased enrollment, many school districts      have been forced to utilize temporary classrooms and other      structures to accommodate increased school populations, along      with resorting to year-round schedules for students.       (3) Research has proven a direct correlation between the      condition of school facilities and student achievement.      Recently, researchers found that the test scores of students      assigned to schools in poor condition can be expected to fall      10.9 percentage points behind the test scores of students in      buildings in excellent condition. Similar studies have      demonstrated up to a 20 percent improvement in test scores      when students were moved from a school with poor facilities      to a new facility.       (4) While school construction and maintenance are primarily      a State and local concern, States and communities have not,      on their own, met the increasing burden of providing      acceptable school facilities, and the poorest communities      have had the greatest difficulty meeting this need.       (5) Many local educational agencies have difficulties      securing financing for school facility construction and      renovation, especially in States that require a \2/3\      majority of voter approval for the passage of local bond      initiatives.       (6) The Federal Government, by providing interest subsidies      and similar types of support, can lower the costs of State      and local school infrastructure investment, creating an      incentive for businesses to support local school      infrastructure improvement efforts.       (7) The United States competitive position within the world      economy is vulnerable if America's future workforce continues      to be educated in schools not equipped for the 21st century.      America must do everything in its power to properly educate      its people to compete in the global marketplace.     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.       The purpose of this Act is to help local educational      agencies bring all public school facilities up to an      acceptable standard and build the additional classrooms      needed to educate the growing number of students who will      enroll in the next decade.     SEC. 4. CREDIT TO HOLDERS OF SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION BONDS.       (a) In General.--Subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of      chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to      business-related credits) is amended by adding at the end the      following new section:     ``SEC. 45D. CREDIT TO HOLDERS OF SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION BONDS.       ``(a) Allowance of Credit.--In the case of a taxpayer who      holds a school construction bond on the credit allowance date      of such bond which occurs during the taxable year, there      shall be allowed as a credit against the tax imposed by this      chapter for such taxable year the amount determined under      subsection (b).       ``(b) Amount of Credit.--The amount of the credit      determined under this subsection with respect to any school      construction bond is the amount equal to the product of--       ``(1) the credit rate determined by the Secretary under      section 1397E(b)(2) for the month in which such bond was      issued, multiplied by       ``(2) the face amount of the bond held by the taxpayer on      the credit allowance date.       ``(c) Limitation Based on Amount of Tax.--The credit      allowed under subsection (a) for any taxable year shall not      exceed the excess of--       ``(1) the sum of the regular tax liability (as defined in      section 26(b)) plus the tax imposed by section 55, over       ``(2) the sum of the credits allowable under this part      (other than under this section and subpart C thereof,      relating to refundable credits) and section 1397E.       ``(d) School Construction Bond.--For purposes of this      section--       ``(1) In general.--The term `school construction bond'      means any bond issued as part of an issue if--       ``(A) 95 percent or more of the proceeds of such issue are      to be used for a qualified purpose with respect to a      qualified school established by an eligible local education      agency,       ``(B) the bond is issued by a State or local government      within the jurisdiction of which such school is located,       ``(C) the issuer--       ``(i) designates such bond for purposes of this section,      and       ``(ii) certifies that it has the written approval of the      eligible local education agency for such bond issuance, and       ``(D) the term of each bond which is part of such issue      does not exceed the maximum term permitted under section      1397E(d)(3).       ``(3) Qualified school.--       ``(A) In general.--The term `qualified school' means any      public school which is established by and operated under the      supervision of an eligible local education agency to provide      education or training below the postsecondary level if--       ``(i) such public school is designed to enhance the      academic curriculum, increase graduation and employment      rates, and better prepare students for postsecondary      education and the workforce,       ``(ii) students in such public school will be subject to      the academic achievement standards and assessments      established by the State,       ``(iii) a program to alleviate overcrowding and to improve      students' education has been constructed,       ``(iv) the average student-teacher ratio for the school      district in which such school is located as of the date of      the issuance of the bonds is at least 28 to 1, and       ``(v) at least 1 of the following requirements is met:       ``(I) The proceeds from the issuance of the bonds will be      used for new school construction, the rehabilitation of      school facilities which are more than 30 years old as of the      date of such issuance, or the provision of advanced or      improved communications infrastructure.       ``(II) There is a reasonable expectation (as of the date of      issuance of the bonds) that the student growth rate over the      next 5 years for the school district in which such public      school is to be located will be at least 10 percent.       ``(III) Construction or rehabilitation activities are      needed as the result of natural disasters or to mitigate the      cost of potential disasters.       ``(B) Eligible local education agency.--The term `eligible      local education agency' means any local educational agency as      defined in section 14101 of the Elementary and Secondary      Education Act of 1965.       ``(4) Qualified purpose.--       ``(A) In general.--The term `qualified purpose' means, with      respect to any qualified school, constructing or      rehabilitating a school facility.       ``(B) School facility.--The term `school facility' means a      public structure suitable for use as a classroom, laboratory,      library, media center, or related facility whose primary      purpose is the instruction of public elementary or secondary      students. Such term does not include an athletic stadium, or      any other structure or facility intended primarily for      athletic exhibitions, contests, games, or events for which      admission is charged to the general public.       ``(e) Limitation on Amount of Bonds Designated.--       ``(1) National limitation.--There is a national school      construction bond limitation for each calendar year. Such      limitation is $1,400,000,000 for 1999 and 2000, and, except      for carryovers as provided under the rules applicable under      paragraph (2), zero thereafter.       ``(2) Allocation of limitation.--       ``(A) State allocation.--The national school construction      bond limitation for a calendar year shall be allocated by the      Secretary among the States on the combined basis of the      following factors:       ``(i) The respective populations of individuals below the      poverty line (as defined by the Office of Management and      Budget).       ``(ii) The respective projected growth rates in the number      of students over the next 5 years and 10 years (as determined      by the Secretary of Education).       ``(B) School allocation.--The limitation amount allocated      to a State under the subparagraph (A) shall be allocated by      the Secretary of Education to qualified schools within such      State.       ``(3) Designation subject to limitation amount.--The      maximum aggregate face amount of bonds issued during any      calendar year which may be designated under subsection (d)(1)      with respect to any qualified school shall not exceed the      limitation amount allocated to such school under paragraph      (2)(B) for such calendar year.       ``(4) Carryover of unused limitation.--If for any calendar      year--       ``(A) the limitation amount for any State, exceeds       ``(B) the amount of bonds issued during such year which are      designated under subsection (d)(1) with respect to qualified      schools within such State,     the limitation amount for such State for the following      calendar year shall be increased by the amount of such      excess.       ``(f) Other Definitions.--The definitions in subsections      (d)(6) and (f) of section 1397E shall apply for purposes of      this section.       ``(g) Credit Included in Gross Income.--Gross income      includes the amount of the credit allowed to the taxpayer      under this section.''       (b) Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for      subpart D of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of such      Code is amended by adding at the end the following new item:``Sec. 45D. Credit to holders of school construction bonds.''       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section      shall apply to obligations issued after December 31, 1998.                                                                    ____ Feinstein Legislation to Provide Tax Credits for School Construction                                  Bonds                          Proposed Legislation       Provides a tax credit for school construction and      rehabilitation bonds. Similar to the ``Qualified Zone Academy      Bonds'' created by the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act, bondholders      would receive a tax credit, rather than interest.       To qualify to use the bonds, schools must meet state      academic achievement standards and have an average student-     teacher ratio of 28 to 1.       Bonds may be used if school districts meet one of three      criteria:       (1) The school is over 30 years old or the bonds are used      to provide advanced or improved telecommunications      infrastructure;       (2) Student growth rate will be at least 10 percent over      the next 5 years;       (3) School construction or rehabilitation is needed to meet      natural disaster requirements.       Bond proceeds could be used for both new construction and      rehabilitation of existing school facilities, unlike the QZAB      law, which could be used only to rehabilitate existing      schools.       Bonds could be used to rebuild following a natural disaster      or mitigate the potential cost of future natural disasters.      The school bonds can help communities rebuild following a      tornado or earthquake, as well as retrofit buildings to      reduce the potentially devastating cost of future disasters.       Any bond holder is eligible to claim the credit. While only      banks could claim the QZAB bond tax credit, the new bond      credit would be available to any purchaser, including other      businesses or private citizens.                          Education Background       School overcrowding, the challenge for the 21st century:      This year, a record 52.2 million children will attend      America's schools, rising to more than 54 million by 2007.      Secondary school enrollment is expected to grow by 1.7      million, or 13%.       A National Problem: Nearly one-half of all states will      experience a 15% growth in the number of public high school      graduates by 2007.       Facilities for Today's Needs: More than \1/3\ of the      nation's existing schools are at least 50 years old and need      to be repaired or replaced. The GAO reports fewer than half      of the public schools have sufficient technology      infrastructure, including phone lines, and wiring for      networks.       Addressing a Long Term Need: Unlike the previous ``baby      boom,'' school enrollment is not expected to decline after      2007. Communities will face a long-term funding challenge for      school construction and rehabilitation.                                 ______                                       By
