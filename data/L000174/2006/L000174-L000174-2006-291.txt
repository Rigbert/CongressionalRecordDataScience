President. I am pleased to introduce, with Senators Kohl, Grassley, and Schumer, the Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act of 2006, S. 3582. It is no secret that prescription drug prices are rapidly increasing and are a source of considerable concern to many Americans, especially senior citizens and families. In a marketplace free of manipulation, generic drug prices can be as much as 80 percent lower than the comparable brand-name version. Unfortunately, there are still some companies that may be keeping low-cost, life-saving generic drugs off the marketplace, off pharmacy shelves, and out of the hands of consumers by carefully crafted anticompetitive agreements between drug manufacturers. This bipartisan bill will improve the timely and effective introduction of generic pharmaceuticals into the marketplace.  In 2001, and last Congress, I introduced a related bill, the Drug Competition Act. That bill, which is now law, is small in terms of length but large in terms of impact. It ensured that law enforcement agencies could take quick and decisive action against companies seeking to cheat consumers by delaying availability of generic medicines. It gave the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department access to information about secret deals between drug companies that keep generic drugs out of the market--a practice that not only hurts American families, particularly senior citizens, by denying them access to low-cost generic drugs but also contributes to rising medical costs.  The Drug Competition Act, which was incorporated in the Medicare Modernization Act, was a bipartisan effort to protect consumers in need of patented medicines who were being forced to pay considerably higher costs because of collusive secret deals. It is regrettable that we must come to the floor again today and take additional action to prevent drug companies from continuing to find and exploit loopholes.  I had faith that we were on the right track. However, two appellate court decisions from 2005 overturned the FTC's longstanding role of ``policing'' these activities and making case-by-case determinations on the appropriateness of proposed settlements, especially those that involved ``reverse'' payments. That refers to payments from a brand-name company to a generic company as opposed to payments from a generic company to the brand-name company for a license to make a particular patented drug.  The FTC rightfully sought U.S. Supreme Court review of the Schering-Plough v. FTC Eleventh Circuit decision. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court refused to hear that case, leaving in doubt the continuing role of the FTC in policing settlements between brand-name drug companies and potential generic competitors. Moreover, in an unprecedented move, the U.S. Solicitor General opposed the request by the FTC for the Supreme Court to hear this case. The inaction of the courts and the choice of the administration to side with large drug companies over seniors and families has provoked us to take action and introduce this important bill.  This matter arises at the intersection of patent law and antitrust law. The drug companies naturally deny that their agreements violate the antitrust laws, presenting them as private preliminary settlements between companies engaged in patent disputes. The problem is that the whole point of the Drug Competition Act is to have an independent body, the FTC, review these deals and to advise the companies if terms or conditions in the deal need to be changed to comply with existing antitrust laws.  Agreements to delay the production and sale of generic medicines in exchange for cash from the brand-name companies need to be carefully reviewed by the FTC under standards that give the FTC authority to act where necessary to enforce antitrust laws. Companies holding patents on medicines should not be permitted topay millions of dollars to potential generic competitors for the purpose of delaying the research, development, and sale of competing generic versions of medications when those generic companies believe they have the legal right to sell such products.  I remain hopeful that during the process of working on this bill, a way can be found to give the FTC some discretion, on a case-by case basis, to continue to evaluate these deals. Under this approach, only the deals that are consistent with the intent of that law will be allowed to stand. There will be some deals that involve the payment of money which, on balance, could be good for the companies involved and for consumers. The original intent of the Drug Competition Act was to provide the FTC and DOJ with an opportunity to provide the companies with useful and timely information so the drug companies could conform their deals to the law through confidential advice from the law enforcement agencies. I want that process to be continued.  Senators Grassley, Kohl, Schumer, and I are not the only ones who share the goal of ensuring effective and timely access to generic pharmaceuticals that can lower the cost of prescription drugs for seniors, for families, and for all Americans. I sincerely thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are working together on that goal. We have devoted considerable attention to this matter in recent years, and I look forward to passing this important bill.  In closing, I praise the FTC for spending so much time and energy on protecting competition in the pharmaceutical sector. This represents a massive workload for the FTC on top of all its other important responsibilities to protect consumers and the American enterprise system.  Years ago, the FTC dealt with latter-day robber barons destroying smaller companies; now the FTC has to try to restrain corporate drug giants from robbing the elderly when these seniors buy prescription medicines. I also appreciate the work of the FTC on the authorized generics issue and look forward to the report they are preparing for the Congress on that matter.                                 ______                                       By
