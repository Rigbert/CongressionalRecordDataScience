President, will the Senator from Indiana yield for another housekeeping observation?  I urge Senators who may have amendments, or issues, if they can to come and talk with the distinguished Senator from Indiana and myself to see if maybe not all amendments necessarily need a vote. If it is possible for us to come together on something, now is the time to do it.  The other thing is that I hope when we stack the votes-- and I believe it is the intention of the leaders to do this at that time--that after the first vote there would be a shortened time for subsequent votes. But I urge the cooperation of Senators, certainly on my side of the aisle, and I am sure the distinguished Senator from Indiana feels that way about his side of the aisle we as we move forward on these issues.
