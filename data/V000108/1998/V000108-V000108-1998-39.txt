Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate the remarks of the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne), and I do have some concern based on the comments made by the gentleman from California (Mr. Campbell) about Mr. Hamilton's impact on academic politics, but I guess only history will tell the story.  Mr. Speaker, before I conclude my remarks, I would simply reference several essays that the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Hamilton) wrote a number of years ago about the influence of religion on politics. I have kept those theses that Mr. Hamilton prepared, and was struck by the theme of both articles, and that is his abhorrence of those who are intolerant to others' ideas and the civility in which he connoted that we ought to, again, respect our differences of opinion, seek a responsible middle ground, and recognize that we have a country to govern in a moral perspective and that we ought to balance those two interests. I think it represents the gentleman that Mr. Hamilton is and every good thing that that term connotes.
