President, I rise to discuss the nomination of Professor Cass Sunstein to be Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OIRA.  Professor Sunstein's nomination has been endorsed by a number of groups, including the Farm Bureau, the Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of Manufacturers.  I will ask consent to have letters of support from these organizations printed in the Record following my remarks.  While many people outside of Washington have never heard of this office, it can have an enormous influence on our everyday lives. Through the process of regulatory review, OIRA--as it is known in Washington--plays an integral role in the rulemaking process. The office advises agencies as rules are developed and then reviews the methodologies used to develop and justify these rules.  Professor Sunstein has extensively studied government regulation and the various methods that can be used to evaluate regulatory effectiveness. During his confirmation hearings, I noted several core principles that seem to underpin Professor Sunstein's work.  He advocates greater transparency in the regulatory process. One of his recommendations is that agencies be required to better justify decisions to regulate, particularly when the costs of regulations appear to exceed the benefits. That makes sense to me.  Professor Sunstein strongly supports the use of cost-benefit analysis as a tool for evaluating regulation. At the same time, he recognizes that such analysis has limitations when it comes to considering intangible costs and benefits.  Recently, Professor Sunstein has proposed an alternative to more draconian ``command-and-control'' regulation. In his book ``Nudge,'' he makes a compelling case for regulation that does not dictate actions but instead encourages certain behavior without limiting personal freedoms. This ``nudging'' can promote societal goals without depriving individuals or organizations of other choices.  As with many nominees who make the transition from academia to government service, Professor Sunstein will find that as he steps from the world of theory into the realm of practice, not every idea discussed in the classroom can be easily converted into government policy--nor should it be. During his confirmation hearing, Professor Sunstein and I discussed several provocative statements he has made in the course of his career, statements that are troubling on their face.  I was deeply concerned, for example, by his past comment that hunting should be banned. When I questioned Professor Sunstein on this statement, he responded as follows:       Hunters are among the strongest environmentalists and      conservationists in the United States. And it would be      preposterous for anyone in a position like mine to take steps      to affect their rights or their interests.  In a July 14, 2009, letter to Senator Chambliss, Professor Sunstein promised to respect second amendment rights if confirmed as OIRA Administrator. Professor Sunstein explained:       I strongly believe that the Second Amendment creates an      individual right to possess and use guns for purposes of both      hunting and self-defense. I agree with the Supreme Court's      decision in the Heller case, clearly recognizing the      individual right to have guns for hunting and self-defense.      If confirmed, I would respect the Second Amendment and the      individual right that it recognizes.  I was also concerned by several law review articles in which Professor Sunstein made the bizarre statement that animals be given standing to sue in court--allowing ``representatives'' to sue on an animal's behalf. In response to questions on this subject during his confirmation hearing, Professor Sunstein clarified that he was suggesting this as a means by which existing animal cruelty laws could be enforced by civil suits. In a letter to me on this issue, Professor Sunstein further stated:       I have no personal plans to regulate farm animal husbandry      in any way. If confirmed, and if the Department of      Agriculture were to propose any regulations in that domain, I      would work with the Department to ensure that any proposed      regulations follow the law and fit with the priorities of the      President--and that they take full account of the pressing      needs of America's farmers and ranchers and the countless      consumers who benefit, every day, from their remarkable      efforts.  I will consent to have Professor Sunstein's letter printed in the Record following my remarks.  I know that a number of my colleagues have shared these concerns or raised other concerns based on Professor Sunstein's extensive bibliography. I understand that Professor Sunstein has made himself available to meet with Senators to discuss those concerns and has in some cases provided written clarifications of his positions. I expect that when confirmed as OIRA Administrator, he will continue to be as accessible and responsive to this Congress.  On balance, I support Professor Cass Sunstein as Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have letters of support and Professor Sunstein's letter, to which I referred, printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                               Chamber of Commerce                              of the United States of America,                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2009.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Mitch McConnell,     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Government          Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and Government          Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Leaders Reid and McConnell, Chairman Lieberman and      Ranking Member Collins: The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the      world's largest business federation representing more than      three million businesses and organizations of every size,      sector, and region, urges you to confirm Professor Cass      Sunstein as Administrator of the Office of Information and      Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and      Budget.       Over the course of an impressive career as a legal      academic, Professor Sunstein has made important contributions      in such diverse areas as environmental law, behavioral      economics, and consumer safety. Through his work, he has      improved our understanding of the law and public policy in a      continuing effort to improve the ability of government to      beneficially impact the lives of its citizens.       As OIRA Administrator, Professor Sunstein is almost certain      to apply a thoughtful approach to regulatory oversight and      review. His extensive writings and teachings provide a useful      blueprint of his pragmatic approach to regulation, including      his continued defense of cost-benefit analysis as a tool for      developing rational regulation. His approach is not      influenced by an ideological predisposition--to the contrary,      his writings show a strong commitment to a balanced review      that is biased neither in favor of nor against regulation.       By all accounts, Professor Sunstein is a man of personal      integrity and formidable intellectual prowess, and the      Chamber applauds his willingness to suspend an exceptional      academic career in order to serve his country. The Chamber      urges you to expeditiously confirm Professor Sunstein as      Administrator of OIRA.           Sincerely,                                              R. Bruce Josten,                                         Executive Vice President,     Government Affairs.                                  ____                                              National Association                                             of Manufacturers,                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2009.     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,     Chairman, Senate Committee on Homeland Security and          Government Affairs, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on Homeland Security and          Government Affairs, Dirksen Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins: On      behalf of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) and      the millions of Americans our members employ, I am writing to      offer our support for the confirmation of Cass Sunstein to be      Administrator of the Office of Information & Regulatory      Affairs (OIRA) in the Office of Management & Budget. Thank      you for the swift work of your Committee to report Professor      Sunstein favorably to the full Senate.       The NAM has supported nominees to OIRA under both      Republican and Democratic presidents. The office plays a      crucial role in agency prioritization, paperwork reduction,      and regulatory review. President Obama said that the office      offers a ``dispassionate and analytical `second opinion' on      agency actions.'' We believe that function is especially      crucial during the economic crisis we face and to preserve      high wage jobs from being lost due to unnecessary or      thoughtless government action.       Cass Sunstein, in particular, is deserving of confirmation      because of his keen intellect, expertise in the fields of      administrative and environmental law, and his commitment to      fair and reasoned deliberation of issues that will come      before him. Under an Administrator Sunstein, all sides will      be given a fair hearing and a real opportunity to impact the      final analysis of an issue.       We stand ready to assist in ensuring confirmation by the      full Senate of Cass Sunstein.           Sincerely,                                             Rosario Palmieri,                                                   Vice President,     Infrastructure, Legal & Regulatory Policy.                                  ____                                                     American Farm                                            Bureau Federation,                                Washington, DC, September 1, 2009.     To All U.S. Senators       Dear Senator: Earlier this year, the Senate received the      nomination of Cass Sunstein to serve as administrator of the      Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within      the Office of Management and Budget. This office plays a      vital role in determining the final disposition of      regulations, in particular environmental and natural resource      proposals that have a direct impact on the agricultural      community. Accordingly, Farm Bureau has a strong interest in      the individual that will fill the role of administrator of      that office.       Like others in the agricultural community, we were      concerned about reports related to Mr. Sunstein's views on      animal rights and the impact that could occur should such      views be reflected in federal regulations. We have, however,      had the opportunity to discuss this subject in person with      Mr. Sunstein. He has been candid, forthright and very open      about how he views his role in OIRA. He has shared his      perspective on the issues in question and stressed that he      would not use his position to undermine federal law or      further policies inconsistent with congressional directives.       Based on our discussions with Mr. Sunstein, Farm Bureau has      no objection to his confirmation to the position of      administrator of OIRA and we hope the Senate can take up this      nomination in the near future and that all senators will vote      to confirm him to this post.           Sincerely,                                                 Bob Stallman,                                                        President,     American Farm Bureau Federation.                                  ____                                                     May 20, 2009.     Hon. Susan Collins,     Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security and          Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: Thank you for your support and the      work of your staff throughout the confirmation process. I am      honored by the Committee's vote today and the opportunity to      serve the Nation as the Administrator of the Office of      Information and Regulatory Affairs.       I understand that a question may have arisen recently about      my views on the regulation of farming and farm animals. I      have no personal plans to regulate farm animal husbandry in      any way. If confirmed, and if the Department of Agriculture      were to propose any regulations in that domain, I would work      with the Department to ensure that any proposed regulations      follow the law and fit with the priorities of the President--     and that they take full account of the pressing needs of      America's farmers and ranchers and the countless consumers      who benefit, every day, from their remarkable efforts. The      focus of my academic work on animal welfare is not regulation      of agriculture, but existing state anticruelty laws (over      which OIRA has no authority). My work as Administrator, if I      am confirmed, would reflect the law and the President's      priorities.       Thank you again for your support throughout this process.           Sincerely,                                                 Cass R. Sunstein.
