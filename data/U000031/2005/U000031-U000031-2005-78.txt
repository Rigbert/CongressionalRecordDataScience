Chairman, let me say at the beginning, I am no fan of MTBE, and my State has banned it. But let me point out a couple of facts.  In this bill, the LUST fund, Leaking Underground Storage Tanks fund, has $2.1 billion to clean up these tanks. We have an additional $1 billion for oxygenate as well. And a precedent exists. The Federal Government mandated that we had to have oxygenate in this bill in the past and we have done that before, we have done that with flu vaccine, we have done that for Biomaterials Access Insurance fund. The government mandated it. We have to protect people that carried through on those provisions.  I accept the agreement that is going to be made between the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Bass) and the chairman to work this out.  Please vote ``no'' on the Capps amendment.
