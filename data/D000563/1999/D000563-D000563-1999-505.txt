This really gets to the heart of the debate we had a few weeks ago on the floor of the Senate. Remember how America reacted to Littleton, CO, and the Columbine High School shooting? I think it fixed the attention of this Nation unlike any other event I can remember. We felt we needed to come to the floor of the Senate to try to find a way to reduce the likelihood that guns would get into the hands of children and criminals. The debate went on for a full week, and it ended finally when we had six Republican Senators join the overwhelming majority of Democrats for a tie vote, 50-50, at which point Vice President Gore came to the floor and cast the tie-breaking vote and sent a good, sensible gun control bill over to the U.S. House of Representatives where, unfortunately, the same organization, the National Rifle Association, tore it to pieces, leaving nothing.  So we have our Senate bill, but the National Rifle Association prevailed over in the House. I say to the Senator from Nevada, I wish that I could tell you that I was shocked that the National Rifle Association would be so careless as to send a membership application to a 13-year-old. But when I look at what they did in the U.S. House of Representatives to a good bill, a bill that would have said we are going to have background checks at gun shows so we know that we are not selling to criminals and kids, and Senator Feinstein's amendment that would have prohibited importing these big magazine clips that are just used by gangbangers--they have no value in sport or hunting--and to make sure wehave trigger locks so when kids find a gun in the house, they won't pull the trigger and kill themselves, the NRA opposed that.
