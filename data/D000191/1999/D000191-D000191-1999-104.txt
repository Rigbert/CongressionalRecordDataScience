 This bill is vital in three major areas for my State and for many States across the Union. It contains investment in appropriate projects that are vital to the economic infrastructure and the competitiveness of the United States in the international economy.  In particular, we have provided for an authorization, should all of the environmental reviews be adequately completed by the Corps of Engineers, for the Columbia River. It is vital if the port of Portland is to compete in the Asia Rim, that they be able to accommodate the new larger class of ships.  It is vital in a number of other areas. The environment. Certainly we can say this is probably the most important piece of environmental legislation to pass this Congress. It contains money for a number of projects in my district: Amazon Creek; Springfield Millrace; going to look at nonstructural flood control alternatives for the Willamette River; Skinner Butte Park environmental restoration right in the heart of the largest city of my district; and, finally, it is good for salmon. It contains a large investment in a long overdue Willamette River temperature control project that I have been working on for almost a decade here in Congress. It is a large project, $65 million, but it will correct problems created by the Federal Government when those dams were constructed, which are destroying salmon runs in the McKenzie and Willamette Rivers.  All in all, this is an excellent piece of legislation. It is good for the economy, good for the environment, and good for water resources across the United States.
