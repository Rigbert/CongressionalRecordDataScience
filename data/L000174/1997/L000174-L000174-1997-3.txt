President, I am delighted that the Senate has approved the nomination of Charles R. Breyer to be a U.S. District Judge for the Northern District of California.  The American Bar Association unanimously found Mr. Breyer to be well-qualified, its highest rating, for this appointment. He has extensive trial experience with the district attorney's office for the city and county of San Francisco, the Department of Justice Watergate Special Prosecution Force, and in private practice. His nomination enjoys the strong support of Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer.  The Northern District of California has 3 vacancies out of 14 judgeships and desperately needs Charles Breyer to help manage its growing backlog of cases.  I am delighted for Mr. Breyer and his distinguished family that he was confirmed. He will make a fine judge.                          ____________________
