This legislation, while not the comprehensive health care reform called for earlier, takes an important and long overdue step in addressing the insecurity many Americans feel about their health insurance.  Americans expect their insurance to be there when they need it. That is why we buy it. And yet many Americans find that, just when they need their health insurance, it is not there, or they are denied coverage, or they can't afford the policy premiums.  This bill provides a measure of health security in a number of ways.

Insurers could not impose preexisting condition limitations for more than 12 months. This means that employees could change jobs without fear of losing their insurance.  Guaranteed access: Under this bill, insurers are required to offer insurance to all groups, regardless of the health status of any member of the group.
