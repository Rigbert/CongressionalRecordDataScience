Speaker, I would like to reemphasize that point, because I do not think most citizens have been listening to the fact that all these cuts that are occurring out of the Medicare program, the nursing home program, the additional costs for students loans, and the very point that my colleagues are raising, which is tax increases for families who are working who earn under $30,000 a year, really add up.  We are talking about over 8 million families in our country who are going to have to pay more in taxes.  Mr. Speaker, I have a chart here that I want to reference that really shows that if you are working and you earn under $10,000 a year, if you earn under $20,000, if you earn under $30,000 a year, under their proposal, you are going to have to pay more.  But, if you happen to be in the category, as every Member of Congress is who has accepted the pay raises, of over $100,000 a year, as Speaker Gingrich is, you are going to get a handsome tax break. For those people who earn over $200,000 a year, they will average a $14,000 tax break, while people who are earning under $30,000 a year are going to have to pay about $600 more a year in taxes and in lost benefits from these health programs.  Mr. Speaker, that is really something to consider. To me it shows the unfairness of the Gingrich set of proposals on the vast majority of the American people.                              {time}  2215  I am glad that the gentlewoman brought up the point. In my district I will say that the earned income tax credit helps 26,000 working families.
