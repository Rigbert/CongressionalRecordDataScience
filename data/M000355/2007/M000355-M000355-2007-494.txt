 President, let me add while my friend the majority leader is here that I hope he joins my view that having finished this supplemental appropriations bill today, we hope the staffs of the two Appropriations Committees in the House and Senate will work expeditiously to finish the conference so it can be approved, hopefully, on the first day we are back, after the House comes back, and we can get it down to the President for the inevitable veto so we can get through this process again and get the much needed money to the troops.
