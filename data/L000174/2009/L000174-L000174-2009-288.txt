President, this week, Senator Cornyn insisted on offering an amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that is most unfortunate. It is an amendment that is so broad in scope and, I believe, wrongheaded, that I felt I should note my disagreement. As a former prosecutor, I am troubled that the Senate is being called upon to prejudge matters that have yet to be fully investigated. This amendment is a classic example of putting the cart before the horse.  I have proposed a Commission of Inquiry in order to move these debates outside of partisan politics. An independent and nonpartisan panel taking a comprehensive approach is better positioned to determine what happened. Before the Senate starts pontificating about who should and should not be investigated, sanctioned, ethically disciplined or prosecuted, would it not be a good idea to know what took place?  I was encouraged to hear Senator Cornyn call for ``an end to the poisonous environment that has overtaken the debate about detention and interrogation policy in the aftermath of September 11th, 2001.'' I agree and that is why I proposed taking the matter out of partisanship and away from political institutions. That is not what the amendment does, however. First, Senator Cornyn styled this as a sense of the Senate making overly broad findings, now he has stripped those findings from this amendment, and is doing something even more nonsensical, trying to prohibit the use of funds for something that funds are not even provided for in the emergency supplemental.  An amendment politicizing decisions about investigations and prosecutions is not the right approach. We should have closed the book on efforts to have partisan interests infect Federal law enforcement decisions when we liftedthe veil on the Bush White House's manipulation of U.S. attorney firings. Some of us have worked very hard to restore the U.S. Department of Justice to be an institution worthy of its name and to again command the respect of the American people.  Senator Cornyn spoke on the floor this week about learning together from our past mistakes. I, again, invite all Senators from all parts of the political spectrum to join my call for a nonpartisan investigation to do just that.  The Justice Department has yet to finish a 5-year inquiry regarding whether some of the lawyers responsible for the Office of Legal Counsel opinions that justified brutality acted in ways that failed to meet professional and ethical standards. It was a Republican ranking member on the Judiciary Committee who earlier this year said that if the news reports of how those memoranda came to be generated are true, there may have been criminal conduct involved. President Obama and the Attorney General have been very forthright in saying that those who relied on and followed the legal advice in interrogating prisoners would not be prosecuted.  What needs to be determined, and has not, is how we came to a place where the United States of America tortured people in its custody in violation of our laws. Those legal opinions have been withdrawn. One of the earliest was withdrawn by the Bush administration in advance of the confirmation hearing on Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General, and others were limited in the final days of the Bush administration. What we do not know and what this amendment is geared toward covering for, is the role of the former Vice President and his staff, the role of the Bush White House in generating those opinions legalizing brutal interrogations.  Last week, the Judiciary Committee held our most recent hearing into these matters. I thank Senator Whitehouse for chairing the hearing before the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. Philip Zelikow testified about how dissent over the legal justifications and implementation of these practices was stifled and overridden. Ali Soufan, the FBI interrogator of Abu Zubaydah, testified about his success using traditional interrogation techniques, and about how ineffective and counterproductive the use of extreme practices was in that case. And Professor David Luban critiqued the released memoranda as legally and ethically dishonest.  Last week also evidenced, yet again, why the approach of an independent, nonpartisan review is the right one. Partisans defending the Bush-Cheney administration's actions chose not to look for the truth, but to mount partisan attacks. They have succeeded in fulfilling the prophecy they created--that any effort to consider these matters would break down into partisan recriminations--by themselves doing just that. They elevated the minor role of a former minority member of the House Committee on Intelligence into their principle concern, thereby ignoring the driving force of the former Vice President, other officials in the Bush-Cheney administration, and the complicity of the Republican congressional officials who were in control of both the House and the Senate. They raised straw men, went on witch hunts, and sought to distract from the fundamental underlying facts. All they really succeeded in demonstrating is that they will continue to view these matters through a partisan lens, and that they have yet to show any willingness to join in a fair, nonpartisan inquiry. Their recent actions reinforce why we need the independent, nonpartisan inquiry for which I have been calling over the last several months.  For those who have reflexively opposed my proposal for a comprehensive, nonpartisan, independent inquiry, I ask these questions: If we never find the truth and understand the mistakes we have made, what incentive is there to avoid them in the future? What guarantee is there that the Government will not repeat the same mistakes? What incentive will future administrations have to respect the very rule of law that distinguishes us as a nation? The risk that the past will again be prologue is too great to take simply because it is not easy to face the truth.  I continue to believe that we must know what happened, and why, to ensure that America does not go down this dark road, again. Before we turn the page, we need to read the page. We should proceed without partisanship, not as Republican or Democratic politicians, but as Americans who recognize, as Philip Zelikow testified last week, that torture was ``a collective failure and it was a mistake.''  During the last several weeks, we have seen the release of the Senate Armed Services report documenting the complicity of top Bush-Cheney administration officials. News reports have indicated that in April 2003, after the invasion of Iraq, the U.S. arrested a top officer in Saddam Hussein's security force, and that some acting on behalf of then Vice President Cheney urged the use of waterboarding in an effort to coerce a ``confession'' supporting the link between al-Qaida and Iraq. That link, of course, has proven to be an illusory justification for the war, as were the nonexistent stockpiles of nuclear weapons and others weapons of mass destruction. Likewise, COL Larry Wilkerson, former chief of staff to President Bush's first Secretary of State, has written that these brutal interrogations, conducted in the spring of 2002 before the legal authorizations of the OLC memoranda were crafted, were aimed at the ``discovery of a smoking gun linking Iraq and al Qaida.'' Perhaps these reports help explain why former Vice President Cheney continues to adamantly support these discredited practices. Perhaps they explain why the proposed amendment's language is so vague with regard to those who, in its words, ``provided input into the legal opinions.''  There are strong passions on all sides. It is not only former Vice President Cheney and his apologists who feel strongly. There are those who will not be satisfied by anything less than prosecutions for war crimes. I have always believed that there is a fundamental middle ground, one that focuses on the most important issue at stake--finding out what happened and why.  I appreciate the support of so many who have rallied to this idea of a nonpartisan commission and a comprehensive review of what took place. Ambassador Thomas Pickering and Philip Zelikow, the executive director of the 9/11 Commission and a former State Department counselor, have both testified in favor of this idea. Former Bush administration official Alberto Mora, and the former FBI Director under President Reagan, Judge William Sessions, have both recognized the need for accountability. Distinguished former military officers, who are familiar with commissions of inquiry, have been supportive. These officers include ADM Lee Gun and MG Antonio Taguba, as well as the National Institute of Military Justice. Senators Feingold and Whitehouse, both members of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence Committees, have strongly endorsed the idea, as has Senator Robert Byrd. The Speaker of the House has spoken favorably about getting to the bottom of these matters, and she has shown her willingness to cooperate with such an inquiry.  Human rights leaders and organizations have endorsed the approach, including Amnesty International, the Constitution Project, the International Center for Transitional Justice, Human Rights Watch, Physicians for Human Rights, the Open Society Institute, the Brennan Center, Human Rights First, and others. Prominent religious leaders such as those represented by the National Religious Campaign Against Torture, which is composed of a broad spectrum of religious denominations, support this idea.  Thoughtful commentators like Jon Meachem, Nicolas Kristof, Tom Ricks, Frank Rich, and Maureen Dowd have come to endorse a nonpartisan commission. Editorials in support of a nonpartisan commission have appeared over the last several weeks in The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, and in Vermont's Rutland Herald.  Last week, the Attorney General of the United States testified that the Justice Department would, of course, cooperate with such a commission were Congress to establish one. The President of the United States has said that he, too, feels that such a pursuit would be better conducted ``outside of the typical hearing process'' by a bipartisan body of ``independent participants who are above reproach and have credibility.''  I urge those Republicans who truly believe, as Senator Cornyn said, that in looking at these matters we must ``maintain our sense of perspective and objectivity and fairness'' to join in a bipartisan effort to provide for a nonpartisan review by way of a commission of inquiry. Such a commission would allow us to put aside partisan bickering, learn from our mistakes and move forward.  Just as partisan Republicans were wrong to try to hold up the confirmation of Attorney General Holder to extort a pledge from him that he would not exercise independent prosecutorial judgment, it is wrong to shoe horn this amendment onto this emergency spending bill. I opposed the effort by some Republican Senators who wanted the Nation's chief prosecutor to agree in advance that he would turn a blind eye to possible lawbreaking before investigating whether it occurred. Republican Senators asked for such a pledge, a commitment that no prosecutor should give. To his credit, Eric Holder did not.  Similarly, passing a broad and unrelated amendment on an emergency appropriations bill that seeks to instruct the Attorney General how to fulfill his constitutional responsibilities is not the path forward. Before we even know how these legal opinions were generated and who was responsible for what, this amendment calls for the Senate to usurp the Justice Department's role in determining whether and, if so, who to investigate or prosecute. Any former prosecutor, any lawyer and any citizen should know that it is not the decision of or an appropriate role for the U.S. Senate.                           Amendment No. 1156  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support Senator Lieberman's amendment relating to Army end strength. By clarifying existing law contained in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008 and providing $400 million for personnel and O&M costs, it ensures soldiers already on Active Duty or who are about to be enlisted are able to serve. It does not create new authority for more Active-Duty soldiers, rather it corrects an erroneous legal interpretation about which end strength number should be used to calculate percentages for additional troops. I applaud Senator Lieberman's commitment to this goal.                      Status of Forces Agreements
