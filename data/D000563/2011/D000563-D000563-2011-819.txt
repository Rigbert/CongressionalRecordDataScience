He is a financial consultant who is recognized as the creator of many aspects of the modern card industry. But he says what I have been saying for months--that the arguments small banks have been making against my amendment defy economic logic and common sense.  I also believe interchange reform is essential for consumers. Banks will tell you consumers will be hurt by reform because banks will have to raise consumer fees to make up for lost revenue.  First, when did we start listening to banks and credit card companies to tell us what is good for consumers? Second, read the headlines for the past few years and you will see that banks were already raising consumer fees to record highs in 2008, 2009, and 2010--before my amendment became law. They are always looking for ways to raise fees on consumers as high as the market will allow.  Third, consumers are already paying for the current interchange system. Soaring interchange fees are passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices for gasoline and groceries. And the current system particularly hurts unbanked consumers who pay with cash.  I believe consumers benefit from transparency, competition, and choice. The current interchange system has been designed specifically to avoid these features. That is why consumer groups agree with me and support the interchange reform which we have on the books.  I know the financial industry lobbyists are out there now storming the Halls of Congress. They are saying: Let's delay the Fed's interchange rulemaking for a year or two. Let's study this issue some more. Study, study, study; this is one great study hall, this U.S. Senate. But there comes a point when we need to act, and we are prepared to act now with the Federal Reserve in April and in July.  There is no need to delay these rules. Read the comments I submitted to the Fed about their draft rulemaking. You will see how the new law provides reasonable timeframes for implementing every part of the Fed's rules.  I saw this call for delay and study before, on the Credit CARD Act back in 2009, and it does not surprise me we are hearing it again.  If my colleagues remember nothing else, they should remember this: Delaying interchange reform will have significant consequences to employers, small businesses, and consumers all across America. Not only will businesses, universities, government agencies, and charities keep paying the current $1.3 billion per month in debit interchange fees, the fees will keep going up further. There will be nothing to constrain Visa and MasterCard from setting higher and higher fees. There is no competition in this industry.  Some of my colleagues say they are concerned about small banks and consumers. So am I. That is why I drafted the amendment to exempt them. Independent analysts and consumer groups agree that the reform we passed protects small banks and consumers.  I say to my colleagues, do not tell me you are worried about small banks and consumers and then push for a delay that will serve to provide $1 billion a month in more fees primarily to the largest banks in America.  A delay in this implementation would give Visa and MasterCard and the big banks a multibillion-dollar handout--have we heard this song before?--while leaving merchants and consumers worse off than they already are. I am not going to sit by and let the big banks and card companies get away with trying to kill this reform. They have been bailed out enough already.  I urge my colleagues in Congress: Do not bail out the big banks on Wall Street another time. Once in a political lifetime is enough for most of us.  I am standing with the consumers and merchants on this issue. I hope my colleagues will join me and find it is a good place to stand.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
