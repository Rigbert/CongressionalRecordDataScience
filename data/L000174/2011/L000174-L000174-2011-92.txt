This has allowed the online marketplace to evolve into the vibrant and competitive system that we are all accustomed to today. Last December, the Federal Communications Commission took action to promulgate ``network neutrality'' rules, which are set to go into effect later this month. These are rules that will create transparency and foster competition. I oppose the resolution being considered by the Senate today that disapproves of the Commission's actions in this area.  Many Americans have either no choice or a limited choice of broadband service providers. This is particularly true in rural areas like Vermont. This lack of competition in the market raises the threat of providers discriminating against certain lawful Web sites and Internet content. Net neutrality rules are crucial in ensuring that the Internet remains the ultimate free marketplace of ideas, where better products or services succeed on their own merits and not based on special financial relationships with providers.  Congress and the executive branch must take steps to ensure that competition on the Internet is vibrant. This has taken on new importance as the Internet has become increasingly central to our lives. The online marketplace is going to be a key driver of the 21st century economy, and implementing net neutrality rules now, while it is still growing, will ensure that the online marketplace will continue to be dynamic well into the future.  The Judiciary Committee held hearings on this issue several years ago, and it is an issue in which I have been interested. I was an original cosponsor of the Internet Freedom Preservation Act in both the 109th and 110th Congresses. That bill would have gone even further to preserve an open Internet than the actions taken by the FCC last year. I will remain a strong supporter of strong and responsible net neutrality regulations in the Senate, and I oppose the resolution being considered today.
