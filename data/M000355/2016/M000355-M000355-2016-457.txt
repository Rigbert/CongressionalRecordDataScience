The Democratic leader has asked for the Senate to pass legislation providing $1.1 billion in immediate funding to combat Zika. In fact, the conference report before us provides exactly that--$1.1 billion in immediate funding to combat Zika. Passing the House-passed conference report is the only way to get this critical funding before September.  This is a conference report. The House has already passed it. It is not amendable. The Senate should act now. Therefore, I object.
