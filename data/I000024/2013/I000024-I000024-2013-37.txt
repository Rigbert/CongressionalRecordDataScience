President, with November being National Adoption Month and this Saturday being National Adoption Day, I would like to take a moment to highlight the issue of adoption--an issue that is near and dear to my heart. Earlier this month Senator Landrieu and I introduced our annual National Adoption Day and Month Resolution which was agreed to on November 13 by unanimous consent.  The importance of family in the growth and development of a child can never be overstated. There are millions of children worldwide who are growing up without the love and support of a family. It is my hope that through National Adoption Day and our work on the Congressional Coalition on Adoption, we can one day make the dream of every child having a permanent and loving family a reality.  Like Senator Landrieu, I have seen first-hand the many blessings that come from the adoption of a child. My daughter Molly adopted my granddaughter, Zegita Marie, from an orphanage in Ethiopia. Z-girl, as I like to call her, is such a smart and confident young girl and I know it is because of the support and love of her family she is able to thrive. More so, Z-girl has been a huge blessing to our family and one that I am forever grateful for.  National Adoption Month is about recognizing those who have made the sacrifices to make a child's life better, and encouraging those who are thinking about adopting to take that step and make a real difference in a child's life. In that spirit, I want to take a moment to recognize a young woman that has taken the step to be a difference in a child's life. As many of my colleagues know, each October the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute hosts its annual Angels in Adoption Gala here in Washington. Every year Senators and Representatives nominate an individual or a family who has made a significant difference in the area of adoption and foster care, and I have had the honor of nominating individuals from my home State of Oklahoma. Unfortunately, circumstances did not allow my nominee, Kate Arnold of Oklahoma City, to come to the event, so I would like to take a moment to recognize her and share her wonderful story.  In 2003, Kate Arnold was volunteering at a San Francisco Bay Area home for teenage mothers when she met Miriam, a mother to 2 boys. Over the course of years Kate developed a relationship with Miriam, her boys, and a daughter born during that time. Kate became a constant presence in their lives, frequently taking the children out for the day or overnight, while Miriam struggled to care for them.  In March of 2011, Child Protective Services removed Miriam's children from her care and over the next several months Miriam continued her struggle with addiction. In October of that year, a social worker asked her to name who her children should go to if she lost them permanently. Miriam named Kate.  At the time Kate was here in D.C. attending Georgetown University School of Medicine. However, she did not let that stop her and immediately petitioned Georgetown for the ability to complete her fourth year of medical school in California so that she could become the children's foster parent and begin adoption proceedings.  In July 2012, Kate returned to California and by August the children were living with her. This year she graduated from Georgetown and the family moved to Oklahoma City so Kate could begin her residency at the University of Oklahoma.  Kate reflects the spirit of National Adoption Month and Day, not only in her decision to foster and adopt Miriam's children but also through years of prior work and commitment to the foster care community. Kate is a great example of what one person can do to become a blessing to the millions of children throughout the world that are in need of a family. I hope that others will join Senator Landrieu and myself this month of November and recognize the great need that exists for families to open their arms to children, both here in the United States and abroad, and take the leap of faith that will change a child's life.                          ____________________
