 And I thank him very much for all his work in this area.  I think, just to summarize--and I recognize there is a lot of territorial imperative resounding around this issue. And I hope that can be put into perspective and that we can look to find something around which we can rally.  True, this is a compromise proposal. I hope it will not be dismissed out of hand. It has a liability cap, yes. It has strong look-back provisions. It provides $428 billion over 25 years. It does divide the money 50-50 to federal and state. The money that goes to the State can be used for 14 specific programs. The money that goes to the federal fund is used for tobacco-related research and public health programs. It does have the FDA provisions. It does have strong advertising provisions.  Now, as I have talked to people, there is a kind of purist attitude that ``Unless a bill is this or that, I won't vote for it.'' Well, there are a lot of strong feelings on behalf of all of us. I could say--and it is true--my calls on tobacco reform have run dominantly in the negative, those people opposed to reform. And yet I think there isn't a Member in this body who does not understand that tobacco reform is something that is important, just forged from one statistic--and that is 3,000 young people a day beginning to smoke, and 1,000 of them dying from tobacco-related illnesses.  We know we have to do something. We do know when you raise the price, teenagers stop or are deterred from buying. If you combine that with a strong no-advertising provision and a strong look-back provision to keep the companies honest, I think you have a bill that is about as good as one can get.  So I'm very pleased and proud to join with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, once again, to offer to work with whomever in this body so that we might be able to introduce a bill that will be looked upon with favor by a majority.  I thank Chairman Hatch and I yield the floor.
