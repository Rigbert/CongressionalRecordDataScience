 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fellow Kentuckian and proud Republican, Dr. Bobby Russell Himes. Earlier this year, Dr. Himes was named Central Kentucky News-Journal's 2004 Man of the Year. The title is one that Dr. Himes has earned.  Dr. Himes has always strived to live life to its very fullest and give 110 percent. After serving 4 years in the U.S. Air Force, he completed his bachelor's degree at Kentucky Wesleyan College. He went on to finish his formal education by earning a masters degree from Appalachian State University and a doctorate from Vanderbilt University. For 40 years, he was a professor of history and political science at Kentucky's Campbellsville University. He was an inspiring educator, mentor, and friend to students and colleagues. While he no longer teaches classes, he continues to support and encourage younger generations.  Beyond his role as an educator, Dr. Himes has been a businessman, a stalwart volunteer for the Republican Party, and an instrumental figure in creating the Central Kentucky Arts Series. Furthermore, he is a devoted husband, father, grandfather, and now a great-grandfather.  Dr. Himes is truly an inspiration. He persevered through a childhood during the Great Depression and a battle with cancer. If there is one thing to learn from Dr. Bobby Russell Himes, it is his philosophy for living. Dr. Himes believes that, ``By setting goals--even if you don't achieve them--you're going to go further just because you set them.''  May we please take this time to honor the man whom so many look up to, Dr. Bobby Russell Himes, Central Kentucky News-Journal's 2004 Man of the Year.                          ____________________
