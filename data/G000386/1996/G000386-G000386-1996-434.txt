 President, I want to speak on a subject that I have spoken before. This is the issue of the promotion of Navy Comdr. Robert Stumpf and his promotion to the rank of captain. This promotion has been denied by the Armed Services Committee. It was denied because of his suspected involvement in inappropriate behavior at the Tailhook convention.  I support the committee's decision to deny the promotion. I have spoken on this matter several times. Since my last speech, I have had a letter from Commander Stumpf's attorney. The attorney's name is Mr. Charles W. Gittins. Mr. Gittins thinks that the facts are the issue here. Of course, I disagree. In my mind, the facts are not at issue.  What do the facts mean? It is the answer to the question that gets Commander Stumpf in hot water.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Mr. Gittins' letter to me.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Williams & Connolly,                                    Washington, DC, April 4, 1996.     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Grassley: I am writing on behalf of my client,      Commander Robert E. Stumpf, USN, who was the subject of your      March 16, 1996 floor speech in the Senate. I applaud you for      asking the five questions relevant to whether Commander      Stumpf should be promoted because it is apparent that your      colleagues have lost sight of those important attributes in      the political infighting over Bob Stumpf's promotion.       Had you researched the answers to the five questions that      you ``asked'', and put the answers as well as the questions      in the Congressional Record, I am sure that you would have      embarrassed your colleagues with the truth. Moreover, I am      sure that if you had researched the answers before you went      to the floor to give the speech, your speech would have been      one of unequivocal support for Commander Stumpf's promotion.       Your first question, like the rest, can be answered by      reference to the official records of the Court of Inquiry as      well as by reference to Commander Stumpf's Official Military      Personnel File. Commander Stumpf's record is clearly among      the finest in the Navy. Two Navy Captain selection boards now      have selected Commander Stumpf for promotion to Captain. In      order to do so, the Boards were required to find that      Commander Stumpf was among those ``best qualified'' from      among those officers who the board found were ``fully      qualified.'' Further, Commander Stumpf's performance in      combat, illuminated by the many citations for bravery and      heroism awarded him by the United States, abundantly proves      that the promotion boards were correct in their judgment of      Commander Stumpf's performance.       Your second question, concerning leadership and discipline,      are equally well answered by the Navy's official records. All      you needed to do was read them. Commander Stumpf was      described by senior officers who testified at his Court of      Inquiry as ``among the finest leaders that they have had the      opportunity to work with.'' In this regard, you may wish to      read the testimony of Vice Admiral Kihune and Rear Admiral      McGowan, two officers with personal and daily observation of      Commander Stumpf in positions of responsibility. You may also      wish to read the statement of Captain Dennis Gillespie, USN,      Commander Stumpf's commander in combat during Desert Storm.      Commander Stumpf's leadership was nowhere more vigorously      tested than in combat, where he personally led 9 carrier air      wing airstrikes without losing a single aircraft. Discipline?      How much discipline does it take to fly a combat aircraft at      500 miles an hour into the face of anti-aircraft fire and      surface to air missiles while still managing to put bombs on      target. I submit that there is no greater demonstration of      discipline.       Does Commander Stumpf set a good example? If not, why was      Commander Stumpf chosen to lead the Blue Angels in the first      place? The singular purpose of the Blue Angels is to provide      a good example of the Navy for public consumption. Perhaps      you saw Commander Stumpf perform at the airshow in Iowa. If      so, you could not help but be impressed with the example      Commander Stumpf sets. The fact that he was returned to      command of the Blue Angels by the Navy even after he was      subjected to an embarrassing Navy Court of Inquiry speaks      volumes about the type example Commander Stumpf sets.      Moreover, his press conference following the Court's decision      made clear Commander Stumpf's agenda--at that press      conference Commander Stumpf said he would thereafter take no      more questions about Tailhook. His job was to ``make the Navy      look good. And that what [he] intend[ed] to do''       Your question four is self-evident by Commander Stumpf's      performance in combat. How many leaders who flew 22 combat      missions can say that they brought back every plane that they      started the mission with? Moreover, the junior officers who      testified for the government, pursuant to grants of      testimonial and transactional immunity, each stated      unequivocally that Commander Stumpf was an outstanding role      model, one who was universally recognized as superior      throughout the Navy and the strike-fighter community, and one      they would gladly follow into combat. There simply is no      higher praise for a military officer. There has never been      any evidence adduced, in the Committee, in the Court of      Inquiry, or in subsequent reviews conducted by the Navy or      the Committee, that Commander Stumpf is anything but an      outstanding role model.       Finally, Commander Stumpf has over and over throughout his      career proven his integrity. Commander Stumpf has been      forthcoming about Tailhook and his involvement therein. The      Secretary of the Navy personally questioned Commander Stumpf      closely on these issues and determined that Commander Stumpf      was not culpable for any misconduct, either by him or his      subordinates, at Tailhook. Secretary Dalton confirmed that      Commander Stumpf was ``appropriately selected for promotion      and that he should be promoted.'' Until you raised the      question of Commander Stumpf's integrity, there has never      been any insinuation that Commander Stumpf was other than      forthright and honest in all of his dealings throughout his      Navy career. If you have specifics in mind, please feel free      to communicate them to me. I will be glad to have Commander      Stumpf respond.       If your five questions are the measuring stick that the      Senate intends to follow on all future officer nominations, I      applaud your standard. If you intend to apply that standard      to Commander Stumpf, it would do you and your colleagues well      to actually read the records before you draw conclusions      about Commander Stumpf, or any other officer who presents to      the Committee or the Senate similarly situated.       What has diminished the credibility of the Committee and      the Senate with the public in Commander Stumpf's case is      ignorance of, or intentional lack of familiarity with, the      unalterable fact that Commander Stumpf did not conduct      himself in any way inappropriately at the 1991 Tailhook      Symposium. That is a fact that cannot be ignored, even on the      floor of the United States Senate.           Sincerely,                                               Charles W. Gittins.
