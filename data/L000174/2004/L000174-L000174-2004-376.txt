President, recently I heard about CAPT John Lawrence From, Jr. in McLean, VA, a retired Navy nuclear submarine captain, who lived next door to Jim Rosser and his wife, Nicki Watts. They told me that he had died of pneumonia at Arlington Hospital at the age of 82. Retired Air Force Colonel Watts sent me material about him, and I would like to include it in the Record. Sometimes obituaries are so cold and give so little about somebody's life that I wanted the Senate to pause and think of Captain From.  Captain From not only served in the Pacific during World War II, but also commanded the first Polaris missile nuclear submarine. The Pacific Theater tours were dangerous, extraordinarily uncomfortable, and extremely necessary to our efforts to win World War II.  People get mentioned on this floor for many things, but I agree with Colonel Watts that Captain From should receive recognition here.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record some material I have about him.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       John Lawrence From, Jr. (Larry), 82, a retired Navy nuclear      submarine captain, died March 19, 2004, of pneumonia at      Arlington Hospital. He had lived in McLean, VA, since 1972.       Captain From, a native of Norfolk, VA, was a 1943 graduate      (class of 1944) of the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD.       He served in the Pacific Theater during WWII, making six      submarine war patrols. After the war, he commanded a diesel-     electric submarine, and in the 1960s commanded the first      Polaris missile nuclear submarine, the USS George Washington      III (SSBN 598), and later the Ulysses S. Grant. (Larry was      pictured on the cover of LIFE magazine's March 22, 1963 issue      as the first Polaris captain.) He retired in late 1972 at the      conclusion of his last assignment as Commanding Officer,      Naval Submarine Base, Pearl Harbor.       Captain From was a graduate of the Naval War College in      Newport, RI, and the National War College in Washington, DC.      He received a master's degree in international affairs from      George Washington University.       His service awards included the Legion of Merit with Gold      Star (second award), the Joint Service Commendation Medal,      and the Navy Commendation Medal with Combat ``V''.      Submarines, while he served in them, were awarded the      Presidential Unit Citation and Navy Unit Commendation.       In the late 1960s, he was instrumental in establishing,      developing, and maintaining a Boy Scout Troop in the      Chesterbrook Woods community of McLean.       After retiring from the Navy, Larry worked for nearly 12      years at Science Applications International Corporation as      Vice President of research and development, and provided the      Navy with state-of-the-art underwater tracking systems based      on advanced signal processing techniques.       Larry was a parishioner of St. John's Catholic Church in      McLean, and his faith was like the submarines he served:      silent but deep. He was committed to serving the Lord and his      lovely wife, Mary Jane, whom he loved so devoutly and cared      for for so many years. Through it all, he remained a tower of      strength, always to be commended and remembered.       Survivors include his wife of 58 years, Mary Jane; three      children, Deborah J. Fletcher of Mill Valley, CA, Tina L.      Egge of Fredericksburg, VA, and Michael E. From of Seattle,      WA; and three grandsons, Kyle Egge, and Christopher and      Patrick From. He is also survived by his brother, William      From, and sister, Mary Elizabeth Troxell.       Larry was interred at Arlington Cemetery on March 30th.                          ____________________
