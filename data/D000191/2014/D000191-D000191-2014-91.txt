Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  H.R. 4032, the North Texas Invasive Species Barrier Act, provides a very specific and necessary exemption to the Lacey Act Amendments of 1981.  The bill would allow the North Texas Municipal Water District and the Greater Texoma Utility Authority to transport water that contains potentially invasive species from the Oklahoma side of Lake Texoma into Texas. However, all water would be kept in closed conveyance systems and would be fully treated, with all zebra mussels, quagga mussels, and other potentially harmful aquatic life being fully removed before being released into any water body.                              {time}  1730  Two years ago, we passed legislation that allowed the water district to pump water containing zebra mussel larvae from Lake Texoma, but now, quagga mussels have emerged as a threat there as well.  These species are the bane of many a power plant and municipal water plant operator. Hundreds of millions will be spent in the near future to deal with these problems in intake and outflow pipes and other infrastructure.  They also harm our fisheries by crowding out native species and taking their food. They are driving out our native mussels toward extinction. The Lacey Act is vital to our Nation's interests because it prevents--or hopefully prevents the spread of undesirable, injurious species like zebra and quagga mussels. A strong Lacey Act is vital to our economy and our environment.  That said, Texas needs access to this water. The aforementioned entities have a comprehensive plan for ensuring that these water transfers do not cause invasive species to spread.  For those reasons, we will support H.R. 4032; but we need to remember that this bill, which was put forward as a remedy to a very difficult and a very unique situation, is not a precedent for broad-spread exemptions to the Lacey Act.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
