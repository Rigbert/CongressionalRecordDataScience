Speaker, I rise today to recognize the accomplishments of Gary Campbell, who is retiring after 34 years of service to education in Southwest Michigan. Earning his degree through Western Michigan University, the largest institution of higher education in Michigan's Sixth District, Gary has shown his commitment to the education of countless children over a four-decade span. Gary began his career at Edwardsburg Public Schools where he taught high school courses for three years. His keen intellect and strong work ethic soon propelled him to school administration. He has served as Superintendentof Lakeshore Public Schools for over 10 years. Behind the scenes, Gary has been extremely active within the communities of Southwest Michigan, becoming involved with such organizations as the Lakeshore Rotary Club, Lakeshore Chamber of Commerce, Council for World Class Communities, Community Partnership for Lifelong Learning, and the Lakeshore Excellence Foundation. Constantly working to contribute to his community, Gary has truly earned my admiration and the respect of the entire South West Michigan Community. Congratulations, Gary! We wish you continued success! Go Lancers!                          ____________________
