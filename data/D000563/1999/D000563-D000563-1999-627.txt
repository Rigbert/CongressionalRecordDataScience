President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator Chafee, Senator Kennedy, Senator Schumer, Senator Lautenberg, Senator Boxer, and Senator Reed to introduce the Child Firearm Access Prevention Act of 1999.  Following the tragedy in Littleton, Colorado, it is natural to ask ``why'', but we also need to ask ``how?''  How do two teenagers enter their high school armed with a Tec 9, semi-automatic assault rifle, two sawed off 12 gauge shotguns, a 9 millimeter semi-automatic pistol, 30 explosive devices and kill 13 innocent people?  There are those who say you can't pass laws to stop this behavior because those inclined to do it will simply ignore the law. I guess the message of this logic is if you can't solve the entire problem, you shouldn't even try.  I think that logic is wrong. We have to act and we have to act now. Everyday in America, 13 children die as a result of gun violence.  In the last two years our schools have been shattered by gun violence.  October 1, 1997, Pearl, Mississippi: A sixteen year old boy killed his mother then went to his high school and shot nine students, two fatally.  December 1, 1997, West Paducah, Kentucky: Three students were killed and five were wounded in a hallway at Heath High School by a 14 year old classmate.  March 24, 1998, Jonesboro, Arkansas: Four girls and a teacher were shot to death and 10 people were wounded during a false fire alarm at a middle school when two boys 11 and 13 opened fire from the woods.  April 24, 1998, Edinboro, Pennsylvania: A science teacher was shot to death in front of students at an eighth grade dance by a 14 year old student.  May 19, 1998, Fayetteville, Tennessee: Three days before his graduation, an 18 year old honor student allegedly opened fire in a parking lot at a high school killing a classmate who was dating his ex-girlfriend.  May 21, 1998, Springfield, Oregon: Two teen-agers were killed and more than 20 people were hurt when a 15 year old boy allegedly opened fire at a high school. The boy's parents were killed at their home.  There is something we can do to protect our children. Seventeen states have already recognized the problem and passed a child firearm access prevention law, which is known as a CAP law. These laws say to those who purchase and own guns, it is not enough for you to follow the law in purchasing them and to use the guns safely; you have another responsibility. If you are going to own a firearm in your home, you have to keep it safely and securely so that children do not have access to it.  These laws are effective. Florida was the first State to pass a CAP law in 1989. The following year, unintentional shooting deaths of children dropped 50%. Moreover, a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in October of 1997 found a 23% decrease in unintentional firearm related deaths among children younger than 15 in those States that had implemented CAP laws. According to the JAMA article, if all 50 states had CAP laws during the period of 1990-94, 216 children might have lived.  Should we consider these state laws as a national model? I think the obvious answer is yes. Unfortunately, the Littleton tragedy is no longer unique.  Mr. President, what I propose today is Federal legislation that will apply to every State, not just 17, but every State. And this is what it says. If you want to own a handgun, a rifle or shotgun, and it is legal to do so, you can; but if you own it, you have a responsibility to make certain that it is kept securely and safely.  What does the bill do? The bill imposes criminal penalties for gun owners who know or should know that a juvenile could gain access to the gun, and a juvenile does gain access & thereby causes death or injury or exhibits the gun in a public place. The gun owner is subject to a prison sentence of up to 1 year and/or fined $10,000 (a misdemeanor penalty). The bill also provides a felony provision for a reckless violation.  The bill has 5 common sense exceptions. (1) The adult uses a trigger lock, secure storage box, or other secure storage technique; (2) The juvenile used the gun in a lawful act of self-defense; (3) The juvenile takes the gun off the person of a law enforcement official; (4) The owner has no reasonable expectation that juveniles will be on the premises; and (5) The juvenile got the gun as a result of a burglary.  States which have passed CAP laws include: Florida, Connecticut, Iowa, California, Nevada, New Jersey, Virginia, Wisconsin, Hawaii, Maryland, Minnesota, North Carolina, Delaware, Rhode Island, Texas, Massachusetts and Illinois. An examination of this list does not reveal the most liberal states in America. The first State to pass this legislation in 1989 was Florida and in 1995, Texas, certainly no bleeding heart state by any political definition, passed a CAP law.  I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in this bipartisan effort to protect children from the dangers of gun violence. Children and easy access to guns are a recipe for tragedy.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was order to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 936       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
