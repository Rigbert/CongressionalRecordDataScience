Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  As the gentleman was on the floor when the majority leader and I had our weekly colloquy, and he said I was going to be very pleased, I was pleased to hear the information, of course, as to how one perfects an amendment that needs to be made in order, but I did not hear anything about whether or not the Committee on Rules is going to grant, as I asked the leader, the ability of the minority to offer any substitute and/or offer substantive amendments.
