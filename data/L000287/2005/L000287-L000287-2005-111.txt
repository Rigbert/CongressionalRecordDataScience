Mr. Speaker, I was unable to cast rollcall votes 336 and 344 on June 29, 2005. I had planned to be present for most of these votes and had planned my flightaccording, but because of the Capitol evacuation which postponed votes, I was unable to be present. I was required to be in the district the following morning to participate in the Base Realignment and Closure hearing and there was no other flight available. Had I been present I would have cast the following votes:  On rollcall 336, I would have voted ``yes''; on rollcall 337, I would have voted ``no''; on rollcall 338, I would have voted ``yes''; on rollcall 339, I would have voted ``yes''; on rollcall 340, I would have voted ``yes''; on rollcall 341, I would have voted ``no''; on rollcall 342, I would have voted ``yes''; on rollcall 343, I would have voted ``yes''; on rollcall 344, I would have voted ``yes.''                          ____________________
