President, for many months now I and other Members ofthe Senate have been coming to the floor of this body to talk about the need for prescription drug coverage for our older people under Medicare.  We have been going through case histories of stories we have been hearing from our States. I have been describing the many older people I am hearing from in Oregon where after they are finished paying their prescription drug bill, they only have a couple hundred dollars for the rest of the month to live on.  I talked about instances where older people at home in Oregon are actually breaking their Lipitor pills. Lipitor is an important cholesterol-lowering drug. A lot of the seniors at home in Oregon can't afford to take these vital medicines, and they are actually having to break them in half in order to try to meet their health care needs. It is just outrageous to think that in a country as rich and as powerful and good as ours so many of our seniors walk on this economic tightrope.  I have come to the floor repeatedly over the last few months to talk about the need for bipartisan legislation that would address the needs of older people and secure important Medicare coverage for them.  I believe there is now genuine interest in reconciling the several bills before the Senate on this issue and a real opportunity to enact good legislation that can generate overwhelming support in this body and get the senior citizens of this country the help they need.  I have spoken, for example, with the Democratic leader, Senator Daschle, several times this week on this subject. He is very interested in bringing Senators with varying approaches on this issue together so we find the common ground to get help for older people.  I especially want to praise my colleague from Maine, our friend, Senator Snowe. She and I have worked together for 14 months now--for more than a year starting with the budget resolution last year--to come up with a bipartisan plan to address this enormous need of older people.  Before I describe some of the new cases we are getting from seniors across the country, I will talk about some areas where I think there is common ground, the common ground I have heard Senator Daschle and others talking about in recent days. For example, I think Senators overwhelmingly believe there ought to be a significant role for marketplace forces in the delivery of this benefit. Certainly we differ about the details. We recognize that. I will not have the last word on this subject. I think virtually all Senators believe there ought to be a significant role for marketplace forces on this issue.  Second, I think there is overwhelming support for the proposition that this program ought to be a voluntary program. Senators and others have learned the lesson from the catastrophic care bill when a lot of the older people in this country said: This is something I am already getting; I don't want it required; I think my money can be spent better elsewhere.  This time, I see Senators with varying political philosophies desiring to make sure this benefit is voluntary.  I think Senators overwhelmingly are interested in making sure this prescription drug coverage for older people is consistent with long-term Medicare reform. Many want to have comprehensive Medicare reform in this session of Congress. It may still be doable. I prefer going that route. If it is not possible to have comprehensive Medicare reform, I can tell Members that Senator Snowe and I have teamed up over the last several months in an effort to make sure the prescription drug coverage program is consistent with long-term Medicare reform.  Finally, we want to make sure this benefit is adequately funded. In the last session of Congress, 54 Members of the Senate voted for the Snowe-Wyden amendment with respect to funding. We brought together Senator Wellstone, Senator Abraham, Senator Kennedy, Senator Santorum, Senators of all political philosophies of both political parties. Mr. President, 54 voted for allocating dollars for a prescription drug program. There is an opportunity now to find the common ground.  I want to describe a few of the accounts I have heard from at home that made it clear to me why it is so important that Senators come together and enact this program for the elderly. I heard recently from an elderly woman in Deschutes County in central Oregon. She is 83 years old; she lives at her sister's. She and her 79-year-old husband take 12 drugs to cover diabetes, hypertension, and a variety of ailments. Their sole source of income is Social Security. They spend nearly 25 percent of their income now on prescription drugs.  In Clatsop County, a retired couple in their seventies from Warrenton, OR, is spending $450 a month on prescription drugs. If they have another increase in their supplemental insurance--and we all know the vast majority of seniors have these supplemental policies, and we all know in almost every instance they go up--this older couple has told me they will have to stop taking their medication altogether.  An older woman in Coos County, aged 75, getting by on only $813 a month, is spending well over $200 of that $800 on prescription medicine.  I could go on with these cases. I have done that on more than 20 occasions in the last few months on the floor of the Senate, trying continually to bring before the body 3 or 4 cases that highlight how great the need is and how important it is we address this issue.  I believe the President of the United States wants this issue addressed in a bipartisan way. I have talked with him about this subject. He recognizes how urgent it is that seniors get this coverage. I think he made it clear in the State of the Union Address he wants to work with Members of Congress of both political parties to get this done.  We have accomplished a great deal in the last 14 months. Fourteen months ago when Senator Snowe and I brought this issue to the Budget Committee, I think we were essentially looked at as well-meaning souls but people who just did not have much of a prospect of seeing this go forward. Now we see the issue of prescription drug coverage as one of the two or three most pressing domestic issues. The American people are disgusted.  Our job now--and I commend Senator Daschle, but I know there are a number of colleagues on the other side of the aisle who feel the same way--is to reconcile these various bills. We want to make sure we build on private health insurance.  There has been a lot of talk in the last few days about whether private health insurance companies would be interested in this program. Having talked with them at home in Oregon, they are definitely going to be interested in this program because what we envisage doing, what essentially all the bills envisage doing, is having the Government pick up the prescription drug portion of a senior's private health insurance program. That is what is going to go on here. We will not set up new bureaucracies and redtape. We will be looking at an effort to have this program pick up the prescription drug portion of a senior's private health insurance. We want to use marketplace forces to the greatest possible extent. We want older people to have bargaining power in the marketplace.  Right now, Medicare does not cover prescriptions, but the older person who walks into a pharmacy perhaps in Rhode Island, Oregon, or any other part of the country and does not have prescription drug coverage, in effect, has to subsidize the big buyers of prescription medicine. If, for example, you are a younger worker and have the good fortune of having a company health plan that covers prescription drugs, that company plan can go out and negotiate a discount. The senior, without any coverage, walks into the pharmacy, doesn't get that same rate, and in effect has to actually subsidize those who do have the good fortune of having a health plan where they can have some real bargaining power. That is not right. Vulnerable seniors deserve a fair shake. They deserve to be able to secure their medicine at an affordable price.  I believe the cases I brought to the floor of the Senate tonight again show how urgent the need is for this benefit. I believe there are colleagues on both sides of the aisle who want to reconcile the various bills that have been introduced on this issue. I have teamed up with Senator Snowe on this matter now for 14 months. We don't think we have the last word on this issue. We want to work with colleagues to find the common ground, to get the help toolder people that they deserve. Senator Daschle has told me a number of times recently that is what he wants to do. I believe colleagues on the other side of the aisle wish to do so as well.  The hour is late. I do not want to keep the Senate in any longer than necessary, but I intend to keep coming back to the floor, bringing to the Senate these truly poignant cases of how great the need is in this country to cover prescription drug costs of the Nation's older people.  I look forward to working with the Presiding Officer of the Senate, a new Member of this body, and one from a very special family, in my opinion, because his father was so kind to me as a new Senator. I know he shares many of the same concerns I have, that we address this issue in a bipartisan fashion.  I am going to keep coming back to the floor of the Senate talking about why this is so important and why it is so important for the Senate to bring these various bills together.  With that, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
