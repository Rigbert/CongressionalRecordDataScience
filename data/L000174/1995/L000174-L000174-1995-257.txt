President, I strongly support it if we are ever going to finish this bill in our lifetime. I understand one Senator is not on the floor, and he would be on the floor in about a minute or two.  I would suggest this, that we go off this amendment for about 3 minutes, bring back the Bingaman amendment during that time, and then 3 minutes from now go back to the Senator from North Carolina.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we go off the pending amendment, go back to the Bingaman amendment, and I assure my colleague I will be asking that we go back to the Helms amendment in a matter of 3 or 4 minutes.
