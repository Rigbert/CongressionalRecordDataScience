 President, first, the Senate is currently considering two well-qualified nominees, both for the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. Yesterday afternoon, we voted to advance the nomination of Marvin Quattlebaum, a graduate of Rhodes College and the University of South Carolina. He presently serves as a district judge for the District of South Carolina. At noon the Senate will vote to confirm his nomination.  When he was nominated to the Federal bench last year, Judge Quattlebaum received strong, bipartisan support from the Senate. The American Bar Association deemed him unanimously ``well-qualified,'' their highest possible rating.  Once we complete consideration of Judge Quattlebaum, we will turn to Jay Richardson. Mr. Richardson is a graduate of Vanderbilt University and the University of Chicago Law School. He has held clerkships with Seventh Circuit Judge Richard Posner and with the late Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist.  Since 2009, he has served as assistant U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina. Current and former peers in the U.S. Attorney's Office say he has a ``well-earned reputation for excellent preparation, good judgment, fairness, and hard work.''  In that role, Mr. Richardson led the successful prosecution of the gunman who murdered nine innocent people at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, SC, back in 2015. Our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have received a letter from Jennifer Pinckney, the wife of the late Clementa Pinckney, one of the victims of that senseless violence. Ms. Pinckney wrote to enthusiastically support Mr. Richardson's confirmation. She said that he ``will make a fine jurist.''  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to confirm both of these impressive nominees.                          ____________________
