Speaker, today I rise to honor a great patriot as well as a great friend, Robert ``Bob'' E. Waxman. On March 1st, 2006, Bob retired as the Deputy for Aircraft Division operations for the Avionics Competency of the Navy Air Navigation Electronics Project (NANEP).  Bob has had a long and distinguished career in service to our nation. He graduated from Forest Park High School in 1942, and worked for the Army Air Corps from 1943-1946, where he trained as a Navigator in B-I7's and B-29's. Bob next attended the University of Maryland, where he received his Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering in 1950.  In 1951, Bob began working for the Electrical Test Division's Radio Communication Branch of the NANEP at Patuxent River. Two years later, he was promoted to the Supervisory Electrical Engineer for the organization. In 1958, Bob was promoted to the Technical Director of the NANEP, a leadership position he would hold for almost 48 years. One of Bob's major accomplishments as the Technical Director occurred when he oversaw NANEP's move to Webster Field in 1960. During the 1960s Bob earned his Master's of Science in Electrical Engineering Management from George Washington University. In 1994, Bob successfully led the transition of the Naval Electronic Systems Engineering Activity into NAV AIR, the Naval Air Systems Command.  Bob Waxman has guided Webster Field through an unprecedented period of growth and success. When he began his service, Webster Field had 57 employees and a $320,000 budget. Under Bob's leadership, Webster Field reached a peak of more than 2,800 employees and a budget of more than $368 million. Bob also achieved another milestone: Webster Field was supposed to have been closed on five separate occasions. On each of these occasions, however, Bob succeeded in saving the organization. These acts alone make him a great leader and a hero to many.  Throughout the past 25 years, Bob's achievements have been recognized time and again with myriad awards and honors. In 2002, Bob was honored as the first employee at Patuxent River to receive a 55-year Length of Service Certificate. Bob is the recipient of the Navy Superior Civilian Service Award, the Navy Meritorious Civilian Service Award, the Distinguished Civilian Service Award, and a Congressional Certificate of Appreciation. In 2001, the Air 4.5 Avionics Robert E. Waxman Leadership Award was established in Bob's name. Finally, Bob's expertise and leadership skills were recognized by his peers when Bob was elected President of the Society of Engineers and Scientists.  Mr. Speaker, throughout his dynamic career, Bob Waxman has been a positive influence on many lives. On behalf of the thousands of individuals that Bob has helped over the years, I would like to congratulate and thank Bob Waxman for his extraordinary contributions to not only our community, but to our Nation.                          ____________________
