President, on October 4, 2000, I did not correctly state the American Cancer Society's position on S. 1272, when I stated that they ``. . . strongly opposed . . . the Pain Relief Promotion Act.'' Their actual position, taken directly from their recent statement on the legislation, is as follows:       . . . The American Cancer Society appreciates the      commitment shown by the sponsors of the legislation to      address these issues, but unfortunately is unable to support      this legislation as written . . . Careful analysis of the      House-passed measure and a substitute version of the Senate      bill . . . have serious potential to exacerbate the current      problem of under treatment of pain. While there are      provisions to proactively address pain and symptom      management, the Society maintains that any benefit from such      provisions would not outweigh the potential threat posed by      the changes to CSA. Furthermore, neither section of the bill      comprehensively addresses the needs of providers, patients,      and families for ongoing support and education to counter the      current problem of under-treatment of pain--a problem that      often leads to requests for physician-assisted suicide . . .      Under the Act, all physicians and particularly physicians who      care for those with terminal illnesses will be made      especially vulnerable to having their pain and symptom      management treatment decisions questioned by law enforcement      officials not qualified to judge medical decision-making.      This can result in unnecessary investigation, and further      disincentives to aggressively treat pain.       Unfortunately, `intent' cannot be easily determined,      particularly in the area of medicine where effective dosage      levels for patients may deviate significantly from the norm.      The question of deciding intent should remain in the hands of      those properly trained to make such decisions--the medical      community and state medical boards. The Pain Relief Promotion      Act seeks to hold harmless any physician who treats a      patient's pain even if death occurs, and the measure attempts      to create a `safe harbor' provision in an effort to shield      physicians whose use of federally-controlled drugs      unintentionally hasten or cause death. However, this      provision does not change the fact that the DEA would now      explicitly be charged with overseeing the medical use of      controlled substances, resulting in a negative impact on      cancer pain treatment. . .  The American Cancer Society statement concluded with the following observation:       The American Cancer Society has engaged in a deliberative      process to evaluate the impact of the Pain Relief Promotion      Act on our Quality of Life goals for all people living with      cancer. Its analysis included a review of existing Society      policies on pain and symptom management and opposition to      physician assisted suicide. We have concluded that as      written, the Pain Relief Promotion Act would ban the use of      federally controlled substances for physician-assisted      suicide at the expense of controlling pain and advancing      symptom management. These issues are both critically      important, but are separate issues. While the Society      strongly opposes all patient deaths stemming from assisted      suicides, we must give heavier weight to the more than 1500      individuals who die of cancer every day in this country--more      than half of whom die in pain unnecessarily. Moreover, the      American Cancer Society believes that the best approach to      help cancer patients and reduce and prevent assisted suicide      is through the adoption of proactive policies and the      provision of resources to prevent and ameliorate pain and      suffering in people with cancer, especially for those at the      end-of-life.  I appreciate this opportunity to clarify the position of the American Cancer Society on S. 1272.                          ____________________
