President, I rise to ask my colleagues to take a close look at a bill which I cosponsored with Senator Murkowski and others. The ski area fee system for Forest Service special use permits needs reform and S. 907 is a good way to get this done.  Skiing is one of the best uses that we have today on our national forests. The ski industry brings millions of people to the mountains to enjoy fresh air, scenery, and the mountain environment. Few other national forest activities are able to host such intense public use with relatively minimal impact.  In fact, many resorts have taken extra steps to protect and enhance the environmental resources with trail and resort designs that include modifications for wildlife use, special sensitivities to wetlands, base villages that minimize the need for cars, and plantings that provide forage for birds. Over the years ski resorts have become adept at reducing water pollution, erosion, and snowmaking. There are still [[Page S8522]] problems to resolve, but I am confident that citizens, communities, and the ski industry will find solutions to each challenge.  In addition to providing access to National Forests on a mass scale, the ski industry provides critical economic benefits. From the first American rope tow installed in Woodstock, VT, in 1934, to the high-speed quads on Sugarbush 60 years later, the ski industry has brought economic opportunity to Vermont towns. The 1993-1994 ski season in Vermont generated $230 million from 4.3 million visitor days according to the Vermont Ski Area Association. These revenues translate into $17 million in tax revenue for Vermont towns. The ski industry represents a sustainable use of national forests and a good neighbor. They deserve our support.  The Murkowski-Leahy bill refines the fee structure for ski areas on national forests. The Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952 and the National Forest Ski Area Permit Act of 1986 both mandate that the Federal Government collect fair market value for the use of Federal property. In 1965, the Forest Service developed the graduated rate-fee system [GRFS] which is still in use today. GRFS is based on the ski area's investment in fixed assets and sales generated in nine business categories. The ski industry and the Forest Service together agree that the system is complex, outdated, inefficient, and in need of reform.  I wish we could say that the reform we propose is based on a comprehensive assessment of fair market value as current law, but such an assessment simply does not exist. Neither the General Accounting Office nor the Forest Service--or any other organization--has been able to offer assistance in developing a widely accepted assessment of fair market value. The revenue collected today is the closest approximation of fair market value, and therefore we have used the total revenue collected as the best available assessment. This bill solves the problems that we know how to solve, and does not preclude adjustments for issues that may benefit from further study.  The solution proposed in the Murkowski-Leahy bill is a simple progressive rate structure based on gross sales. Since it operates much like an annual tax form, it is easy to prepare, relatively easy to audit, and less prone to litigation. The fees are linked to the economy so ski areas can make regular and fair payments that reflect their ability to pay. The bill also has a provision to adjust the rate structure for inflation and it would be easy to amend if the public wants to adjust the ski-fee revenues up or down based on further information on fair market value.  This bill is a reasonable, balanced, and progressive bill that offers clear reform for the ski area fee system. This is basically the same bill that the Senate passed in 1992 with strong bipartisan support. I hope we can pass the S. 907 this year with equally strong support.                          ____________________
