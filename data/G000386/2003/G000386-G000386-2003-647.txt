 President, I have a great deal of respect for Senator McCain. He is very consistent. I want to only argue with one point. This is a national facility. It was located decades ago in my State for reasons that I believe are closely related to Iowa State University being a very good land grant and research institution.  Second, the issue of whether this is legitimate at this point is best justified by the fact that this renovation has already been reauthorized, and this is just one more step by the Congress in carrying out a decision that Congress previously made that this facility that is now decades old should be renovated for the good of the safety of food in the United States.
