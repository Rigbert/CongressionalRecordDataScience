Speaker, reclaiming my time, as the gentleman and I both know, no appropriations bills have been enacted. As I pointed out, forgetting about who is to blame--and I am sure you and I have different perspectives on that--the fact of the matter is they haven't passed, and they haven't been signed by the President. When I say ``passed,'' that's the Congress. They haven't passed the Congress, and the President hasn't signed any. So there is no possibility we are going to pass one or more of those bills.  As you know, there are 12 appropriations bills to fund government. We haven't passed one of them. It doesn't look like we are going to pass any of them, so we are going to need a CR. So my question relates to the CR. There are three points.  I thank the gentleman for clarifying it.  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for clarifying.  Just one more little clarification, if the gentleman may. All 12 of the appropriations bills have passed out of committee. So it is our desire to finish that work.  Yes, it looks as though we will be into a continuing resolution. We have funding up until September 30. It is our intent to have that done before we depart. We will not depart without finishing that work.  The duration is up for discussion, and we have been having discussions on both sides of the aisle about that. But as soon as that decision is made, Members will be advised when the floor action is scheduled. But I assure the gentleman it will be done before any Member is departing.
