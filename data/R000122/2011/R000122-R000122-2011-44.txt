President, I am pleased to be joined today by Senator Hutchison in the introduction of the Pediatric, Adolescent, and Young Adult Cancer Survivorship Research and Quality of Life Act of 2011.  The population of survivors of childhood cancer has grown exponentially over the years. In 1960, only 4 percent of children with cancer survived more than 5 years. Today, nearly 80 percent of children with cancer survive more than five years. While this is heartening news, as a result of their cancer and treatment, many of these children unfortunately have health complications, often life-threatening, for years to come. Indeed, after beating cancer, as many as \2/3\ of these children suffer from late effects of their disease or treatment, including second cancers and heart and lung damage. There are also serious psychosocial impacts that these survivors face.  With so many facing the risk of these late effects, it is critical that resources are made available to help these survivors, especially those in underserved communities. Our legislation would enhance research on the late effects of childhood cancers and improve collaboration among providers so that doctors are better able to care for this population as they age. It would also establish a new pilot program to begin to explore models of care for childhood cancer survivors. Creating standard protocols and procedures will help providers, patients, and families know what to expect after beating cancer, including when to get certain check-ups and tests that guard against late effects.  This bill is part of a continuing effort to focus greater attention on childhood cancers. In 2008, I worked on a bipartisan basis to enact, the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act. This law has increased support for research on childhood cancers and improved treatment for patients. But we must not stop there.  The legislation Senator Hutchison and I are introducing today to address the late effects of childhood cancer, will do more to help childhood cancer patients. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation and help ensure that children who survive cancer live a long and healthy life.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1613       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Pediatric, Adolescent, and      Young Adult Cancer Survivorship Research and Quality of Life      Act of 2011''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds as follows:       (1) An estimated 12,400 children and adolescents under age      20 are diagnosed with cancer each year.       (2) In 1960, only 4 percent of children with cancer      survived more than 5 years, but by 2011, cure rates have      increased to 78 percent for children and adolescents under      age 20.       (3) The population of survivors of childhood cancers has      grown dramatically, to more than 300,000 individuals of all      ages as of 2007.       (4) As many as \2/3\ of childhood cancer survivors are      likely to experience at least one late effect of treatment,      with as many as \1/4\ experiencing a late effect that is      serious or life-threatening. The most common late effects of      childhood cancer are neurocognitive, psychological,      cardiopulmonary, endocrine, and musculoskeletal effects and      secondary malignancies.       (5) The late effects of cancer treatment may change as      treatments evolve, which means that the monitoring and      treatment of cancer survivors may need to be modified on a      routine basis.       (6) The Institute of Medicine, in its reports on cancer      survivorship entitled ``Childhood Cancer Survivorship:      Improving Care and Quality of Life'', states that an      organized system of care and a method of care for pediatric      cancer survivors is needed.
