 Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1423, the Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center Lease Act, as amended. I am proud to sponsor this legislation, and I thank Mr. Donnelly for joining me as a cosponsor.  I also do want to thank Chairman Rahall and Ranking Member Don Young, the chairman of the subcommittee, as well as the ranking member, and especially the exceptional staff of the subcommittee and the full committee of Natural Resources for their consideration and good work on this measure.  This measure will grant the Secretary of the Interior the authority to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a joint partnership with Porter County. This partnership will allow the National Park Service and the Porter County Convention, Recreation and Visitor Commission to develop a plan to maximize the efficiency of the Visitor Center at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and enhance the visitor experience. The measure also will provide funding to develop exhibits for the center.  Additionally, the bill will help us enhance the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore in the most affordable fashion possible. It will permit, but not require, the Secretary of the Interior to accept donations of lands located outside the present boundaries of the Lakeshore if they are contiguous with the park or separated by only a right-of-way. At present, the Secretary of the Interior cannot accept such donations. This provision makes a minor technical correction that has no financial impact, and will allow this natural treasure to expand by the generosity of those wishing to enhance the Lakeshore. It is my sincere hope that this legislation will continue our efforts to protect and enhance the Lakeshore, and to ensure that all Americans can benefit from the park.  The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore is an incredible natural treasure, as was mentioned, comprised of about 15,000 pristine acres along the southern shore of Lake Michigan in the midst of an urban environment. With its vast array of flora and fauna in northwest Indiana, a short distance from downtown Chicago, the Lakeshore receives over 3 million visitors from that urban area each year.  The Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore owes a great deal of gratitude to Dorothy Buell, who was instrumental in its establishment and development. Buell devoted much of her life to saving the dunes. In 1952, she founded the Save the Dunes Council to obtain dunes land and to give it to the National State Park so that the unique habitat could be preserved and enjoyed by the general public.  In 1992, Buell's extraordinary contributions to the dunes were recognized when the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore Access and Enhancement Act was signed into law, thereby naming the park's visitor center for her and commemorating her vision, dedication and work.                              {time}  1500  The Dorothy Buell Memorial Visitor Center is an excellent facility for providing environmental education programs and recreational activities. Visitors can enjoy displays and exhibits.  I am very proud of the continued investment in the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore by the National Park Service staff, our local communities, and Lakeshore volunteers in Indiana's First Congressional District. They seek to preserve, protect, and restore the Lakeshore and surrounding resources for an enhanced quality of life.  Mr. Speaker, I want to again thank the members and the leaders of the committee and subcommittee as well as the staff, and I ask my colleagues to support the measure.
