President, today I am introducing a bill which offers a legislative solution for a number of Federal employees who have been the unwitting victims of paperwork errors. Over 10 years ago, Congress passed a Public Law 98-369, which eliminated the Social Security exclusion for Federal employees with prior military service. This law was made retroactive to January of that year, and it was up to each Federal agency to find the individual workers who were affected by this law and change them from the old Civil Service Retirement System [CSRS] into the Federal Employee Retirement System [FERS].  Unfortunately, a small but important group of workers have remained in the CSRS retirement system, because of agency error. Over time, these agencies have belatedly discovered employees who are improperly enrolled in CSRS and are forcing them back to FERS. This has been disruptive and unfair to the affected employees, since they are losing many years of contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan, which my colleagues know is critical to any FERS retirement. In many cases, the agencies reluctantly made this switch, but they had no authority to give a waiver to these public servants.  Today I am offering a bill which will allow Federal employees who were inadvertently enrolled in the wrong retirement system to remain in CSRS. It is nearly impossible to make an employee whole after many years of contributing to the wrong retirement system, despite agency efforts to do so. The number of employees affected by my legislation may be small, perhaps as few as several dozen, but we need to correct this oversight so that these workers may enjoy a full retirement.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1287         Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives      of the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. ELECTION OF FEDERAL RETIREMENT COVERAGE BY                    EMPLOYEES ERRONEOUSLY COVERED BY THE CIVIL                    SERVICE RETIREMENT SYSTEM.
