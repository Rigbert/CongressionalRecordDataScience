While he took a different position than mine on this, Icommend him for his efforts and his work on this. While the chairman and I disagree on the need for this amendment, I think we both agree that if somebody is to give their first speech in the Senate, there are few issues that will be of such significance as this.  Anytime one amends the Constitution, something that has been amended only 17 times since the Bill of Rights, that is a significant effort. As I said yesterday, for 200-some-odd years, we have resisted the temptation to amend our Constitution, which is one of the reasons why we are such a powerful democracy and one of the reasons why our Constitution has stood the test of time.  I also note, I think on both sides of the aisle there is strong support to balance the budget, but what I want to remind everybody, as the President said in his State of the Union Address, is all it takes is our vote and his signature to balance the budget without a constitutional amendment. In the last 4 years, the deficit has come down. For the first time since I have been able to vote, the President 4 years in a row brought the deficit down and is now on the fifth time. He deserves a great deal of credit for that.
