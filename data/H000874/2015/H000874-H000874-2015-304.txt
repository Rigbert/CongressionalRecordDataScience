Speaker, I rise to mark an important milestone in the history of my home state of Maryland. On April 15, 2015, the faculty, staff, students, and alumni of Bowie State University will celebrate the school's 150th anniversary at its annual Founders Day.  In the final months of the Civil War, the Baltimore Normal School began serving emancipated African-Americans by offering training for teachers. In 1910, it outgrew its facilities and moved to a 187-acre lot in Bowie, Maryland, and in 1914 it became the Maryland Normal and Industrial School at Bowie. Over the course of the twentieth century, the institution evolved into a four-year degree-granting college and eventually became a liberal arts college whose mission extended well beyond training educators. Renamed Bowie State College in 1963, it provided access to higher education for African American students, many of whom were barred from other institutions as a result of segregation.  In 1988, in recognition of the school's important role in higher education for Marylanders and its expansion into graduate studies, it was elevated to University status and welcomed into the University System of Maryland. Since then, Bowie State University has been one of Maryland's top institutions of higher education and has continued to rank as one of our nation's leading historically black colleges and universities, preparing not only some of the brightest young minds in Maryland but also training a new generation of leaders for our nation's African American community.  Mr. Speaker, I have been proud to represent Bowie State University in Congress and to help secure federal grants that help the school expand its cutting-edge programs, including in the high-demand areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics--or ``STEM'' education. In recent years, Bowie State University has become a national leader in what many are calling ``STEAM'' education, which brings traditional ``STEM'' fields together with art and design in order to prepare students for careers in digital technologies. At the same time, Bowie State University has become a national center for training in cybersecurity, drawing on its proximity to Ft. Meade and defense institutions in the Greater Washington area. It continues to build on a groundbreaking $27 million award from NASA and the National Science Foundation in 1995 that recognized Bowie State University as a national Model Institution for Excellence in STEM education.  Last year, I joined President Obama in Prince George's County, Maryland, to highlight a $7 million Youth Career Connect grant that was made possible through an innovative partnership between the County's public schools, Lockheed Martin, and Bowie State University's Maryland Center to grow the pipeline of students pursuing college degrees and STEM-related careers. The University is playing a major role in growing Maryland's high-skill workforce for the twenty-first century, and I am excited for what the future holds.  I hope my colleagues will join me in celebrating Bowie State University's proud history as it marks its sesquicentennial. I look forward to continuing to work closely with President Mickey Burnim and the Administration to ensure that Bowie State University can continue to carry out its mission of providing high-quality higher education and research that supports learning and careers in Maryland and across the United States.                          ____________________
