 President, I thank the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, the chairman of the subcommittee. I will very shortly propose an amendment which will stand next to Senator Collins's amendment.  The purpose of my amendment is simple. It provides that the Secretary of Homeland Security will ensure that Homeland Security grants are allocated based on the assessment of threat, vulnerability, and consequence to the maximum extent practicable.  This amendment dovetails S. 1013 which Senator Cornyn and I submitted earlier. Cosponsors are Senators Lautenberg, Boxer, Hutchison, Kerry, Martinez, Schumer, Nelson of Florida, Clinton, Corzine, Kennedy, and Dodd.                Amendment No. 1215 to Amendment No. 1142(Purpose: To improve the allocation of grants through the Department of                Homeland Security, and for other purposes)  I send this amendment to the desk and ask it be set aside until 10 a.m. tomorrow morning.
