 President, I rise today to express my appreciation to my colleagues for passing for the second time this session, the Violence Against Women Act of 2005. Once again the Senate has spoken loudly and clearly that domestic violence and sexual assault are serious, public crimes that must be addressed. Today's bill is a tremendous compromise measure that merges the comprehensive, Senate-passed Violence Against Women Act, S. 119, with the House of Representative's Department of Justice Appropriations Authorization Act bill, H.R. 3402. This merger followed hours of bipartisan, bicameral negotiations. Compromises and edits were made, and what emerges is a balanced bill that strikes the right balance between rejuvenating core programs, making targeted improvements, and responsibly expanding the Violence Against Women Act to reach the needs of America's families.  The enactment of the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 was the beginning of a historic commitment to women and children victimized by domestic violence and sexual assault. While not the single cause, this commitment has made our streets and homes safer. Since the Act's passage in 1994, domestic violence has dropped by almost 50 percent incidents of rape are down by 60 percent and the number of women killed by an abusive husband or boyfriend is down by 22 percent. Today, more than half of all rape victims are stepping forward to report the crime. And since we passed the Act in 1994, over a million women have found justice in our courtrooms and obtained domestic violence protection orders.  This is a dramatic change from a decade ago. Back then, violence in the household was treated as a ``family matter'' rather than a criminal justice issue. Because we took action, the criminal justice system is much better equipped to handle domestic violence, and it is treated for what it is--criminal. The goal of the legislation passed here today is to usher the Violence Against Women Act into the 21st century. With this bill we attempt to look beyond the immediate crisis and take steps to not only punish offenders, but to also help victims get their lives back on track, and prevent domestic violence and sexual assault from occurring in the first place.  The bill contains much to commend. To that end, I will ask unanimous consent to include at the close of my statement a thorough section-by-section summary of H.R. 3402, but in the meantime, I would like to highlight some of the bill's provisions.  Title I, the bill's backbone, focuses on the criminal justice system and includes provisions to: (1) renew and increase funding to over $400 million a year for existing, fundamental grant programs for law enforcement, lawyers, judges and advocates; (2) stiffen existing criminal penalties for repeat federal domestic violence offenders; and (3) appropriately update the criminal law on stalking to incorporate new surveillance technology like Global Positioning System, GPS.  Notably, our bill reauthorizes the Court Appointed Special Advocates, ``CASA,'' a nationwide volunteer program to help children in the judicial system. Children are doubly impacted by family violence--both as observers of, and recipients of abuse. Court Appointed Special Advocates fit uniquely into the mix of services for victims of violence. Judges overwhelmingly report that children and families are better served by the involvement of a CASA volunteer on their cases. I hope that my colleagues see fit to fully appropriate this effective program, and in the future, raise the program's authorization level.  The Violence Against Women Act has always included measures to help law enforcement and victim service providers reach underserved communities. Today's bill goes even further by creating a new, targeted culturally and linguistically specific service grant program. This provision is intended to ensure that the Act's resources reach racial and ethnic communities grappling with family violence and its enormous ramifications.  The Violence Against Women Act crafts a coordinated community response that seeks the participation of police, judges, prosecutors, and the host of entities who care for the victims. Title II helps victim service providers by: (1) creating a new, dedicated grant program for sexual assault victims that will strengthen rape crisis centers across the country; (2) reinvigorating programs to help older and disabled victims of domestic violence; (3) strengthening and expanding existing programs for rural victims and victims in underserved areas; and (4) removing a current cap on funding for the National Domestic Violence Hotline.  Sexual violence is a crime that affects children and adults across our country. Unfortunately, rape has been a crime shrouded in secrecy and shame. Sexual assault survivors can experience physical and emotional problems for years. Approximately 1,315 rape crisis centers across the country help victims of rape, sexual assault, sexual abuse, and incest rebuild their lives by providing a range of vital services to survivors. But unfortunately, many rape crisis centers are under funded and understaffed. They are constantly in a crisis mode, responding to the needs of all victims--male, female as well as children--and are incapable of undertaking large-scale prevention efforts in their communities.  In response to this overwhelming need, our bill will provide increased resources to serve sexual assault victims. It includes, for the first time, a dedicated Federal funding stream for sexual assault programs through the proposed Sexual Assault Services Program, SASA. SASA will fund direct services to victims, including general intervention and advocacy, accompaniment through the medical and criminal justice processes, support services, and related assistance.  Reports indicate that up to ten million children experience domestic violence in their homes each year. The age at which a female is at greatest risk for rape or sexual assault is 14. Two-thirds of all sexual assault victims reported to law enforcement are under 18, and national research suggests that 1 in 5 high-school girls is physically or sexually abused by a dating partner. Treating children who witness domestic violence, dealing effectively with violent teenage relationships and teaching prevention strategies to children are keys to ending the cycle of violence. This reauthorization takes bold steps to address the needs of youngpeople by renewing successful programs and creating new programs to: (1) promote collaboration between domestic violence experts and child welfare agencies; and (2) enhance to $15 million a year grants to reduce violence against women on college campuses.  Critical prevention initiatives are contained in title IV, including programs supporting home visitations for families at risk, and initiatives that specifically engage men and boys in efforts to end domestic and sexual violence. We can no longer be satisfied with punishing abusers after the fact and trying to help a woman pull her life back together--we must end the violence before it ever starts. We must end it, not just mend it.  Violence against women is a health care issue of enormous proportions with one in three women expected to experience such violence at some point in their lives. It also has enormous health consequences for women and children, leading to serious injuries and disease, including substance abuse, chronic, serious pain and sexually transmitted infections including HIV/AIDS. We know pregnant women are particularly at risk for violence with increased levels of abuse accounting for injuries to the mother and developing fetus. In fact, homicide is a leading cause of death for pregnant and recently pregnant women.  Consequently, doctors and nurses, like police officers on the beat, are often the first witnesses of the devastating aftermath of abuse. Unfortunately, most health care providers are not currently trained on how to screen for, identify, document and treat or refer for violence-related illnesses or injuries. That's why the new health care programs in the Act are so essential--they provide an opportunity to intervene much earlier in the cycle of violence, before it becomes life threatening, and they provide a chance to reach out to children who may be growing up in violent homes.  In some instances, women face the untenable choice of returning to their abuser or becoming homeless. Indeed, 44 percent of the nation's mayors identified domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness. Efforts to ease the housing problems for battered women are contained in Title VI, including (1) $20 million grant programs to facilitate collaboration between domestic violence organizations and housing providers; (2) programs to combat family violence in public and assisted housing, including new requirements that domestic violence victims may not be evicted or cut off from voucher services because of the violence; and (3) enhancements to transitional housing resources.  In some instances, victims of domestic violence who apply for or reside in public and subsidized housing are evicted or turned away because of the violence against them. A scream for help, a shot being fired, or the sound of police sirens is cited as a ``disruptive sound'' justifying eviction. In a recent nationwide survey, local housing and domestic violence attorneys across the country reported over 500 documented cases where victims were evicted because of the domestic violence committed against them.  Sections 606 and 607 of the Act provide important protections in public housing and the Section 8 program for victims of domestic violence and stalking. These sections prohibit denial of housing assistance based on the individual's status as a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking. With certain exceptions, they also prohibit terminating a victim's tenancy or rental assistance because of the violence against him or her. When women know they may lose their homes if their housing provider learns about the violence, they will seek to keep the abuse secret at all costs and thus, will often be unable to take the steps necessary to keep themselves and their families safe.  While protecting victims against retaliation, Sections 606 and 607 permit public housing authorities and private landlords to evict or end voucher assistance to perpetrators of domestic violence. It also ensures that landlords and housing providers can effectively manage their properties and maintain important discretionary authority. The Act allows landlords to bifurcate a lease to remove a perpetrator while maintaining a victim's tenancy and evict victims who commit other lease violations or if the tenancy creates an actual and imminent threat to the public safety. Further, the Act clarifies that landlords should not be held liable simply for complying with the statute. Sections 606 and 607 benefited greatly from the input by the national associations representing landlords and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, including the National Association of Realtors, the National Multi-Housing Council, and the National Leased Housing Association.  It may be useful if the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development issues guidance or regulations to assist with the implementation of these sections. Certain nonprofit organizations and other government agencies that have expertise in domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking, or in housing law and policy, could provide valuable guidance to HUD in creating such guidance and regulations.  Title VII helps abused women maintain economic security by establishing a national resource center to provide information to employers and labor organizations so that they may effectively help their employees who are victims of domestic violence. I had hoped that provisions from Senator Murray's Security and Financial Empowerment Act, SAFE, would have remained in the bill. This amendment would provide some fundamental economic protections for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. Just as the Family Medical Leave Act protects individuals caring for a sick loved one, the SAFE Act would allow domestic violence victims to take time off from work to appear in court cases and other judicial proceedings without jeopardizing their employment at a time they need it the most. It is my hope that the Senate will revisit this issue soon.  Immigrant women often face a difficult time escaping abuse because of immigration laws, language barriers, and social isolation. Title VIII of today's bill builds on the progress of VAWA 1994 and VAWA 2000 to remove obstacles hinder or prevent immigrants from fleeing domestic abuse and participating in prosecutions. Further, the bill expands VAWA relief to: (1) elder abuse victims who have been abused by adult U.S. citizen sons or daughters; and (2) victims of child abuse or incest who are less than 25 and would have qualified as child self-petitioners. It will allow adopted children who have been abused by an adoptive parent to obtain permanent residency without having to reside with the abusive parent for 2 years. In an important move to help battered immigrant women achieve desperately-needed economic stability, the bill permits employment authorization to battered women and abused spouses of certain nonimmigrants.  Title VIII enhances immigration protection for victims of trafficking by removing barriers that block some victims from accessing to T and U visas. Title VIII also facilitates the reunion of trafficking victims with their family members abroad who are in danger of retaliation from international traffickers, and will increase access to permanent residency for victims of severe forms of trafficking who are cooperating in trafficking prosecutions. Finally, title VIII will arm foreign fiancees with background information about their U.S. citizen fiance, and will educate foreign fiancees about U.S. domestic violence laws and resources.  In an effort to focus more closely on violence against Indian women, title IX creates a new tribal Deputy Director in the Office on Violence Against Women dedicated to coordinating Federal policy and tribal grants. It also authorizes the Office to pool funds available to tribes and tribal organizations in various VAWA programs. In addition, Title IX authorizes tribal governments to access and upload domestic violence and protection order data on criminal databases, as well as create tribal sex offender registries, and strengthens available criminal penalties.  No doubt, today's bill is comprehensive; it speaks to the many complexities presented by domestic violence and sexual assault. I am indebted to a whole host of groups who worked on this measure and/or voiced their support throughout the journey from introduction to passage, including the American Bar Association, the National Association of Attorneys General, the International Association of Forensic Nurses, the American Medical Association, the National Sheriffs Association, the National CoalitionAgainst Domestic Violence, the National Congress of American Indians, the National Network to End Domestic Violence, the Family Violence Prevention Fund, Legal Momentum, the National Alliance to End Sexual Violence, the National Center for Victims for Crime, the National District Attorneys Association, the National Council on Family and Juvenile Court Judges, the National Association of Chiefs of Police, and many others. I am grateful for the work each of you does each day to make our families safer and healthier.  The legislation being passed today also demonstrates Congress's commitment to the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, COPS. This program has been widely credited for helping to reduce crime rates over the past 10 years. It was deemed a ``miraculous success'' by Attorney General Ashcroft, and law enforcement experts from top to bottom, including Attorney General Gonzalez, police chiefs, and sheriffs, have all testified to its effectiveness at combating crime. While many politicians have argued this point, the Government Accountability Office conclusively established a statistical link between COPS hiring grants and crime reductions. We know that the COPS program works, and the legislation we are passing today recognizes this fact by re-authorizing the COPS program for the next 5 years at $1.05 billion per year.  In addition, this legislation also updates the COPS program grant making authority by providing more flexibility for local agencies in applying for assistance. It still includes many of the hallmarks that attributed to its success, such as reducing redtape by allowing local agencies to apply directly to the Federal Government for assistance, and providing grants on a three-year basis to facilitate long-term planning. The major improvement is that agencies will now be able to submit one application for its various funding needs, including hiring officers, purchase equipment, pay officers' overtime, and other programs that will increase the number of officers deployed in community oriented policing services. Originally, agencies had to make separate grant applications for the various purpose areas of the program. In addition, it allows the COPS program to award grants for officers hired to perform intelligence, anti-terror, or homeland security duties. Providing local agencies with this type of flexibility is a step forward.  While re-authorizing the COPS program is important, the next step is for the appropriators to fund the program at authorized levels. Back in the nineties, we invested roughly $2.1 billion for state and local law enforcement each year. We are safer today because of these investments. Over the past 5 years, we have adopted a wrong-headed approach of cutting funding for our state and local law enforcement partners. And, the recently passed Commerce, Justice, Science budget allocated less than $800 million for state and local law enforcement assistance, and it zeroed out the COPS hiring program. I agree with the International Association of Chiefs of Police and the National Sheriffs Association that these cuts leave us more vulnerable to crime and terrorism. In this bill, the Congress demonstrated its support for the COPS program, but the real test will come when we make funding decisions in the future. For the safety and security of the American people, I will be fighting for the Congress to fully fund the COPS program at the newly authorized levels of $1.05 billion per year.  I have many partners here in the Senate and in the House of Representatives who have worked tirelessly on this bill. Chairman Sensenbrenner and Ranking Member Conyers were committed to reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, and spent countless hours working on a resolution. Our negotiations were model ones--I wish bicameral relations were always so easy.  Senator Reed and Senator Allard were very helpful on the act's housing provisions, and Senator Enzi helped craft some of the victim service providers. I appreciate their assistance and help to move this bill forward. With respect to the Native American provisions, Senator McCain and Senator Dorgan provided instrumental guidance.  Since 1990, Senator Hatch and I have worked together to end family violence in this country, so it is no great surprise that once again he worked side-by-side with us to craft today's bill. I am also deeply indebted to Senator Kennedy for his unwavering commitment to battered immigrant women and his work on the bill's immigration provisions. Senator Kennedy's staff, particularly Janice Kaguyutan, have been invaluable to this process. I also thank Senator Leahy who has long-supported the Violence Against Women Act and, in particular, has worked on the rural programs and transitional housing provisions. As Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy has consistently pushed forward reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, and his staff, chief counsel Bruce Cohen, Tara Magner, and Jessica Berry have worked hard for passage. My final appreciation is for my very good friend from Pennsylvania for his commitment and leadership on this bill. It is a pleasure to work with Chairman Specter, and his staff Brett Tolman, Lisa Owings, Joe Jacquot, Juria Jones and chief counsel Mike O'Neill. From day one, Chairman Specter has been one of this bill's biggest champion. Chairman Specter is the reason a bipartisan, bicameral compromise measure is being passed today and I thank him.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the section-by-section analysis be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Section-by-Section Summary of the Violence Against Women Act of 2005       Sec. 1. Short Title.       Sec. 2. Table of Contents.       Sec. 3. Universal Definitions and Grant Conditions. This      section aggregates existing and new definitions of terms      applicable to the Act. (Previously, relevant definitions were      scattered in various Code provisions.) The section also sets      forth universal conditions that apply to the Act's new and      existing grant program.Title I Enhancing Judicial and Law Enforcement Tools to Combat Violence                              Against Women       Sec. 101. STOP (Services and Training for Officers and      Prosecutors) Grants Improvements. This section reauthorizes      the cornerstone of the Act, the STOP program, at $225,000,000      annually for 2007 through 2011 (it is currently authorized at      $185 million annually). This program provides state formula      grants that bring police and prosecutors in close      collaboration with victim services providers. Technical      amendments increase the focus on appropriate services for      underserved communities and ensure victim confidentiality.       Sec. 102. Grants to Encourage Arrest and Enforcement of      Protection Order Improvements. This fundamental Department of      Justice program is reauthorized at $75,000,000 annually for      2007 through 2011 (it is currently authorized at $65 million      annually). States and localities use this funding to develop      and strengthen programs and policies that encourage police      officers to arrest abusers who commit acts of violence or      violate protection orders. Amendments will provide technical      assistance to improve tracking of cases in a manner that      preserves confidentiality and privacy protections for      victims. Purposes are amended to encourage victim service      programs to collaborate with law enforcement to assist pro-     arrest and protection order enforcement policies. In      addition, this section authorizes family justice centers and      extends pro-arrest policies to sexual assault cases.       Sec. 103. Legal Assistance for Victims Improvement. This      section reauthorizes the grant program for legal services for      protection orders and related family, criminal, immigration,      administrative agency, and housing matters. It allows victims      of domestic violence, dating violence, stalking, and sexual      assault to obtain access to trained attorneys and lay      advocacy services, particularly pro bono legal services, when      they require legal assistance as a consequence of violence.      This program has been expanded to provide services to both      adult and youth victims. Previously authorized at $40,000,000      annually, funding is set at $65,000,000 annually for 2007      through 2011, to be administered by the Attorney General.      This provision also includes an amendment to ensure that all      legal services organizations can assist any victim of      domestic violence, sexual assault and trafficking without      regard to the victim's immigration status. The organizations      can use any source of funding they receive to provide legal      assistance that is directly related to overcoming the      victimization, and preventing or obtaining relief for the      crime perpetrated against them that is often critical to      promoting victim safety.       Sec. 104. Ensuring Crime Victim Access to Legal Services.      This section eases access to legal services for immigrant      victims of violent crimes.       Sec. 105. The Violence Against Women Act Court Training and      Improvements. This section creates a new program to educate      the     courts and court-related personnel in the areas of domestic      violence, dating violence, sexual abuse and stalking. The      goal of this education will be to improve internal civil and      criminal court functions, responses, practices and      procedures, including the development of dedicated domestic      violence dockets. This section will also authorize one or      more grants to create general educational curricula for state      and tribal judiciaries to ensure that all states have access      to consistent and appropriate information. This section is      authorized at $5,000,000 for each fiscal year 2007 through      2011 and it is administered by the Department of Justice.       Sec. 106. Full Faith and Credit Improvements. Technical      amendments are made to the criminal code to clarify that      courts should enforce the protection orders issued by civil      and criminal courts in other jurisdictions. Orders to be      enforced include those issued to both adult and youth      victims, including the custody and child support provisions      of protection orders. Amendment also requires protection      order registries to safeguard the confidentiality and privacy      of victims.       Sec. 107. Privacy Protections For Victims of Domestic      Violence, Sexual Violence, Stalking, and Dating Violence.      This section creates new and badly-needed protections for      victim information collected by federal agencies and included      in national databases by prohibiting grantees from disclosing      such information. It creates grant programs and specialized      funding for federal programs to develop ``best practices''      for ensuring victim confidentiality and safety when law      enforcement information (such as protection order issuance)      is included in federal and state databases. It also provides      technical assistance to aid states and other entities in      reviewing their laws to ensure that privacy protections and      technology issues are covered, such as electronic stalking,      and training for law enforcement on high tech electronic      crimes against women. It authorizes $5,000,000 per year for      2007 through 2011 to be administered by the Department of      Justice.       Sec. 108. Sex Offender Training. Under this section, the      Attorney General will consult with victim advocates and      experts in the area of sex offender training. The Attorney      General will develop criteria and training programs to assist      probation officers, parole officers, and others who work with      released sex offenders. This section reauthorizes the program      at $3,000,000 annually for 2007 through 2011.       Sec. 109. National Stalker Database and Domestic Violence      Reduction. Under this section, the Attorney General may issue      grants to states and units of local governments to improve      data entry into local, state, and national crime information      databases for cases of stalking and domestic violence. This      section reauthorizes the program at $3,000,000 annually for      2007 through 2011.       Sec. 110. Federal Victim Assistants. This section      authorizes funding for U.S. Attorney offices to hire      counselors to assist victims and witnesses in prosecution of      domestic violence and sexual assault cases. This section is      reauthorized for $1,000,000 annually for 2007 through 2011.       Sec. 111. Grants for Law Enforcement Training Programs.      This section would authorize a Department of Justice grant      program to help train State and local law enforcement to      identify and protect trafficking victims, to investigate and      prosecute trafficking cases and to develop State and local      laws to prohibit acts of trafficking. It proposes $10,000,000      in grants annually from 2006 to 2010.       Sec. 112. Reauthorization of the Court-Appointed Special      Advocate Program. This section reauthorizes the widely-used      Court-Appointed Special Advocate Program (CASA). CASA is a      nationwide volunteer program that helps represent children      who are in the family and/or juvenile justice system due to      neglect or abuse. This provision also allows the program to      request the FBI conduct background checks of prospective      volunteers. This program is reauthorized at $12,000,000      annually for 2007 through 2011.       Sec. 113. Preventing Cyberstalking. To strengthen stalking      prosecution tools, this section amends the Communications Act      of 1934 (47 U.S.C. 223(h)(1)) to expand the definition of a      telecommunications device to include any device or software      that uses the Internet and possible Internet technologies      such as voice over internet services. This amendment will      allow federal prosecutors more discretion in charging      stalking cases that occur entirely over the internet.       Sec. 114. Updating the Federal Stalking Law. Section 114      improves the existing federal stalking law by borrowing state      stalking law language to (1) criminalize stalking      surveillance (this would include surveillance by new      technology devices such as Global Positioning Systems (GPS));      and (2) to expand the accountable harm to include substantial      emotional harm to the victim. The provision also enhances      minimum penalties if the stalking occurred in violation of an      existing protection order.       Sec. 115. Repeat Offender Provision. This section updates      the criminal code to permit doubling the applicable penalty      for repeat federal domestic violence offender--a sentencing      consequence already permissible for repeat federal sexual      assault offenders.       Sec. 116. Prohibiting Dating Violence. Utilizing the Act's      existing definition of dating violence, section 115 amends      the federal interstate domestic violence prohibition to      include interstate dating violence.       Sec. 117. Prohibiting Violence in Special Maritime and      Territorial Jurisdiction. This section tightens the      interstate domestic violence criminal provision to include      special maritime and territories within the scope of federal      jurisdiction.       Sec. 118. Updating Protection Order Definition in 28 U.S.C.      Sec. 534(e)(3)(B).       Sec. 119. Grants for Outreach to Underserved Populations.      This grant program authorizes $2 million annually for local,      national, and regional information campaigns on services and      law enforcement resources available to victims of domestic      violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking. Title II. Improving Services for Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating                  Violence, Sexual assault and stalking       Sec. 201. Findings       Sec. 202. Sexual Assault Services Provision. This section      creates a separate and direct funding stream dedicated to      sexual assault services. Currently, the Act funds rape      prevention programs, but does not provide sufficient      resources for direct services dedicated solely to sexual      assault victims, primarily rape crisis centers. Under this      new program funding will be distributed by the Department of      Justice to states and their sexual violence coalitions. The      formula grant funds will assist States and Tribes in their      efforts to provide services to adult, youth and child sexual      assault victims and their family and ho1usehold members,      including intervention, advocacy, accompaniment in medical,      criminal justice, and social support systems, support      services, and related assistance. Funding is also provided      for training and technical assistance. This section      authorizes $50,000,000 annually for 2006-2010.       Sec. 203. Amendments to the Rural Domestic Violence and      Child Abuse Enforcement Assistance Program. This section      reauthorizes and expands the existing education, training and      services grant programs that address violence against women      in rural areas. This provision renews the rural VAWA program,      extends direct grants to state and local governments for      services in rural areas and expands purpose areas to include      community collaboration projects in rural areas and the      creation or expansion of additional victim services. New      language expands the program coverage to sexual assault,      child sexual assault and stalking. It also expands      eligibility from rural states to rural communities,      increasing access to rural sections of otherwise highly      populated states. This section authorizes $55,000,000      annually for 2007 through 2011 (it is currently authorized at      $40 million a year).       Sec. 204. Education, Training and Enhanced Services to End      Violence Against Women with Disabilities. This section      reauthorizes and expands the existing education, training and      services grant programs that address violence against women      with disabilities. New purpose areas include construction and      personnel costs for shelters to better serve victims with      disabilities, the development of collaborative partnerships      between victim service organizations and organizations      serving individuals with disabilities and the development of      model programs that situate advocacy and intervention      services for victims within organizations serving individuals      with disabilities. The program is authorized at $10,000,000      for each fiscal year 2007 through 2011.       Sec. 205. Education, Training and Services to End Violence      Against and Abuse of Women Later in Life. This section      reauthorizes and expands the existing education, training and      services grant programs that address violence against elderly      women. Grants will be distributed by the Department of      Justice to States, local government, nonprofit and      nongovernmental organizations for providing training and      services for domestic violence, dating violence, sexual      assault and stalking victims age 60 and older. The program is      authorized at $10,000,000 annually for 2007 through 2011.       Sec. 206. Strengthening the National Domestic Violence      Hotline. Section 206 eliminates a current funding requirement      that any funds appropriated to the Hotline in excess of      $3,000,000 be devoted entirely to a non-existent Internet      program.   Title III. Services, Protection and Justice for Young Victims of                                 Violence       Sec. 301. Findings       Sec. 302. Rape Prevention and Education. This section      reauthorizes the Rape Prevention and Education Program. It      appropriates $80,000,000 annually (its current authorization      level) for 2007 through 2011. Of the total funds made      available under this subsection in each fiscal year, a      minimum of $1,500,000 will be allotted to the National Sexual      Violence Resource Center.       Sec. 303. Services, Education, Protection and Justice for      Young Victims of Violence. This section establishes a new      subtitle that would create four new grant programs designed      to address dating violence committed by and against youth.       (1) The Services to Advocate for and Respond to Teens      program authorizes grants to nonprofit, nongovernmental and      community based organizations that provide services to teens      and young adult victims of domestic violence, dating      violence, sexual assault or stalking. This section is      authorized for $15,000,000 annually for 2007 through 2011 and      will be administered by the Department of Health and Human      Services.       (2) The Access to Justice for Teens program is a      demonstration grant program to promote collaboration between      courts (including tribal courts), domestic violence and     sexual assault service providers, youth organizations and      service providers, violence prevention programs, and law      enforcement agencies. The purposes of the collaborative      projects are to identify and respond to domestic violence,      dating violence, sexual assault and stalking committed by or      against teens; to recognize the need to hold the perpetrators      accountable; to establish and implement procedures to protect      teens; and to increase cooperation among community      organizations. This section is authorized at $5,000,000      annually for 2007 through 2011 to be administered by      Department of Justice.       (3) The third program established under Sec. 303 is the      Grants for Training and Collaboration on the Intersection      between Domestic Violence and Child Maltreatment program. It      provides grants to child welfare agencies, courts, domestic      or dating violence service providers, law enforcement and      other related community organizations. Grant recipients are      to develop collaborative responses, services and cross-     training to enhance responses to families where there is both      child abuse and neglect and domestic violence or dating      violence. This section authorized at $5,000,000 annually 2007      through 2011 to be administered by the Department of Justice.       (4) The final program established under 303 is the      Supporting Teens through Education and Protection program to      be administered by the Department of Justice to eligible      middle and high school schools that work with domestic      violence and sexual assault experts to train and counsel      school faculty and students.       Sec. 304. Reauthorization of Grants to Reduce Violence      Against Women on Campus. This amends the existing campus      program to be administered by the Department of Justice on a      three-year grant cycle, provides more money and sets      parameters for training of campus law enforcement and campus      judicial boards. This section is authorized at $12,000,000      for 2007 and $15,000,000 for 2008 through 2011 (it is      currently authorized at $10 million).       Sec. 305. Juvenile Justice. The overwhelming majority of      girls entering the juvenile justice system are victims of      abuse and violence, and the system must provide adequate      services that are tailored to girls' gender-specific needs      and to their experiences of abuse. These provisions amend the      Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act to permit      grantees to detail gender-specific services.       Sec. 306. Safe Havens for Children. This section continues      and expands a pilot Justice Department grant program aimed at      reducing domestic violence and child abuse during parental      visitation or the transfer of children for visitation by      expanding the availability of supervised visitation centers.      It reauthorizes the program for $20,000,000 annually for 2007      through 2011.   Title IV. Strengthening America's Families by Preventing Violence       Sec. 401. Findings, Purpose and Authorization for three      new, child-focused programs. This section creates: (1) Grants      to Assist Children and Youth Exposed to Violence that      authorizes new, collaborative programs, administered by the      Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of Justice      in collaboration with the Administration for Children, Youth      and Families in the Department of Health and Human Services,      to provide services for children who have been exposed to      domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or      stalking for the purpose of mitigating the effects of such      violence. Programs authorized under this section include both      direct services for children and their non-abusing parent or      caretaker, and training/coordination for programs that serve      children and youth (such as Head Start, child care, and      after-school programs). It is authorized at $20,000,000      annually from 2007 through 2011.       This section also establishes the Development of Curricula      and Pilot Programs for Home Visitation Projects. Home      visitation services are offered in many states and on some      military bases to provide assistance to new parents or      families in crisis. Home visitation services, in addition to      providing assistance to the parents, look for signs of child      abuse or neglect in the home. This provision, administered by      the Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of      Justice in collaboration with the Administration for      Children, Youth and Families in the Department of Health and      Human Services, creates model training curricula and provides      home visitation services to help families to develop strong      parenting skills and ensure the safety of all family members.      The program is authorized at $7,000 per year for 2006-2010.       The final new program engages men and youth in preventing      domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and      stalking. It authorizes the development, testing and      implementation of programs to help youth and children develop      respectful, non-violent relationships. The grant is      administered by the Office on Violence Against Women at the      Department of Justice in collaboration with the Department of      Health and Human Services, and eligible entities include      community-based youth service organizations and state and      local governmental entities. It is authorized at $10,000,000      annually for 2007 through 2011.       Sec. 402. Study Conducted by the Centers for Disease      Control and Prevention. This provision authorizes $2 million      to the Centers for Disease Control to study the best      practices for reducing and preventing violence against women      and children and an evaluation of programs funded under this      Title. Title V. Strengthening the Health Care System's Response To Domestic          Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault and Stalking       Sec. 501. Findings.       Sec. 502. Purposes.       Sec. 503. Training and Education of Health Professionals.      This section provides new grants to train health care      providers and students in health professional schools on      recognizing and appropriately responding to domestic and      sexual violence. The provision authorizes $3,000,000 each      year from 2007 through 2011 to be administered by the      Department of Health and Human Services.       Sec. 504. Grants to Foster Public Health Responses to      Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault and      Stalking. Section 504 provides grants for statewide and local      collaborations between domestic and sexual violence services      providers and health care providers including state hospitals      and public health departments. These programs would provide      training and education to health care providers and would      develop policies and procedures that enhance screening of      women for exposure to domestic and sexual violence, and      encourage proper identification, documentation and referral      for services when appropriate. This section is authorized at      $5,000,000 annually from 2007 through 2011.       Sec. 506. Research on Effective Interventions in the Health      Care Setting to Address Domestic Violence. Includes funding      for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and      Administration for Healthcare Research and Quality to      evaluate effective interventions within the health care      setting to improve abused women's health and safety and      prevent further victimization. This section is authorized at      $5,000,000 annually from 2007 through 2011.   Title VI. Housing Opportunities and Safety for Battered Women and                                 Children       Sec. 601. Amends the Violence Against Women Act to include      a title addressing housing needs of victims of domestic      violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking.       Sec. 41401. Findings.       Sec. 41402. Purposes.       Sec. 41403. Definitions.       Sec. 41404. Collaborative Grants to Develop Long-Term      Housing for Victims. Modeled after successful affordable      housing, community development, and ``housing first''      programs across the nation, this section would provide      $10,000,000 for the Department of Health and Human Services      in partnership with the Department of Housing and Urban      Development to fund collaborative efforts to: place domestic      violence survivors into long-term housing as soon as      reasonable and safe; provide services to help individuals or      families find long-term housing; provide financial assistance      to attain long-term housing (including funds for security      deposits, first month's rent, utilities, down payments,      short-term rental assistance); provide services to help      individuals or families remain housed (including advocacy,      transportation, child care, financial assistance, counseling,      case management, and other supportive services); and      create partnerships to purchase, build, renovate, repair,      convert and operate affordable housing units. Funds may      not be directly spent on construction, modernization, or      renovations.       Sec. 41405. Grants to Combat Violence Against Women in      Public and Assisted Housing. This section establishes grants      to assist public and Indian housing authorities, landlords,      property management companies and other housing providers and      agencies in responding appropriately to domestic and sexual      violence. Grants would provide education and training,      development of policies and practices, enhancement of      collaboration with victim organizations, protection of      victims residing in public, Indian and assisted housing, and      reduction of evictions and denial of housing to victims for      crimes and lease violations committed or directly caused by      the perpetrators of violence against them. The program is      authorized at $10,000,000 and will be administered by the      Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of      Justice.       Sec. 602. Transitional Housing Assistance Grants for      Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault      or Stalking. Section 602 amends the existing transitional      housing program created by the PROTECT Act and administered      by the Office on Violence Against Women in the Department of      Justice. This section expands the current direct-assistance      grants to include funds for operational, capital and      renovation costs. Other changes include providing services to      victims of dating violence, sexual assault and stalking;      extending the length of time for receipt of benefits to match      that used by HUD transitional housing programs; and updating      the existing program to reflect the concerns of victim      service providers. The provision would increase the      authorized funding for the grant from $30,000,000 to      $40,000,000.       Sec. 603. Public and Indian Housing Authority Plans      Reporting Requirement.       Sec. 604. Housing Strategies.       Sections 603 and 604 amend the Housing and Urban      Development (UUD) Agency reporting requirements imposed on      public housing applicants. Pursuant to the amendment, HUD      applicants must include any     plans to address domestic violence, dating violence, sexual      assault and stalking in their application.       Sec. 605. Amendment to the McKinney-Vento Homeless      Assistance Act. This provision amends the Homeless Management      Information Systems (HMIS) statute in the McKinney-Vento      Homelessness Assistance Act to protect the confidentiality of      victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault      and stalking receiving assistance from HUD-funded victim      service programs. It requires that these programs refrain      from disclosing personally identifying information to the      HMIS. HUD-funded victim service providers may disclose non-     personally identifying information to the HMIS.       Sec. 606. Amendments to the Low Income Housing Assistance      Voucher Program.       Sec. 607. Amendments to the Public Housing Program.      Sections 606 and 607 amend the Low Income Housing Assistance      Voucher program (also known as the Section 8 or Housing      Choice Voucher program) and the Public Housing program to      state that an individual's status as a victim of domestic      violence, dating violence, or stalking is not an appropriate      basis for denial of program assistance by a public housing      authority. It also states that incidents of domestic      violence, dating violence and stalking shall not be good      cause for terminating a lease held by the victim. The      amendments specify that the authority of an owner or PHA to      evict or terminate perpetrators of abuse shall not be      limited and gives landlords and PHAs the ability to      bifurcate a lease to maintain the victim's tenancy while      evicting the perpetrator. Victims must certify their      status as victims by presenting appropriate documentation      to the PHA or owner, and the language clarifies that      victims can be evicted for lease violations or if their      tenancy poses a threat to the community.     Title VII. Providing Economic Security for Victims of Violence       Sec. 701. Resource Center on Domestic and Sexual Violence      in the Workplace. This provision authorizes the Attorney      General to award a grant to a private non-profit entity or      tribal organization for the establishment and operation of a      national resource center to provide information and      assistance to employers and labor organizations to aid      victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual      assault, and stalking. A million dollars would be      appropriated annually for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 to      support these activities.   Title VIII. Protection of Battered and Trafficked Immigrant Women       Sec. 801. Treatment of Spouse and Children of Victims. For      some trafficking victims, providing assistance in the      investigation or prosecution of the trafficking case can      endanger or traumatize the victim or her family members. The      ability to ensure safety of family members living abroad is      crucial to trafficking victims' or crime victims' well being      and ability to effectively assist in prosecutions. This      section allows T and U visa holders' spouse, children,      parents, and unmarried siblings under 18 to join them in the      United States.       Sec. 802. Permitted Presence of Victims of Severe      Trafficking. This section permits trafficking victims'      unlawful presence in the United States only if the      trafficking is at least one central reason for the unlawful      presence. The limited exception to the unlawful presence      provision is identical to that afforded to non-citizen      survivors of domestic abuse.       Sec. 803. Adjustment of Status for Victims of Trafficking.      This section shortens the adjustment time and allows      trafficking victims to apply for lawful permanent residency 2      years after receiving a T visa.       Sec. 804. Protection and Assistance for Victims of      Trafficking. This section clarifies the roles and      responsibilities accorded to the Department of Justice and      the Department of Homeland Security in addressing trafficking      and supporting victims. Furthermore, this section clarifies      that ``assistance'' by trafficking victims includes      responding to and cooperating with requests for evidence and      information.       Sec. 805. Protecting Victims of Child Abuse and Incest.      This section clarifies language to ensure that children of      VAWA self-petitioners abused by lawful permanent residents      receive the VAWA immigration protection and lawful permanent      residency along with their abused parent. It also assures      that children eligible for VAWA immigration relief are not      excluded from Child Status Protection Act protection. This      section enhances protection for incest victims by permitting      VAWA self-petitions to be filed until age 25 by individuals      who qualified for VAWA relief before they were 21 but did not      file a petition before that time if the abuse is at least one      central reason for the delayed filing.       Under current law, adopted foreign-born children must      reside with their adoptive parents for two years to gain      legal immigration status through their adoptive parents.      This section allows adopted children who were battered or      subjected to extreme cruelty by their adoptive parent or      the adoptive parent's family member residing in the      household to attain legal immigration status without      having to reside for two years with the abusive adoptive      family member.       Sec. 811. Definition of VAWA Self-Petitioner. This section      creates a term ``VAWA self-petitioner'' which covers all      forms of VAWA self-petitions created in VAWA 2000 including      VAWA Cuban Adjustment, VAWA HRIFA and VAWA NACARA applicants.       Sec. 812. Application in Cases of Voluntary Departure.      Under current law, people who fail to comply with voluntary      departure orders are barred for 10 years from receiving      lawful permanent residency through adjustment of status,      cancellation of removal (including VAWA cancellation), change      of status, and registry. Denying lawful permanent residency      to immigrant victims of domestic violence, sexual assault and      trafficking undermines Congressional intent to provide      immigration relief crucial to supporting crime victims      cooperating with law enforcement and offering protection for      battered immigrant spouses and children. This section exempts      victims eligible for VAWA, T or U relief from the harsh      consequences of failing to comply with voluntary departure      orders as long as the extreme cruelty or battery is at least      one of the central reasons for the overstay.       Sec. 813. Removal Proceedings. This section adds domestic      abuse to the list of exceptional circumstances that allow      immigrants to file motions to reopen in removal proceedings.      VAWA 2000 allowed immigration judges in cancellation of      removal and adjustment of status proceedings to waive      ineligibility grounds for some VAWA eligible battered      petitioners, who acted in self defense, violated their own      protection order, or were involved in a crime that didn't      result in serious bodily injury or where there was a      connection between the crime and their own abuse. This      section corrects drafting errors that have made these waivers      procedurally unavailable to battered immigrant victims.       Sec. 814. Eliminating Abusers' Control Over Applications      and Limitation on Petitioning for Abusers. The Violence      Against Women Act enabled battered Haitian Refugee      Immigration Fairness Act and Cuban Adjustment Act applicants      to apply for VAWA immigration relief. In order for these      applicants to access the relief, they need to file motions to      reopen. However, due to a drafting oversight, the deadline      for filing motions to reopen had already passed when VAWA      2000 became law. This amendment corrects the drafting and      allows these battered immigrants to file motions to reopen      and thereby access the relief that was created for them in      VAWA 2000.       This section also makes approved VAWA self-petitioners and      their spouses eligible for employment authorization.      Providing employment authorization earlier in the application      process gives battered immigrant self-petitioners the means      to sever economic dependence on their abusers, promoting      their safety and the safety of their children.       Section 814 also prohibits a VAWA self-petitioner or a T or      U-visa holder from petition for immigrant status for their      abuser.       Sec. 815. Application for VAWA-Related Relief. This      amendment clarifies that certain battered spouses and      children can access relief under the Nicaraguan Adjustment      and Central American Relief Act that was specifically created      for those groups in VAWA 2000. This amendment ensures relief      even in cases where an abusive spouse or parent failed to      apply to adjust the survivor's status to lawful permanent      residency by the statutory deadline or failed to follow      through with applications after filing. Thus, this      amendment prevents abusers from controlling their non-     citizen victims by blocking their ability to successfully      access the relief that was intended under VAWA 2000.       Sec. 816. Self Petitioning Parents. This section expands      the scope of VAWA immigration relief to include      intergenerational abuse, allowing non-citizen parents who are      abused by their adult U.S. citizen son or daughter to seek      VAWA relief       Sec. 817. Enhanced VAWA Confidentiality Non-disclosure      Protections. This section amends VAWA's confidentiality      protections so that they cover a range of immigrant victims      eligible for the various forms of VAWA or crime victim      related immigration relief including T visa victims, VAWA      Cubans, VAWA HRIFAs, VAWA NACARAs and VAWA suspension      applicants. This section also ensures that VAWA      confidentiality rules apply to each relevant federal agency      including the Department of Homeland Security and the      Department of State.       Sec. 821. Duration of T and U visas. This provision would      authorize issuance of T and U visas for a period of not more      than 4 years.       Sec. 822. Technical Correction to References in Application      of Special Physical Presence and Good Moral Character Rules.      This section corrects two technical drafting errors. First it      ensures that the provisions on physical presence and on good      moral character apply to all VAWA cancellation applicants.      Second it corrects an incorrectly cited section so that the      ``good moral character'' bar applies to bigamy, not unlawful      presence.       Sec. 823. Petitioning Rights of Certain Former Spouses      Under Cuban Adjustment. This section would ensure that      battered immigrants are still able to adjust under VAWA Cuban      adjustment relief even if they are divorced from the abuser.      This provision is necessary to prevent abusers from cutting      their spouses off from potential immigration status      adjustment by divorcing them.       Sec. 824. Self-Petitioning Rights of HRIFA Applicants. This      amendment clarifies that Haitian abused applicants can access      relief that was specifically created for them in VAWA 2000.      Abusers could control battered immigrants by not adjusting      their own status to lawful permanent residency pursuant to      the Haitian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act (``HRIFA''). The      abuser may not follow     through with the lawful permanent residency application or      fail to file an application at all. This technical correction      remedies the problem to ensure that all abused spouses and      children otherwise eligible for VAWA HRIFA are able to access      this relief.       Sec. 825. Motion to Reopen. This section, a correction to      VAWA 2000, gives domestic abuse victims the opportunity to      file one motion to reopen to pursue VAWA relief, and exempts      them from the special motion to reopen filing deadlines.       Sec. 826. Protecting Abused Juveniles. This section assures      that immigration authorities are not required to contact      abusive parents or family members in connection with the      abused, neglected, or abandoned juvenile's application for      special immigrant juvenile status. This prevents abusive      parents from keeping their children from accessing help      and support in the United States.       Sec. 827. Exceptions for the Protection of Domestic      Violence and Crime Victims. This section carves out an      exception to the current requirements regarding driver's      license or identification cards for victims of domestic      violence to ensure their safety.       Sec. 831. Short Title for the International Marriage Broker      Regulation Act of 2005.       Sec. 832. International Marriage Broker Information      Requirements. This section provides that a U.S. citizen      filing a petition for a K visa for a fiancee from another      country must provide information on criminal convictions for      specified crimes. These include a list of violent crimes,      including assault and battery as well as crimes relating to      substance or alcohol abuse. The Department of Homeland      Security will provide this criminal history information,      along with results of their search for any criminal      convictions to the foreign national beneficiary. The      Department of State is prohibited from approving a fiancee      visa if the petitioner has petitioned for more than 2 K visas      in the past, or less than 2 years have passed since the      petitioner filed for a K visa and that visa was approved. DHS      can waive this bar, but if person has history of violent      crimes, the bar cannot be waived unless DHS determined that      there are extraordinary circumstances, or the individual's      crimes were a result of domestic violence, the individual was      not the primary perpetrator of the violence, and the crime      did not result in serious bodily injury. DHS is directed to      create a database to track repeated K applications and notify      petitioner and spouse when second K is applied for in 10-year      period. All future K applications will trigger similar      notice, with domestic violence pamphlet being sent to K      beneficiary. The fact that an individual was provided with      this information and the domestic violence pamphlet for      immigrants cannot be used to deny their eligibility for      relief under VAWA.       Sec. 833. Domestic Violence Information and Resources for      Immigrants and Regulation of International Marriage Brokers.      This section directs DOS, DHS and DOJ to create a pamphlet on      domestic violence rights and resources for immigrants as well      as a summary of that pamphlet for use by Federal officials in      the interview process. The pamphlet is to be translated into      at least 14 languages and the required list of translations      is to review and revised every 2 years based on the language      spoken by the greatest concentration of K nonimmigrant visa      applicants. The pamphlet is to be mailed to all K applicants      with their visa application process instruction packet as      well as a copy of the petition submitted by the petitioner.      The pamphlet is to be made available to the public at all      consular posts, and posted on the DOS, DHS, and consular post      websites. The pamphlet will also be provided to any      international marriage broker, government agency or non-     governmental advocacy organization.       Sec. 834. Sharing of Certain Information. This section      provides that there is no bar to the sharing of information      between the relevant departments for the purpose of      fulfilling the disclosure requirements of the U.S. petition.                   Title IX. Safety for Indian Women       Sec. 901 and 902. Findings and Purposes.       Sec. 903. Consultation Requirement. This section requires      the Secretary of the Interior and the Attorney General to      consult with and seek recommendations from tribal governments      concerning the administration of tribal VAWA funds and      programs.       Sec. 904. Analysis and Research of Violence Against Indian      Women. This provision requests that the National Institute of      Justice conduct a national baseline study to examine violence      against Indian women and the effectiveness of Federal, State,      local and tribal responses. It also requires the Attorney      General to establish a task force to assist in the      development and implementation of the study and report to      Congress. Members of the study shall include tribal      governments and national tribal organizations. The violence      study is authorized at $1,000,000 for fiscal years 2007 and      2008. In addition, this section requires the Secretary of      Health and Human Services to conduct a study of injuries to      Indian women from incidents of domestic violence, dating      violence, sexual assault and stalking and the costs      associated with these injuries. The injury report shall be      reported to Congress and is authorized at $500,000 for fiscal      years 2007 and 2008.       Sec. 905. Tracking of Violence Against Indian Women. In      cases of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault      and stalking, the provision authorizes tribal law enforcement      to access and enter information on to Federal criminal      information databases (set out in 28 U.S.C. Sec. 534).      Second, it permits tribes to develop and maintain national      tribal sex offender registries and tribal protection order      registries. To undertake the latter, the provision authorizes      $1,000,000 for fiscal years 2007 through 2011.       Sec. 906. Safety for Indian Women Formula Grants. To better      administer grants to Indian Country and enhance the responses      of Indian tribal governments, this measure authorizes the      Office on Violence Against Women to combine all Native      American set asides appropriated under this Act and create a      single grant source.       Sec. 907. Deputy Director in the Office on Violence Against      Women. To coordinate and guide Federal, State, local and      tribal responses to violence against Indian women, this      provision establishes a Deputy Director of Tribal Affairs in      the Office on Violence Against Women. The Deputy Director is      charged with several duties, including, but not limited to,      oversight of tribal grant programs and developing federal      policies and protocols on matters relating to violence      against Indian women. In addition, the Deputy Director is      authorized to ensure that some portion of tribal funds      distributed through VAWA programs will be devoted to      enhancing tribal resources such as legal services or shelters      for Indian women victimized by domestic violence or sexual      assault.       Sec. 908 and 909. Enhanced Criminal Law Resources and      Domestic Assault by Habitual Offender. Sections 908 and 909      make several changes to existing criminal law. Under current      law persons who have been convicted of a qualifying      misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under federal or state      law are prohibited from possessing firearms. This amendment      would expand that prohibition to those persons convicted of a      qualifying misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under      tribal law.       Under current law, federal courts have exclusive      jurisdiction over domestic violence crimes committed in      Indian country where the perpetrator is a non-Indian and the      victim is an Indian, and concurrent jurisdiction with the      tribal courts where the perpetrator is an Indian and the      victim is a non-Indian. Under this scheme, federal officers      can only arrest for misdemeanors that occur in the presence      of the arresting officer. Most domestic violence offenses are      misdemeanors not committed in the presence of a federal      officer. Accordingly, this amendment will eliminate that      requirement and allow a federal arrest if there is reasonable      grounds that the offense was committed. Finally, the      provision creates a repeat offender provision.                      Title X. DNA Fingerprinting       Sec. 1001. Short Title.       Sec. 1002. Use of Opt-Out Procedure to Remove Samples from      National DNA Index. Because this title expands the scope of      the national DNA database to include DNA samples from      arrestees, this particular section amends the current      expungement protocols and directs the FBI to remove samples      in the event of an overturned conviction, acquittal, or the      charge was dismissed.       Sec. 1003. Expanded Use of COIS Grants. To reduce the      extraordinary backlog of rape kits and other crime scene      evidence waiting for DNA testing, the federal government      makes available to States a targeted DNA grant program.      Specifically, States may seek funding to reduce the backlog      in crime scene evidence, to reduce the backlog in DNA samples      of offenders convicted of qualifying state offenses, or to      enhance the State's DNA laboratory capabilities. This section      would expand the grant purpose regarding offender DNA samples      to include all samples collected under applicable state law;      accordingly, States could use federal funding to test samples      collected from arrestees or voluntary elimination samples.       Sec. 1004. Authorization to Conduct DNA Sample Collection      From Persons Arrested or Detained Under Federal Authority.      Current law allows federal authorities to collect DNA samples      from individuals upon indictment. This provision would expand      that authority to permit the Attorney General to collect DNA      at arrest or detention of non-United States persons.       Sec. 1005. Tolling of Statute of Limitations for Sexual      Abuse Offenses. This amendment strikes a carve-out      authorizing John Doe indictments in sexual assault crimes and      makes uniform the federal law that tolls the statute of      limitations for all federal crimes where DNA evidence is      collected (Sec. 3297).  The bill (H.R. 3402), as amended, was read the third time and passed.                          ____________________
