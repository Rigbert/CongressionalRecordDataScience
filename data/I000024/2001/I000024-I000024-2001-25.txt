President, before we recessed subject to the call of the Chair, I called up amendment No. 1735. I want to read it again because, as I stated before, to even consider that our energy dependence upon foreign sources is not a defense issue I think is ludicrous.  Instead of offering the long amendment, I have merely offered a sense-of-the-Senate amendment that says:       Sense of Senate on Availability of Energy-Related Supplies      for the Armed Forces.--It is the sense of the Senate that the      Senate should, before the adjournment of the first session of      the 107th Congress, take action on comprehensive national      energy security legislation, including energy production and      energy conservation measures, to ensure that there is an      adequate supply of energy for the Armed Forces.  I think the strongest point we can make about our dependency upon the Middle East is the fact that the most rapidly growing contributor to our energy supply in the Middle East, Iraq, is a country with which we are at war. It is absurd not to at least make this commitment as a sense of the Senate to get this done.  I ask this amendment be agreed to.
