President, today I rise to introduce a bill to honor a group of men who bravely served this country. I am proud to recognize the Choctaw and Comanche Code Talkers who joined the United States Armed Forces on foreign soil in the fight for freedom in two world wars.  During World War I, the Germans began tapping American lines, creating the need to provide secure communications. Despite the fact that American Indians were not citizens, 18 members of the Choctaw Nation enlisted to become the first American Indian soldiers to use their native language to transmit messages between the Allied forces.  At least one Choctaw man was placed in each field company headquarters. He would translate radio messages into the Choctaw language and then write field orders to be carried by messengers between different companies on the battle line. Fortunately, because Choctaw was an unwritten language only understood by those who spoke it, the Germans were never able to break the code.  The 18 Choctaw Code Talkers who served in the 142nd Infantry Company of the 36th Division were: Albert Billy, Victor Brown, Mitchell Bobb, Ben Carterby, George Davenport, Joe Davenport, James Edwards, Tobias Frazier, Ben Hampton, Noel Johnson, Otis Leader, Soloman Louis, Pete Maytubby, Jeff Nelson, Joseph Oklahombi, Robert Taylor, Walter Veach, and Calvin Wilson.  Similarly, the Comanche Code Talkers played an important role during World War II. Once again, the enemy began tapping American lines. In order to establish the secure transmission of messages, the United States enlisted fourteen Comanche Code Talkers who served overseas in the 4th Signal Company of the 4th Infantry Division. They were: Charles Chibitty, Haddon Codynah, Robert Holder, Forrest Kassanavoid, Wellington Mihecoby, Albert Nahquaddy, Jr., Clifford Ototivo, Simmons Parker, Melvin Permansu, Elgin Red Elk, Roderick Red Elk, Larry Saupitty, Morris Tabbyetchy, and Willis Yackeshi.  The Army chose the Comanches because their language was thought to be the least known to the Germans. Second Lieutenant Hugh Foster worked with them to develop their own unique code for military words. He gave the Indians a list of military words and then worked with them to develop a Comanche word or phrase for those words.  On June 6, 1944, just after landing in Normandy, a Comanche trained by Lt. Foster and serving as a driver and radio operator under Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr, sent one of the first messages from Utah Beach. These communications efforts, by the Comanches, helped the Allies win the war in Europe.  It is time Congress officially recognizes these men. My bill directs the Secretary of the Treasury to award the Choctaw and Comanche Code Talkers a gold medal as a result of their great commitment and service on behalf of the United States during World Wars I and II. I welcome my colleagues to join me in saluting this group of heroes for contributing to the fight for freedom for our country and around the world.                                 ______                                       By
