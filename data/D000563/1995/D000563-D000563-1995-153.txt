Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.  I wonder if the gentleman from South Carolina would take a microphone at his leisure. I would just like to ask him two or three questions.  First, I would like to ask the gentleman, has he ever be in the south building of the Department of Agriculture?
