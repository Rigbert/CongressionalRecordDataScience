 Chairman, this is the Republican budget. ``The Department of Energy has spent billions of dollars on research and development since the oil crisis in 1973 triggered this activity. Returns on this investment have not been cost effective, particularly for applied research and development which industry has ample incentive to undertake. Some of this activity is simply corporate welfare * * *''  This is not the gentleman from Vermont; this is the Republican budget resolution. ``* * * corporate welfare for the oil, gas and utility industries. Much of it duplicates what industry is already doing. Some has gone to fund technology for which the market has no interest.''  Mr. Chairman, according to the Congressional Budget Office, the beneficiaries of the fossil fuel program are some of the largest multinational corporations in the world including Exxon, Chevron, Conoco, Texaco, Amoco, Phillips Petroleum, ARCO, and Shell. These companies in fact are making large profits. They do not have to come to the taxpayer for all of this support.  So I think the time is now to be fair to communities all over this country, and I would urge support for this important amendment.
