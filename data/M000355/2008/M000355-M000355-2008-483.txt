 President, I will start the day by acknowledging the tragedy that has befallen several States in the South, including my own State of Kentucky.  According to news reports, rare winter storms struck across Kentucky, Arkansas, Tennessee, and Mississippi. News reports indicate at least 44 people have been killed, and 7 of those were in my State--4 in Allen County, which is along the Tennessee border, and 3 in Greenville, which is in Muhlenberg County in the western part of our State.  Thousands more are left with damage or destroyed property or are without power. The authorities are still working to determine the extent of the damage.  I ask my colleagues to join me in praying for the families of the victims and to all who have been touched by these terrible storms. State and local officials are working as hard as they can to survey the destruction and get help to anybody who needs it.                          ____________________
