 The gentleman has announced that TRIA is going to be under consideration. We believe this is a very important piece of legislation. However, it passed out of committee on a party-line vote, as the gentleman knows, and there are still concerns that need to be addressed. I would hope that we could work on those before it comes to the floor.  Does the gentleman know whether that will come under a rule and whether or not that rule will provide for an open amendatory process?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY of California. I thank you for yielding and for bringing up this issue.  As I mentioned the schedule announcement for next week, Members should be prepared for possible consideration of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act. Once the timing is finalized, the Rules Committee will announce a hearing on the measure to determine the process by which the bill will be brought before the floor.
