Speaker, I thank our able leaders, the gentleman from California (Mr. Lantos) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), and rise in strong support of this bipartisan resolution condemning yesterday's reprehensible acts of terrorismperpetrated against the people of the United States and freedom-loving people everywhere.  Americans stand united in our firm resolve to seek out those responsible for this carnage and to bring them to justice before the entire international community. Our citizenry's valor, their order, and their dignity in face of this overwhelming tragedy shines to the whole world. Across America, our people are helping one another, honoring the dead, healing the injured, donating blood, picking up the wreckage and building for a new day.  Across our world, words of encouragement pour into our Capitol. Tonight I wish to read some of these words into the record.  From Russia:       Dear Congresswoman: All of us in Russia, just the same as      throughout the world, express our deepest condolences over      the terrible losses suffered in the United States. We believe      that this tragedy affects us all. We share the pain of the      lost lives and know that we must unite our efforts to do      everything in our power for this to never happen again. We      should forget about all our differences, and focus together      on the critical issues that need to be resolved in the world      today. Our prayers are with you.--Andrei and all your other      brothers and sisters in Russia.  From Ukraine's Roman Catholic Vicar General, Bishop Stanislaw Szyrokoradiuk:       Dear Congresswoman Kaptur: I would like to present to You      and through You--to all American people--our condolences      because of the terrible tragedy that has stricken the whole      world.       We have been very shaken to know about a series of acts of      terrorism that happened in the United States of America      yesterday.       It has been an awful blow by its cruelty and scale that      struck not only USA but all humanity. I received this notice      during spiritual retreats in our Higher Spiritual Seminary in      Vorzel, where all priests of our Diocese came. As a sign of      our unity and sympathy in your grief we celebrated Holy Mass      for the souls of the departed and prayed for all victims. May      the Lord strengthen them by His grace that they may outlive      this horrible disaster.       In all our churches there are Divine Services and prayers      said for the souls of the departed victims and for all those      who have suffered.       These days our hearts and our prayers are with your people.           Sincerely yours,                               Bishop Stanislaw Shyrokoradiuk,                                          The Roman Catholic Vicar                                               General of Ukraine.  From Western Europe:       I cannot find the words to describe our feelings about what      happened in NY and Washington! Our thoughts are with you and      all American people.       While obviously it's difficult to go forward together, it's      the only way!       Hope that nobody of your relatives/friends will be amongst      the victims.       Warm regards,                                                    Roos & Gerard.  From Canada:                       America: The Good Neighbor       This Canadian thinks it is time to speak up for the      Americans as the most generous and possibly the least      appreciated people on all the earth. Germany, Japan and, to a      lesser extent, Britain and Italy were lifted out of the      debris of war by the Americans who poured in billions of      dollars and forgave other billions in debts.       None of these countries is today paying even the interest      on its remaining debts to the United States. When France was      in danger of collapsing in 1956, it was the Americans who      propped it up, and their reward was to be insulted and      swindled on the streets of Paris. I was there. I saw it.       When earthquakes hit distant cities, it is the United      States that hurries to help. This spring, 59 American      communities were flattened by tornadoes. Nobody helped. The      Marshall Plan and the Truman Policy pumped billions of      dollars into discouraged countries. Now newspapers in those      countries are writing about the decadent, warmongering      Americans.       I'd like to see just one of those countries that is      gloating over the erosion of the United States dollar build      its own airplane. Does any other country in the world have a      plane to equal the Boeing Jumbo Jet, the Lockheed Tri-Star,      or the Douglas DC10?       If so, why don't they fly them? Why do all the      International lines except Russia fly American Planes? Why      does no other land on earth even consider putting a man or      woman on the moon? You talk about Japanese technocracy, and      you get radios. You talk about German technocracy, and you      get automobiles. You talk about American technocracy, and you      find men on the moon--not once, but several times--and safely      home again.       You talk about scandals, and the Americans put theirs right      in the store window for everybody to look at. Even their      draft-dodgers are not pursued and hounded. They are here on      our streets, and most of them, unless they are breaking      Canadian laws, are getting American dollars from ma and pa at      home to spend here.       When the railways of France, Germany and India were      breaking down through age, it was the Americans who rebuilt      them. When the Pennsylvania Railroad and the New York Central      went broke, nobody loaned them an old caboose. Both are still      broke.       I can name you 5000 times when the Americans raced to the      help of other people in trouble. Can you name me even one      time when someone else raced to the Americans in trouble? I      don't think there was outside help even during the San      Francisco earthquake.       Our neighbors have faced it alone, and I'm one Canadian who      is damned tired of hearing them get kicked around. They will      come out of this thing with their flag high. And when they      do, they are entitled to thumb their nose at the lands that      are gloating over their present troubles. I hope Canada is      not one of those.       Stand proud, America! Wear it proudly!!  From an elderly and disabled constituent from our district:       She can't give blood or send money, but has been trying to      think what she could do to help in this situation. It came to      her that everybody should fly their flag. It's a visible sign      of our support of our nation and the perseverance of the      citizens. Also all the tv and radio stations could be asked      to play the national anthem once all at the same time. She's      asking Marcy to ``get the word out'' so people could be asked      to do this. May we?  From Arab-American Muslims in my community, the strong resolution of condemnation that no political cause could ever be assisted by such immoral acts:   We Deplore the Attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon       We strongly condemn this morning's plane attacks on the      World Trade Center and the Pentagon and express deep sorrow      for Americans that were injured and killed. We sends out our      condolence to all victims of this cowardly terrorist attack.      There is no cause that justifies this type of an immoral and      inhumane act that has affected so many innocent American      lives. We support all efforts of the investigation in order      to track down the people responsible for this tragic act of      terrorism.       ``Arab And American Muslims utterly condemn what are      apparently vicious and cowardly acts of terrorism against      innocent civilians. We join with all Americans in calling for      the swift apprehension and punishment of the perpetrators. No      Political cause could ever be assisted by such immoral      acts.''                                              Hussein H. Shousher.  From a Technical Sergeant at our Toledo Air National Guard, who suggests new safety technologies on airplanes using Internet video surveillance:       In light of today's unfortunate events, I have formulated a      logical solution to help prevent future catastrophes      involving hijackings. An internet video surveillance system.      The equipment to record movement and post to the internet is      already available from http://www.x10.com/, and x10.com has      been delivering affordable internet tools since 1997.       I'm sure with a few simple adjustments, and an FCC pipe to      the internet a plane could be equipped with the same      surveillance system as a house. The system could continually      post updates to the internet where the video could be      monitored for the safety of the passengers and people on the      ground. This would be a deterrent for future attacks. It      would give passengers some peace of mind. And it would give      us the opportunity to strike back and bring a commercial      plane down before it was close enough to crash into a      building that thousands of people were working in.       I would be happy to help out with the development and      installation of such a life-saving device.       Thank you.                                                Joseph A. Poirier,                                        Toledo Air National Guard.  From a constituent who e-mailed us:       Dear Marcy. Some thoughts about what may be some of the      gifts of this tragedy. I am grateful for the heart you have      always brought to your leadership.       Please lead for us in a new way. Find the power in      collaboration. Power to create amazing solutions by bringing      your differences together and relinquishing outcomes based on      self-interest. Listen to each other and learn what the      listening will teach. Let debate and fear-based grasping for      power cease. Discover how to be powerful in coming together      in dialogue and collaboration. Your singing on the steps of a      sacred place of American government has far more substance      and potential in it than patriotism stoked by attack. Lead us      in learning what this tragedy can teach. Is it possible to      defend us and secure the world community without adding to      the fire of terror and violence? Just asking ourselves the      question and hearing what comes forth might yield vital new      methods to add to the old. This is a time when we can see who      we are. Help us reflect the best of ourselves back to each      other. The American people are responding to each other with      such generosity and full hearts. A new world order may be      able to emerge as we look at what generates order in the      middle of chaos. We are watching it as we look at our      television sets today.       You are in my thoughts and prayers.                                                   Nancy Harshman.  The outpouring of good will over evil is evident in every act, every letter, every call, every encounter. America will surmount this new test of her will and her freedom.  God bless America.
