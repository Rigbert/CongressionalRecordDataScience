Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to present to the House H.R. 1836, introduced by our colleague from New York, Mike Forbes, to add a 98-acre ocean-front parcel of land in Montauk, NY, to the Long Island National Wildlife Refuge.  During our committee's deliberations on this bill, a local supervisor and a group of concerned citizens testified in strong support of protecting this property called Shadmoor, which is essential habitat for several highly endangered plants.  While it is unclear how much it will cost the Federal Government to purchase this tract of land, I am encouraged by the fact that the local community in the Town of East Hampton, NY, has voted to share in the acquisition costs. This is a positive step in the right direction.  I am prepared to support H.R. 1836 based on this innovative cost-sharing commitment and the stipulation that those private citizens who now own Shadmoor are fully compensated for their property prior to its inclusion in the Long Island National Wildlife Refuge complex.  I urge an ``aye'' vote on H.R. 1836 and I compliment Congressman Mike Forbes for his outstanding leadership in this matter.
