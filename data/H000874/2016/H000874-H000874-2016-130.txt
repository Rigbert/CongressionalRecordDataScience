Speaker, I thank my friend for that information. I want to ask him just one question on one of those commonsense bills that seeks to remove those employees who work for the IRS who collect taxes, that if they are delinquent, they will be removed.  Does that apply to the Congress of the United States as well which levies those taxes, that if we have any Members who are delinquent, that they, too, would be removed?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  The bill solely deals with the IRS, but he can always offer an amendment.
