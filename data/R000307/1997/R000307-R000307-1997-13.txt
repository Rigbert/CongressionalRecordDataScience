President, today I am introducing legislation that really should not have to be introduced to address a controversy that should not be taking place. The legislation is intended to prevent further construction of any memorial on the parcel of Federal land surrounding the U.S. Marine Corps memorial commonly known as the Iwo Jima memorial located in Arlington, VA.  Mr. President, the reason I am introducing this legislation is that, unfortunately, this site has been selected for a 50-foot high Air Force memorial approximately 500 feet from the Iwo Jima statue.  Mr. President, I realize full well that this legislation and this issue will and has caused considerable emotional debate and difference of opinion within our Marine and Air Force communities. I stress that in my opinion it does not have to be that way.  First, the points that I will raise should not be construed as any denigration or challenge to the worthiness of a memorial to the proud men and women of the U.S. Air Force who have served our Nation so very well. In fact, one of my points is that our U.S. Air Force deserves its own special place that will not compete with any other memorial.  In discussing this legislation, I am going to leave the legal issues to those with better expertise in the nuance of law. The point I would like to stress is very basic. It supersedes reports and hearings and commission recommendations and whether or not the proponents of construction of another memorial have successfully--and apparently they have--traversed the procedural obstacle course and the tripwires necessary to gain approval for construction.  Simply put, the Iwo Jima memorial represents and memorializes an absolutely unique and special time in our Nation's history. Just as Bunker Hill and Saratoga and Yorktown and Gettysburg, Belleau Wood and Bataan, Normandy, Chosin Reservoir, and other battles have been etched in our national psyche as touchstones and reminders of courage, valor and bravery in defense of freedom, and have special meaning for this Nation and the valiant members of our Armed Forces that fought bravely in each of those campaigns, Iwo Jima became a rallying point for this country and the U.S. Marine Corps during the dark days of the war in the Pacific.  Mr. President, on a personal note, for me, the Iwo Jima memorial has special meaning. My dad, then a Marine major, Wes Roberts, took part in the battle of Iwo Jima. His accounts of the bravery and sacrifice are part of our family's history and inspiration. Fifteen years later, then Marine Lt. Pat Roberts, stationed in Okinawa with the 3d Marine Division, revisited Iwo Jima, along with the first official Marine party to pay a personal tribute and visit to that island. My assignment was to cover the visit and dedication for the Stars and Stripes newspaper.  I shall never forget the experience. Iwo Jima veterans, enlisted and officers, stood on Mt. Suribachi in the quiet of the gentle wind overlooking a now lush green island in the blue of the Pacific, and there was not a sound. Then, in hushed tones, mixed with emotion and tears, the Iwo Jima veterans relived, recounted that battle and said many a prayer for their fallen comrades.  Lt. General Thomas A. Wornham placed a 5th Marine Division insignia on the flagpole atop famous Suribachi. Former members of his old unit, the 27th Marines, stood with visiting dignitaries. They listened quietly. The general said, ``We landed over there by those two rocks. The terraces were much higher then. I crawled on my hands and knees right by that small hill.''  In a low whisper, Col. John W. Antonelli, former 2d battalion Commander in the 27th, said, ``I cannot look at this scene, this island, without thinking of my Marines who died inorder to capture it. From the top of Suribachi, I can see where they fell. One of my best friends was killed in that ravine. Every time the Marines would take cover there, they invited the incoming artillery.''  Then Col. Donn J. Robertson, former 3d battalion commander in the famous regiment, told listeners how the island had changed. ``This new lush vegetation would have given our boys much needed cover then. As I stand here looking down from Suribachi, I realize how the enemy had us covered in interlocking fire. We landed on a beautiful day just like this, sun shining, blue sky, blue ocean. I am thankful to be alive.''  Standing on Suribachi, it was difficult for any of us to imagine how anyone could have survived the landing and day-after-day assault. The day after the island was declared secure more marines suffered casualties than they had in the last 10.  But survive they did, and Old Glory was raised over Iwo Jima on the 23d of February, 1945, and captured on film to become a pictorial moment in history unequaled in portraying uncommon valor. Almost 10 years later, that special event in our Nation's history was recreated and consecrated forever in the dedication of the Iwo Jima memorial here in our Nation's Capital and now attracts over 1 million visitors every year.  Let me stress, Mr. President, that Iwo Jima is not purely a Marine Corps memorial. It does, of course, represent an extremely important event in the proud history of our corps, but it is, in a larger sense, a memorial for the American people. Many consider the Iwo Jima site as hallowed ground and certainly not a site where there should be a competing memorial.  I also wish to acknowledge that the Air Force Association has been forthright and aboveboard in the process to find a suitable site for their proposed memorial. I applaud and support their efforts to properly recognize the superb contribution the men and women of the U.S. Air Force have made to this country. The point is that I do not believe it serves any purpose for either memorial to compete with or stand in the shadow of the other.  I also realize the proponents of the Air Force memorial will say it will not interfere with Iwo Jima, and it will be located behind a line of trees so that it cannot be seen from the Iwo site.  Now, the sense I get from those statements is that the Air Force memorial will figuratively be in the shadow of Iwo Jima. If so, that, quite frankly, is not fair to the Air Force and to those the memorial is intended to honor. A location should be found where the memorial can stand clearly, proudly, and in its own place without competition from any other structure.  In addition, the National Planning Commission report recognizes that the site for the proposed Air Force memorial is, ``fragile and delicate.'' The report further recognizes that the area encompassing the Iwo Jima memorial and the Netherlands Carillon and the Arlington National Cemetery is ``reverent space whose beautiful nature is already heavily disrupted by heavy automobile and bus traffic on the periphery and by tour bus traffic within the area itself. The planned construction of 40 additional parking spaces adjacent to the memorial, which is currently a wooded area, would further diminish the natural beauty of the memorial and the park surroundings.''  I realize in the passage of time, even the most memorable acts of courage and valor and bravery tend to fade into yesterday's history books. Succeeding generations tend to forget the lessons of the past, and the world, indeed, is a different place. Today, great historical events, and even the lives and lessons of our Founding Fathers are many times mere footnotes in a fast-paced society, or worse, subject to revision depending on what is politically correct at the moment.  But, let us not add to or hasten this erosion by unnecessarily competing or infringing upon what has been accurately called ``sacred and reverent space.''  This so-called controversy about the location of the proposed Air Force memorial in conjunction with the Iwo Jima memorial is, in fact, a paradox of enormous irony. The battle of Iwo Jima was fought to secure a safe haven and staging area for bomber aircraft flown by the forerunners of the U.S. Air Force. Marines fought and died to help save the lives of the fliers of the Army Air Corps. For 43 years, ever since the memorial was dedicated on the Marine Corps birthday in 1954, the Iwo Jima memorial has been in fact a memorial to both brave marines and fliers of World War II.  Why, why then, why indeed, should any memorial so inspired, so true to the memory and sacrifice of both marines and Army Air Corps fliers, why should such hallowed ground be subject to encroachment and duplication of yet another memorial for the same purpose, a memorial that should stand in its own right and on its own site?  We should preserve the sanctity of a memorial that has come to be viewed by all Americans as a de facto memorial to World War II. Nothing should detract from the serene and hallowed setting of the Iwo Jima memorial.  In a letter I have received from the Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, Gen. C.C. Krulak, the Commandant eloquently sums up what all marines feel in their hearts and what I have tried to explain in my remarks. I quote from his letter:       Although I was just a young boy, I remember watching as the      Iwo Jima memorial was erected on the edge of Arlington      Cemetery. I remember that November day in 1954 when my      godfather, Gen. Holland ``Howlin Mad'' Smith, stood before      that magnificent statue and, with tears slowly streaming down      his cheeks, softly said, ``My marines, my marines. . . .''      Truly, this is a sacred place.  Mr. President, the commandant went on to say that, as the last marine on active duty to have witnessed the Iwo dedication, he truly believes that this Nation must preserve its sanctity. For, as General Krulak said, the Iwo Jima memorial is more than a monument; it is a place for reflection, a place to pay respect, and a place to gain inner strength. Over 23,000 marines were killed or injured on Iwo Jima, and each year, over 1 million Americans pay tribute to those marines.  General Krulak closed his letter by saying:       In speaking for them, for their survivors, and for all      marines past, present and future, the sanctity of the Iwo      Jima memorial must be preserved.  Semper fidelis, general, semper fidelis.  I ask my colleagues to join me in this effort.                                 ______                                       By
