Speaker, I rise to celebrate the career of U.S. Capitol Police Detective William J. Zimmerman, who is retiring in October after thirty-two years with the force.  Since 1987, Det. Zimmerman has served with the Threat Assessment Section, the division responsible for investigating threats made against Members of Congress, their families, or others who receive special protection under the law. Det. Zimmerman currently serves as the Senior Investigator, playing a lead role in identifying threats and keeping Members of Congress safe as they serve this nation.  When an individual or group contacts a Member's office in a suspicious way, it is up to Threat Assessment Section investigators like Det. Zimmerman to assess whether a danger is present. As a longtime veteran of the process, Det. Zimmerman has helped establish threat assessment and management programs for other law enforcement services across the United States and in the United Kingdom as well. He has conducted training for House and Senate staff on security awareness and spoken at conferences around the country to share best practices.  Det. Zimmerman served as the first President of the Washington D.C. chapter of the Association of Threat Assessment Professionals and holds that position today. In 2004, he became the inaugural recipient of the Association's distinguished Meritorious Service Award for his work and leadership in the field.  The U.S. Capitol Police play an extraordinarily important and often-overlooked role in the functioning of our nation's democracy. Without the safe and secure space they provide, lawmakers would be unable to conduct the American people's work and carry out our functions under the Constitution. All of us who serve in Congress hold the U.S. Capitol Police and its personnel in high esteem, and we are grateful for those who put on its uniform every day.  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Det. William J. Zimmerman for his more-than three decades of service to the U.S. Capitol Police, to the Congress of the United States, and to our nation. I wish him all the best in his retirement.                          ____________________
