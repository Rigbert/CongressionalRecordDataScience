 We have worked together on the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Youth Violence to update the statute. I am disappointed that we were not able to pass reauthorization legislation this year. I look forward to trying again next year. I would ask the chairman of the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations Subcommittee if he is concerned that if reauthorization legislation is not passed next year, whether that will make it more difficult for the subcommittee to fund the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention?
