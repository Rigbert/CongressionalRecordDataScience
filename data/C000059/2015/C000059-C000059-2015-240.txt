 My constituents are depending on the House and the Senate to send a strong message to the White House that their attempt to grant amnesty through executive action is an affront to the democratic process that has served our Nation well for more than 200 years.  The reason people are fleeing from south to north is that this side of the border, we have the rule of law, not men.  I want to thank Homeland Security Subcommittee Chairman John Carter, Chairman Hal Rogers, and the rest of my colleagues on the Appropriations Committee for putting together a responsible bill that provides the funds for our Homeland Security personnel and the need to carry out their mission.  Specifically, the bill provides significant funding for our Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement to ensure both agencies have the ability to stem large flows of illegal immigration like we witnessed last summer in Texas.  Another important tool in tackling illegal immigration is the increased use of E-Verify, which remains the only and best way for employers to confirm that the employees that they hire are in this country legally. The underlying bill contains full fundingfor the E-Verify funding and will allow employers to continue to use this program in a free and efficient manner.  When it comes to patrolling our land, air, and sea, Homeland Security officials consistently rely on the awareness and insights that are provided by assets operated by the Air and Marine Operations Center, or AMOC. In fact, AMOC, which is located in Riverside County, California, is the Nation's only Federal law enforcement center tasked to coordinate interdiction operations in the Western Hemisphere.  The FY15 bill fully funds the operations of AMOC and ensures that our law enforcement agencies will continue to benefit from their contributions.  Again, I want to thank Judge Carter for his leadership, and I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for the FY15 Homeland Security Appropriations bill.
