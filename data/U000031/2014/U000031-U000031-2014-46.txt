Speaker, I rise today to recognize a much beloved member of our community and a well-respected journalist, Lou Mumford, on the occasion of his retirement from the South Bend Tribune newspaper.  For the past 43 years, Lou has reported the news as it unfolded in Greater Michiana. He is an excellent writer with a trusted, familiar voice, gentle humor, and a strong sense of integrity. He was a true journalist's journalist, exemplifying the newspaper industry's gold standard.  During his many decades at work, Lou has seen it all, both good and bad. From covering everything from the high school football team to the courthouse; providing eyewitness accounts to presidential visits; to reporting on the grand national scene and sharing the stories of individuals living right within our community.  When Lou was covering local politics or breaking news out of Washington, you always knew what to expect. His questions were fair, unbiased, and intuitive. You were never going to get a free pass, but you would always be treated with the utmost courtesy and respect. It is impossible to not develop a deep professional respect and admiration for a man of Lou's character. And despite our unbridgeable differences--he roots for the White Sox and I am a dyed-in-the-wool Cubs fan--I am grateful for the warm personal rapport we developed over the years.  Lou has a knack for reading the political field--the history, personalities, issues, and all their nuances--because he understands people and what makes them tick. He also empathizes and brings the reader along with him on an emotional journey. This is where Lou showed his true strengths.  His columns shared the lives of ordinary folks in our own community, touching upon the full range of human emotions. His stories about everyday lives could warm the heart, bring a smile to our face, or a tear to our eye.Sometimes both in the same story. They reminded us all of what is really important in life--our own experiences, family, friends, and community.  The great journalist Bob Schieffer once remarked that ``journalism is a great way to do public service, to have an impact on your community.'' While the dawn of each day unveiled new stories on the pages of the South Bend Tribune, one thing remained constant through the years, and that was the steady voice of Lou Mumford. Our community is grateful for Lou's dedicated years of service to our community. We wish him all the best in his retirement, and do hope his story telling will continue.                          ____________________
