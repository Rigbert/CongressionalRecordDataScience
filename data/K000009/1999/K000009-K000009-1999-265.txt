Speaker, I rise with great pride to honor a 104 year old veteran in my district. John Topolewski was awarded France's Knight Cross of the French Legion of Honor on Wednesday, June 16, 1999 in Toledo, Ohio. The Knight's Cross is the highest award given by France to citizens of other countries. The award was presented to Mr. Topolewski by France's Consul General Alain de Keghel, the second ranking French official in the U.S., in front of a replica of the troop train which transported U.S. troops to France in World War I. Mr. Topolewski was one of those ``Doughboys` and a member of the 82nd Infantry Division. The nation of France has bestowed the Knight's Cross upon John Topolewski for uncommon valor in the trenches as he fought in the United States Army during World War I.  The Greek historian Thucydides wrote ``remember that this greatness was won by men with courage, with knowledge of their duty, and with a sense of honor in action . . . but the bravest are surely those who have the clearest vision of what is before them, glory and danger alike, and yet notwithstanding go out to meet it.'' As a young man at the dawn of his adulthood, John Topolewski embodied these words. He acted because he thought it his duty to his comrades, his country, and the world, not out of a desire for recognition, glory or awards. Consul General Keghel told him as he gave him the medal ``More than two million American soldiers were sent across the Atlantic Ocean. The French have not forgot their bravery more than eighty years later. Today it is your turn, Mr. John Topolewski, to be honored. You served in dangerous conditions. You belong for sure among the veterans here.''  John Topolewski stands today as a symbol of thousands of nameless heroes of that first great world wide conflict, and the ones which followed. He is a reminder of the humanness in war, of sacrifices made to preserve liberty and regain freedoms withheld. Although I was unable to personally be with him as he received this belated honor, I salute John Topolewski, and thank him on behalf of the people of our nation and freedom lovers world-wide.                          ____________________
