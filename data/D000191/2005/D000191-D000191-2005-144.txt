Speaker, I would suggest to the chairman of the Committee on Rules that more time for words would be great, but what would be better would be action by this Congress to fix a dysfunctional Federal Emergency Management Agency. Dysfunctional at the top, not at the bottom. People at the bottom want to get out there. The first responders want to be out there. They still do not have effective interoperable communications 4 years after 9/11.  Given the befuddled response at the top, I am not confident that this $51.8 billion we are going to borrow, indebting a generation of Americans of probably another $100 billion or $200 billion, will be well and effectively spent and get the relief and the rescue efforts and the rebuilding efforts to the people and the communities that are devastated.  We are not putting in place oversight and protection against crisis profiteering. We are not trying to improve the agency. It is the middle of a hurricane season. What if there is another tomorrow or next week? Will the terrorists wait until we are done with our natural disasters? No. We need to begin the review and oversight now. They say, Oh, you cannot do that in the middle of a crisis.  What is the greatest crisis this country has experienced in the last 100 years? I think it might have been World War II. In the middle of World War II, Harry Truman chaired a committee investigating war profiteering under FDR, the greatest President of the last century, and reforms were put in place. Congress did its job.  We need to improve FEMA. We need a better response. The first responders need better tools. The people that have been affected need effective relief, they need compassion, and they need assistance. Shoveling money at them and more words will not do it. We need to make some changes, and you are not going to allow any changes or any amendments here on this floor today, but you will allow us a few more words. We might get up to $1 billion a minute instead of $1.2 billion a minute.
