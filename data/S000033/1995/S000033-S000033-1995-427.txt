 Go for it. We think it is a great idea.''  But if you are concerned about a $200 billion deficit, if you are concerned that there are people here in Congress who say that because of the deficit we have got to cut back on Medicare, on Medicaid, on nutrition programs for hungry kids, and you think that a $40 billion loan guarantee for Mexico is not how you want to see your tax dollars being spent, then I think also you should get on the phone, you should call up Speaker Gingrich, you should call up my office, Ms. Kaptur's office and the office of your Representative in Congress, your United States Senator.  Mr. Speaker, we can defeat this thing if millions of Americans stand up and say, ``No, let's get our priorities straight. We have other things to do with our tax dollars other than to bail out Mexico and protect investments from large banks and investment houses.''  So let us get our priorities straight, let us flood the U.S. Congress with calls, with letters, and say to the Members of this institution, ``No bailout for Mexico. Protect American taxpayers.''
