President, I have so much respect and affection for two key sponsors, Senator Kyl of Arizona and Senator Feinstein of California. They, as the other 98 Senators of both parties, care deeply about the rights of victims. Anybody who has seen some of the violent crimes in this country could not feel otherwise. A great, powerful, wealthy nation ought to care about the victims of child abuse, or fraud, and victims of all crime. That is not the issue. The issue, I say to my friends, is the legacy we leave to the next generation. So much of that legacy as Senators is what is in the Constitution.  We will not vote on anything more important than constitutional amendments, unless it is a declaration of war. There have been thousands of votes I have cast, and many that I can remember were inconsequential. Virtually all of them were on issues on which, if we did not like the results we could come back and revisit it the next Congress and change it. You cannot do that with a constitutional amendment. You do it with practical, pragmatic legislation that actually helps people--legislation that the Senator from Delaware has passed, legislation that I have passed, legislation that Senators on both sides of the aisle have passed, including Senators Nickles, DeWine, and others. I do not mean to exclude other people who have joined in on real legislation that really works for victims.  Mr. President, how much time is still available to the Senator from Vermont?  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Helms). There are 48 minutes remaining.
