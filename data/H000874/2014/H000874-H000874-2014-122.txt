I also understand that the chairman of the Financial Services Committee is opposed to the Export-Import Bank. He has said that publicly.  So I would hope, at some point in time, again, that the majority of the House could work its will because I do not believe that the chairman of the Financial Services Committee represents the majority of this House in this instance.  Therefore, I am hopeful that we can move forward and that I can work with the majority leader's office, as we did with the last authorization, to reach that objective.  Mr. Speaker, unless the majority leader asks me to yield, I yield back the balance of my time.                          ____________________
