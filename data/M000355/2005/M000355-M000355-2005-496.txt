 President, I ask the Senate to pause for a moment today in loving memory and honor of Sergeant Darrin Keith Potter.  Sergeant Potter of Louisville, KY, served with the 223rd Military Police Company in the Kentucky Army National Guard. On September 29, 2003, he gave his life in defense of our country in the vicinity of Baghdad, Iraq.  On that day in September, nearly 2 years ago, Sergeant Potter and two of his fellow soldiers were responding to reports of lethal bombing attacks by terrorists near a prison facility. His MP team tried to drive around a tight corner in a Humvee, but overturned into a canal.  Although his teammates escaped the vehicle safely, sadly, Sergeant Potter did not, and drowned. He had faithfully served his nation as a citizen-soldier for 5 years. He was 24 years old.  For his valorous service, Sergeant Potter was awarded the Bronze Star Medal and the Purple Heart. He was awarded the Kentucky Distinguished Service Medal, which is the second highest honor that the Commonwealthof Kentucky can bestow. He had also received both the Army Reserve Component Achievement Medal and the Army Achievement Medal numerous times in his years of service.  Sergeant Potter's aspiration to defend others dates back to his formative years, when he dreamed of one day becoming a police officer. While a student at Butler High School, in Louisville, he joined the Jefferson County Police Explorers, a program for boys and girls interested in a law enforcement career.
