 President, I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 1240, the Sexual Crimes Against Children Prevention Act of 1995. H.R. 1240 seeks to enhance prison time as well as fines for child pornographers who use computers to trade in child pornography. I believe that this penalty enhancement is an important measure and the Grassley-Hatch-Thurmond amendment merely clarifies what the House intended to do in order to remove any possible confusion in the future.  Computers are now the preferred business forum for child pornographers. Due to modern technology, predatory pedophiles sell, purchase and swap the most vile depictions of children engaged in the most outrageous types of sexual conduct.  Simply put, child pornography on computers is dangerous and must be stopped. In the past, whenever, State or Federal law enforcement agents arrested a child pornographer, or ring of child pornographers, they seized and then destroyed the child pornography. This kept child pornography out of the hands of child molesters and preserved the privacy of the children who had been so callously exploited. But now, because of digital computer technology, it is nearly impossible to actually destroy child pornography. That means there will be more child pornography for child molesters and less privacy for abused children. We in Congress must do something.  H.R. 1240 and the Grassley-Hatch-Thurmond amendment would discourage child pornographers from using computers to trade in child pornography. And when the U.S. Sentencing Commission reports to us this fall on how computer child pornographers are being punished, I will take a close look to see if there is anything the Senate can do to provide even more protection to children.
