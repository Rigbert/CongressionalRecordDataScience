 Mr. President, my amendment would raise the end strength of the U.S. Army by 10,000 soldiers. It is fully paid for this year through the Iraqi freedom fund.  In the process of rebuilding Iraq, we have to be very careful not to demolish our Army. It is stretched thin across the globe, with 320,000 soldiers in over 120 countries.
