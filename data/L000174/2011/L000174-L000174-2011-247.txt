President, today, I joined Senator Cornyn in reintroducing the Faster FOIA Act of 2011, a bipartisan bill to strengthen the Freedom of Information Act, FOIA. Last week, the House Republican leadership stripped these FOIA provisions from legislation that unanimously passed the Senate in May as part of a procedural maneuver to address unrelated issues surrounding the debt limit. I urge the Senate to promptly reaffirm its bipartisan commitment to open government and to once again pass the Leahy-Cornyn Faster FOIA Act of 2011 so that this good government bill can be enacted into law.  The Faster FOIA Act enjoys broad bipartisan support from across the political spectrum. The Senate unanimously passed this bill in May, after the Judiciary Committee favorably reported the bill by voice vote. Recently, more than 35 transparency organizations urged the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to act on this legislation. On July 26, the Washington Post editorialized that the House should promptly enact this bipartisan bill to improve the FOIA process.  Senator Cornyn and I first introduced the Faster FOIA Act in 2005 to address the growing problem of excessive FOIA delays within our Federal agencies. During the intervening years, the problem of excessive FOIA delays has not gone away. We reintroduced this bill in 2010, and the Senate unanimously passed it last year. The current bill is the most recent product of our bipartisan work to help reinvigorate FOIA.  The Faster FOIA Act would establish a bipartisan Commission on Freedom of Information Act Processing Delays to examine the root causes of excessive FOIA delays. The Commission would recommend to Congress and the President steps that should be taken to reduce these delays so that the administration of the FOIA is more equitable and efficient.  The Faster FOIA Act will help ensure the dissemination of government information to the American people so that our Democracy remains vibrant and free. This is a laudable goal that we all share. Neither Chamber of Congress should allow partisan politics to obstruct the important goal of this bill.  The ongoing debate in Congress about the national debt has made clear that we must find ways to work together, across party lines and ideologies, to address the many challenges facing our Nation. This bipartisan spirit is at the core of the Faster FOIA Act. I have said many times that open government is neither a Democratic issue nor a Republican issue it is truly an American value and virtue that we all must uphold. I urge the Senate to promptly pass this bill and I hope that the House of Representatives will quickly follow suit and enact this good government measure.  I ask unanimous consent that the Washington Post editorial entitled: ``Time to Reinforce FOIA'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, July 26, 2011]                Freedom of Information Act Needs a Push       This year marks the 45th anniversary of the Freedom of      Information Act, FOIA, a crucial, if sometimes sluggish,      vehicle through which journalists can demand greater      government openness and accountability. In May, in a rare      moment of bipartisanship, Sens. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and      John Cornyn (R-Tex.) won unanimous Senate passage of the      Faster FOIA Act, which would establish an advisory panel to      examine the backlog of more than 69,000 FOIA requests. It's      time for the House to take it up.       While the panel would be authorized only to provide      Congress with recommendations for further action to enhance      the filing and receipt of FOIA requests, it would be a small      step forward. At best, the panel could develop the means to      enforce the 20-day standard for the screening of requests,      which, in reality, can take months or years.       As much as FOIA can be a journalist's best friend, it can      also be a nightmare. Despite amendments in 2007 and 2009, the      FOIA process remains beset by incompetence and lack of      guidance for evaluating requests. ``The overarching problem      is inadequate implementation and compliance among the      agencies,'' Malcolm Byrne, deputy director at the National      Security Archive, told us.       Despite a 2009 executive order that instructed all federal      agencies to open more documents to the public--to err on the      side of openness when deciding whether to release documents--     government offices have classified more documents since      President Obama took office, according to the Federation of      American Scientists.       The executive order tried to force all federal agencies to      implement new regulations to ensure greater transparency in      the disclosure process. But this hasn't happened, either. A      report by the Information Security Oversight Office in April      found that less than half of 41 evaluated agencies had made      significant efforts toward this end.       These facts should reinforce the need for progress, however      modest, when it comes to improving the FOIA process. While      there was no opposition to the Faster FOIA legislation in the      Senate, Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), chairman of the House      Oversight and Government Reform Committee, has yet to take a      position on the bill, according to a spokesman. We urge him      to embrace it in the same bipartisan spirit as the Senate,      and to do so immediately.
