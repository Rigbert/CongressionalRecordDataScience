The members and friends of the post and its auxiliary commemorated the milestone during the annual Genoa Homecoming Festival Parade along with hundreds of others celebrating this major community event.  The Genoa American Legion has been an anchor in its community since the early days of the last century. Through the decades it has provided a sanctuary and camaraderie to veterans returning from service as its members have worked to move the community and our nation forward. Its civic efforts include public works, while the post has also provided individual assistance in numerous ways to many.  Following in the tradition of the American Legion since its national founding, members of the Genoa Post have been among the ``keepers of the flame'' honoring the sacrifice of the victims of combat while teaching the next generations of their place in history. The American Legion ensures we ``will never forget'' and focuses attention on the needs of our nation's veterans and their service for freedom's cause.  The Genoa American Legion Auxiliary kept ``the home fires burning'' making significant contributions to the community and nation on our own soil. When veterans return from service, the Auxiliary is there to support and pay special attention to the families' needs. The Legion and its Auxiliary are hand-in-hand in a strong partnership in service to country. Together, these members will continue to meet the needs of veterans and the community of Genoa on their journey toward their centennial. Godspeed.                          ____________________
