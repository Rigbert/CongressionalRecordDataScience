President, I am not really surprised at this man's many accomplishments. Several years ago, our distinguished majority leader, Senator Lott, took an overdue codel to Latin and Central America. I was privileged to go. On one of our first stops, we were briefed on the overall situation, again within the 32-nation sprawling Southern Command. Pressed for time, General Charles Wilhelm gave one of the most complete, pertinent, and helpful briefings I have ever heard. I have been a Wilhelm fan ever since, and I certainly value his advice and his suggestions.  General Wilhelm stated our vital national security interests very well when he said the following:       I see our future prosperity in the Americas, not in the Far      East. . . . Forty-six percent of our exports flow within the      Americas, 28 percent to the Far East and 26 percent to      Europe. I see the balance shifting even more to the Americas      over the first 25 years of this century. The future      prosperity of the United States is linked to the Americas.  Throughout his career as a United States Marine, General Charles Wilhelm demonstrated uncompromising character, discerning wisdom, and a sincere, selfless sense of duty to his Marines and members of other services assigned to his numerous joint commands.  His powerful leadership inspired his Marines to success, no matter what the task. All Marines everywhere join me in saying to the general: Thank youand well done. The results have guaranteed United States security in this hemisphere and throughout the world.  In behalf of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, our congratulations to him and to his wife Valerie and his son Elliot on the completion of a long and distinguished career, and I trust more to come. God bless this great American and Marine. Semper Fi, General, Semper Fi.                          ____________________
