Reclaiming my time just briefly, and then I will be happy.  As my colleagues know, the charges are that she was planning on blowing up the Peruvian Congress. Now I do not know if that is true or not, but we know how seriously we take those acts of violence that are committed on our own Congress, killing of our two policemen which we so rightfully honored yesterday.  This lady may be completely innocent. What she deserves is a fair trial, not a de facto exoneration by the Congress or the House of Representatives of the United States, and I think we err seriously if we make a decision not knowing, and Members will be walking in that door voting based on a handout in some cases or just a scintilla of knowledge. We need to know the real facts which are voluminous about this case.
