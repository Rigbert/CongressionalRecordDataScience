There is no balanced budget amendment in this legislation. There is a big dollop of legislative legerdemain and blackmail. It simply says that the Republicans will drive the country to default unless Congress later passes their right-wing version of a balanced budget amendment that requires an impossible two-thirds vote to close the most egregious tax loophole, the same loopholes that the gentleman from Wisconsin purports to want to close.  With apologies to Lewis Carroll, ``There's no use trying,'' said Alice. ``One can't believe imaginary things.''  ``I dare say you haven't had much practice,'' said the Queen. ``When I was your age I did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I believed as many as six imaginary things before breakfast,'' or in this case, before dinner and cocktails at the Republican Club.
