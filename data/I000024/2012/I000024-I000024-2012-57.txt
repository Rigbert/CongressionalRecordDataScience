President, when we came back to session this week, I was pleased to see a very good friend of mine on the floor, of a completely different philosophy from mine and a different background and a different State, talking about--being somewhat critical of my position on global warming, which everybody knows I have been involved in for some 12 years since the Koyoto treaty, which was never before us.  Nonetheless, I appreciated the fact that we had a chance to resurrect that issue because, to my knowledge, nobody has uttered the term ``global warming'' since 2009. It has been completely refuted in most areas. But I was pleased to hear my good friend from Vermont talking about it because he and I have a very honest relationship with each other but a total disagreement. We are able to go over those things.  Then again today two things happened. First of all, we had the senior Senator from Massachusetts come down to the floor and was somewhat quite critical of me and anyone who is a skeptic. I think it is important to realize that to understand--so you understand, when we are talking, what we are referring to.  Those people who believe the world is coming to an end because of global warming and that is all due to manmade anthropogenic gases, we call those people alarmists. Those people such as myself who have looked at it very carefully and have come to the conclusion that is not happening and the fact or the assertion that global warming is occurring today and it is occurring because of the release of CO2 and anthropogenic gases, methane, and such as that, it is a hoax, which I said way back in 2003. This became quite a charge to a lot of people, a hoax that--the fact that all of this is happening is due to manmade gases. I believe it is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.  As a result of that, a lot of people are trying to do things to this country that are detrimental. By the way, we also had this morning--it was enjoyable. This is the first time since 2009 that the Environment and Public Works Committee has had a hearing on global warming, on the science or lack of science behind global warming.  I was delighted to see all these things resurrected. I know it is not proper to talk about your own books on the floor, and I do not do it, except I have to do it because it was mentioned by some of my adversaries, my book which was called ``The Greatest Hoax.'' Things were taken out of this book so I had to defend them. Let me just mention, if I can in this fairly short period of time that I have, I think it is only 30 minutes, some of the things that were stated, first of all, on the floor by the senior Senator from Massachusetts and then make some comments about the hearing this morning.  In fact, I am glad it is coming to the surface again. First of all, I was referred to as a ``skeptic.'' I mentioned just now that skeptics are those who do not believe what I referred to as the hoax. He referred to us as ``flat earthers.'' I learned a long time ago that if they do not have logic on their side, they do not have the science on their side, they respond with name calling. I have been called a lot of names. Let me just name a few. This comes right out of the book and some of the things that were said this morning. The ``noisiest climate skeptic,'' ``the Senate's resident denier bunny,'' ``traitor,'' ``dumb,'' ``crazy man,'' ``science abuser,'' ``Holocaust denier,'' ``villain of the month,'' ``hate filled,'' ``war mongering,'' ``Neanderthal,'' ``Genghis Khan''. It goes on and on. I will submit this for the Record.  But quite often we hear these things, it is only because there is not logic or science on their side. So they do name calling, which is fine. To me, that gets attention, and it needs to have the attention. The second thing, one of the other things that came out this morning, the statement was made by the senior Senator from Massachusetts, and I am quoting now, I believe: There are 6,000 peer-reviewed studies that say that no one peer-reviewed study that proves it is not happening.  There is not one, not one peer-reviewed study. A peer-reviewed study is a study that is published and then the peers review it. I think that is a process that is necessary. Consequently, that statement was made. That statement just flat is not right. In fact, let me go ahead and talk about some of these studies. If we look at the Harvard-Smithsonian study, that was a study which examined the results of more than 240 peer-reviewed papers published by thousands of researchers over the past four decades.  The study covers a multitude of geophysical and biological climate indicators. They came to the conclusion--this is a Harvard-Smithsonian peer-reviewed study. They came to the conclusion that climate change is not real, that the science is not accurate.  Dr. Fred Seitz. Dr. Fred Seitz is a former president of the National Academy of Science. He said: ``There is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane or other greenhouse gasses is causing or will in the foreseeable futurecause catastrophic heating of the earth's atmosphere and disruption of the earth's climate.''  I would like to pause at this moment, because I see the majority leader on the floor of the Senate, and inquire if they care to have some leadership time. I would be very glad to yield to them that time. Apparently, that is not the case.  Thirdly, this is something that happened very recently. One of the universities, George Mason University, surveyed 430 weathercasters and found that only 19 percent of the weathercasters felt catastrophic global warming is taking place and is a result of human activity.  That is quite a change from what it used to be. That means 81 percent of those weathercasters that we all see every night are saying that is not true.  Dr. Robert Laughlin, a Nobel Prize-winning Stanford University physicist, said:       Please remain calm. The earth will heal itself. Climate is      beyond our power to control. The earth doesn't care about      government and legislation. Climate change is a matter of      geologic time, something the earth does on its own without      asking anyone's permission or explaining itself.  I think the statement is certainly not an accurate statement that was made this morning. By the way, in terms of the climate change, I would like to suggest there is a Web site called Climate Depot by Marc Morano. In this, we can find multitudes of peer-reviewed studies. There is not time to go over them all, but we certainly can find them on that particular Web site.  Another statement made by the senior Senator from Massachusetts this morning was when they were talking about a former climate skeptic, Richard Muller, M-u-l-l-e-r. He changed his mind through extensive research, implying he at one time was a skeptic and he is now an alarmist. Let me tell you about Richard Muller. In 2008 Richard Muller said that the bottom line is that there is a consensus. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--we will talk about that later. The President needs to know what the IPCC says. Second, they say that most of the warming of the last 50 years is probably due to humans. You need to know that this is from carbon dioxide and that you need to know the understanding of the technology.  Mr. President, I was talking about and responding to the speech made on the floor this morning by the senior Senator from Massachusetts.  I think the main thing I got across at that time was the assertion that was made that there are 6,000 peer-reviewed studies that say not one peer-reviewed study proves that global warming is not happening and that anthropogenic gases would be the cause of it. I know it wasn't the intention of the senior Senator from Massachusetts to say something that was factually wrong, but I did read several peer-reviewed studies and referred to the Web site climatedepot.com, if anyone is interested in that.  Second is the fact that the Senator from Massachusetts--and then again in the hearing this morning, Richard Muller was referred to several times as being a former skeptic who converted over to an alarmist. I suggested--and I read something to show that, in my opinion, he never was a skeptic. I would like to make some comments about Richard Muller.  If you go to my Web site, you will find about 1,000 scientists who have come around and said: No, this assertion that we are having catastrophic global warming due to anthropogenic, manmade gases is not correct. Muller is not on that list. However, when they say that he is the one and made such a big issue, I will quote a couple people about their expressing themselves on the credibility of Richard Muller.  Professor Judith Curry, a climatologist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, stated ``way over-simplistic and not at all convincing, in my opinion.'' She was talking about the comments by Muller. She also said, ``I don't see that their paper adds anything to our understanding of the causes of the recent warming.'' That is on the paper submitted by Richard Muller.  Roger Peilke, Jr., said that the ``bigger issue is how the New York Times let itself be conned into running [Muller's] op-ed.''  Michael Mann is the guy who started this whole thing at the U.N., putting it together. He had the hockey stick thing that has been totally discredited. He said:       It seems, in the end--quite sadly--that this is all really      about Richard Muller's self-aggrandizement.  So much for the statements that were made to give credibility to their side by Richard Muller.  I think another thing that was stated this morning was we have evidence of climate change all around--wildfires, drought and vegetation, and all that type. Then they talked about glaciers. Well, let me just share the facts about that, which I think are very significant, as far as the droughts and all that are concerned. Again, this is a statement made by the senior Senator from Massachusetts this morning, talking about all these things that are happening as a result of global warming.  Well, hurricanes, according to NOAA, have been on the decline in the United States since the beginning of records in the 19th century. The worst decade for major--category 3, 4, and 5--hurricanes was in the 1940s.  To quote the Geophysical Research Letters:       Since 2006, global tropical cyclone energy has decreased      dramatically . . . to the lowest levels since the late 1970s.      Global frequency of tropical cyclones has reached a historic      low.  So just the opposite.  On tornadoes, NOAA scientists reject a global warming link to tornadoes. To quote them:       No scientific consensus or connection between global      warming or tornado activity.  Droughts. The Senator talked about droughts this morning. Reading from this article, the headline is ``Scientist disagrees with Obama on cause of Texas drought:'' and to quote Dr. Robert Hoerling, a NOAA research meteorologist, ``This is not a climate change drought.''  They further said severe drought in 1934 covered 80 percent of the country compared to only 25 percent in 2011.  The statements that were made about the Arctic and about Greenland this morning, if you look at a November 2007 peer-reviewed--and I stress peer-reviewed--study, conducted by a team of NASA and university experts, it found cyclical changes in ocean currents impacting the Arctic. The excerpt from this peer-reviewed study by NASA says:       Our study confirms that many changes seen in upper Arctic      Ocean circulation in the 1990s were mostly decadal in nature,      rather than trends caused by global warming.  And 2011 sees 9,000 Manhattans of Arctic ice recovery since the low point in 2007.  Let me explain what that means. When we talk about the Manhattan Arctic recovery, they use Manhattan because that is something people can identify with, and then they relate that to the recovery of ice. In this case--this is, again, from NASA. In 2011, there were 9,000 Manhattans of Arctic ice recovery since the low point in 2007. Now, this study was 2011. So that means the low point was actually below that, and it has been decreasing since that time.  Now, that was the Arctic. In the Antarctic there is a 2008 peer-reviewed paper in the American Geophysical Union, and it found a doubling in snow accumulation in the western Antarctic Peninsula since 1850. In a paper published in the October Journal of Climate Examples, the trend of sea ice extends along the east Antarctic coast from 2000 to 2008 and finds a significant increase of 1.43 percent per year.  Let's talk about Greenland. And I will always remember when I had occasion--well, one of the things I have been interested in is aviation. I have been an active pilot for, I guess, 60 years now. The occupier of the chair is fully aware of this because he and I together were able to pass the pilots' bill of rights, so for the first time an accused pilot has access to the judicial system. But as the occupier of the chair is fully aware, I had occasion to fly an airplane around the world one time, emulating the flight of Wiley Post when he went around the world. It is an exciting thing, but it is one of those things where you feel you are glad you did it, but you never want to do it again. It was kind of miserable at times.  Anyway, I remember coming across Greenland, following Wiley Post, and starting in the United States, going up to Canada, then Greenland, to Iceland,back to western Europe, and then across Siberia. But in Greenland they are still talking up there about what it used to be like in Greenland. They had gone through this melting period where everyone up there was growing things. They were ecstatic up there, talking about the great old times. Then, of course, the cold spell came along, and it got much colder and it was much worse.  Now, the IPCC, in 2001, covered this. They said that to melt the Greenland ice sheet would require temperatures to rise by 5\1/2\ degrees Celsius and remain for 1,000 years. The ice sheet is growing 2 inches a year. So that is Greenland, and they were just talking about Greenland this morning. In fact, they talked about it during this hearing too.  Let me mention this IPCC and remind everyone of something that people tend to forget. The IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It was put together by the United Nations a long time ago. It all started in 1992 down in Rio de Janeiro. They had their big gathering down there to try to encourage everyone to pass the Kyoto Treaty. The treaty was never even submitted by the Clinton-Gore administration, although Gore went to this big meeting in Rio de Janeiro. They had a wonderful time down there. At that time they were all saying the world is coming to an end so we have to pass the Kyoto Treaty to stop all that. Well, that is the IPCC that I have been very critical of because that is the science on which all of these things are based that we are dealing with today.  So much for these things that were stated in terms of the disasters and the droughts and all of these problems. The next thing he talked about--and I have already talked about Greenland--is he talked about it is going to be necessary to have carbon caps. I think we talked about that this morning. Right now, there are those people who are advocating cap and trade--a very complex, difficult thing to explain--which is essentially requiring a cap on carbon emissions and then trading these emissions back and forth. That is something they do not talk about anymore because that has been completely discredited. Now they are talking about a carbon tax, and I think that was mentioned this morning.  Quoting the Senator from Massachusetts this morning once again:       The avoidance of responsibility has to stop. We have been      waiting for 20 years now while other countries, including      China, are stealing our opportunities.  Let's put up that chart. Let's talk a little about China. You know China is the great beneficiary of anything we do here to put caps on carbon because they are the ones that are doing it. So they say China is making great strides in reducing their carbon emissions. Well, look at this. The green line there is China. This is in emissions--billions of tons of emissions. It starts down at 2, a little over 2, which was in 1990, and it was fairly low until 2002.  Look at what has happened. It has doubled in tons of emissions. China has actually doubled in that period of time, from 2002 to 2012--a 10-year period.  At the same time, we have actually reduced our emissions--both the United States and the European Union. To suggest that China is sitting back there waiting for us to provide the leadership for them to destroy their economy is pretty outrageous.  By the way, the other statement that has been made in the past, not just by the Senator to whom I have referred but several others, is that we are not going to be able to solve the problem and to do something about our reliance upon the Middle East just by developing our own resources. That is wrong.  There is a guy named Harold Hamm, who is now the authority, and he has actually had more successful production in tight formations. He happens to be from my State of Oklahoma. I called him up before a speech or a debate I was involved in probably 6 months ago, and I said to Harold Hamm: You know, if we were to open up the United States--now, granted, there has been a surge in the production in this country, in the recovery, but that is all in private lands; none in public lands because we have had a reduction in public lands.  The Obama administration has said over and over and over--and I guess if you say something wrong enough times people will believe it--that even if we open these public lands it would take 10 years before that would arrive at the pumps.  So I asked Harold Hamm, and I said: You are going to have to give me something you can document, but if we were to set up in New Mexico, for example, where you are precluded on public lands from drilling, and you put up your operation, how long would it take you to bring up the oil and actually go through the whole refinery process and get it to the pump to get the supply there so we can bring down the price of oil, of gas, at the pumps? He said: Seventy days. He didn't hesitate.  I said: Seventy days? They said it would take 10 years.  He said: No. He said: It would take 30 days to go down and lift it up--60 days before you hit the surface, and in preparation of sending it to a refinery, then in 10 days you get it to the refinery and to the pumps.  Well, I am just saying there is this whole idea we have to rely on some kind of green energy that has not even been developed yet in terms of technology and ration what we have in this country. I mean, this Obama administration has had a war on fossil fuels since before he was elected President of the United States. He wants to kill fossil fuels. We all know that. And I am not going to quote all the people in his administration who say we are going to have to raise the price at the pumps to be comparable to Central Europe before people will be weaned off of fossil fuel because I think people know that now.  This morning was kind of interesting. We had a hearing this morning, and one of the witnesses was a Dr. Christopher Field. He was a witness for the other side, and he made a lot of statements. It was kind of interesting because there is an article that was sent out, written by Roger Pielke, Jr., who is from the University of Colorado at Boulder, and he was actually on the IPCC at one time. But he is one of the authorities who disagrees with me, and he talked about how wrong Dr. Field was.  Now, this is what Field said, first of all:       As the U.S. copes with the aftermath of last year's record-     breaking series of $14 billion climate-related disasters and      this year's massive wildfires and storms, it is critical to      understand that the link between climate change and the kinds      of extremes that lead to disasters is clear.  Well, what did Roger Pielke say this morning? He said:       Field's assertion that the link between climate change and      disaster ``is clear,'' which he supported with reference to      U.S. ``billion dollar'' economic losses, is in reality      scientifically unsupported by the IPCC. Period.  That was the response to the assertion made this morning.  Another assertion made this morning by Field was:       The report identified some areas where droughts have become      longer and more intense (including southern Europe and west      Africa), but others where droughts have become less frequent,      less intent or shorter.  This is what was said in response to that. Again, this is Dr. Roger Pielke, Jr., just today. This is in today's paper he published.       Field conveniently neglected in his testimony to mention      that one place where droughts have gotten less frequent, less      intense or shorter is . . . the United States. Why did he      fail to mention this region, surely of interest to U.S.      Senators. . . .  Myself included--that were on the panel?  The third thing he mentioned on NOAA's billion-dollar disasters; Field said:       The U.S. experienced 14 billion-dollar disasters in 2011, a      record that far surpasses the previous maximum of 9.  Field says nothing about the serious issues with NOAA's tabulation. The billion-dollar disaster memo is a PR train wreck, not peer-reviewed, and is counter to the actual science summarized in the IPCC. Again, this is Dr. Pielke, Jr., who disagrees with me on this, but he said he is tired of people saying things that are not true.  I ask unanimous consent to include his entire statement in the Record because he goes over point after point and discredits everything that was said by this witness--whose name is Christopher Field--this morning.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Roger Pielke Jr IPCC Lead Author Misleads US Congress       The politicization of climate science is so complete that      the lead author of the IPCC's Working Group II on climate      impacts feels comfortable presenting testimony to the US      Congress that fundamentally misrepresents what the IPCC has      concluded. I am referring to testimony given today by      Christopher Field, a professor at Stanford, to the US Senate.       This is not a particularly nuanced or complex issue. What      Field says the IPCC says is blantantly wrong, often 180      degrees wrong. It is one thing to disagree about scientific      questions, but it is altogether different to fundamentally      misrepresent an IPCC report to the US Congress. Below are      five instances in which Field's testimony today completely      and unambiguously misrepresented IPCC findings to the Senate.       1. On the economic costs of disasters:       Field: ``As the US copes with the aftermath of last year's      record-breaking series of 14 billion-dollar climate-related      disasters and this year's massive wildfires and storms, it is      critical to understand that the link between climate change      and the kinds of extremes that lead to disasters is clear.''       Field's assertion that the link between climate change and      disasters ``is clear,'' which he supported with reference to      US ``billion dollar'' economic losses, is in reality      scientifically unsupported by the IPCC. Period. There is good      reason for this--it is what the science says. Why fail to      report to Congress the IPCC's most fundamental finding and      indicate something quite the opposite?       2. On US droughts:       Field: ``The report identified some areas where droughts      have become longer and more intense (including southern      Europe and West Africa), but others where droughts have      become less frequent, less intense, or shorter.''       What the IPCC actually said: . . . in some regions droughts      have become less frequent, less intense, or shorter, for      example, central North America. . .''       Field conveniently neglected in his testimony to mention      that one place where droughts have gotten less frequent, less      intense or shorter is . . . the United States. Why did he      fail to mention this region, surely of interest to US      Senators, but did include Europe and West Africa?       3. On NOAA's billion dollar disasters:,       Field: ``The US experienced 14 billion-dollar disasters in      2011, a record that far surpasses the previous maximum of      9.''       What NOAA actually says about its series of ``billion      dollar'' disasters: ``Caution should be used in interpreting      any trends based on this [data] for a variety of reasons''       Field says nothing about the serious issues with NOAA's      tabulation. The billion dollar disaster meme is a PR train      wreck, not peer reviewed and is counter to the actual science      summarized in the IPCC. So why mention it?       4. On attributing billion dollar disasters to climate      change, case of hurricanes and tornadoes:       Field: ``For several of these categories of disasters, the      strength of any linkage to climate change, if there is one,      is not known. Specifically, the IPCC (IPCC 2012) did not      identify a trend or express confidence in projections      concerning tornadoes and other small-area events. The      evidence on hurricanes is mixed.''       What the IPCC actually said: ``The statement about the      absence of trends in impacts attributable to natural or      anthropogenic climate change holds for tropical and      extratropical storms and tornados''       Hurricanes are, of course, tropical cyclones. Far from      evidence being ``mixed'' the IPCC was unable to attribute any      trend in tropical cyclone disasters to climate change      (anywhere in the world and globally overall). In fact, there      has been no trend in US hurricane frequency or intensity over      a century or more, and the US is currently experiencing the      longest period with no intense hurricane landfalls ever seen.      Field fails to report any this and invents something      different. Why present testimony so easily refuted? (He did      get tornadoes right!)       5. On attributing billion dollar disasters to climate      change, case of floods and droughts:       Field: ``For other categories of climate and weather      extremes, the pattern is increasingly clear. Climate change      is shifting the risk of hitting an extreme. The IPCC (IPCC      2012) concludes that climate change increases the risk of      heat waves (90% or greater probability), heavy precipitation      (66% or greater probability), and droughts (medium      confidence) for most land areas.''       What the IPCC actually says: ``The absence of an      attributable climate change signal in losses also holds for      flood losses'' and (from above): ``in some regions droughts      have become less frequent, less intense, or shorter, for      example, central North America''       Field fails to explain that no linkage between flood      disasters and climate change has been established. Increasing      precipitation is not the same thing as increasing streamflow,      floods or disasters. In fact, floods may be decreasing      worldwide and are not increasing the US. The fact that      drought has declined in the US means that there is no trend      of rising impacts that can be attributed to climate change.      Yet he implies exactly the opposite. Again, why include such      obvious misrepresentations when they are so easily refuted?       Field is certainly entitled to his (wrong) opinion on the      science of climate change and disasters. However, it utterly      irresponsible to fundamentally misrepresent the conclusions      of the IPCC before the US Congress. He might have explained      why he thought the IPCC was wrong in its conclusions, but it      is foolish to pretend that the body said something other than      what it actually reported. Just like the inconvenient fact      that people are influencing the climate and carbon dioxide is      a main culprit, the science says what the science says.       Field can present such nonsense before Congress because the      politics of climate change are so poisonous that he will be      applauded for his misrepresentations by many, including some      scientists. Undoubtedly, I will be attacked for pointing out      his obvious misrepresentations. Neither response changes the      basic facts here. Such is the sorry state of climate science      today.
