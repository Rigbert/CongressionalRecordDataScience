 President, I rise today to reiterate my steadfast and unwavering support for Amtrak.  I believe that President Bush, Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta, Amtrak President David Gunn, and the Congress need to work together immediately to prevent our passenger rail system from grinding to a halt and stranding millions of commuters coast to coast.  Amtrak's passenger rail service is an essential link in our transportation system and our economy.  Every day Americans use Amtrak and local commuter rail systems thatdepend on Amtrak to get to and from work. And as we approach the July Fourth holiday, more and more Americans are relying on Amtrak trains for their vacation travel, especially this year because of security changes at our Nation's airports.  I cannot think of a worse time for Amtrak to have run out of money and I find it unconscionable that Members of Congress and the President are not unified to see that our trains continue to run.  What will happen if Amtrak shuts down? You can be sure the roads will jam up even more and air travel will become an even greater headache.  I agree with Secretary Mineta when he said Monday night that the burden is not on President Bush alone to save the rail system from bankruptcy. However, it is important to point out that President Bush alone can keep Amtrak out of bankruptcy by announcing today that he will approve the company's application for a $200 million loan guaranty and support an additional appropriation of $200 million in the supplemental appropriations bill that is now in conference negotiations.  Here is how I believe we must respond to the current situation. First, I believe the $200 million emergency loan guaranty that Amtrak needs to keep the trains running must be approved immediately. This $200 million will allow Amtrak to again find private financing that has dried up over the past several months because of the company's deteriorating financial condition.  Second, the members of the conference committee on the supplemental appropriations bill are trying to include a $200 million emergency appropriation for Amtrak. If this bill can emerge from conference negotiations this week and if the President agrees to sign the legislation, the funds will get to Amtrak before the July Fourth holiday.  Third, I have joined many of my colleagues in a commitment to work for $1.2 billion for Amtrak in fiscal year 2003. This is the amount Amtrak needs and I believe it is the amount Congress should deliver.  I cannot understand why President Bush continues to stand by his paltry budget request of $521 million and threaten to veto the Transportation appropriations bill if more than that amount is provided to Amtrak.  Fourth, I believe the Senate should take up Senator Hollings' legislation to fund Amtrak for the next 5 years. The National Defense Rail Act would authorize $4.6 billion annually from 2003 to 2007 for passenger rail service. The legislation, which passed the Commerce Committee by a vote of 20-3 in April would fund rail security improvements, high speed rail development, and operational costs for existing rail routes.  I believe Congress must take each of these four steps to preserve and improve Amtrak.  I strongly believe that Amtrak is not a failure, it is the government that has failed Amtrak. If we do not properly fund our rail system, how do we expect it to thrive?  Since 1971, when Amtrak was founded, only $25 billion has been spent on passenger rail, compared to over $750 billion that has been invested in highways and aviation. The Federal Government has made a commitment to fund road construction and expand aviation capacity, but we have always come up short to provide fair funding for our rail system.  The Federal Government provided $15 billion in payments and loan guaranties to aid the airlines after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Why can't we provide $200 million to keep our trains running?  Imagine the chaos that will ensue if Amtrak does shutdown this summer. There will be even more traffic on our roads and air travel will slow down if trains are not an option for commuters heading to work or travelers on vacation.  On Monday, Senator Boxer and I wrote President Bush to ask him to approve Amtrak's $200 million loan guaranty. This letter illustrates how important Amtrak is to California and why a shutdown would threaten the State's economy.  As we mention in the letter, last week a transportation think tank declared southern California and the Bay Area as the two urban areas of the country with the longest traffic delays. Californians do not need any more gridlock.  Yet if Amtrak shuts down, thousands of people in California who depend on Amtrak service every day will be stranded. Amtrak trains that travel throughout the State and regional commuter trains could both grid to a halt if the $200 million loan guaranty is not forthcoming.  Since most rail lines in California are run by Amtrak or depend on Amtrak, everything is in jeopardy. These include three Amtrak routes funded by the State and the Federal Government: 1. the Capitol Corridor route between San Jose and Auburn; 2. the San Joaquin route between Oakland and Bakersfield; 3. the Pacific Surfliner route between San Diego and San Luis Obispo.  These are three of the most successful routes in the United States. In fact, all three are among the top five intercity rail corridors and the Pacific Surfliner is the fastest growing route in the nation. Overall the State of California has added 28 new daily trains since 1995 and over 1.5 million new passengers.  But a shutdown will also threaten some of California's largest regional transportation systems including: 1. Caltrain, the rail service between San Francisco and San Jose 2. Metrolink, Southern California's regional transit system 3. The Coaster, San Diego County's regional train.  In fact, on Monday Metrolink passengers in Southern California found these flyers on their seats. The flyer updates commuters on the imminent Amtrak shutdown and tells them to ``explore other commute options.''  This week I also received a letter from the North County Transit District on the impact an Amtrak shutdown will have on San Diego County's Coaster Commuter Rail Service.  It is clear to me that a shutdown of Amtrak will be devastating for rail passengers across the Nation. I believe we must act immediately to avoid it. I urge President Bush to provide a $200 million loan guaranty to prevent a shutdown of Amtrak service in California and the rest of the country.  I ask unanimous consent to print additional material in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                    Washington, DC, June 24, 2002.     Hon. George W. Bush,     President of the United States, The White House, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to urge you to approve a      $200 million federal loan guaranty to allow Amtrak to      continue to operate. Amtrak is extremely important to      California. After New York, California has the second highest      ridership in the country. Without this funding, thousands of      people in California who depend on Amtrak service every day      will be stranded.       Just last week, a respected analyst rated Los Angeles and      San Francisco-Oakland as the two urban areas of the country      with the longest annual delays per rush-hour driver.      Californians have gridlock. Without Amtrak, the 69,000 daily      commuters that use the three Amtrak commuter train systems      will not be able to get to work. These services also have      financial support from the state of California, which spent      $72 million in the state's fiscal year 2002.       Amtrak is important and growing outside the Northeast      Corridor. For example, California has the second most      traveled line in the country: the ``Pacific Surfliner''--from      San Diego to Los Angeles. Amtrak West has increased the daily      number of trains from 36 intercity trains in 1995 to 64      intercity trains in 2001, which is a 78 percent increase. All      but three of these are in California. The number of      passengers has increased by 52 percent and passenger related      revenues have increased by 49 percent during the same period      of time.       We strongly believe that the federal government must      continue to support Amtrak and the partnership with the State      of California for a viable national intercity passenger rail      service. Again, we urge you to provide a $200 million loan      guaranty to prevent a shutdown to Amtrak service in      California and the rest of the country.           Sincerly,     Dianne Feinstein,       United States Senator     Barbara Boxer,       United States Senator                                  ____                                            Metrolink Commuter                                                    June 24, 2002.       Dear Metrolink Commuters: Within the last few weeks, the      nation learned that Amtrak is facing urgent financial      challenges to continue national passenger rail services      through the end of the federal fiscal year (October 2002). As      of June 19, 2002, Amtrak     had not been able to secure a needed $200 million bank loan.      David L. Gunn, the newly appointed Amtrak CEO, testified      before a U.S. Senate Sub-committee on that day that failure      to obtain $200 million in federal loan guarantees or cash by      July 1 would leave him no choice but to begin an orderly      shutdown of rail passenger service nationwide, to place the      company into bankruptcy, and to place the corporation's      assets under a court appointed trustee.       You may be aware that Metrolink dispatchers, locomotive      engineers and conductors are provided under a contract with      Amtrak. Our contract with Amtrak is similar to many other      passenger rail operator contracts with Amtrak throughout the      country. The Metrolink contract, which expires on June 30,      2004, covers all Amtrak costs of providing the 145 Amtrak      employees needed to dispatch trains and to operate      Metrolink's 138 weekday trains and 32 weekend trains.       At this time, we have no additional information as to      exactly how a shutdown of Amtrak passenger rail service would      affect Metrolink. Metrolink sent Amtrak and federal officials      a letter on June 10th stating that no federal subsidies are      used for the Metrolink contract and that there should be no      cash flow concerns for Amtrak by continuing to provide the      contract services. To date, Amtrak has not provided a      response. We have also begun to explore the limited options      we have to try to avoid an interruption in Metrolink services      in case Amtrak is unable or unwilling to meet its contractual      obligations. In order to ensure uninterrupted safe operation      of Metrolink, we need the continued availability of the      existing Amtrak certified and qualified employees.       While we encourage you to purchase your July Metrolink fare      media as usual, you should also explore other commute      options. Should Metrolink services be interrupted we will      reconcile any fare payment issues. We also will provide      updated information through the media, on our website      (www.metrolinktrains.com), and with fax and email updates to      the employee transportation coordinator that participate in      our Corporate Pass Program. You may also call (800) 371-LINK.       We apologize for any inconvenience or uncertainty that this      potential Amtrak action may have. We have hope that Amtrak      and the federal government can secure the needed funding to      avert the crisis.     David Solow, CEO                                  ____     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Building, Room 331, Washington, D.C.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On behalf of the Southern      California Regional Rail Authority, operators of Metrolink, I      am writing to urge your support for an immediate Amtrak loan      guarantee. We contract with Amtrak to provide our commuter      rail service throughout six counties of Southern California.      If bridge funds are not provided to Amtrak, our service is at      risk for shutting down as well.       As you are probably aware, David Gunn, Amtrak's new      president recently announced that Amtrak needs a $200 million      loan guarantee by June 30th from Congress or the company will      have to begin an orderly shutdown of all services. Metrolink      dispatchers, locomotive engineers and conductors are provided      under a contract with Amtrak. Our contract with Amtrak is      similar to many other passenger rail operator contracts with      Amtrak throughout the country. The Metrolink contract, which      expires on June 30, 2004, covers all Amtrak costs of      providing the 145 Amtrak employees needed to dispatch trains      and to operate Metrolink's 138 weekday trains and 32 weekend      trains.       Our commuter rail services are obtained through cost-     reimbursement contracts. This means we are not subsidized by      Amtrak. Nonetheless, Amtrak has been unable to ensure      continued Metrolink commuter rail service. In order to ensure      uninterrupted safe operation of Metrolink, we need the      continued availability of the existing Amtrak certified and      qualified employees.       Metrolink operates in the nation's most congested region.      Shutting down our service will not only impact our      ridership--34,000 daily--but also contribute to increased      peak hour congestion on the highways. Metrolink removes one      lane of traffic during peak hours on the highways we      parallel. Without our service, those lanes will be flooded      again with frustrated drivers.       Please contact President Bush to request his support for      Amtrak's request of $200 million in loan guarantees. We      respectfully urge you to work with Congress to ensure      continued operation of passenger rail and the contract      services upon which Metrolink depends.           Sincerely,                                                      David Solow,     Chief Executive Officer.                                  ____     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing to you on behalf of      the North San Diego County Transit Development Board to      request your support for Amtrak and its provision of NCTD's      ``Coaster'' Commuter Rail Service in San Diego County.       David Gunn, Amtrak's new President, has recently announced      that unless Amtrak receives a $200 million loan guarantee by      the end of this month, the company will have no choice but to      shut down all passenger train services nationwide. NCTD,      along with three other public agencies in California,      contract with Amtrak for the operation of critical commuter      rail and inter-city rail services. Our commuter rail services      are obtained through cost-reimbursement contracts and do not      contribute to the national subsidy requirements for Amtrak's      overall network. Nevertheless, Amtrak has been unable to      provide assurance of continued commuter rail service      operation for the Coaster.       The shutdown of commuter rail service in San Diego County      would severely impact 5,000 Coaster passengers per day, add      significantly to peak hour freeway congestion, and reduce      regional mobility. Due to the complex requirements of      railroad operations, Amtrak's services cannot be readily      replaced overnight if Amtrak shuts its doors.       Please contact the President to request his support for      Amtrak's request for $200 million in loan guarantees, and      work with Congressional leaders to ensure continued operation      of passenger rail and the contract services upon which      Coaster operations depend.           Sincerely,                                                Thomas P. Walters,     Washington Representative.                          ____________________
