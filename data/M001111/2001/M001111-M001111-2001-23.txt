 President, I rise today to share with the Senate and the American people the remarkable work of Dr. Lee Hartwell, a respected scientist in Washington State. Dr. Hartwell was recently awarded the Nobel Prize for his groundbreaking research in cell division and cancer.  I'm especially proud that Dr. Hartwell conducted much of his research at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, where he serves as president and director.  On October 8, 2001, the Nobel Assembly announced that Dr. Hartwell, along with Paul Nurse and Timothy Hunt, has won the 2001 Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine. The award honors Dr. Hartwell's more than 30 years of pioneering work in yeast genetics. Dr. Hartwell's research into cell division has helped scientists throughout the world to better understand cancer and has laid the foundation for future cancer treatments.  Dr. Hartwell leads one of the finest research teams in the world at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. In the past five years, I've worked in Congress to double funding for the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This investment is intended to support the kind of groundbreaking research being conducted at the Research Center. In fact, as a member of the Senate HELP Committee and the Senate Labor, H.H.S. and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I often point to the lifesaving research and care the center provides as an example of why this investment in NIH is so important.  Dr. Hartwell is not just a talented scientist. He is a real champion for cancer patients and their families. During consideration of a Patients' Bill of Rights, Dr. Hartwell often spoke out on behalf of cancer patients and explained the importance of access to clinical trials, which is sometimes the only hope for patients. Thanks to the advocacy of cancer researchers like Dr. Hartwell, the final legislation included this protection for patients.  Dr. Hartwell was born on October 30, 1939 in Los Angeles, California. He earned his Bachelor of Science in 1961 from the California Institute of Technology and his Ph.D in 1964 from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. From 1965-68, he served as Associate Professor at the University of California. In 1968, he joined the faculty of the University of Washington and became a professor of genetics in 1973. In 1997, he became President and Director of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. In 1987, he became a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. He has received numerous honors including: the General Motors Sloan Award (1991), Gairdner Foundation International Award (1992), Genetics Society of America Medal (1994) and the Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award (1998).  Dr. Hartwell will be presented with the award on December 10, 2001, which is the 100th anniversary of the death of Alfred Nobel, after whom the award is named. The Nobel Committee has recognized what we in the Northwest have known for a long time; namely that because of Dr. Hartwell's hard work and dedication, the world is a better place. It is an honor and a distinct pleasure to join with the Nobel Committee in formally recognizing Dr. Lee Hartwell's many accomplishments.                          ____________________
