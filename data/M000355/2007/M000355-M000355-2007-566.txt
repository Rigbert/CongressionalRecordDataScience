 That bill is not yet on the calendar and will be filed sometime this week.  I understand that the pending unanimous consent request is that we turn to a different bill, which has been reported by the Commerce Committee. At this point, I am compelled to object to this unanimous consent request and say to the majority leader, once the 9/11 bill is available and Members have had an opportunity to review the legislation, I will be happy to revisit this consent request. So I, therefore, object.
