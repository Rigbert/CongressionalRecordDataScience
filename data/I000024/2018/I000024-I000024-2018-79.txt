President, I couldn't have said it as well as the Senator from Missouri. This is the John S. McCain reauthorization bill and obviously he is deserving of much more than that.                           Amendment No. 2842  Since we are going to have the votes in just a few minutes--two votes--let me make a couple of comments, and then I will yield to the Senator from Rhode Island. I believe the first vote we are going to have is going to be the Reed amendment, and I do oppose it. This amendment would require congressional authorization for the development of nuclear weapons for one simple reason we already require. Congress is already required to authorize the development of nuclear weapons in each year's authorization and appropriations bill.  The debate is not really about the authorization; it is about the ``Nuclear Posture Review.'' The ``Nuclear Posture Review'' calls for the United States to develop a low-yield nuclear capability, which some in Congress are against. That is fine. That is what this vote is on. We should debate it. We have debated it in the past, certainly in our committee we have, and that is the reason it is on the committee and would have to be taken off on the floor, if that is the desire of the majority of Members. That is not my desire. That is what we did.  The Armed Services Committee considered an amendment to limit low-yield authorization, debate its merits, and voted it down by a bipartisan vote of 16 to 11. There is certainly support for it.  Let's be clear. The purpose of developing the low-yield capability is the same as our entire nuclear enterprise--deterrence. According to the NPR, Russia believes we have a gap in our nuclear capability because we have no low-yield nuclear warheads. As a result, they may perceive that limited nuclear first use, including low-yield weapons, would present the United States with two bad choices in response: escalate or do nothing. Since neither response would be acceptable, Russia may see this as an opportunity to gain strategic advantage through the use of nuclear weapons. We must correct this Russian misconception.  Simply put, the NDAA authorizes the development of low-yield capability to make nuclear use less likely, to preserve and enhance deterrence. That is what this is all about. I heard arguments--and we debated this for many hours in the committee, and it is one that I think we ought to have every capability the Russians have, and of course we will not have that unless we have the low-yield capability. I would hate to have our country in a position where the only choice we have is to do nothing or to use the high-yield equipment that we don't want to use.  I will save my remarks on the next amendment, the Lee amendment, until after this so we can give Senator Reed the opportunity to visit about his amendment.
