 President, I thank my friend from Delaware for his suggestion and giving me a moment here--I am not sure whether he is finished--but to just ask unanimous consent on a matter.                           Order of Procedure  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following leader remarks on Thursday, February 16, there be 10 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to the confirmation vote on Executive Calendar No. 16, Mick Mulvaney to be Director of the Office of Management and Budget, followed by up to 10 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to the cloture vote on Executive Calendar No. 15, the nomination of Scott Pruitt to be Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and if cloture is invoked, time be counted as if invoked at 7 a.m. that day.
