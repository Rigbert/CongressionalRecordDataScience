President, I rise today to introduce the Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act, legislation intended to stimulate private investment in the entrepreneurs who drive our economy. I am very pleased to be joined today by my good friend, the Senator from Georgia, Mr. Cleland, and by the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Roth, in introducing this important legislation. Senators Cleland and Roth both understand the importance of small businesses to our economy and have been tireless advocates on their behalf.  The bill we are introducing today will encourage long-term investment in small and emerging businesses by rewarding individuals who risk investment in such firms. According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small firms account for three-quarters of the Nation's employment growth and almost all of our net new jobs.  Small businesses employ more than 50 percent of all private workers, provide 51 percent of our private sector output, and are responsible for a disproportionate share of innovations. Moreover, small businesses are avenues of opportunity for women and minorities, younger and older workers, and those making the transition from welfare to work.  At the same time, small businesses face unique financing challenges. I know this from my experience serving as the New England Administrator for the Small Business Administration. There are so many small entrepreneurs who have a wonderful idea for an innovative product but simply have great difficulty in getting the financing they need to get that idea off the ground.  Simply put, entrepreneurs need access to more capital to start and expand their businesses. Small businesses that cannot deliver ``dot-com'' rates of return are particularly having trouble raising needed funds. As the Small Business Administration noted earlier this year, ``Adequate financing for rapidly growing firms will be America's greatest economic policy challenge of the new century.''  A recent report by the National Commission on Entrepreneurship presented findings of 18 focus groups with more than 250 entrepreneurs from across the country. According to the report, these entrepreneurs were ``nearly unanimous in identifying difficulties in obtaining seed capital investments.'' That is the early stage financing that helps get a business off the ground.  Moreover, minority-owned small businesses and research-intensive businesses that may take many years to develop a product find raising sufficient capital to be particularly difficult. Consider that it takes, on average, 14 years for a biotechnology company to develop a new pharmaceutical. This promising and growing sector of our economy requires patient capital--and lots of it.  Cheryl Timberlake, the executive director of the Biotechnology Association in my State, recently wrote to endorse the legislation I am introducing today and to reinforce the need to stimulate more investment in biotech firms. Cheryl wrote that:       Many of the Maine biotech companies are still in the      research stage and rely on venture capital to fund their      innovative drug development. Most research-stage biotech      companies do not yet have products on the market. Without a      source of revenue, there are no profits to fund their      business. These companies are dependent on private investors      for most or all of their financial support. [Therefore,      the Biotechnology Association of Maine] believes that the      changes in . . . the Internal Revenue Code [such as you      propose] will enable more small business investment in our      member companies.  I think Cheryl summed up the problem well in Maine. We have a growing and diverse biotechnology sector, but they are having difficulty in finding the kind of financial support that they need to grow.  I also received recently a letter of support from the executive director of the National Commission on Entrepreneurship. He noted that startup companies are ``struggling to find access to equity investments [particularly in the range] between $100,000 and $3 million.''  His letter continues:       So the question becomes: how can we motivate more      individuals with investment capital, who may not have      previous experience with entrepreneurial companies, to invest      in such companies at the ``seed'' or ``early-stage'' level?      The Encouraging investment in Small Business Act, by      increasing the incentives provided by Section 1202 of the      Internal Revenue Code, may well provide one important part of      the answer to this question.  Similarly, the National Federation of Independent Business, our Nation's largest small business group, has also written in support of the legislation that the Senator from Georgia and I are introducing today.  Dan Danner wrote:       Unfortunately, while our nation's current prosperity has      brought unprecedented funds to certain sectors of our      economy, small business entrepreneurs still lack access to      valuable capital needed to start and expand their businesses.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the three letters from which I quoted this morning be printed in the Record, in their entirety.  There being no objection, the letter were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         Biotechnology Association                                                     of Maine,                                     Augusta, ME, August 28, 2000.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     U.S. Senate, Russell Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the Biotechnology      Association of Maine (BAM), a trade organization representing      Maine's biotechnology companies, our affiliated educational      institutions, and the not for profit research organizations.      I am writing to endorse the Encouraging Small Business Act.       In an industry survey conducted by our sister organization      the Center for Innovation in Biotechnology (CIB), the first      most critical challenge to the success of biotechnology firms      in Maine is financing. The incredible pace of new      technological developments create unceasing demands for new      and established companies to remain competitive and grow. All      efforts to stay competitive require investment. Businesses in      Maine involved in biotechnology and life sciences look for      any opportunity to increase their financial footing.       Many of the Maine biotech companies are still in the      research stage and rely on venture capital to fund their      innovative drug development. Most research-stage biotech      companies do not yet have products in the market. Without a      source of revenue, there are no profits to fund their      business. These companies are dependent on private investors      for most or all of their financial support.       BAM believes the changes in Section 1202 of the Internal      Revenue Code, as proposed will enable more small business      investment in our member companies. The changes will enable      private investors to use the Code, as it was intended and      eliminate the duplication and unnecessary provisions that      complicate the process. The key is to encourage investment,      in whatever means possible. It should be recognized that the      Section 1202 has proven useful to small and large companies,      but it frequently burdensome, with difficult accounting      procedures and other unrelated hurdles.       On behalf of the Biotechnology Association of Maine, I      appreciate your continued leadership and thank you for      proposing the Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act.      We look forward to working with you on passage of this      important piece bill. Thank you.           Sincerely yours,                                             Cheryl C. Timberlake,     Executive Director.                                  ____                                               National Commission                                          on Entrepreneurship,                               Washington, DC, September 15, 2000.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Russell Senate Office Building, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I congratulate you on your      introduction of The Encouraging Investment in Small Business      Act of 2000. The bill represents one way that tax policy can      help address the current ``capital gap'' facing emerging      high-growth companies throughout the country, especially in      regions just beginning to build entrepreneurial economies.       The National Commission on Entrepreneurship has just      completed 18 focus groups with 250 entrepreneurs around the      country. We asked these entrepreneurs to tell us what key      external constraints face the start-up and growth of their      companies. Finding qualified people--from entry level to      technical to management employees--was their number one      concern. But also very high on their lists was a growing      ``seed capital'' or ``early-stage capital'' gap.      Entrepreneurial companies are struggling to find access to      equity investments roughly between $100,000 and $3,000,000.       In brief, the ``early stage capital'' problem is this.      Entrepreneurs can cobble together the equity they need up to      about $100,000 through the use of credit cards, second      mortgages, and cash investments from friends and family. And      if they are building a company, say in ``hot'' sectors like      the Internet or biotech, where the dynamics of the industry      require extraordinary amounts of cash early in a firm's life,      they can find venture capital firms to invest a minimum of      three to five million dollars. But if they need less than      $3,000,000 for the near future, investors at that funding      level are very hard to find.       Highly developed entrepreneurial regions provide this      ``early-stage capital'' typically in the form of organized      ``angel'' investor networks. ``Angels'' are usually      previously successful entrepreneurs and other wealthy      investors connected with the entrepreneurial economy in their      regions who regularly and systematically review potential      investments. They then serve either as board members or      mentors to their new investee companies, and prepare them for      a round of venture capital investment or acquisition by      another company or an initial public offering.       Unfortunately, regions just beginning to build      entrepreneurial economies do not yet have these ``angel      networks'' in place. So the question becomes: how can we      motivate more individuals with investment capital, who may      not have previous experience with entrepreneurial companies,      to invest in such companies at the ``seed'' or ``early-     stage'' level?       The Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act, by      increasing the incentives provided by Section 1202 of the      Internal Revenue Code, may well provide one important part of      the answer to this question. While we have not reviewed in      detail all the provisions of your legislation, your bill      takes two important steps in this direction.       First, the bill accounts for post-1993 changes in tax rates      for capital gains of all kinds, by increasing the capital      gains exclusion for investments in small businesses from 50%      to 75%. And second, the bill excludes the gains from these      investments from calculations under the Alternative Minimum      Tax (AMT) provisions of the Code. Combined with the other      provisions of your bill that simplify the use of Section      1202, the tax incentives could well motivate many more      investors to allocate more of their investment dollars to      high-growth entrepreneurial companies. Typically, the      combined investments of several individuals in one such      company would amount to meeting the critical ``seed'' or      ``early stage'' capital needs of that company.       We look forward to working with you as your legislation      moves forward and would be delighted to provide any      additional information about ``angel'' investing and the      growing ``early-stage'' capital gap. To that end, I have      taken the liberty of attaching a copy of one of our bi-weekly      columns that addresses the topic.           Sincerely,                                               Patrick Von Bargen,     Executive Director.                                  ____                             NFIB, The Voice of Small Business                                                   Washington, DC.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the 600,000 members of      the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), I      want to express our support for the Encouraging Investment in      Small Business Act, which you will be introducing in      September.       As you are aware, small businesses are the engines driving      our economy. They constitute 98 percent of all businesses in      America, and they employ almost 60 percent of the workforce.      Additionally, small businesses have created roughly two-     thirds of the net new jobs in the American economy since the      early 1970's.       Unfortunately, while our nation's current prosperity has      brought unprecedented funds to certain sectors of our      economy, small business entrepreneurs still lack the access      to valuable capital needed to start and expand their      businesses.       Your legislation goes along way towards addressing this      problem. By reforming and improving Section 1202 of the      Internal Revenue Code, investors will now have a true      incentive to invest in small businesses. Under current law,      Section 1202 is no longer a viable option in many of the      circumstances it     was originally intended to address. Moreover, Section 1202's      impact will continue to be diluted by a scheduled decrease in      long-term capital gains rates applicable to most stock      purchased after 2000 and the probability that still more      taxpayers will be subject to the extremely complicated and      cumbersome Alternative Minimum Tax. The Encouraging      Investment in Small Business Act would eliminate unnecessary      complexity in Section 1202 and make it a more robust engine      of capital formation for small businesses.       Senator Collins, thank you for your continued support of      small businesses. We look forward to working with you to get      the Encouraging Investment in Small Business Act enacted into      law.           Sincerely,                                                   Dan Danner,                                            Senior Vice President,                                            Federal Public Policy.
