 President, I agree with the remarks of my fellow Senator from Iowa. We need to eliminate the slot rule which is detrimental to the air service for cities in Iowa and throughout the Midwest. But, the elimination of slots does need to be done in the proper way. Otherwise the major carriers will absorb all of the capacity of the airport, not [providing sufficient service for small and medium sized cities. We need to provide for service by new entrant carriers that can provide for real competition on the price of tickets, increased ability to provide for turboprops so our smaller cities can have proper service, and regional jets for improved service to mid sized cities. While I am pleased with the action by the House, I do believe that it is important that the conferees support the content of the original Gorton proposal.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I do agree with the comments of both Senators from Iowa about the need to eliminate the slot rule in two phases at O'Hare. As I stated this morning, I am a supporter of the Gorton slot amendment before its modification by Senator Fitzgerald. I intend to do what I can to have the conference report on the bill contain the provisions of that measure regarding O'Hare which I believe is good policy.  Providing for a 40 month first phase during which regional jets and turboprop aircraft to airports with under two million enplanements, as well as exemption of new entrant carriers, all under the limitations set out in the original amendment would be exempt from the slot rule is crucial. These are key elements of a first phase in the elimination of slots at O'Hare. I will also support the increased service provisions that allow for improved service in conference.
