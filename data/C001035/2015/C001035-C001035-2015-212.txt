President, it doesn't surprise me that there are both Democratic Senators and Republican Senators who are extremely uncomfortable with what the President did last November because it is so outside of the scope of his authority as President that I think that most of my colleagues, in their hearts, on the other side of the aisle must have qualms and misgivings about what the President did. In fact, I would almost guarantee that if a Republican President had exceeded his Executive authority to that degree, there would have been an uproar. So I think this is important in terms of our protecting the checks and balances that our Founding Fathers so wisely incorporated into the Constitution. And I do believe there are even more Senators on the other side who may not have said what they were thinking but who really do have qualms about it even if they agree with the policy.  We need to distinguish between the policy--whether or not some Members agree with the policy; some Members don't--but the question is, Does the President's frustration with Congress's failure to pass immigration reform allow him to unilaterally write the law?  The Senator from Texas is a former Supreme Court justice in Texas, and through the Chair I would pose that question to him.
