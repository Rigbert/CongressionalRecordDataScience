 President, the Senate is now considering the House-passed Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015. We finally have a chance to vote to end ObamaCare's cycle of broken promises and failures with a simple majority vote. I look forward to completing action on this bill this week.                          ____________________
