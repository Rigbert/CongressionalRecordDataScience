Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding me time.  Mr. Speaker, I urge a yes vote on this important human rights resolution. Nine years ago today, the ground of Tiananmen Square was hallowed by the blood of thousands of peaceful democracy advocates. Those Chinese patriots were slaughtered by a communist regime that remains unapologetic for its actions and that continues to deny the truth of what happened. It is repugnant that the President of the United States of America, the country that, foremost of any of the world, ought to bear the standard of freedom and democracy, would meet at the very site with dictators who continue to lie about the murders committed less than a decade ago.                              {time}  1800  This resolution is not anti-China. It is anti-abuse, the abuse that was endured by those democracy activists, that was witnessed by the world via C-SPAN, via CNN and other networks that were there on the scene.  Mr. Speaker, in December of 1996 General Chi Haotian, the Defense Minister of the People's Republic of China and the operational commander of the forces that attacked the pro-democracy demonstrators, was invited to the United States by the Clinton Administration. During his visit, he was given full military honors, a 19-gun salute, visits with several military bases, and a tour of the Sandia Nuclear Laboratory. He even had a personal meeting with President Clinton at the White House.  General Chi said that not a single person, and I quote, not a single person lost his life in Tiananmen Square. He claimed that on June 4, 1989 the People's Liberation Army did nothing more violent than pushing people whom he called hooligans.  The supposed idea behind these official visits such as General Chi's visit and President Clinton's trip to Beijing is to foster mutual understanding. That is just what they say. If we are going to live in the same world with governments run by people like General Chi, the argument goes, we had better get to know each other.  General Chi's big lie about Tiananmen Square certainly helped many Americans understand what he and his government are really like. However, in China the visit by the Butcher of Beijing was a public relations coup. He could not have gotten better press, being feted at the White House and being given all of these honors. Again, this is the man that ordered the killing of those students.  I believe that the process of getting acquainted must be a reciprocal one. In an effort to help General Chi understand that in America it matters whether you tell the truth, my Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights invited him or any other representative of the Chinese Government to appear at a hearing on the Tiananmen massacre. If he could present convincing and compelling evidence that the massacre was really a myth after all, those of us who view the Beijing government and had our views shaped by that massacre would have to admit that we were wrong.  We were prepared to give General Chi an opportunity to substantiate his claim that China has sold no illegal weapons to Iran. Perhaps he could have shown us that there were no persecuted Christians in China, no ethnic and religious persecution in Tibet and Xinjiang, no forced abortions, which are millions per year, women who are literally thrust and brought into these abortion mills, no coerced sterilizations, and no dying rooms for unwanted children. These claims would have all been contrary to the evidence, but in America everyone is given a fair opportunity to be heard.  Unfortunately, General Chi did not respond to our invitation, and the place we had saved for a representative, either he or a member of the government, sat empty during that hearing, at which time we heard from multiple eyewitnesses, including an editor from the People's Daily who recounted the horrors of Tiananmen Square.  In commentary about Tiananmen Square, Mr. Chairman, Nicholas Kristoff of the New York Times, who was in the Square that night, reported, and I quote, ``The troops began shooting. Some people fell to the ground, wounded or dead. Each time the soldiers fired again and more people fell to the ground.''  When he went to the Xiehe hospital, the nearest to the Square, ``it was a bloody mess with hundreds of injured lying on the floors. I saw the bullet holes,'' Nicholas Kristoff goes on to say, ``in the ambulances.''  Jan Wong of the Toronto Globe and Mail, looking down from the balcony at the Peking Hotel, ``watched in horror as the army shot directly into the crowds. People fell with gaping wounds.'' Later, she reported, ``The soldiers strafed ambulances and shot medical workers trying to rescue the wounded.'' ``In all,'' she reported, ``I recorded eight long murderous volleys.'' Dozens died before her very eyes.  This is what Tiananmen Square means to the people of China and to the world. If President Clinton goes there and stands shoulder to shoulder with the very people who ordered the massacre, that gesture will be a thousand times more powerful than any mere words he may exchange with those who mowed down and bayonetted students and democracy activists. It will be the diplomatic equivalent of dancing on the graves of the courageous and innocent victims of Tiananmen square.  Mr. President, for God's sake and for the sake of the people of China and for the sake of everything the U.S. used to and hopefully still stands for, do not mark the ninth anniversary of the murder at Tiananmen Square by celebrating with the murderers at the scene of the crimes.
