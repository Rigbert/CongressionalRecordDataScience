 President, with the end of the Cold War, the threat of a nuclear holocaust between the United States and Russia has largely receded. There remains a real risk, however, that former Soviet weapons of mass destruction or the technology needed to build them will find their way to rogue states, terrorist groups, or even criminal organizations. If such weapons should ever be used, their impact will be catastrophic. It will hardly matter that ``only'' one or two cities have been so hideously slaughtered.  The war against these so-called ``loose nukes'' is as important as any war we have fought. It is a war fought with assistance to states of the former Soviet Union, rather than with armed force. Its battles are the battles against unemployment and lax security. Its fronts are an array of firms and institutes and so-called ``nuclear cities,'' as well as the international frontiers where smugglers try to move sensitive materials to states like Iran, Iraq or Libya.  This is a war that we dare not lose. The Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reports that in December, the chief of Russia's Federal Security Service in the Chelyabinsk region said that employees at one sensitive plant had tried to steal 40 pounds of weapons-usable nuclear material. A month earlier, 3,000 workers at Chelyabinsk-70, a ``nuclear city'' similar to our nuclear weapons design laboratories, had held a protest over unpaid wages. In 1996, the head of that city committed suicide in despair over his inability to pay his personnel.                The Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative  The Clinton Administration recently announced an Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative that will enlarge existing Nunn-Lugar programs by 60 percent for the next five years. The Carnegie Endowment notes correctly that ``this new funding commitment still does not match the threat.'' But the Administration's request for extra funding in the Fiscal Year 2000 budget is desperately needed and merits wholehearted support.  One especially important aspect of the President's package is a major effort to find alternative employment for Russia's biological weapons experts. The microbiologists and other scientists who built the Soviet Union's massive biological warfare establishment are highly expert. They are quite capable of doing research and development that would improve public health in Russia and around the world. But they would be equally capable of assisting rogue states to wreak massive destruction, if we and other countries did not enable them to survive in non-military pursuits.  The United States is taking steps, in other programs, to better prepare for the awful possibility of a terrorist attack with chemical or biological weapons. The Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative will help give us the time we so desperately need, in which to improve our capability to combat those threats.          The Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention Program  Two weeks ago, the General Accounting Office issued a report on another of our non-proliferation assistance efforts, the Energy Department's Initiatives for Proliferation Prevention--or IPP--program, that was critical of program management. Newspapers quoted a statement by my friend from North Carolina, Senator Helms, who chairs the Foreign Relations Committee and commissioned the GAO study. He said that Energy Department failure to implement reforms recommended by the GAO would ``jeopardize continued support'' for the program and also ``cast doubt'' on the wisdom of the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative.  Those stories made it sound as though threat reduction efforts were in danger. In my view, however, what we are actually witnessing are the normal growing pains of a basically successful program. I believe that the IPP program and other Nunn-Lugar efforts both deserve and will obtain the Senate's continued support.  The IPP program is only five years old. Its objective is to foster non-military employment for weapons scientists in the former Soviet Union by assisting them to develop marketable ideas that can then be produced in joint commercial ventures with Western companies. The GAO report notes that over 400 projects have been funded by IPP--over 200 projects in its first year alone--at about 170 institutes and organizations.  Thousands of Russian scientists have found at least part-time employment through IPP projects, and the result has been to lessen the temptation to sell their goods and expertise to rogue states. The GAO report discusses those results as follows:       Officials from three institutes told us that the IPP      program had prevented their laboratory or institute from      shutting down and reduced the likelihood that scientists      would be forced to seek other employment. A representative      from Sarov [the new name for Arzamas-16, Russia's equivalent      of Los Alamos] told us that without the IPP program, the      situation at the institute would be a disaster.       Some institute officials told us that the benefits of the      IPP program went beyond financial support. . . .[and      included] how to do business with the United States.  The GAO noted that the Energy Department's National Laboratories``have made great strides in helping to `open up' NIS [former Soviet] institutes,'' stated that ``the program has been successful in employing weapons scientists through research and development programs,'' and concluded that the overall effort is ``in our national security interests.''  Why, then, was the GAO critical of the IPP program? First, it found administrative lapses in the Department of Energy, such as not knowing how many scientists were engaged in particular projects, spending too much money in the United States and too little in the former Soviet Union, and allowing Russia to charge taxes on the assistance we provided. Secondly, it found many projects that had little or no chance of ever becoming commercially viable. Given that the IPP program is supposed to find Western investors for the projects it funds, the GAO's point was that the program was not achieving its long-term goals.  The GAO is right. But what they found was actually the tail end of the success story. They found a program that, in five short years, successfully reached into 170 former Soviet institutes and helped employ thousands of scientists. The IPP program made those crucial contacts and brought a message of hope that resonated throughout the community of Russian experts in weapons of mass destruction. It told them that we understood their need to survive economically and also their need to retain self-respect as skilled professionals.  After five years, it is time to tighten the administration of the IPP program. The good news is that the Energy Department is already working to do that. Indeed, of the GAO's 11 recommendations, the Energy Department accepted 10 completely and the 11th in part.  That 11th recommendation was to move more slowly in expanding the ``Nuclear Cities Initiative'' that will help Russia to downsize its nuclear complex without throwing weapons scientists out on the street. The Energy Department agrees on the need to move carefully, but reserves the right to take advantage of opportunities to expand the program beyond the three ``nuclear cities'' where it will begin.  When Chairman Helms warns that the GAO recommendations must be implemented, he is sending a stern message to which the Energy Department should pay attention. But as I read the GAO report and the Energy Department's response, that Department is indeed paying attention. I have every hope, therefore, that even conservatives like my friend from North Carolina will conclude that the IPP program and the Expanded Threat Reduction Initiative deserve our support.  On February 26, the New York Times published a very perceptive editorial regarding U.S.-Russian nuclear relationships. The last paragraph of that editorial spoke directly to the last GAO recommendation:       The G.A.O. report calls for closing down the nuclear-cities      program until the problems in the institutes program have      been resolved. That would be a mistake. The nuclear-cities      agreement is more carefully drawn than its predecessor and      already provides for exemption from Russian taxation.      Tightened project review procedures are in place to make sure      that Washington is not inadvertently subsidizing new Russian      weapons development. These programs, along with Washington's      contributions to Russia's plutonium and uranium conversion      and security programs, should go forward as part of a      coordinated drive to substantially eliminate Russia s cold-     war nuclear infrastructure before the Clinton Administration      leaves office.  The New York Times is right. Wars are not cheap. We cannot win the war against ``loose nukes,'' ``loose chemicals'' and ``loose pathogens,'' unless we give our government the means to fight. Given the terrible stakes in this war, we must move forward.  I ask that the New York Times editorial of February 26 and the Energy Department's response to the GAO report be printed in the Record at this point.  The material follows:                [From the New York Times, Feb. 26, 1999]                      Unfinished Cold-War Business       History will judge the Clinton Administration's foreign      policy record partly by its success in helping Russia reduce      the nuclear remnants of the cold war. Nothing would do more      to protect American security in the decades ahead than      insuring that Russia's immense stockpile of nuclear weapons      and materials is diminished and adequately controlled. The      modest amount of money needed to achieve these goals now      could save Washington many billions of dollars in the future      to deal with the Russian nuclear threat if it is not reduced.       Moscow still has 6,000 nuclear warheads poised for long-     distance delivery. Weapons-grade plutonium from dismantled      warheads is stored in poorly secured buildings, vulnerable to      theft. Russia also has tens of thousands of underpaid weapons      scientists and workers in 170 scientific institutes and 10      closed cities that house the Russian nuclear weapons complex.      If President Clinton hopes to leave an enduring mark in      international affairs, he will work on these problems in the      remaining 23 months of his term. Specifically, he should look      for innovative ways to further reduce nuclear weapons and      speed the conversion of Russia's nuclear establishment to      civilian activities.       The last nuclear arms reduction treaty, negotiated more      than six years ago, has yet to be ratified by Russia's      Parliament. That treaty alone would cut nuclear weapons      totals nearly in half. Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov      recognizes the treaty's value for Russia, both in foreign      policy and budget savings terms. Mr. Clinton should work      closely with President Boris Yeltsin and Mr. Primakov to      achieve ratification.       But hopes for deep nuclear cuts need not depend on Russia's      Communist-dominated Parliament. In coordination with Russia's      leaders, Mr. Clinton should initiate steps that go beyond the      treaty, including parallel nuclear reductions and taking more      weapons off hair-trigger alert. Such methods proved effective      when tried by Presidents George Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev a      decade ago.       Shrinking Russia's nuclear infrastructure also requires      expanding the cooperative programs developed under      legislation originally sponsored by Senators Sam Nunn and      Richard Lugar. These efforts have already supported the      dismantling of 5,000 Russian warheads. Additional work is      needed now to safely convert as much of the plutonium and      enriched uranium from these bombs into less dangerous forms      and to store what remains under much more secure conditions.      The Administration rightly seeks large spending increases in      these programs in next year's budget. It is essential that      Congress approve these requests.       Washington should also press ahead with its efforts to re-     employ Russian weapons scientists in civilian work. Two      American programs managed by the Energy Department are      designed to achieve that goal. One, begun in 1994, is aimed      at Russia's scientific institutes. A newer program deals with      the closed nuclear cities. The scientific institutes program      has succeeded in re-employing thousands of Russian scientists      at home and keeping them out of the reach of terrorists or      countries eager to make nuclear, biological or chemical      weapons. But a report prepared for Congress this week by the      General Accounting Office called attention to some problems,      including taxation by Russia of some of the aid money and      allegations that some assistance went to institutes and      scientists still engaged in weapons work. However cash-     starved the Russian Government is, taxation of American aid      money is unacceptable. Nor should American subsidies support      Russian weapons development.       The G.A.O. report calls for slowing down the nuclear-cities      program until the problems in the institutes program have      been resolved. That would be a mistake. The nuclear-cities      agreement is more carefully drawn than its predecessor and      already provides for exemption from Russian taxation.      Tightened project review procedures are in place to make sure      that Washington is not inadvertently subsidizing new Russian      weapons development. These programs, along with Washington's      contributions to Russia's plutonium and uranium conversion      and security programs, should go forward as part of a      coordinated drive to substantially eliminate Russia's cold-     war nuclear infrastructure before the Clinton Administration      leaves office.                                  ____                                         Department of Energy,                                Washington, DC, February 10, 1999.     Mr. Victor S. Rezendes,     Director, Energy, Resources and Science Issues, U.S. General          Accounting Office, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. Rezendes: The Department of Energy appreciates the      opportunity to review the draft General Accounting Office      report, GAO/RCED-99-54, ``Nuclear Proliferation: Concerns      With DOE's Efforts to Reduce the Risks Posted by Russia's      Unemployed Weapons Scientists.'' The report, as written,      provides valuable insight into our Initiatives for      Proliferation Prevention Program and will assist the      Department to better manage this valuable program. Technical      comments to this report have been provided separately. Our      comments on the report's recommendations are attached.           Sincerely,                                        Leonard Spector, Director,                      Office of Arms Control and Nonproliferation.       Attachment.      Comments on Draft General Accounting Office Report--Nuclear Nonproliferation: Concerns With DOE's Efforts To Reduce the Risks Posed        by Russia's Unemployed Weapons Scientists, February, 1999                            general comments       The Department of Energy appreciates the effort that the      General Accounting Office put into this report. We agree with      the vast     majority of its recommendations, and the IPP Program will be      significantly strengthened as the result of this independent,      in-depth evaluation. There are, however, a number of issues      that we believe need further clarification.       First, the report expresses concern that certain IPP      projects may have supported the development of dual-use      technology that could inadvertently strengthen Russian      military capabilities. We note that the specific projects      identified in the report date from an earlier period of the      program and, at worst, might have provided only incidental      military benefits to Russia--and not to its weapon of mass      destruction or missile programs. We are firmly committed to      ensuring that IPP projects do not support dual-use      technologies and are directed exclusively to peaceful      objectives. This is an explicit project requirement as noted      in guidance. Over the past eighteen months, the new      management of the IPP Program has intensified project reviews      to reinforce implementation of this standard.       We have been particularly sensitive to the dual-use      potential of projects in the NIS chemical and biological      institutes. The Department recognized from the onset of the      program that the dividing line between commercial and weapons      technologies was subtle in this area of technology. As a      result, DOE instituted a special review process, which      included the U.S. interagency, the U.S. chemical and      biological community, and the DOE National Laboratories.      Although the GAO report states that some reviewers may have      provided only cursory analysis of particular projects, we      believe that every IPP project with a chemical and biological      institute received extensive scrutiny from numerous      participants in the review process and that this process      deliberately erred on the side of disapproval when questions      on potential dual-use applications were raised. Nonetheless,      we recognize that improvements are needed to make the review      process more consistent and, as noted below, we accept the      GAO's recommendation on this issue.       The GAO report also raised the concern that some Russian      weapon scientists are being paid by the IPP Program even      though they remain employed at their respective weapons-     related institutes. The implicit criticism of the program is      that this practice is subsidizing Russian weapon-of-mass      destruction activities. We believe this implication is      misplaced. The fundamental goal of the IPP Program is to keep      weapons specialists working in their home countries--in the      face of grim domestic employment prospects--rather than      selling their services to foreign states or organizations of      proliferation concern. At virtually all Russian weapons      institutes, salaries are going unpaid for months, even for      those who are nominally ``employed'' there. These scientists,      and those who have been dismissed, are the proper targets of      the IPP Program, because these are the individuals who are      most likely to be tempted to sell their services abroad. IPP      policy clearly states that the Program does not pay      scientists to perform weapons work, and we match the scale of      payments to those of deliverables required by our contracts,      so that we are not inadvertently subsidizing other work at      the host institute. Moreover, time spent on IPP activities is      time scientists cannot spend working on Russian military      programs.       Finally, GAO notes that only two of the IPP projects have      progressed to Thrust III. Commercialization of science and      engineering requires time, and the IPP program has only      recently shifted its emphasis to commercialization. In the      United States, commercialization efforts normally take five      to seven years. In just the past year, the IPP Program has      placed increased emphasis on projects cost-shared with U.S.      industry (Thrust II) and on moving such projects towards      commercial viability (Thrust III). This progression is      important, we believe, to create viable long-term employment      opportunities for Russian scientists who are leaving weapons      work. We recognize, however, that IPP cannot by itself create      commercial entities; it can only set measures and procedures      in place to maximize the likelihood of their creation by U.S.      industry. If Russian economic conditions stabilize, we      believe the coming eighteen months will see the fruits of      these and earlier efforts.       Fortunately, as the GAO notes, even if IPP      commercialization success remains limited, the fundamental      objective of the IPP Program--keeping former Soviet weapon-     of-mass-destruction scientists at home--is succeeding.                    responses to GAO Recommendations                 A. Recommendations on the IPP Program     Recommendation 1       Re-examine the role and the costs of the national      laboratories with a view towards maximizing the amount of      program funds going to the NIS institutes.     DOE management position       Concur.       The Department will continue its examination of laboratory      roles to utilize their expertise more efficiently. In coming      months, we expect to increase significantly the proportion of      project dollars going to the NIS and to correspondingly      reduce the proportion of funds spent at the national      laboratories. An increased emphasis on Thrust II and Thrust      III projects will help to promote this shift in funding. The      Department notes that the enabling legislation for IPP calls      for a ``. . . program of cooperation between scientific and      engineering institutes in the New Independent States of the      former Soviet Union and national laboratories and other      qualified academic institutions in the United States designed      to stabilize the technology base in the cooperating states as      each strives to convert defense industries to civilian      applications . . .''     Recommendation 2       Obtain information on how program money is being spent by      the NIS recipients of program funds.     Management position       Concur.       The IPP Program office will issue guidance to participating      laboratories to ensure more complete tracking of the      expenditure of funds by the NIS recipients. The program will      establish quarterly reporting on funds spent in the NIS.     Recommendation 3       Seek assurances from the Russian government, either through      a government-to-government agreement or through other means,      that program funds are exempt from Russian taxes.     Management position       Concur.       The Department of Energy agrees with this recommendation      and will work with the Department of State to facilitate a      government-to-government agreement. In the meantime, the      Department will continue its efforts within the U.S.      interagency structure to resolve this issue. This effort has      led to discussions by the Vice President with his Russian      counterparts on taxation issues and to the renewal of the      Panskov-Pickering agreement as the basis for seeking case-by-     case tax exemptions for IPP funds expended in Russia.     Recommendation 4       Require that program officials, to the extent possible,      obtain accurate data on the number and backgrounds of      scientists participating in program projects, and eliminate      funding for institutes that did not formerly work on weapons      of mass destruction.     Management position       Concur.       The IPP Program has issued, and will reemphasize, program      guidance instructing principal investigators to obtain      accurate data regarding the number and backgrounds of      scientists participating in program projects. Scientists with      weapons knowledge now employed at nonweapons institutes will      continue to be eligible to participate in the IPP Program, as      they represent a continuing potential proliferation concern.     Recommendation 5       Clarify program guidance as to whether scientists currently      employed in weapons of mass destruction programs are eligible      for program funding.     Management position       Concur.       The basic goal of the program is to retain former Soviet      WMD scientists in their home countries; the key question is      the expertise they possess and might offer to others, not      whether they are currently on the roster of an NIS WMD      institute. Through its increasing emphasis on      commercialization, IPP will continue to develop long-term      opportunities for scientists to leave WMD institutes.      Explicit program guidance regarding scientists currently      employed in weapons of mass destruction programs will be      issued within 90 days.     Recommendation 6       Require that project reviewers consider all military      applications of projects to ensure that useful defense      related information is not unintentionally transferred.     Management position       Concur.       The IPP Program has always been sensitive to the question      of transfer of weapons-sensitive technology to the NIS. Based      on the GAO's report, however, we recognize that our review      process was not as complete as it should be. Accordingly, the      program has revised its procedures to request a direct review      of projects by the Department of Defense instead of      forwarding projects through the Department of State.     Recommendation 7       Strengthen and formalize DOE's process for reviewing      proposed chemical and biological projects by:       (1) providing complete project information to all reviewing      U.S. Government agencies and organizations.     Management Position       Concur.       Based on the GAO's report, the program has revised its      procedures to ensure that all appropriate government agencies      and organizations have complete project information.       (2) developing criteria to help frame the evaluation      process.     Management Position       Concur.       This recommendation was completed during the course of the      GAO's audit.       (3) providing feedback to all of the reviewing agencies      about the final disposition of the projects.     Management Position       Concur.       The Department will provide feedback to all reviewers      regarding the status of final approval of IPP projects.     Recommendation 8       Re-evaluate the large number of Thrust 1 projects,      particularly those that have been     funded for several years, and eliminate those that do not      have commercial potential.     Management Position       Concur.       The Department has implemented a reevaluation of Thrust 1      projects based on GAO's review.     Recommendation 9       Develop criteria and time frames for determining when      Thrust 1 projects should be terminated if they do not meet      the criteria of graduation to the program's next phase.     Management Position       Concur.       Based on GAO's review, this recommendation will be      accomplished within 120 days.            B. Recommendations on Nuclear Cities Initiative       Because DOE plans to implement the Nuclear Cities      Initiative in a relatively short amount of time (5 to 7      years) at a potential cost of up to $600 million during      uncertain economic times in Russia, we believe it is critical      that program implementation be based on solid thinking and      planning which considers the problems experienced under the      IPP Program. Therefore, we recommend that DOE:     Recommendation 10       Develop a strategic plan for the Initiative before large      scale funding begins and include in the plan-program goals,      costs, time frames, performance measures, and expected      outcomes, such as the number of jobs created for each city.     Management Position       Concur.       The Department is preparing a strategic plan that will be      published within 90 days.     Recommendation 11       Not expand the Initiative beyond the three nuclear cities      until DOE has demonstrated that its efforts are achieving      program objectives, that is, that jobs are being created in      the civilian sector for displaced weapons scientists,      engineers, and technicians.     Management Position       Concur, with qualification.       Some existing IPP projects in other closed cities may      naturally transition to work under the Nuclear Cities      Initiative. Similarly, the Department does not want to      preclude the possibility of accomplishing significant      reductions in nuclear weapons related activities in another      closed nuclear city should the opportunity arise to assist in      the shutdown of facilities there. It is also the intent of      the Department to structure the second year of the Nuclear      Cities Initiative based upon lessons learned the first year.      The Department has a process for reviewing program objectives      to determine lessons learned and next steps.                          ____________________
