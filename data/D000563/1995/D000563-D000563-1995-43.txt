Speaker, make no mistake, this amendment is not public interest, good government. The amendment here is generated by special interest groups, special interest groups which some way or another did not get a bite of the apple in the Republican reconciliation bill.  With this, with the amendment that the gentleman from Pennsylvania is going to come in with, and the mystery amendment from the gentleman from Texas, I have to say to my colleagues on the floor, I have been around legislatures and Congress for a long time, and I have seen a lot of lobbyists and special interest groups. What is happening on this floor today is turning the House of Representatives into a dismal swamp of special interests. It is shameful.                announcement by the speaker pro tempore
