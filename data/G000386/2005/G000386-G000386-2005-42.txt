 President, over the past several years the Congress has worked hand-in-hand with the administration to foster greater peace and stability in the Middle East through trade. We have concluded and implemented free trade agreements with Israel, Jordan, and Morocco. We recently concluded negotiations with Oman and negotiations are ongoing with United Arab Emirates. Perhaps soon, we will launch negotiations with our good friend and ally, Egypt.  Yesterday, with the passage of S. 2027, the U.S.-Bahrain Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, we took another historic step forward. Once this agreement enters into force, 98 percent of our agricultural exports to Bahrain will enter duty-free and 100 percent of our two-way trade in industrial and consumer products will be duty-free. The agreement sets a new standard on services, with broad commitments by Bahrain to open their service sector to our exports.  Passage of the U.S.-Bahrain FTA will help advance the President's goal of achieving a Middle East Free Trade Area, MEFTA, by 2013. This visionary agenda is a key element in our efforts to help foster economic growth and prosperity in an important region of the world. It also reflects keen appreciation by the Bush administration of the 9/11 Commission Report recommendation that ``a comprehensive U.S. strategy to counter terrorism should include economic policies to encourage development, more open societies, and opportunities for people to improve the lives of their families and to enhance prospects for their children's future.''  I am pleased that we are able to take another step toward fulfilling this recommendation with passage of the Bahrain agreement. This would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of many people. I first want to recognize Ambassador Robert Zoellick. As the former U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Zoellick spearheaded our trade agenda, including initiation of negotiations with Bahrain. This year, Ambassador Portman took up the reigns as our U.S. Trade Representative. Ambassador Portman has proven to be an able and effective negotiator who faithfully works with Congress to achieve the best result for America in our trade agreements. Ambassador Portman was assisted by Catherine Novelli, before her departure, as well as her replacement, Ambassador Shaun Donnelly, both serving in their capacity as Assistant U.S. Trade Representatives for Europe and the Mediterranean.  With the passage of this agreement, the Finance Committee continues its tradition of bipartisanship on trade. I appreciate the efforts of my ranking member, Senator Max Baucus, in helping remove any impediments to getting this done. An agreement such as this one also would not have been possible without the professionalism and work ethic of Senator Baucus' staff. In this regard, I owe thanks to Russ Sullivan, Democratic staff director, and Bill Dauster, deputy staff director, for their steadfast dedication to the Committee. Brian Pomper, chief international trade counsel to Senator Baucus, also deserves special thanks for his efforts as do Shara Aranoff, Demetrios Marantis, Anya Landau, Janis Lazda, and Chelsea Thomas.  I also want to recognize the work of my Finance Committee staff. At the top of the list is Kolan Davis, my chief counsel and staff director. Kolan has been a valuable asset to this committee, lending his counsel and expertise to moving countless bills, including the Bahrain agreement. Everett Eissenstat, chief international trade counsel to the committee, has played an important part in seeing that this agreement is timely implemented. I appreciate his continued dedication to advancing our trade agenda.  Everett manages a strong team of dedicated staff who consistently pull together to achieve our trade agenda. David Johanson, Stephen Schaefer, and Tiffany McCullen Atwell provide valuable support to the team. Their hard work and long hours are much appreciated. I also want to recognize Claudia Bridgeford, international trade policy assistant, and Russell Ugone, who is on detail to my staff from the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection in the Department of Homeland Security. Both Claudia and Russ have contributed a great deal to the work of this committee.  I would be remiss if I did not take this time to thank Mike Smythers, Special Assistant to the President for Senate Affairs from the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. I also want to thank Matt Niemeyer, Counselor and Assistant U.S. Trade Representative for Congressional Affairs. Matt will soon be leaving the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Throughout his tenure, he has been a valuable ally in passage of much of our trade agenda. I appreciate his hard work and service to the American people.  Matt was assisted by David ``Andy'' Olson, who provided critical support in moving this agreement. Jonathon Kallmer from the Office of General Counsel at the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, also played a key role in working with Congress to ensure faithful implementation of the agreement. I appreciate both of their efforts. Finally, I want to take this opportunity to thank Polly Craghill senior counsel in the Senate's Office of Legislative Counsel, for her role in passing this agreement. Polly never falters in her efforts to provide timely technical expertise to this committee and her work is much appreciated.  This is a good day for the United States and Bahrain. I hope President Bush will soon sign this bill and that we will see quick implementation of this historic agreement.                          ____________________[Page S13563]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]    PASSAGE OF U.S.-BAHRAIN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT IMPLEMENTATION ACT
