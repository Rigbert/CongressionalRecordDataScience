 President, ``An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.'' When our parents and grandparents told us that, they probably weren't talking about the problem of crime in America. But they might have been.  So many times in our debates, in the testimony given by experts from law-enforcement professionals to psychologists and social workers, the value of prevention--of keeping kids away from crime before they ever get into it--is clear and indisputable. And it is just as clear that one of the best ways to keep kids out of trouble is, simply, to give them something else to do.  Terrance Collier, a 13-year-old from Washington, DC, had something else to do this summer. In fact, he had a lot to do. Through a program called City Kids Wilderness Project, Terrance went to Wyoming, where he camped, cooked, helped with cleaning up, paddled a canoe, went rafting, made new friends and, in the process, learned about nature, himself, teamwork and responsibility.  Randy Luskey started City Kids Wilderness Project and continues to fund the program himself. A few years ago, Randy donated his Wyoming ranch to the kids. But, Randy is not just a blind donor. Randy leaves his own family in Colorado every year to actively participate with the kids in Jackson Hole.  Cathy Robillard takes time away from her home and family in Vermont every summer to work with the kids in Wyoming. She is the person that runs the nuts and bolts of the program and does so with a measure of care and discipline.  City Kids Wilderness Project is one of the best possible examples of time and money well spent. And it is an example that should be followed.  A lot of the participants get into City Kids Wilderness Project through Boys and Girls Clubs, the kind of partnership that gets the best out of both programs, the kind of partnership that has proven successful time and time again.  In debating funding for crime-prevention programs and public-private partnerships, we hear testimony from the experts and professionals, as we should, but we will never have a witness more important than 13-year-old Terrance Collier. Terrance found his time in Wyoming to be rewarding, it made a difference to him, he thought it was important and it kept him off the street.  Let's listen to that testimony, and let's thank the people like Randy Luskey and Cathy Robillard who are offering ``an ounce of prevention'' to kids like Terrance, brightening the promise of the future for all of us.                          ____________________
