President, Vermont is constantly made a better place by some of the extraordinary people who come there and add to the talents of our State.  One such person is Claudia Becker. She has restored the Big Picture Theater in Waitsfield along with her husband Eugene Jarecki. The theater has become a center for the people of the Mad River Valley, and Claudia has shown a sense of conscience in films she has shown at Big Picture.  Marcelle and I have been privileged to know Claudia for years and her husband Eugene for years before that. Marcelle, as an acting justice of the peace, even performed their marriage. We have enjoyed watching their home grow in Vermont, as well as the addition of two of the most beautiful children anyone could wish for.  Recently, Seven Days in Vermont wrote an article about Claudia and what she has done with her film festival. I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    ``Big'' Deal--Film Fest Founder Claudia Becker Gets the Picture                           (By Candice White)       On a recent sunny afternoon, several cars, many with ski      racks, pulled into a large dirt parking lot at the corner of      Route 100 and Carroll Road in Waitsfield. Children pulled off      brightly colored ski hats and unzipped puffy jackets as they      led their parents through sturdy wood doors. Above, bold red      and black letters inscribed on a round, Art Deco-style clock      identified the building as the Big Picture Theater.       Inside, the petite proprietor, Claudia Becker, was hustling      from one task to another. She swept the wooden floor of the      large, windowed cafe-lounge, dusted the player piano, crossed      to the carpeted hallway to help an employee count a cash      drawer, and answered both the theater phone and the personal      cell phone hooked to her corduroys.       A young man and his blonde girlfriend--friends visiting      from Becker's native Germany--appeared and greeted her. After      a quick exchange of words in German, the man walked behind      the bar to the kitchen area and began polishing silver, while      his girlfriend took over the broom. Becker darted back to the      concessions area and, with a warm smile, greeted the line of      customers arriving for a 4 p.m. matinee of Charlotte's Web.       The past year has been a whirlwind for Becker, 39, in her      new role as owner of the Big Picture Theater. When she bought      and renovated the former Eclipse Theater last spring, she      already had a full plate: two children under the age of 6, a      marriage to filmmaker Eugene Jarecki (The Trials of Henry      Kissinger, Why We Fight), and an acclaimed film fest. Lately,      Becker's velocity has increased as she gears up for the      fourth annual Mountaintop Film Festival. The human-rights-     based marathon runs at the theater starting this Wednesday,      January 10, through Sunday, January 14.       The fest presents 10 documentary films and three dramas,      all addressing issues of national and international concern,      from the toll of the Iraq war to Bombay's child sex trade to      civil disobedience during the Vietnam War. It showcases      personalities, too. The opening night gala features a      reception with filmmaker Henrietta Mantel before the      showing of her film on Ralph Nader, An Unreasonable Man. A      Q with Nader himself     via lcam follows. Olympia Dukakis, who stars in the drama      Day on Fire, is expected to make an appearance at one of      her two film screenings (Thursday and Saturday at 8 p.m.).      Filmmakers James Longley (Iraq in Fragments), Milena      Kaneva (Total Denial), and Alex Gibney (Enron: The Movie)      are all scheduled to appear. And Jarecki, whose 2005 doc      Why We Fight won a grand jury prize at Sundance, will      teach a three-hour media lab on Sunday at 1 p.m. Three      nights of live music and a Friday night community potluck      dinner round out the five days of brainy cinema.       Mountaintop grew out of a serendipitous meeting five years      ago between Becker and Kimberly Ead, now festival manager. At      the time, Becker was a teacher--she holds a master's degree      in special education from the University of Munich--and an      informal consultant to her husband's filmmaking. But she was      looking for new pursuits that would express her ``deep sense      of political concern.'' Ead, who was working on antiwar      issues at Burlington's Peace and Justice Center, offered just      that. ``Claudia and I really connected,'' Ead remembers. ``We      combined her contacts in the film industry and my work as an      activist to create the festival.''       Both women have a strong commitment to educating youth      about film and filmmaking, and it shows in the festival. This      year, students from area high schools, including Harwood      Union, Mt. Mansfield, Burlington and Vergennes, will be      bussed in for special screenings. ``I'd like to add more      educational components to the theater,'' Becker says, looking      to the future, ``like a media literacy program and a      documentary filmmaking program.''       And the future looks bright, judging by the success of the      festival so far. Becker points to an increase in ``the level      of recognition. . . and in the turnout. The festival has      established itself as one of the premier film festivals in      Vermont.''       One positive change is that the fest is no longer a      renter--this is the first year Becker has owned its venue.      After the previous owners shut their doors, Waitsfield locals      kept talking about the need for a community space. Becker      decided she needed to buy the theater and make it a viable      epicenter of the Mad River Valley. Vowing to spend every last      dime she had, she purchased the building, hired a      construction crew, and began a major renovation.       In May 2006, Becker re-opened the theater and unveiled the      transformed space: an open-kitchen cafe with a full bar, old-     fashioned soda fountain, and Internet lounge; a newly      renovated smaller theater with flexible seating, to be used      for both movie showings and community events; and a largely      untouched traditional movie theater.       Becker's vision for the aptly named Big Picture was a      ``local gathering place with a global dimension,'' she says.      ``And I wanted the name to reflect my personal desire for      teaching, discourse and thought exchange.''       Her political beliefs aren't just talk. Becker demonstrates      her commitment to the ``local'' by letting organizations rent      the space at a price that often just covers her costs. To      accommodate area events, she formed a partnership with the      nonprofit Open Hearth Community Center, which ``wouldn't have      a home without Claudia,'' says Open Hearth program manager      Kirstin Reilly. ``She has worked with the board to create a      space that is useful for the community's needs.''       Becker has brought an eclectic mix of first-run and      documentary films, thought-provoking discussions, music,      comedy and art exhibits to Big Picture. Last fall, New      Hampshire comedian Cindy Pierce drew a huge crowd for her      show on the mysteries of women's sexuality. Soon after, the      theater filled up again for a discussion of international      security issues with former U.N. weapons inspector Scott      Ritter.       Becker says she's still working on balancing her political      passions with the need to turn a profit. ``It has been a real      learning experience to find what works and what doesn't,''      she admits. ``Live music continues to be a challenge. But      when we bring in a political speaker, the place is      packed.''       Becker seems to have found a management style that suits      her: a nonhierarchical organization that still allows her to      jump in and be the boss when needed. And when friends and      family visit, they're put to work. Jarecki is often seen      pouring beers behind the bar. The couple's daughter Anna has      baked cookies to sell in the cafe.       ``When I was hiring, I was very careful to find people who      had a positive attitude and a predisposition for      multitasking,'' Becker says. Her core team is composed of      women: Ead; theater manager Jo-Anne Billings; and chef Amanda      Astheimer, who aims to deliver on Becker's international      culinary vision. Several men work as projectionists and      concessions staff.       All hands will be on deck during this week's film festival.      ``I am looking forward to it all being over, just so I can      take a breath,'' Becker says.       But she also recognizes that a busy theater is the best      reward. Becker defines success as ``seeing people having a      great time; working with and within the community; feeling      that I am doing something that is greater than myself.'' If      she can bring new issues and ideas to filmgoers' attention,      so much the better.       ``I want to open people's minds and inspire discourse,''      Becker says. ``I don't believe I can have an impact on what      people do with the information, but I feel it is important to      get it out there.''                          ____________________
