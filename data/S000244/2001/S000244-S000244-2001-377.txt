Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Speaker, the Framers of the Constitution have used terms of art like due process of law and equal protection under the law and the courts have interpreted it. If the argument of the gentleman from New York (Mr. Weiner) is that we should draft constitutional amendments so tightly that the courts do not interpret it, then I think we probably would have to rewrite the Constitution right from article I, section 1. We do not want to do that. But we do want to give Congress the authority to determine what de minimis is.  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Hayworth).
