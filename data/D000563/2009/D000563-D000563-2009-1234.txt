Senators should expect the so-called vote-arama to begin around 11:30 a.m. tomorrow. Votes will occur in a stacked sequence with 2 minutes for debate prior to each vote. In addition, Senators should note that each vote after the first vote will be only 10 minutes in duration.                          ____________________
