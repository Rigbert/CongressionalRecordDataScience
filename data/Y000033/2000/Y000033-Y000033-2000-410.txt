Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I would tell the gentleman I am very sympathetic and would support his amendment if we had not reached this agreement in the delicate balance which we did arrive at. I want to, again, stress that last year the Committee on Appropriations, by the way, because there are certain individuals in the Committee on Appropriations that do not like this bill, if they had been doing their jobs, they would have fully funded it.  In fact, the Committee on Appropriations owed this America $13 billion which was collected in offshore development that we said we were going to spend, we spent it for other reasons. This is what I am very concerned with. I want to remind the gentleman that last year the Committee on Appropriations only funded $135 million for PILT, $10 million for the refuge sharing program. What we tried to do and, by the way, this was insistence from one of the Western Caucus members that we consider the PILT.  We tried to take and say, all right, we will fully fund it with the help of the Committee on Appropriations, which we do. After we did that, the National Association of Counties supports the bill. It is their interpretation that it is the full funding. I can assure the gentleman, I may not be on this committee next year, I will be the vice chairman of this committee, it is my intent to make sure that this does occur. I hope he has a little faith in what we are trying to do here because I think he is absolutely correct. To have a small community have to shoulder the burden for the national good is wrong. They ought to be reimbursed for those lands that are taken out of production. But we thought we were doing it. We really thought we had a formula here. Really this idea came from the National Association of Counties. That is who we were working with.
