It in fact cannot account for a large majority of its expenditures, and the fact is that one party runs this government. They run it with an iron fist here in the House where substantive amendments are often not allowed. One party runs the United States Senate as much as the Senate can be run. And one party runs the White House that will never admit it was wrong.  I wonder why it is that the Washington Waste Watchers here cannot make a little more mileage with their people downtown and why they have to give speeches on the floor as opposed to taking real action to root out waste and abuse. His amendment may have merit, and I will take a look at it, but the point is I have heard many of his other speeches about things that could be accomplished administratively. I believe the administration, the Bush administration, which runs the Interior Department, could take action internally to eliminate this apparent plethora of excess websites.  Why should it take an act of Congress? If we have such a responsible administration downtown, why will they not take administrative action? Whydo they not limit the number of websites out there? Why do they not limit the expenditure?
