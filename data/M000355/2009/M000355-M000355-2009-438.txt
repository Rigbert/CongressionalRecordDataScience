 Throughout the week, Louisville, Lexington, and other communities in Kentucky and the Nation have held events to commemorate this solemn occasion.  As we remember the terrible sufferings of the Jewish people and all others who have suffered and who continue to suffer at the hands of hatred and intolerance, we spread one of the most enduring lessons of the Holocaust--that evil exists in the world and it is the responsibility of free and just nations to protect the innocent by speaking for all those who cannot speak for themselves.  The theme of the 2009 Days of Remembrance is ``Never Again: What You Do Matters.'' Those words should serve as a reminder to all of us that anti-Semitism and other forms of religious hatred are as real today as they were in the middle of the last century and that the best way to honor the victims of the Holocaust is for us to work toward building a more hopeful and a more peaceful world.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
