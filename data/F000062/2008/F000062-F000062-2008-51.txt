 President, I rise today to update the Senate on the deteriorating situation in California.  Simply put, the situation is untenable.  In the past 2 weeks, 1,781 wildfires have burned roughly 688,000 acres--an area roughly the size of Rhode Island. Today, 323 fires continue to burn including the Camp Fire, in Butte County. As a result of that fire, 14,000 residents have had to evacuate their homes and nearly 50 homes have been destroyed in the past 48 hours.  It is likely to get worse--with a heat wave and more lightning strikes forecast--just as State and Federal resources are being depleted.  Governor Schwarzenegger has told the Federal Government that California cannot continue to fight these fires--that with current resources the State cannot protect lives and property.  California needs the following: Personnel: The Governor needs 302 more hand crews to put on the front lines and 773 support personnel. The State has tapped out its resources; it is time for the Federal Government to step up to the plate.  And the Forest Service is also short on staff. Key supervisors and firefighters are missing from our national parks, hampering firefighting and brush clearing efforts. Last month the agency reported 380 vacancies in California--roughly 8.5 percent out of a total force of 4,432. These positions must be filled. Agriculture Under Secretary Mark Rey promised me these vacancies would be filled by July 8. But as of today only 289 positions have been filled. We need to do more.  A Full Emergency Declaration: Governor Schwarzenegger has declared emergencies in 11 counties: Butte, Trinity, Shasta, Santa Barbara, Santa Clara, Monterey, Mendocino, Santa Cruz, Plumas, Kern, and Mariposa. But President Bush has issued only a limited emergency declaration. California is asking the President for a full disaster declaration, which will open the State to broader assistance under the Stafford Act. I fully endorse this request.  Funding: California's fire emergency is burning up Federal firefighting dollars at an alarming rate. The Forest Service has already expended $704 million--more than half the $1.2 billion in available funds--and fire season has just begun. Therefore, I am asking for $910 million in emergency appropriations for the Forest Service and Interior Department.  This emergency funding, to be used throughout the United States as needed this year, includes: $610 million for wildfire suppression; $125 million for fuels reduction on State and private lands; $100 million for rehabilitation; $50 million for fuels reduction on Federal lands; and $25 million for firefighter recruitment and retention in high risk areas.  Air assets: The Governor has told President Bush that we need an additional 41 helicopters in California. I am committed to working with the President to make these aircraft available from other States, the military, or foreign nations. Whatever it takes, we need these resources.  We also need to permanently station military firefighting aircraft in California. It is increasingly clear to me that the key to these wildfires in remote geographic areas is immediate aerial assault on the fires. You cannot get firefighters into these areas fast enough. Earlier this year I asked the President and Defense Secretary Robert Gates to permanently station two C-130 tankers at Point Mugu. This is vital; several C-130s are working these fires today, but they had to travel great distances to get to California. This is unacceptable.  I am writing to the President again to renew this critical request.  Let me share with you a letter written by Henry Renteria, Director of Governor Schwarzenegger's Office of Emergency Services, to R. David Paulison, Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  It says in part:       We are in an unprecedented draw-down in the state's      emergency resources. Many fire departments are barely able to      maintain sufficient resources for initial attack on new      structure fires, while still participating in the statewide      mutual aid effort to address these wildfires.  Even with the assistance of more than 24,000 firefighters from 40 States, ``California has outstanding orders for fire resources that it is unable to fill,'' the letter states.  Yesterday there were requests for 230 engines that went unfilled, and at one point last week there were requests for 400 crews of 15-20 firefighters that were not met.  The Governor's letter continues:       California is in the untenable position of having orders      for firefighting resources remaining unfilled for multiple      days. The Governor has taken the extraordinary action this      week to direct the training of 400 California National Guard      soldiers in basic firefighting. These soldiers will be      assigned to the firefight as quickly as they can be trained      and equipped.  Mr. Renteria--again, the Governor's authorized representative--concludes by warning that ``the cumulative impact of these disasters has exhausted state and local resources to the point in which California cannot avert threat to live and improved property adequately.''  This is without question a clear and present threat to the largest State in the Nation.  California is on the precipice of a major catastrophe. California has spent more than $300 million fighting these fires--that is more than it spent on last year's firestorms. And this is only the second week of July.  Let me remind you of what the fall brings to southern California. It brings strong Santa Ana winds, which fuel massive and deadly firestorms: In 2003 in California, huge wildfires burned roughly 1 million acres; killed 21; and destroyed more than 5,000 homes. And last year in California, wildfires blackened 1,087,110 acres; killed 10; and destroyed 3,079 structures.  We are in a new and dangerous time.  The great bulk of the fires that have burned since last month--more than 1,000--were sparked by more than 8,000 dry lightning strikes.  California is now faced with dry lightning strikes at a level that I cannot remember in my lifetime. And more are forecast this week.  The State is also facing extreme heat. Across the State, nearly in every county, there are excessive heat warnings.  And the State is in the midst of a serious drought--Governor Schwarzenegger has declared a drought emergency.  The State's reservoirs are below normal, and drought has produced record amounts of dry brush. In many areas, there is more dry brush than at any point in the 27-year recorded history of the data.  This dry brush is like an unexploded bomb.  Last month--the halfway point of the year--more than 272,969 acres in California had burned. That's up from 42,214 acres burned at the same point last year. And up from the 5-year average of 30,938 acres burned on State land at that time of year.  The facts are clear and cannot be ignored. California is in great peril. And California's peril is the Nation's peril, for the costs of fighting these fires is fast draining our Federal firefighting resources.  Bottom line: California and the Nation need help now. A potentially recordbreaking fire season is upon us. We need to do more. We need to prepare. And we need to do it now.                          ____________________
