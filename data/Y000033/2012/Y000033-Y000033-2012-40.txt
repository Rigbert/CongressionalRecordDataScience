Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (H.R. 2938) to prohibit certain gaming activities on certain Indian lands in Arizona, as amended.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:                               H.R. 2938       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Gila Bend Indian Reservation      Lands Replacement Clarification Act''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) In 1986, Congress passed the Gila Bend Indian      Reservation Lands Replacement Act, Public Law 99 503, 100      Stat. 1798, to authorize the Tohono O'odham Nation to      purchase up to 9,880 acres of replacement lands in exchange      for granting all right, title and interest to the Gila Bend      Indian Reservation to the United States.       (2) The intent of the Gila Bend Indian Reservation Lands      Replacement Act was to replace primarily agriculture land      that the Tohono O'odham Nation was no longer able to use due      to flooding by Federal dam projects.       (3) In 1988, Congress passed the Indian Gaming Regulatory      Act, which restricted the ability of Indian tribes to conduct      gaming activities on lands acquired after the date of      enactment of the Act.       (4) Since 1986, the Tohono O'odham Nation has purchased      more than 16,000 acres of land. The Tohono O'odham Nation      does not currently game on any lands acquired pursuant to the      Gila Bend Indian Reservation Lands Replacement Act.       (5) Beginning in 2003, the Tohono O'odham Nation began      taking steps to purchase approximately 134.88 acres of land      near 91st and Northern Avenue in Maricopa County, within the      City of Glendale (160 miles from the Indian tribe's      headquarters in Sells). The Tohono O'odham Nation is now      trying to have these lands taken into trust status by the      Secretary of the Interior pursuant to the Gila Bend Indian      Reservation Lands Replacement Act of 1986 (``Gila Bend      Act''), and has asked the Secretary to declare these lands      eligible for gaming, thereby allowing the Indian tribe to      conduct Las Vegas style gaming on the lands. The Secretary      has issued an opinion stating that he has the authority to      take approximately 53.54 acres of these lands into trust      status, and plans to do so when legally able to do so.       (6) The State of Arizona, City of Glendale, and at least 12      Indian tribes in Arizona oppose the Tohono O'odham Nation      gaming on these lands. No Indian tribe supports the Tohono      O'odham Nation's efforts to conduct gaming on these lands.       (7) The Tohono O'odham Nation's proposed casino violates      existing Tribal-State gaming compacts and State law,      Proposition 202, agreed to by all Arizona Indian tribes,      which effectively limits the number of tribal gaming      facilities in the Phoenix metropolitan area to seven, which      is the current number of facilities operating.       (8) The Tohono O'odham casino proposal will not generate      sales taxes as the State Gaming Compact specifically      prohibits the imposition of any taxes, fees, charges, or      assessments.       (9) The proposed casino would be located close to existing      neighborhoods and a newly built school and raises a number of      concerns. Homeowners, churches, schools, and businesses made      a significant investment in the area without knowing that a      tribal casino would or even could locate within the area.       (10) The development has the potential to impact the future      of transportation projects, including the Northern Parkway, a      critical transportation corridor to the West Valley.       (11) The Tohono O'odham Nation currently operates three      gaming facilities: 2 in the Tucson metropolitan area and 1 in      Why, Arizona.       (12) Nothing in the language or legislative history of the      Gila Bend Indian Reservation Lands Replacement Act indicates      that gaming was an anticipated use of the replacement lands.       (13) It is the intent of Congress to clarify that lands      purchased pursuant to the Gila Bend Indian Reservation Lands      Replacement Act are not eligible for Class II and Class III      gaming pursuant to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. Such      lands may be used for other forms of economic development by      the Tohono O'odham Nation.     SEC. 3. GAMING CLARIFICATION.        Section 6(d) of Public Law 99 503 is amended by inserting      ``except that no class II or class III gaming activities, as      defined in section 4 of the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (25      U.S.C. 2703), may be conducted on such land if such land is      located north of latitude 33 degrees, 4 minutes north'' after      ``shall be deemed to be a Federal Indian Reservation for all      purposes''.     SEC. 4. NO EFFECT.        The limitation on gaming set forth in the amendment made      by section 3 shall have no effect on any interpretation,      determination, or decision to be made by any court,      administrative agency or department, or other body as to      whether any lands located south of latitude 33 degrees, 4      minutes north taken into trust pursuant to this Act qualify      as lands taken into trust as part of a settlement of a land      claim for purposes of title 25 U.S.C. 2719(b).
