I know the distinguished chairman of the committee is here as well, and I want him to be able to speak for our side.  Mr. President, I have always tried to work in a bipartisan way on health care. I voted in favor of creating the Medicare prescription drug program. I do not favor the Government running everything in health care. In fact, I have introduced legislation that would ensure that the government would not run everything. I believe it is important that pharmaceutical companies be successful in developing new products and therapies for America's seniors and for patients who are suffering. I believe it is time for the Senate to right a wrong. Outlawing the Government from any and every opportunity to negotiate lower drug prices for millions of seniors and taxpayers is an instance of special interest overreaching. Everybody else in America negotiates. Employers negotiate. Labor unions negotiate. Individuals negotiate. Everybody tries to be a smart shopper. Certainly Medicare, with 43 million people's interest on the line, ought to do everything it possibly can to be a savvy shopper.  It is especially important that the Government not give up the right to negotiate when single-source drugs are involved.
