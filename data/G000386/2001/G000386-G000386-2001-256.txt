 President, this is another one of those amendments. It has just a little change from what we voted on last night.  This delegates to the Secretary of the Treasury the setting of tax rates. I think this very much is an affront to the constitutional requirement that all revenue measures shall originate in the House.  Senator Nelson's amendment strikes at the heart of the principal jurisdiction over taxation held by the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee. Every year, for 10 years, he delegates the top marginal income tax rate to the Secretary of the Treasury to determine.  This amendment sacrifices the American taxpayer for the convenience of the State treasuries. I urge defeat of the amendment.  I have a point of order I want to raise. The amendment is not germane to the provisions of the reconciliation measure. That point of order is, as you have heard so many times: I raise a point of order that the amendment violates section 305(b)(2) of the Budget Act.
