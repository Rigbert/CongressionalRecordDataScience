 Is it not true that when we look at the record about detainees or those accused of terrorism being tried, we find that since 9/11, over 200 of them have been successfully tried in article III courts under President Bush and President Obama and that under military commissions, exactly 4, 4 terrorists have been tried; and that the argument on the other side, which is that the article III courts are incapable of protecting the United States and successfully prosecuting terrorists, absolutely flies in the face of the facts: 200 terrorists convicted in article III courts, 4 by military tribunals. You would think it was exactly the opposite, from the arguments made on the floor by my friend from Arizona and others.  I would ask the Senator from Nevada, our majority leader, are we not trying to give to any President--this President and any President--the tools and the decisionmaking necessary to protect our Nation, to pick the best place to investigate and to prosecute those who are accused of terrorism?
