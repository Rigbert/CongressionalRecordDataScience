President, I thank Chairman Collins and Senator Lieberman for working with me to include this provision in the act. It preserves an important requirement from section 504 of the National Security Act of 1947. It is very simple: That funds appropriated for an intelligence activity must be specifically authorized.  I appreciate your cooperation on this matter. It is a very simple amendment.  I yield to the distinguished chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee.
