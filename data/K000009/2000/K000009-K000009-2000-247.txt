Speaker, I am very pleased to recognize the 125th anniversary of the Temple Shomer Emunim in Sylvania Ohio. The congregation commemorated this most auspicious occasion in special services and celebration on June 2 and 3, 2000.  In 1870, there were about 30 Jewish families in Toledo, Ohio, most of whom were Orthodox. A small number of these families sought a more liberal practice of their faith and organized a Reform congregation. Those early services were held in homes and conducted by visiting rabbis. The band of families practicing in the Reform movement formally established a Temple in 1875 and the congregation was dedicated as Shomer Emunim-Guardian of the Faithful. This name was suggested by Rabbi Isaac Wise, founder of America's Reform Judaism and is taken from Isaiah 26:2, ``Open ye gates that there shall be a righteous nation-guardian of the faithful . . .''  In those first years, the congregation worshiped in a small church rented from a Christian congregation. In 1879, it was decided the grand sum of $12,500.00 would be raised in order to build their own sanctuary. With Toledo's Jewish population at the time settled in adowntown neighborhood, a small building was built on Tenth Street in downtown Toledo where the congregation remained for 23 years. The original Temple was formally dedicated by Rabbi Wise. As Toledo's Jewish community grew, the congregation moved to a larger building on Scottwood Avenue which was previously owned by a Methodist congregation. By 1916, the congregation had outgrown that building, and a new major synagogue was built on Collingwood Avenue. Nearly 100 years after its first quiet beginnings and as its members moved to the suburbs, the congregation built a new synagogue in suburban Sylvania in 1973, where the Temple remains and has flourished, an integral part of the community. It is affiliated with the Union of American Hebrew Congregations, the national organization of Reform Judaism.  For a century and a quarter, the Temple Shomer Emunim has been a fixture of life in Toledo's Jewish community, and our community as a whole. It has been a place to develop spiritual well-being and personal growth, and strengthen the bonds of family and faith. Its rabbis and members have stood as leaders among us, and have provided both guidance and wise counsel. As we reflect on more than a century of growth from its humble inception to its current prominence, we look forward to the future of Temple Shomer Emunim. Mozel Tov!                          ____________________
