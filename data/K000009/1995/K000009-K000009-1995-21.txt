In fact, it is all going to go for major tax breaks, over $245 billion, to among the most privileged people in this country.  So, all of the sacrifice that we are talking about, the quadrupling of what seniors will have to pay over the remaining part of this decade and into the next century, is not going to do a thing to make health insurance more accessible to seniors. All that money and all that sacrifice is going away so at the same time the seniors are shouldering a heavier burden, the Medicare Program will not be made any better.  I yield to the Congresswoman.
