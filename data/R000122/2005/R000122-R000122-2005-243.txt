President, I have immense respect for the chairman. I appreciate the difficulty of the job in trying to balance all these conflicting requests for funds. He has done a tremendous job with this appropriations bill. Certainly, I will consider his advice with respect to the position of the legislation. I would like to consider it a little further. But I appreciate the difficulty that the committee has in trying to meet all these amendments.  I say, finally, that what I am trying to do now is avoid a situation next year or the following year, as the chairman very well pointed out, where supplementals are not sufficient and the Army and Marine Corps have to look to their acquisition programs, cut combat systems, they have to look to other issues, quality of life for families, since these do keep these forces in uniform.  There is no disagreement, as the chairman pointed out, with respect to the need of these troops. There is no disagreement with respect to the fact that they will be on our books, if you will, for several years into the future.  I am pleased that the chairman and Senator Inouye formally increased the end strength, as Senator Warner and Senator Levin have done in the Defense authorization bill.  He is very right. The argument is how we pay for it. Do we pay for it through the emergency, or do we pay for them through the regular accounts?  I argue that a day of reckoning is coming where, if we don't face up to this by including it in the regular accounts, we will be dipping into acquisition and into other necessary programs of both the Army and Marine Corps.  But again, I will take the Senator's good advice very closely to mind, and I appreciate the fact that we agree on so much.  We are trying to figure out what is most appropriate--not just for the near term but in the long term--way to pay for these forces.  I yield the floor.
