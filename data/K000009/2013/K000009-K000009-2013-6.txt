Speaker, critics said it couldn't be done. They said the Federal Government ``refinancing'' of the American automobile industry couldn't work. Thankfully, for the economy of our country, they were wrong, wrong to denounce President Obama for his courageous decision to save America's auto sector. Yesterday, Treasury announced it was selling its last stake in General Motors, the same General Motors that critics derisively called ``Government Motors.''  Now the verdict is in: the automotive rescue was a huge success. Led by House Democrats, 237 out of 435 Members of this House voted to save America's auto industry. The President and Democrats made a bet on the auto communities, and it paid off with dividends.  Today, the auto sector supports one in 17 private sector jobs in this country and one in eight jobs in Ohio. The workers at the Toledo Transmission Plant and the Parma Metal Center thank President Obama and the Members of Congress who were willing to take the heat and do the right thing. The U.S. auto industry is back thanks to the President's leadership and those 237 Members of this House.  Onward, USA.                          ____________________
