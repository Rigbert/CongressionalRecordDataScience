  Just this afternoon, 29 Senators sent a letter to all of our colleagues that says:       We will oppose including Social Security cuts for future or      current beneficiaries in any deficit reduction package.  Let's be very clear. Our country does have a serious deficit problem. Our deficit this year is about $1 trillion, and our national debt is $16 trillion. That is a serious problem. However, let's be equally clear in understanding that Social Security has not contributed one nickel to the Federal deficit. So despite what we are going to hear tonight on cable television or some of the speeches my colleagues will give, let me reiterate: Social Security has not contributed one nickel to our Federal deficit.  In fact, the Social Security trust fund today, according to the Social Security Administration, has a $2.7 trillion surplus--let me repeat that: a $2.7 trillion surplus--and can pay out 100 percent of all benefits owed to every eligible American for the next 21 years.  Although many Americans now take Social Security for granted, we should never underestimate the incredibly positive impact Social Security has had on our Nation. In fact, one could well argue that Social Security has been the Nation's most successful social program--certainly in the modern history of this country.  In the 77 years since Social Security was signed into law, it has been enormously successful in reducing poverty for senior citizens. Before the advent of Social Security, back in the 1920s, early 1930s, about half of the senior citizens in this country lived in poverty, some in dismal poverty. Today, while the number is too high, the number of seniors living in poverty is less than 10 percent. We have gone from 50 percent to less than 10 percent. That, to my mind, is a real success story and something of which this Nation should be incredibly proud.  Today Social Security not only provides retirement benefits for 34 million Americans but also enables millions of people with disabilities and widows, widowers, and children to live in dignity and security. I hear in Vermont very often--and I expect the Presiding Officer hears in New Hampshire--about young people who have been able to go to college, live with some sense of security, despite the death of a parent, precisely because of Social Security.  Yet, despite all of these success stories, today Social Security is on the chopping block. Millions of Americans, when asked in polls, make it very clear--including people all across the political spectrum--saying: No, we should not cut Social Security. Millions of people understand that Social Security--and this is simply an extraordinary record--has been there in good times and in bad times. And in 77 years, not one American, no matter what the state of the economy, has not received all of the benefits to which he or she is entitled. It is an insurance program that has worked, and worked extraordinarily well.  What we are looking at right now are attacks on Social Security coming from Mitt Romney, from Paul Ryan, and from virtually every Republican in Congress, who are calling for major cuts in Social Security. Many of them, including Romney and Ryan, also want to begin the process of privatizing Social Security and turning it over to Wall Street, putting the retirement dreams of millions of Americans at risk. They are also pushing to increase the retirement age to 68 or 69, forcing older Americans who have worked their entire lives--sometimes in physically demanding jobs in construction; maybe they worked in restaurants being waitresses their whole lives and now some folks want these people to still be working at the age of 68 or 69.  While virtually every Republican in Congress is pushing to cut Social Security benefits, there are also some Democrats who are considering cutting Social Security as part of some deficit reduction grand bargain. I strongly disagree with that approach, and I hope President Obama will make it clear, as he did 4 years ago, that he also disagrees with that approach.  Let me quote what President Obama said 4 years ago when he was Senator Obama running for the White House. This is what he said:       John McCain's campaign has suggested that the best answer      for the growing pressures on Social Security might be to cut      cost of living adjustments or raise the retirement age. Let      me be clear: I will not do either.  End of quote of Senator Barack Obama on September 6, 2008. What then-Senator Obama said in 2008 was exactly right, and I hope that now, in 2012, we will hear the President reiterate that position.  One of the most talked about ideas, when we hear discussions about cutting Social Security--and nobody outside of the beltway has a clue about what this means. I can tell you, I have been to many meetings in Vermont, and I have asked Vermonters: Do you know what the chained CPI is? And nobody has a clue. But one of the most talked about ways to cut Social Security is moving toward a so-called chained CPI, which changes how cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security benefits and veterans benefits are calculated.  So what it does right now: There is a formula by which the government determines what kind of COLA--cost-of-living adjustment--seniors and veterans will get. It is a complicated formula. But what these guys want to do is cut back, readjust that formula so that the benefits will be less.  People who support this concept of a chained CPI, such as Alan Simpson, Erskine Bowles, and Wall Street billionaire Pete Peterson--and Peterson is one of the guys, a billionaire on Wall Street, putting in huge amounts of money in order to cut Social Security and other important programs--they believe Social Security COLAs and COLAs for veterans benefits are too generous, and they want to cut those COLA benefits.  Well, I will tell you something. When I talk to seniors in the State of Vermont and I say there are people in Washington who think their COLA benefits are too generous, usually they laugh. The reason they laugh is that for 2 out of the last 3 years, they have not received any COLA whatsoever--nothing--while at the same time their prescription drug costs and their health care costs have been soaring. And they look at me and say: What? Are these people crazy? If we have not gotten a COLA in 2 out of the last 3 years, while our expenses have risen, how do they think that COLA formula is now too generous?  Let's also be very clear that when we talk about this chained CPI, this means not only cuts for seniors, it means cuts for veterans, and that is an issue we have not talked about very much.  So let me talk about what the chained CPI means. It means--and they want to implement this, by the way, very shortly. Romney and Ryan are talking about changing Medicare, as we know, over a 10-year period, and I think that is a disastrous idea. But what these guys now are talking about are immediate cuts in the COLA, starting as soon as they can pass that legislation.  What it would mean is that for a senior citizen who is 65 years of age today, by the time that senior reaches 75, there would be a $560-a-year cut compared to what they otherwise would have gotten. Some folks here on Capitol Hill may not think $560 is a lot, but if you are struggling on $14,000 or $15,000 a year, that is quite a hit. And once that 65-year-old, in 20 years, reaches 85, that cut will be approximately $1,000 a year.  Now, I have a problem; in a nation that has the most unequal distribution of wealth and income, where the rich are getting richer and their effective tax rate is the lowest in decades, some folks around here, pushed by Wall Street billionaires, by the way, say: Hey, we have a great idea on how we could deal with deficit reduction: Let's tell a senior living on $15,000 a year, Social Security, that we are going to cut them by $1,000 in 20 years. I think really that is morally grotesque, and it is also bad economics.  But this chained CPI would not only impact seniors, it would also impact 3 million veterans. Three million veterans would be impacted by this chained CPI. For example, a veteran who put his life on the line to defend this country and who was severely wounded in action and who has a 100-percent service-connected disability is currently eligible to receive about $32,000 a year from the VA. Under the chained CPI, this disabled veteran, who started receiving VA disability benefits at age 30, would see his benefits cut by more than $1,300 a year at age 45, $1,800 a year at age 55, and $2,260 a year at age 65.  In other words, moving toward a chained CPI would be a disgraceful effort to balance the budget on some of the most vulnerable people in this country, including people who have suffered severe wounds and disabilities in defending this country. Those are not the people upon whom you balance the budget.  Madam President, I will conclude by reminding the American people that when Bill Clinton left office in January 2001, this country had a $236 billion surplus, and the projections were that that surplus was going to grow every single year. But some of the same people in Congress right now, including Congressman Paul Ryan, who is running for Vice President, who are so concerned about the deficit, who want to cut Social Security, end Medicare as we know it, make devastating cuts in Medicaid and education--these very same people voted to go to war in Iraq and Afghanistan and not pay one nickel for those wars but put them on the credit card and increase the deficit. These same people who now want to go after wounded veterans gave huge tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country, adding to the deficit. They passed a Medicare Part D prescription drug program and forgot to pay for that as well. So, to my mind, I have a real problem with folks who went to war without paying for it, gave tax breaks to billionaires without paying for it, passed a Medicare Part D prescription drug program without paying for it, and now they say we have to cut Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, education, and the needs of working families and low-income people. I think that is absolute hypocrisy.  So our charge is that instead of listening to the Wall Street billionaires who want to move to deficit reduction on the backs of the elderly, the children, the sick, the poor, wounded veterans, there are better ways to do deficit reduction. I hope that as a Congress we will come together and say that when the wealthiest people are doing phenomenally well, yes, they are going to have to pay more in taxes. When a quarter of the corporations in this country pay nothing in taxes, yes, they are going to have to pay their fair share of taxes. When we are losing $100 billion a year because of tax havens in the Cayman Islands and elsewhere, weare going to have to deal with that issue before we cut programs on which elderly people and veterans and children depend.  So we have a lot of work in front of us, but the bottom line is that I will do everything I can to make sure we do not balance the budget on the backs of the elderly, the children, the sick, and the poor. That is immoral, and it is also bad economic policy.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter signed by 29 Members of the Senate opposing cuts in Social Security.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                                                   Washington, DC.       Dear Colleague: We are writing to inform you that we will      oppose including Social Security cuts for future or current      beneficiaries in any deficit reduction package.       Under long-standing Federal law, Social Security is not      part of the Federal budget and cannot contribute to the      federal deficit. This reflects Social Security's structure as      an independent, self-financed insurance program, in which      worker contributions, not general taxes, finance benefits. In      our view, it is essential that Social Security's status as a      separate entity be fully maintained.       Contrary to some claims, Social Security is not the cause      of our nation's deficit problem. Not only does the program      operate independently, but it is prohibited from borrowing.      Social Security must pay all benefits from its own trust      fund. If there are insufficient funds to pay out full      benefits, benefits are automatically reduced to the level      supported by the program's own revenues. Social Security      cannot drive up the deficit by tapping general revenues to      pay benefits.       Even though Social Security operates in a fiscally      responsible manner, some still advocate deep benefit cuts and      seem convinced that Social Security hands out lavish welfare      checks. But Social Security is not welfare. Seniors earned      their benefits by working hard and paying into the system.      Meanwhile, the average monthly Social Security benefit is      only about $1,200, quite low by international standards.       For all these reasons, we believe it would be a serious      mistake to cut Social Security benefits for current or future      beneficiaries as part of a deficit reduction package. To be      sure, Social Security has its own long-term challenges that      will need to be addressed in the decades ahead. But the      budget and Social Security are separate, and should be      considered separately.       Thank you for your consideration of our views.
