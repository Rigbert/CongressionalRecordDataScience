 Chairman, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh) and I have worked together on a number of issues, and I appreciate where he is coming from, and we all understand the difficulty of coming up with the money.  However, I think the gentleman is not accurate in saying that we have funded the program higher than the President's request. I believe it is $14 million below the President's request, to the best of my knowledge.
