 President, let me thank the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, for raising the issue that today is International Women's Day--it is a very important day for women around the world and their rights--and to thank her for her work on the resolution asking the Foreign Relations Committee to hold a hearing on CEDAW, which is a very important resolution. It is time that we as a Senate hear what is involved and have a chance to get testimony and to possibly move forward on it. It would be a great step forward.                          ____________________
