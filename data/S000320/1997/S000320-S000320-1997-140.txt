 President, I rise today to join with many of my colleagues in saluting a great friend, patriot, and statesman--the senior Senator from South Carolina, Strom Thurmond. Listening to the debate recently, I realized that many were speaking of their personal experiences while serving with Senator Thurmond. I, however, would like to share with my colleagues the greatest story I know about Senator Thurmond--the true story of his life. To me it illustrates one key thing: that the hallmark of Strom Thurmond's life has been his dedication to serving others.  Senator Thurmond was born in 1902 and raised in Edgefield, SC. Following his graduation in 1923 from Clemson University, young Strom Thurmond began his career, first as a teacher and coach, then, at the age of 21, as an officer in the U.S. Army Reserve. Eventually, Senator Thurmond went on to become the county superintendent of education, city attorney, county attorney, State Senator and circuit judge of South Carolina. From 1942 to 1946, Senator Thurmond, along with millions of other brave young men, served in World War II. For his service in the American, European, and Pacific theaters, Senator Thurmond earned 5 battle stars and 18 decorations and medals, including the Legion of Merit with oak leaf cluster, the Purple Heart, and the Bronze Star for valor. Upon his return to South Carolina, Strom Thurmond was elected to serve as Governor of South Carolina. During his tenure as Governor, Senator Thurmond was a candidate for President of the United States. Five years later, in 1954, Strom Thurmond was elected as a write-in candidate for U.S. Senator and has served with distinction in this body as chairman of two prestigious committees, as well as serving as the President pro tempore.  The many personal sacrifices that Senator Thurmond has made over the past nine decades demonstrate his respect for our institution of government and our Nation's history. He knows all too well that when one fails to stand for his principles, those principles will perish. And Strom Thurmond, as a young paratrooper, as a Presidential candidate, and now, as a U.S. Senator, stands--sometimes all alone--for the greatest principles on which America was founded.  Strom even had to switch parties--not once, but effectively, twice, to keep advancing his strongly held principles and ideals. In a sense, though Senator Thurmond has been a Dixiecrat, a Democrat and a Republican, he has always been, most of all, a proud American.  Strom Thurmond has witnessed incredible growth and change in our Nation and our world, and his knowledge of our past and vision for our future is crucial to our present. The Senator's strong leadership, patriotism, dependability, and devotion to duty is inspiring--and his stamina is legendary. The people of South Carolina are fortunate to have such an able gentleman represent them; we here in the U.S. Senate are lucky to stand with him; and all Americans should be grateful for Senator Thurmond's 41 years of service in the Senate and proud of his 94 years of service to this country.                          ____________________
