 President, I rise today to speak in support of an amendment that I introduced yesterday that addresses the issue of toxins entering the ventilation systems on commercial aircraft.  This amendment is designed to ensure the FAA has the necessary information to protect the American public from exposure to harmful contaminants while flying.  Specifically, here is what the amendment would do:  First, it would require FAA to complete a study of cabin air quality within 1 year; second, the amendment would provide FAA with the authority to mandate that airlines allow air quality monitoring on their aircraft for the purposes of the study; and third, the amendment would authorize FAA to mandate installation of sensors and air filters if the study demonstrates that these steps would provide a public health benefit.  This amendment is necessary because the air in the passenger cabin is a mixture of recirculated cabin air and fresh air that is compressed in the airplane engines.  Sometimes the air you breathe on an airplane gets contaminated with engine oils or hydraulic fluids that are heated to very high temperatures, often appearing as a smelly haze or smoke.  That haze or smoke that enters the cabin air is a toxic soup and can contain carbon monoxide gas as well as chemicals that can damage your nervous system called tricresylphosphates, TCPs.  Exposure to TCPs can initially cause stomach ache and muscle weakness, followed by delayed memory loss, tremors, confusion, and many other symptoms.  Exposure to this and other air toxics in cabin air is a serious matter.  In 2004, the FAA concluded that the problem was so ``unsafe'' that it needed to do thorough inspections of certain aircraft.  In a Federal Register notice, FAA called for ``repetitive detailed inspections of the inside of each air conditioning . . . duct,'' which FAA stated was ``necessary to prevent impairment of the operational skills and abilities of the flight crew caused by the inhalation of agents released from oil or oil breakdown products, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.''  Let me take moment to explain how these broad findings impact people who happen to be exposed to toxic air in aircraft cabins.  Terry Williams is a mother of two and a former flight attendant, who knows firsthand the dangers associated with exposure to toxic fumes while onboard an airplane.  As Terry was working on April 11, 2007, she noticed a ``misty haze type of smoke'' on the plane as it taxied toward its gate. Since then, she has experienced chronic migraines and twitching.  Terry made repeated visits to the emergency room before a neurologist told her she had been the victim of toxic exposure.  Terry is not alone.  Although several flight attendants and passengers have related similar stories to the FAA of smelling chemicals and then experiencing serious illnesses, the FAA has never conducted a large-scale study to measure the frequency or severity of such toxic fume events in aircraft.  Moreover, there appears to be no FAA standard for identifying or preventing the presence of toxic fumes in aircraft cabins.  This FAA reauthorization bill pending before the Senate addresses this very important public health and safety issue.  Specifically, section 613 of the Commerce Committee's bill would require that the Federal Aviation Administration implement a research program to identify appropriate and effective air cleaning technology and sensor technology for the engine and auxiliary power unit air supplied to the passenger cabin and flight deck of all pressurized aircraft.  This is a very good and important provision. FAA should absolutely study what equipment most effectively fixes this air quality problem.  But my amendment would go further than the establishment of a ``research program.''  It lays out a clear framework for protecting the public from what could be a serious risk.  First, it requires that FAA study the nature of this risk by thoroughly and comprehensively monitoring the frequency of exposure on aircraft, so that we understand whether toxic exposure is a common occurrence.  Second, the FAA must assemble records of passenger illness complaints to determine the specific health risks associated with harmful contaminants in airplane ventilation systems.  By gathering this information, I am confident that FAA will develop a clear picture of the level of health risk posed by toxins in cabin air, and the ways to protect the American traveling public and the hardworking men and women who make air travel possible.  Finally, this amendment would empower the FAA to require the installation of toxic air monitors and air filters that the Commerce Committee legislation's study would identify.  Such installation would only be required if the FAA's study shows that such a step is necessary to protect public health, but FAA would clearly have a mandate to take this step.  In March 2009, the president of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, ASHRAE, which in 2007 developed voluntary model standards to protect aircraft cabin air quality, called on FAA to ``investigate and determine the requirements for bleed air contaminant monitoring and solutions to prevent bleed air contamination.''  I will ask to have a copy of this full letter printed in the Record.  But I also want to read ASHRAE's conclusion, which states:       Although no systematic fleet-wide or industry-wide audits      have been conducted, the UK Committee on Toxicity recently      calculated the incidence of oil/hydraulic fluid events as 1      percent of flights based on pilots reports and 0.05 percent      of flights based on engineering investigations. . . .       Still, no aviation regulator requires either bleed air      monitoring or bleed air treatment.       To this end, the ASHRAE committee that developed (the model      air quality standard) is writing to ask you . . . to      investigate the technical implications and flight safety      benefits of addressing bleed air contamination, and to      determine the requirements for bleed air contaminant      detection systems and solutions to prevent bleed air      contamination.  I agree with the ASHRAE recommendation that we need to study this problem and take steps to protect public health and safety.  I offered this amendment in order to implement ASHRAE's very sound recommendations, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the March 6, 2009, letter to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-           Conditioning Engineers, Inc.,                                       Atlanta, GA, March 6, 2009.     Re Request to investigate and determine requirements for          bleed air contaminant monitoring and solutions to prevent          bleed air contamination.     Lynne A. Osmus,     Acting Administrator, Federal Aviation Administration,          Washington, DC.     Patrick Goudou,      Executive Director, European Aviation Safety Agency, Koeln,          Germany.       Dear Ms. Osmus and Mr. Goudou: In 2007, ASHRAE published      ``Air quality within commercial aircraft'' (ASHRAE, 2007;      copy attached), developed by Standard Project Committee 161.      The standard addresses a wide range of air quality issues      including ventilation, temperature, and contaminants from a      variety of sources. In light of the committee's flight safety      concerns and the references cited below, the committee      requests that, this year, you investigate and determine the      requirements for bleed air contaminant monitoring and      solutions to prevent bleed air contamination, including      maintenance/operating/design control measures and bleed air      cleaning equipment.       As background, ASHRAE is an engineering association that,      among other things, develops and publishes voluntary indoor      air quality standards that are often adopted by regulatory      authorities. This aircraft air quality standard was developed      over a ten-year period. It was a significant undertaking that      was ultimately approved for publication unanimously by a      committee of members that represent the full spectrum of      aviation interests and expertise: namely, aircraft and      component manufacturers, airlines, crewmembers, passengers,      and a general interest group, appointed according to      administrative rules that ASHRAE issued in 2000 to ensure      that all interest groups were represented and would be heard.      Pre-publication, the standard was also released for two 45-     day comment periods during which the general public and other      interested parties had the opportunity to weigh in.       Section 7.2 of the standard requires the installation of      ``one or more sensors intended to identify a substance or      substances indicative of air supply system contamination with      partly or fully pyrolyzed engine oil or hydraulic fluid''      with flight deck indication when such fumes are present to      enable the pilot(s) to respond appropriately and rapidly.      Also on the subject of air supply monitoring, Section 8.2 of      the standard notes the utility of making portable, reliable,      easy-to-use air monitoring devices available in the cabin and      flight deck. Finally, Section 8.2 states that air cleaning      technologies intended to reduce bleed air contaminants may be      considered.       Many other publications support this request. For example,      the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) of the UK      Department for Transport echoed the call for bleed air      monitoring, noting ``adverse physiological effects in one or      both pilots, in some cases severe'' (AAIB, 2007). These      smoke/fume events had been reported on commercial flights, so      the AAIB recommended that the EASA and the FAA ``consider      requiring, for all large aeroplanes operating for the      purposes of commercial air transport, a system to enable the      flight crew to identify rapidly the source of smoke by      providing a flight deck warning of smoke or oil mist in the      air delivered from each air conditioning unit.'' The      installation of sensors which would identify contaminated air      events would further help to address the concerns raised by      the FAA and others of the underreporting of such events (FAA,      2006(a); FAA, 2006(b); Michaelis, 2003). It has been      estimated that less than 4% of oil fume incidents are      reported as required (Michaelis, 2007). Sensors would help      mitigate the reported high failure rate of crews to use      emergency oxygen, despite clear industry guidelines to use      oxygen when the air is (or is suspected to be) contaminated.       Similarly, controlling bleed air contamination is supported      by many recent publications that have cited either pilot      incapacitation or impairment caused by exposure to oil fumes      (AAIB, 2007; ATSB, 2007; SAAIB, 2006; CAA, 2002; CAA, 2000).      Oil fume events have been reported fleet-wide across a wide      range of aircraft types (Murawski, 2008). For example, on the      BAe146 aircraft, the FAA itself requires particular      inspections and cleaning to ``prevent impairment of the      operational skills and abilities of the flightcrew caused by      the inhalation of agents released from oil or oil breakdown      products, which could result in reduced controllability of      the airplane,'' describing oil contamination as an ``unsafe      condition'' and requiring that corrective actions be      completed prior to further flight (FAA, 2004).       Although no systematic fleet-wide or industry-wide audits      have been conducted, the UK Committee on Toxicity recently      calculated the incidence of oil/hydraulic fluid events as 1%      of flights based on pilots reports and 0.05% of flights based      on engineering investigations (with the caveat that the      incidence may vary with airframe, engine type, and servicing)      (COT, 2007).       Still, no aviation regulator requires either bleed air      monitoring or bleed, air treatment. To this end, the ASHRAE      committee that developed Standard 161-2007 is writing to ask      you to establish a joint independent committee (perhaps with      other regulatory authorities) this year to investigate the      technical implications and flight safety benefits of      addressing bleed air contamination, and to determine the      requirements for bleed air contaminant detection systems and      solutions to prevent bleed air contamination, as described.      The committee thanks you for your commitment to aviation      safety and encourages you to direct any questions,      correspondence, or requests for references to the committee      Chairman, Dr. Byron Jones.           Sincerely,                                                 William Harrison,                                                        President.
