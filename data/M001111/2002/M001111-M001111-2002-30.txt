 President, I thank the Chairman of Defense Appropriations Subcommittee for his foresight and leadership with the FY2003 Department of Defense Appropriations bill. I commend the Chairman for including in this bill $50 million in the Military Personnel Defense Health Program for a Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program. Our military personnel face numerous unknown risks each and every day. Providing funding to treat, mitigate or eliminate these risks is the least we can do for those who have agreed to dedicate their lives to defending our nation and freedom.
