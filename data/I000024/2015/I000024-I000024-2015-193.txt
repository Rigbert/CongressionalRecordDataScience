President, I am afraid this may end up out of order. If we are going to pursue this further, it seems as though the forgotten continent has always been, in our experience, the African continent. So we are going to address equal trade with Africa, and that is the upcoming area on which we need to be concentrating. Ten years from now, we will look back and see that those were the real, live economies, and we have to quit ignoring them.  I withdraw the amendment.
