 President, I rise today to submit a resolution on behalf of myself, Senator Boxer, Senator Hutchison, Senator Durbin, and Senator Santorum, to commemorate the acts of kindness of the residents of Remy, France afforded World War II Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Houston Braly. While these deeds occurred more than fifty years ago, the story of this young pilot is carried on in the hearts and minds of the people of Remy. Now the friends and comrades of Lt. Braly have joined together to show their appreciation in a most sincere gesture of goodwill.  On August 2, 1944, Lt. Braly's squadron of P-51 fighters on patrol in northern France encountered a German munitions train. The squadron made three unsuccessful attack runs at the train, which was almost impossible to see because of camouflage. On the fourth run, however, Lt. Braly's fire hit a car carrying explosives, causing a tremendous explosion.  Airplanes circling 13,000 feet over the battle were hit by shrapnel from the train. Haystacks in fields some distance away were seen burning, and nearly all buildings in the small French town were demolished. The 13th century church in the town of Remy barely escaped destruction, but the historic stained-glass windows were destroyed.  The explosion also claimed the life of Lt. Braly, who was only twenty-two years old on that tragic day.  Despite the near total destruction of the small town, the residents of Remy regarded that young American as a hero. A young woman pulled Braly's body from the burning wreck of the plane, wrapped him in the nylon of his parachute, and placed him in the town's courtyard. Hundreds of villagers showered the site with flowers, stunning the German authorities. Threats of reprisals were made if the tributes continued, but eventually the authorities agreed that a small, private burial could be performed in the church's cemetery.  The next morning it was discovered that despite the potentially severe consequences, villagers had once again paid tribute to the young pilot. The covert placement of flowers on Lt. Braly's grave continued until American forces liberated Remy to the cheers of the townspeople. American soldiers were led to Lt. Braly's grave, which was marked by the bent propeller of his P-51 fighter.  Nearly 50 years later, Steven Lea Vell of Danville, California, came across this story during the course of research he was doing at the Air Force Archives in Alabama. Mr. Lea Vell was so moved by the story that he visited Remy, France, only to find that the stained glass windows of the magnificent 13th century church which were destroyed in the explosion had not been replaced. Mr. Lea Vell contacted various members of the 364th Fighter Group, under which Lt. Braly had served. These veterans had heard the stories of how the residents of Remy had honored their fallen friend. They joined together to form Windows for Remy, a non-profit organization working to raise $200,000 to replace the stained glass windows to repay the town for their distinguished actions toward Lt. Braly.  Mr. President, the residents of Remy have not forgotten the story of that young American pilot. On Armistice Day, November 11, 1995, fifty years after the war ended, the town of Remy paid tribute once more to Lt. Braly. On that day they renamed the crossroads where he perished to ``Rue de Houston L. Braly, Jr.''  I am confident that my fellow senators will join me in commending the people of Remy, France for their kindness and recognize the friends and former comrades of Lt. Braly for their efforts to pay back this debt of honor.                          ____________________
