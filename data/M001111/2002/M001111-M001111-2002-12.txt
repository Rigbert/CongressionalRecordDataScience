  As the Presiding Officer knows, in our State of Washington, a tragic accident occurred 3\1/2\ years ago when a pipeline blew up on a sunny June afternoon, tragically killing three young children in our State and devastating a mile-wide section of a river that travels through Bellingham, WA. This was a traumatic event that has impacted the lives not only of those families and their friends but hundreds of people in Bellingham and across this country.  At the time, I thought this was a uniquely tragic accident that occurred in my State when a pipeline suddenly blew up on a sunny Friday afternoon, after school. But after coming back to Washington, DC, and researching what was known about pipelines, I found out that in a short time period, between 1986 and 1999, there had been 5,700 pipeline accidents.  What happened in my home State was not unique. Three hundred twenty-five people had died in that time period. There had been 1,500 injuries that had occurred and $850 million in environmental damage. Working with many colleagues, Senator McCain, who chaired the Commerce Committee, and Senator Hollings, who worked diligently with me, Senators Inouye, Breaux, Wyden, Brownback, Bingaman, Domenici, Corzine, Torricelli, my colleague who is presiding today, Senator Cantwell, and former Senator Gorton, made this an issue in this country. It has been a long and difficult road. We have passed this bill out of the Senate on several occasions. We have been stopped in the House, and today we are finally at a point where the House, I believe, is going to pass this legislation as well, and it will be sent to the President of the United States. It will put into place significant new improvements on training and qualifications of our pipeline personnel, on inspection and prevention practices, on tough penalties for people who violate this, and States' abilities to expand their safety activities.  For the thousands of families who live next to pipelines, who work next to pipelines, who send their kids to schools next to pipelines, this is definitely an improvement in our law.  Is it everything we ask for? No. But today I want to rise and thank all of my colleagues, and Congressman Larsen as well, for finally moving us to a point where the families of Wade King, Stephen Tsiorvas, and Liam Wood can realize the hard work they have put in is going to finally result in a change of law that means some future child, some future family, some future community, will not have to face the situation as they have.  I thank my colleagues for their work on this, and I look forward to having the President sign this into law.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
