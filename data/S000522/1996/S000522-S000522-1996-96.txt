Mr. Speaker, I would just remind the gentleman from Virginia that the foreign aid portion of this legislation was dropped in conference. This is consolidation and State Department reauthorization part C, which was in the original bill, and the gentleman is correct in noting that that was dropped, so the bill that the President vetoed had nothing whatsoever to do with the foreign aid portion of the legislation.
