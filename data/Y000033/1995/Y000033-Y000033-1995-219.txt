Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I am terribly surprised the gentleman from Florida would speak as he just spoke. There is no loss to taxpayers. CBO says this. I agree with him, President Clinton, and Secretary Babbitt, as I mentioned before, but these are not true facts as far as loss of money. This is budget neutral. It also probably will increase moneys as we go forth and create new jobs.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to my good friend, the gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Callahan], a great leader and fine Congressman, one of the new cardinals in the U.S. Congress.
