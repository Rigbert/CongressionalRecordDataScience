She brings up a very good point, and that is we are in the middle of a process now that is very complicated. First of all, we have our defense authorization bill. It is very, very significant that we get this passed because we have pay raises for those people who are serving right now in Bosnia and other places. We have military construction projects that, if we do not pass this authorization bill, can be in jeopardy. This goes far beyond depot maintenance. I just hope, instead of holding up the entire authorization bill, that we could address this in a way where an amendment could be crafted by the Senator from Texas that would take out the offensive language and then debate it openly, for hours and hours. Because these are critical decisions.  I have to respond to a few things that were said. First of all, the idea of privatization in place--no one is going to exceed my efforts for the past 30 years for privatization in place. I can remember when I was mayor of the city of Tulsa, I was privatizing everything that would not move. I remember our trash system--we privatized it in place. Of course, people do not like change. I can remember they ended up dumping in my front yard. However, now it is the greatest system we could have had--privatization in place.  There is a big difference between privatizing a trash system and privatizing a core responsibility of the military. So here we are trying to defend America and putting ourselves in a posture where, if we follow all the way through with the privatization argument and privatize everything in the military, then we would not have a core capability within the public sector to defend America. That is clearly what this issue is all about.  I would also like to talk a little bit about the committee process that we have gone through. The Senator from Texas talks about the committee perhaps not coming out with the right conclusions. We have been going through this every year. Certainly I, when I was in the other body, sat through this process. Am I happy with it? No. I would like to have a better process. The committee process is a very difficult one and it is one of compromise. We have compromised.  In this process our committee--first of all, in the Subcommittee on Readiness we discussed this issue, we aired it. It was not partisan. It was not Republicans versus Democrats. It was how can we address the issue of having enough of the critical workload, core workload in the public sector so we know if a war comes up we will not be in a hostage situation by one supplier or one contractor who might be in a position to undercut the public sector a little bit at the present time. That is really what it is about.  So we discussed this and we aired this in committee. I see now that Senator Thurmond, the chairman of the committee, is here in the Chamber. I am just reminded that, back when it was very difficult for the Senator from South Carolina to comply with it, they came along and closed, in the 1993 BRAC round, the Charleston naval shipyard. He does not have to answer this question, but I can tell you right now he was not very happy about that. But he bit the bullet and said we have to eliminate excess capacity.  I can say the Senator who is presiding right now, Senator Coats--Mr. President, you can remember when you had to close Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indiana. Was that fun? No, it was not fun. But you were very strong at that point and said we have to protect the integrity of this nonpoliticized process and close excess capacity. There is hardly a Senator in here who did not have to bite the bullet. All of a sudden, we are saying the system is not good and we are going to have to ignore the BRAC process for facilities in two States. There are 50 States. There are still 50 States. This is just two States we are talking about. So we went from the subcommittee into the committee, and Senator Thurmond will remember that we debated this hour after hour. We had amendments that were offered that would strike the language that we put in, saying in order to protect the integrity of the BRAC system, we have to close two of the ALC's and move that workload so others are going to have at least 75 percent capacity. The House said 80 percent, the Senate said 75 percent, and we debated that. We had some votes that were really close votes.  If you remember, Mr. President, we debated these and had the votes, and then there were amendments that were offered, and in the final analysis, we came out and said this bill is a good bill. This bill does things we have been trying to do for a long time. We have been trying to define what is core. Always before we have had a very loose definition that the DOD has used, and that has been acceptable, and we took their definition and put it into this bill so we will have a definition of what is core, what is necessary to be performed by the public sector in order to protect us in times of war so we do not become dependent upon some outside contractor.  So we have that definition in there. We also have another compromise that I made, and that is, one of the reasons--in a minute I am going to talk about the bidding process--we can't have any kind of bidding on this thing that is fair to the public sector is because they cannot do the same things the private sector can do. So we put in a teaming provision. That is to say that the public sector can do what the private sector can do. Let's take Tinker Air Force base in Oklahoma City. If Tinker Air Force base wants to compete for some of the workload that private contractors in Texas are currently trying to hold, they cannot subcontract out or have teaming arrangements with other subcontractors on work that they would like. In this bill, when we pass this authorization bill, we put a provision in here that says, yes, they can go ahead and contract out. So, if they find the private sector can do one particular function or one product more efficiently than the public sector can, then they can go ahead and do that and that work will be counted as public work in any formula.  That is a great concession, and it is one I don't mind making, because in that situation, the private sector could do the work, but we could not be held hostage because the public sector would control the contracting out of that work. They want to do it. There is not an ALC in America that doesn't want to have the capability of contracting out small parcels that might be better done while they can still protect the core condition or concern that is there.  We have things such as bundling in a package. I can tell you right now that if they continue the way they are doing it right now in trying to induce competition for these core responsibilities, that they are going to win. You cannot compete when you are operating on a playing field that isn't level.  Right now they can bundle it, and they have bundled these projects, for example, in Texas, so that only those in Texas could come out realistically and win this thing.  In our statutes, we have depreciation schedules, where the private sector can use a different schedule than the public sector. We have another provision, which I don't disapprove of, which is one that I, as mayor of Tulsa, actually had the opportunity at one time to participate in, and that is when they decided that Air Force Plant No. 3 in Tulsa, OK, was no longer inventory that the Air Force wanted and wanted to have to keep up, we went through this process, the process of divesting ourselves of inventory we do not want: First, we let the Federal agencies look at it to see if they want it. If they want it, it is taken up there. If not, it goes to the State, and if not there, it goes to the local communities and counties.  In the case of Air Force Plant No. 3, the city of Tulsa ended up with it. What can we do now? We can take that and, at no cost, offer it to a contractor to go out there and compete. This is, I suggest, exactly what can happen and will happen if they are successful in what they call competition down at Kelly for some of the ALC work. They would be able to pick up that base that is closed, that resource worth many, many, many millions of dollars, give it, for all practical purposes, to a contractor. That contractor can submit a bid and bid against any of the remaining ALCs at no cost for overhead.  So here we are in Utah or Georgia or in Oklahoma saying we are going to have to pay for all of this overhead in our bid, we have to account for that some way, and they get something free. No, we can't bid. I don't care if we gave them a 20-percent advantage, there is no way we could do that, and we shouldn't be talking about that anyway because the issue here is national defense. Are we going to be capable, Mr. President, of defending America, of handling those core issues and concerns within the public sector?  I have to share something, because the very eloquent Senator from Texas quoted a number of people, and I would like to suggest to you, Mr. President, that of the eight members of the BRAC committee, only one who came out for privatization in place as something that is reasonable. I would like to read to you what some of the other Commissioners said. This comes from Commissioner Steele. She said:       The Commission was, in general, supportive of privatization      of DOD industrial activities where appropriate. However,      privatization as a concept and forced privatization in place      of what is clearly excess depot capacity are two very      different issues.       In the specific case of Sacramento and San Antonio ALCs,      the Commission was very aware that we were recommending the      closure of two very large industrial activities. The      Commission's recommendation to consolidate these workloads,      other than common-use ground-communication and electronics      work, ``to other DOD depots or to private sector commercial      activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance      Council. Move the required equipment * * * to the receiving      locations''--       ``To the receiving locations,'' that means a location other      than Kelly Air Force Base and other than McClellan out in      California, because you still don't resolve the problem, if      you merely privatize in place and end up with five, so to      say, ALCs all operating at 50-percent capacity.       Forced privatization in place of all of the workload is      contrary to the intent of Report language.  She says, further reading toward the end of the letter:       The Commission clearly did not intend to privatize in place      all of the workload from the 2 ALCs we voted to close, as      noted in our Findings, ``closure * * * permits significantly      improved utilization of the remaining depots and reduces DOD      operating costs.'' Where the Commission encourages      privatization in place, our Report addresses it directly * *      *  And she cites the page numbers.       Such was not the case with the ALCs.  Finally:       If any Commissioner had offered a motion--  Listen, Mr. President--       If any Commissioner had offered a motion to privatize in      place, as the President proposes, I am 100-percent certain      that such a motion would have been defeated handily.  This is Wendi Steele, a Commissioner who went through all the processes. I won't go through the whole letter from Commissioner Lee Kling, but I will read the last paragraph of his letter. Now keep in mind, these are two of the eight Commissioners. We have letters from all but former Senator Dixon.  He says:       The Commission's review clearly documented significant      excess capacity in the five Air Force Air Logistic Centers.      Privatization in place of all of the workload of Sacramento      and San Antonio Air Logistic Centers could result in little      or no savings to the Air Force by the closures. Further, it      might result in privatizing excess capacity rather than      eliminating it and could also miss the opportunity to improve      the efficiency of other DOD depots by increasing their      utilization.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these letters from Commissioner Wendi Steele and Commissioner Kling printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          The Defense Base Closure                                   and Realignment Commission,                                Arlington, VA, September 21, 1995.     Hon. J.C. Watts, Jr.     U.S. House of Representatives,     Washington, DC.       Dear Representative Watts: Thank you for your letter of      September 15 and questions regarding the issue of      privatization in place for the workload of the Sacramento and      San Antonio Air Logistics Centers.       The Commission was, in general, supportive of privatization      of DoD industrial activities where appropriate. However,      privatization as a concept and forced privatization in place      of what is clearly excess depot capacity are two very      different issues.       In the specific cases of the Sacramento and San Antonio      ALCs, the Commission was very aware that we were recommending      the closure of two very large industrial activities. The      Commission's recommendation to consolidate these workloads,      other than common-use ground-communication and electronics      work, ``to other DoD depots or to private sector commercial      activities as determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance      Council. Move the required equipment . . . to the receiving      locations'' was intended to move that workload to the most      cost-effective and operationally sound location after     closure of the ALCs and elimination of that capacity.       We felt that the Depot Maintenance Council, rather than the      Air Force. Would be in the best position to proceed in good      faith to maximize efficiencies by determining what portions      of that workload should be interserviced, moved to another      ALC or transferred to the private sector (not necessarily      ``in place''). Forced privatization in place of all of the      workload is contrary to the intent of our Report language.       The only instance I am aware of the Commission specifically      discussing the possibility of significant ALC privatization      in place, or a government owned/contractor operated facility      (GO/CO), was the C-5 work at Kellly (excluding engines). That      would assume it could be accomplished by a private contractor      at that location for less than the savings and efficiencies      which would be realized by moving it. By all of our measures,      it appeared that the long-term savings to DoD would be      substantial by moving that workload to another ALC, but we      did not want to pre-determine the outcome of a complete and      fair analysis by the Depot Maintenance Council, which the      President's proposal disallows.       Though the Commission did not direct the engine work to      move to another ALC, our Findings state, ``The Commission      urges the Air Force to consolidate engine maintenance      activity at Tinker to reduce excess capacity. The Commission      firmly believes that consolidation of engine activities will      result in lower costs and increased efficiencies.''       Privatization in place of all the workload of the 2 closing      ALCs would enhance our national security posture only when:      Moving the work to another DoD depot or to a private activity      would have unmanageable operational/readiness risk; the costs      to move the work would outweigh the long-term efficiencies      and savings which would be realized (capacity utilization,      reduction in overhead, etc.); or a truly unique capability or      strategically important redundancy would be lost or unable to      be cost-effectively replicated elsewhere in the public or      private sector.       It's important to remember that both DoD and the      Commission's review clearly documented significant excess      capacity in the 5 ALCs. Privatization in place of all of the      workload of Sacramento and San Antonio would result in      shifting excess capacity to what appears would be a      competitively protected segment of the private sector rather      than eliminating it, and further, would miss the opportunity      to improve the efficiency of the other DoD depots.       The Commission clearly did not intend to privatize in place      all of the workload from the 2 ALCs we voted to close, as      noted in our Findings, ``closure * * * permits significantly      improved utilization of the remaining depots and reduces DoD      operating costs.'' Where the Commission encouraged      privatization in place, our Report addresses it directly (see      pgs. 1-58 to 1-61). Such was not the case with the ALCs.       Moreover, not allowing the remaining ALCs--all of which      ranked higher in military value--to compete for the      additional workload, will cause them to become increasingly      less cost-competitive in the future. Even beyond common sense      issues of most effectively utilizing our limited defense      resources, I am at a loss to understand why it would be in      the Air Force's best interest to protect its lowest ranking      depots at the expense of its 3 superior installations.       As difficult as it was to vote for the closure of 2      facilities of this size and quality, the Commission voted 6-2      to do so because we felt that it was in the best interest of      the Air Force, DoD, and the American taxpayers. If any      Commissioner had offered a motion to privatize in place, as      the President proposes, I am 100% certain that such a motion      would have been defeated handily.       Representative Watts, I hope I have answered your      questions. Please feel free to contact me if I might be of      further service on this or any other matter.           Highest regards,                                                  Wendi L. Steele,     Commissioner.                                                                    ____                                                 S. Lee Kling,                                St. Louis, MO, September 29, 1995.     Hon. J.C. Watts, Jr.     Congress of the United States, House of Representatives,          Washington, DC.       Dear Congressman Watts: Thank you for your recent letter      concerning the issue of privatization in place for the      workload of the Sacramento and San Antonio Air Logistics      Centers. I certainly understand your interest in this      question.       As Chairman Dixon noted in his July 8 letter to Deputy      Secretary of Defense John White, the Commission was generally      very supportive of the concept of privatization of DoD      industrial and commercial activities. This is consistent with      the May, 1995 Report of the Commission on Roles and Missions      of the Armed Forces, which concluded that ``with proper      oversight, private contractors could provide essentially all      of the depot-level maintenance services now conducted in      government facilities within the United States.''      Privatization is very beneficial in certain situations but      not all.       In specific cases of Sacramento and San Antonio Air      Logistics Centers, the Commission was very aware that we were      recommending the closure of two very large industrial      activities. The Commission's recommendation to consolidate      the workloads of these two Air Logistics Centers ``to other      DoD depots or to private sector commercial activities as      determined by the Defense Depot Maintenance Council'' was      intended to give the Air Force and the Secretary of Defense      the maximum flexibility to implement the closure of these two      Air Logistics Centers in a way that would eliminate excess      capacity without harming ongoing Air Force operations and      provide the greatest savings. With the exception of the      direction to move the common-use ground-communication      electronics workload currently performed at Sacramento Air      Logistics Center to Tobyhanna Army Depot, the Commission did      not direct any of the workload of McClellan or San Antonio      Air Force Bases to any specific DoD depot or to the private      sector. We felt that the Defense Department was in the best      position to make these judgments.       The Commission's review clearly documented significant      excess capacity in the five Air Force Air Logistics Centers.      Privatization in place of all of the workload of Sacramento      and San Antonio Logistics Centers could result in little or      no savings to the Air Force by the closures. Further, it      might result in privatizing excess capacity rather than      eliminating it and could also miss the opportunity to improve      the efficiency of other DoD depots by increasing their      utilization.       Thank you for your continuing interest in the base closure      process.           Kindest regards,                                                     S. Lee Kling.
