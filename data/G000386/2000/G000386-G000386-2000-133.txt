 The Senate will be in a period of morning business until 2 p.m., with Senators Durbin and Thomas in control of the time.  Following morning business, the Senate is expected to begin consideration of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill with amendments in order to that bill. Those Senators who have amendments should work with the bill managers on a time to offer their amendments as soon as possible.                          ____________________
