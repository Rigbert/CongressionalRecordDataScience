 I was actually here as a young staffer on the Judiciary Committee when Richard Nixon appointed two Supreme Court Justices who were defeated. During most of those years, our Democratic friends were in the majority here in the Senate. They could have done whatever they wanted to on the executive calendar to slow down, obstruct, and prevent Republican Presidents from having nominations confirmed.  I can remember during the Clinton years the urging of both Senator Daschle and Senator Lott--when my party was in the majority--to invoke cloture on circuit court nominees whom I opposed in order to keep the Senate from developing a process of filibustering the executive calendar, which had never been done before.  The clearest example of why it was never done before is the Clarence Thomas nomination--the most controversial nomination for the Supreme Court in history, with the possible exception of Brett Kavanaugh. He came out of committee with a dead-even vote. They could have killed him in committee. He went to the floor and was confirmed 52 to 48. We all know it only takes one Senator, just one, to make us get 60 votes on something.  Joe Biden and Ted Kennedy were hard over against Clarence Thomas, but nobody--not one of the 100 Senators--said you have to get 60 votes. Clarence Thomas was confirmed 52 to 48 and has been on the Supreme Court for 30 years. He would never have been there if a single Senator--just one--had said you had to get 60 votes. My friends, I call that a pretty firm tradition that you don't filibuster the executive calendar. Was it possible? Yes, it was possible. It just wasn't done.  When did all of this start? Well, the junior Senator from New York got elected in 1998. George W. Bush gets elected in 2000. The alarms go off. They are going to appoint a bunch of crazy rightwingers to the circuit courts.  So my good friend the Democratic leader, at a seminar or a meeting, invited a couple of people named Laurence Tribe and Cass Sunstein--two rather famous liberal law professors--and they had a discussion about what to do about these awful rightwing judges who are going to be sent up.  The conclusion was to open the toolbox, take out whatever tool would work, and save America from these kinds of people. And so they did. The poster child for that was Miguel Estrada, who they said openly they were afraid was going to give President Bush the opportunity to make the firstHispanic appointment to the Supreme Court. We had all-night filibusters. We actually stayed up all night trying to make a point.  It didn't make a difference. Ultimately, we thought maybe we should employ the so-called nuclear option. We ended up not doing it after there was a gang of 14 that developed and worked out an agreement, and some of the nominees were confirmed and some weren't. Yet what had been clearly established was that now the norm in the Senate was that you filibuster anybody that you want to on the executive calendar. That had then been established as a matter of practice, and that continued through the Bush years. There was actually an effort to keep Justice Alito from being on the Supreme Court by requiring a filibuster for the purpose of defeating Justice Alito, but it was not successful. A number of circuit judges were stopped.  When we fast-forward to the Obama years, our side used the filibuster twice to defeat two circuit judges over a period of 5\1/2\ years. Majority Leader Harry Reid decided, in his zeal, to pack the DC Circuit--that this had gone on long enough. So, in November 2013, I believe it was, the nuclear option was employed. The threshold was lowered to 51 for everybody on the Executive Calendar except for the Supreme Court. The DC Circuit court judges were confirmed. At the time, I said I didn't like the way it was done. I thought maybe those on the other side would rue the day they did it.  Amazingly enough, about a year and a half later, I was the majority leader. Funny how these things change, isn't it?  A number of my Members came up and said: Why don't we change it back.  I said: Look, I don't think we like the way they did it, but this is the way the Executive Calendar was handled for 200 years until Senator Schumer and his allies Laurence Tribe and a cast unseen said: Well, why don't we use any tool in the toolbox to stop judicial appointments?  I discouraged our going back to 60 because I had actually seen that both sides had respected their using a simple majority on the Executive Calendar down to 2003, so we didn't.  Now, look, with regard to these continued complaints about Merrick Garland, that is not what this proposal is about. This proposal is about sub-Cabinet appointments and district judges. For those of you who were not here in 2013, it is almost identical to what almost every one of you voted for in 2013--a standing order that lasted 2 years and a good number of us giving President Obama the opportunity to advance these sub-Cabinet appointments and district judges more quickly.  Let's talk about district judges for a minute. Chairman Grassley and Chairman Graham honored the blue slip for district judges. There are 47 of you guys. There is not a single district judge who comes out here on the calendar who doesn't have two blue slips returned from whomever the Senators are from the home State. What that means is that you guys are not irrelevant on district judge appointments. You are not irrelevant. For example, I tried to get my good friend the Democratic leader to approve a list of 30 district judges last fall, and 14 of them were from blue States. Oh, no. He was not going to do any district judges on a voice vote even if he were for them.  So, look, all this proposal does that we are talking about today is reduce the postcloture time for sub-Cabinet appointments--just like we helped you all do in 2013--and for district judges, none of whom will even be on the calendar until both blue slips are returned positively. It is not exactly a radical change.  Back to Merrick Garland for a minute. Look, I made the decision--and my colleagues on the Republican side joined me in making that decision--because I knew for sure, for absolute certainty, that if the roles were reversed and there were a Republican President and a Democratic Senate, you wouldn't have filled the vacancy. How did I know that? You have to go back to the 1880s to find the last time a vacancy on the Supreme Court occurred in the middle of a Presidential election year and was confirmed by a Senate of a different party from the President's--1880.  Oh, but that was not enough. In 1992, our friend Joe Biden, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, with a Republican in the White House, a Democratic Senate, and no vacancy on the Supreme Court, helpfully opined that if a vacancy occurred, he wouldn't fill it.  Oh, but guess what. Eighteen months before the end of the Bush 43 term, the majority leader of the Senate, Harry Reid, and a fellow named Chuck Schumer said that if a vacancy occurred, they wouldn't fill it. That was 18 months before the end of the Bush term.  On the business of filibustering the Executive Calendar, there is one thing I left out, and I want to catch up here. Back in 2003, when my good friend the Democratic leader started all of this that we have been wrestling with since then, he said: I am the leader of the filibuster movement, and I am proud of it. The Buffalo News, May 27, 2003. I am the leader of the filibuster movement, and I am proud of it. The Buffalo News. Charles E. Schumer recommended using an extreme tactic--a filibuster--to block some of the Bush administration's nominees for Federal judgeships. Talk about being proud of something. He started this whole thing that we have been wrestling with since 2003. He cooked it up and convinced his colleagues to do it, and once it started, it continued until 2013 when it was turned off.  So, look, where are we? The Executive Calendar is very close to being returned to the way it was treated by both parties down to 2000--not the legislative calendar but the Executive Calendar. There is nothing radical about this. He is acting like it is a sad day for the Senate. If you want to pick a sad day for the Senate, go back to 2003 when we started filibustering the Executive Calendar. He started it. That was a sad day. This is a glad day. We are trying to end the dysfunction on the Executive Calendar.  Let's talk about dysfunction. There were 128 cloture votes in the last Congress, many of them on nominees for whom there were no objections at all--128. Goodness gracious. In the first 2 years of each of the last six Presidents, cumulatively, the majority leader of whichever party had to do that 24 times in order to try to advance a nomination.  So don't hand me any of this ``sad day in the Senate'' stuff. What has been going on here is completely and totally unacceptable. Do you know why I know that? It is because many of your Members, Mr. Leader, have told me privately that they would be happy to do this provided it would take effect in January 2021. Oh, what might happen in January 2021? I can't imagine. Well, it might be a Democratic President and a Democratic Senate. I can understand--but, oh, not now.  Look, we know you don't like Donald Trump, but there was an election. He is at least entitled to set up the administration and make it function. With regard to the judiciary and circuit judges, every President of both parties feels it is his prerogative.  Senator Alexander has pointed out the history of the blue slip. There has been a little confusion about that. He has noted that blue slips were not used as an absolute veto over judicial nominees until--listen to this--the 1950s, when former Judiciary Committee Chairman James Eastland of Mississippi afforded them the status because he did not want Federal judges who had been appointed by President Eisenhower to interfere with segregationist policies in the Jim Crow South. When he became the Judiciary Committee chairman, our former colleague Ted Kennedy restored blue slips to their historical purpose of ensuring consultation as opposed to serving as a one-Member veto of a qualified judicial nominee.  All we have done is restore blue slips for circuit court nominees to the consultative function they have played for most of their history.  I have been under Presidents of both parties. They do not defer to us on circuit court judges. We don't get to pick them. We almost do get to pick them when they are district court judges and when we are of the same party as the White House. We have a lot of clout because the chairmen honor the blue slips for district court judges. They are entirely contained within our States, and none of them get out here on the floor unless the Senators approvethem. There are 47 of these guys over here who are not toothless when it comes to district judges.  So this is not a bad day for the Senate; this is a day we end this completely outrageous level of interference and obstruction with this administration. I don't think anybody ought to be seized with guilt over any institutional damage being done to the Senate.                             Point of Order  Mr. President, I raise a point of order that postcloture time under rule XXII for all executive branch nominations other than a position at level 1 of the Executive Schedule under section 5312 of title 5 of the United States Code is 2 hours.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cotton). Under rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, the point of order is not sustained.                       Appeal Ruling of the Chair  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I appeal the ruling of the Chair and ask for the yeas and nays.
