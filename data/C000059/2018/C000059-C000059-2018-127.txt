Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to our region have been exceptional. After serving 16 years on the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, my good friend Marion Ashley will be stepping down.  Marion is a native of Riverside County, a member of a pioneer Perris Valley family, and has long shown his deep commitment to the people of Riverside County. He attended local schools: Perris Union High School, Riverside City College and graduated San Diego State University with a major in Business Management. Marion spent years in the private sector as a CPA with a national accounting firm, a corporate executive, a banker, and established a real estate investment firm. He also served the public as a Riverside County Planning Commissioner from 1973 to 1981, and was elected to a serve on the Board of the Eastern Municipal Water District from 1992 to 2002.  In 2002, Marion was elected to the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, where he has become a respected leader on regional issues. As a County Supervisor he oversees a budget of $5.3 billion and sets public policy for nearly 2.4 million people. Marion's leadership has made a tremendous impact on a variety of initiatives critical to Riverside County's future, including the Riverside County Integrated Project, the Perris Valley Metrolink Line, and the construction of numerous public safety and transportation infrastructure projects. For the benefit of future generations, Marion and his family have donated hundreds of acres of land in the hills west of Perris to help create a permanent wildlife refuge and supported countless charitable causes.  Marion has contributed immensely to the betterment of our region and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. To conclude, Mr. Speaker I want to thank Marion for his service to the Inland Empire--his dedication, insight and passion will be greatly missed.                          ____________________
