 Related to the budget conference, Mr. Leader, do you expect that we will have a debt limit vote on the floor either as a part of the conference report or as a freestanding bill of some type or other in the week to come?  Mr. DeLAY. If the gentleman would yield, the gentleman is very well aware that we reinstituted a very important rule called the Gephardt rule that includes in the budget conference report the number that is needed in order to raise the debt ceiling. So the vote on the conference report as far as the House is concerned is the vote on the debt ceiling.
