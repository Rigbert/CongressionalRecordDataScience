Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, this amendment was written with the cooperation of not only the staff but cooperation of the outdoors coalition. It was written and reviewed. They are supporting this, those people who directly use this.  I have things in here that a lot of people would not vote for. I have trapping, hunting, fishing. Those are the things I would like to see left in this bill because it is part of wildlife rehabilitation and wildlife restoration.  Again, I suggest, respectfully, the amendment as offered is so broad it defeats all the purposes that we have worked for to try to have the wildlife included in this bill.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore (Mr. Quinn). All time has expired on the discussion of the amendment.  The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Idaho (Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.
