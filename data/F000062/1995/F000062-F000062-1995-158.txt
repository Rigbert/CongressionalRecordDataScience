  Mr. President, the bill, as presently drafted, would deny cash and noncash welfare benefits to naturalized citizens. The Constitution of the United States provides for one class of citizens, and the only place it diverges is with respect to the President of the United States.  In every other case, a naturalized citizen is as good as a native-born citizen. I believe it is extraordinarily important that this amendment be adopted. It is supported by the American Bar Association, by the Governor's conference, by the State legislatures, by Mayor Giuliani, by Mayor Riordan of Los Angeles, by virtually a whole host of organizations. It would be my hope that in this bill we do not, for the first time in American history, create two classes of American citizens.
