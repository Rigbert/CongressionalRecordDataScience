Shows), and I hope that he will take back to his dad our thanks, not just from those of us who have heard him speak tonight, but from a grateful Nation.  I think we all agree with Tom Brokaw that this was one of the great generations of all time in this country who, when the challenges came, knew that the costs would be high, but they were willing to pay it.  My opinion is the American public knows that freedom is not free, that keeping our promises to our veterans is not free, that paying down that debt is not free. They have to pay down their debt all the time, and they know that, when they do, their families are better off. The gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Shows) makes the point that that is what we need to do as well, and I appreciate his contribution.  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Dicks), one of our most distinguished senior members of the Congress of the United States who, in my opinion, is one of probably 10 of the real experts on defense issues and the readiness issues and the status of our Armed Forces here and around the world that we have in the Congress of the United States.  He is from Washington State. He has been a Member of Congress for over 20 years. He is the second ranking member on the Committee on Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, and I am very pleased that he joined us tonight.
