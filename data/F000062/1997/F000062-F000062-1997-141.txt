 President, I support Senator Murray's amendment to repeal the provision of current law that prohibits a woman in the armed services from using her own funds to pay for an abortion in an overseas U.S. military facility. I support this amendment for several reasons.  First, under several Supreme Court decisions, a woman clearly has a right to choose. A woman does not give up that right or it is not obliterated because she serves in the U.S. military or is married to a U.S. servicemember.  Second, women based in the United States and using a military facility in this country are not prohibited from using their own funds to pay for an abortion. Barring the use of U.S. military facilities overseas creates a double standard for military women and an undue hardship on women servicemembers stationed overseas.  Third, women may not have ready access to private facilities in other countries. Abortion is illegal in some foreign countries, like the Philippines. A woman stationed in that country or the spouse of a servicemember would need to fly to the United States or to another country--at her own expense--to obtain an abortion. Most servicemembers cannot easily bear the expense of jetting off to Switzerland for medical treatment.  Fourth, if women do not have access to military facilities or to private facilities in the country where they are stationed, they could endanger their own health by the time it takes to get to a facility in another country or by being forced to get treatment by someone other than a licensed physician.  We know from personal experience in this country that when abortion is illegal, desperate women resort to unsafe and life-threatening methods. If it were your wife, or your daughter, would you want her in the hands of an untrained, unknown person on the back streets of Manila or Cordoba, Argentina? Or would you prefer that she be treated by a trained physician in a U.S. military facility?
