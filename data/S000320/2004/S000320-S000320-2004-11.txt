 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. John Hicks, a veteran administrator of the University of Alabama System who, after a quarter-century of service, will retire on August 31, 2004. John has made tremendous contributions to the institution through his dedication to educational excellence, and I am pleased to congratulate him today.  John has served as a member of the University of Alabama management team since 1979, most recently as executive assistant to the chancellor and secretary of the board of trustees of the University of Alabama. Recognized nationally for his accomplishments in higher education administration, John has made countless contributions to the university.  John has been an integral part of the university's efforts to recruit senior leadership, resulting in the selection of 10 campus presidents and four chancellors. Additionally, John's responsibilities at the university include oversight of the activities and meetings of the board of trustees as well as leadership in strategic planning and crisis management issues.  As ambassador of the University of Alabama system in the U.S. and abroad, John has represented the Board and its entities in activities of the Association of Governing Boards of American Colleges and Universities, the American Council on Education, the College and University Personnel Association, the Japan-America Society of Alabama, and the National Association of State Universities and Land Grant Colleges. In addition to his responsibilities with the university system, John still finds time to actively participate in the community by serving on the Alabama Shakespeare Festival Theatre Authority and boards of the Alabama School of Math and Science, the Kentuck Festival, and A Women's Place, a shelter for women and children in Tuscaloosa, AL. He is a member of the 2004 class of Leadership Alabama and Christ Episcopal Church.  John received a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial economics/administration and finance from Purdue University and a Master of Arts from the Eastern Michigan University. John and his wife Kirsten Boyd Hicks are the parents of three grown children and have two grandchildren.  John has served the University of Alabama community with dedication and a sincere commitment to make the university a better place. The university will, indeed, miss him, but I am certain he will maintain his presence and leadership within the Tuscaloosa community. Today, I want to congratulate John on the occasion of his retirement and wish him and his family the very best.                          ____________________
