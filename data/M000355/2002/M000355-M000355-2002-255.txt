 But if in fact that is the way it is, I have enjoyed the debates we have had over the years. If it ends up that we don't have these anymore, I will sort of miss them in a perverse sort of way.  I want to say that, with regard to the hard money issue, which the Senator from Arizona knows I care deeply about--and he has been supportive of that as well--I think great progress has been made on that subject in the bill of which the Senator from Arizona was a principal sponsor, which left the Senate and passed the House. Both candidates and parties have been operating under hard dollar limits set at a time when a Mustang cost $2,700. We did a study of the cost to candidates over a 6-year term, and for the typical candidate in America over a 6-year term, the cost of running the same campaign he ran 6 years before is up 40 percent. So certainly that is a good feature in the bill.  Again, I commend the Senator from Arizona for his steadfast interest in this issue, and he has been a great competitor.  I admire him greatly. We will be prepared to deal with this issue after the recess.  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Kentucky for his kind words. I do want to say, I may not miss it at all.  (Laughter.)  My friend from Wisconsin is here. We shared the very wonderful moment last night with our colleagues in the House and Congressman Meehan and Congressman Shays. It was quite a remarkable time. I am glad to have been able to be a part of this process.  I say again, the opposition has been principled, honorable, and ferocious. That is in the tradition of the Senate.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
