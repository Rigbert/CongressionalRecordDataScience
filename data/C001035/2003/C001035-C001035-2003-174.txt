Feingold) submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:                             S. Con. Res. 8       Whereas visiting nurse associations (VNAs) are nonprofit      home health agencies that, for over 120 years, have been      united in their mission to provide cost-effective and      compassionate home and community-based health care to      individuals, regardless of the individuals' condition or      ability to pay for services;       Whereas there are approximately 500 visiting nurse      associations, which employ more than 90,000 clinicians,      provide health care to more than 4,000,000 people each year,      and provide a critical safety net in communities by      developing a network of community support services that      enable individuals to live independently at home;       Whereas visiting nurse associations have historically      served as primary public health care providers in their      communities, and are today one of the largest providers of      mass immunizations in the medicare program (delivering over      2,500,000 influenza immunizations annually);       Whereas visiting nurse associations are often the home      health providers of last resort, serving the most chronic of      conditions (such as congestive heart failure, chronic      obstructive pulmonary disease, AIDS, and quadriplegia) and      individuals with the least ability to pay for services (more      than 50 percent of all medicaid home health admissions are by      visiting nurse associations);       Whereas any visiting nurse association budget surplus is      reinvested in supporting the association's mission through      services, including charity care, adult day care centers,      wellness clinics, Meals-on-Wheels, and immunization programs;       Whereas visiting nurse associations and other nonprofit      home health agencies care for the highest percentage of      terminally ill and bedridden patients;       Whereas thousands of visiting nurse association volunteers      across the Nation devote time serving as individual agency      board members, raising funds, visiting patients in their      homes, assisting in wellness clinics, and delivering meals to      patients;       Whereas the establishment of an annual National Visiting      Nurse Association Week would increase public awareness of the      charity-based missions of visiting nurse associations and of      their ability to meet the needs of chronically ill and      disabled individuals who prefer to live at home rather than      in a nursing home, and would spotlight preventive health      clinics, adult day care programs, and other customized      wellness programs that meet local community needs; and       Whereas the second week in May is an appropriate week to      establish as national Visiting Nurse Association Week: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That Congress--       (1) designates the second week in May each year as      ``National Visiting Nurse Association Week''; and       (2) requests that the President issue a proclamation      calling upon the people of the United States to observe the      week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
