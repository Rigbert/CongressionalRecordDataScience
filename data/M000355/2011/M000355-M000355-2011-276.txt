 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a devoted and hardworking Kentuckian. Ms. Opal Overbey has been honored in her hometown and will have her life story submitted to the Library of Congress for being an extraordinary woman who dedicated her life to her family and her work.  Born December 2, 1929, on Tom Cat Trail in Laurel County, KY, Opal was the fourth of eight children. Growing up, Opal remembers a childhood filled with love, laughter and hard work. Following the guidance of her parents--her mother, a committed housewife and her dad, a diligent farmer--she learned that a little hard work and determination goes a long way. Driven by a desire to be independent and earn her own money, Opal worked two jobs. After many years at the local laundromat as well as working part time at the Crystal Kitchen, Opal moved into a small room in a house behind a jeweler with her cousins. Soon after, she met her husband of 62 years, Virgil Overbey.  When Opal was 17 she and Virgil got married. Together they had four children. Being a mother at a young age was a difficult feat to master, but Opal was determined to give her children a childhood similar to her own. As they got older, her eldest son Jim found a common interest with his mom, and together they built a greenhouse supplying flowers and crops for the community. After Virgil Overbey's unfortunate death on November 24, 2008, the greenhouse was a way for the family to stay together and enjoy each other's company while doing something they all loved.  Opal's greenhouse business continues today. She says that working at the greenhouse has always been a pleasurable experience, but it's the people and the customers that make it worthwhile: ``I think in life you have to just work and treat people right, and be honest and the Lord will bless you.'' Her children have grown up and started families of their own, and Opal continues to help in any way that she can.  Kentucky is fortunate to have a hardworking and devoted woman like Opal Overbey. At 81 years of age, Opal has lived a lifetime of service to her community. I am sure her children Jim, Denver, Glenda, and Evelyn, as well as her whole family, are very proud of everything that she has accomplished and provided for her loved ones.  Mr. President, the Laurel County Sentinel Echo recently published an article highlighting Ms. Opal Overbey's life and career. I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows:          [From the Sentinel Echo, Laurel County, June 8, 2011                   London's Living Treasures: Part 3       In the third installment of the Living Treasures project,      we meet 81-year-old Opal Overbey, a fixture at Overbey's      Greenhouse on Ky. 229. The only Living Treasure nominee who      is a native of Laurel County, Overbey shared her life story,      one that is characterized by love of family, love of the land      and a tireless work ethic.       ``I was born Dec. 2, 1929 here in Laurel County on Tom Cat      Trail near Bush. My mother just raised all us youngin's, she      was a housewife, and my dad farmed everything, tobacco, corn,      whatever people grew then. He had about 80 acres of      pastureland. He was a good, honest man. My mom was the same.      There was eight of us, six sisters and two brothers. I was      the fourth child down.       I had a happy childhood. Honey, we just played and had fun      and worked also. Dad always made us hoe corn and whatever he      was doing. He learned us to work. But we would play Hoopy      Hide, tag, hopscotch, whatever kids played at that time. We      used to take washes down to the creek where the water     was. And we'd swim, we had a good swimming hole place. That      was fun-fun, we loved that. We had a childhood that was as      normal as normal could be.       I went to Weaver School, a one-room school. We would walk      to school, to and from it was probably about three miles. I      wasn't in particularly a great student. I really didn't like      school; I would rather stay home and wash clothes or      something, if she would let me. I didn't really like any      subject, except recess.       Whenever I was a kid you didn't go to the store to get what      you needed, you put it up in the summertime. That was what      she fed us on. She had a big garden, potatoes. corn, beans,      cucumbers, just anything she could get seed for. She saved      quite a lot of seed and kids used to go around and sell      packets of seed back then and that's how she would get      cucumber and beets and stuff like that.       My chores were milking, gathering the eggs, cleaning up,      dishes, drawing water, we drew our water out of a well, you      know. Mom caught her wash water when it came off the house.      No plumbing, not when I was home, no electricity.       We had a big house with plenty of room. It was like      everybody else's house then. It was made of weatherboarding.      Our nearest neighbors were about a quarter of a mile away. A      lot of them was my relatives. Uncle Perry and Aunt Rhilde      Root and Ed and Polly Jones lived real close to us.       I had an uncle, Charlie, that got a radio, and we would go      listen to the Grand Ole Opry at Uncle Charlie's on Saturday      night. I was probably 6 or 8 years old. We would just sit      around and listen at the radio.       We went to Flatwoods Christian Church. That was the only      place we had to go. We went there quite a lot. I liked to go      to church. Everybody in the community went, it was just a      gathering place. You didn't have no movies or anything like      that back then. Sometimes mom would take us all to a      neighbor's house and we'd have dinner. Sometimes they went      over with us. We had a real close neighborhood there, very      good people.       Our mother basically made all of our dresses until we were      big enough to work and earn them ourselves. I remember one      dress in particular. Back then, I don't know if I was a state      thing or something, anyway, we got some free clothes. That      was my first ready-made dress and I never forgot that. It was      just a solid brown, cotton summer dress, but it was made      pretty and I loved it.       I was probably about 12 when I stopped going to school. I      didn't get very much schooling. I wasn't interested in      continuing. I just wanted to work.       I went to London and got me a little job in the laundry,      and I worked there for Mr. Terry until me and Virgil got      married. They had these presses and usually I pressed jeans      and passed them on to somebody else. Me and a couple of my      cousins, Eula Mao Smith and Deloris Smith, we got us a room      in a big house that sat back from Barton's Jewelry Store and      I worked, part-time now, not all the time.       London was pretty low back then. I remember when they had      boards for the sidewalks. People tied their horses and their      wagons at the foot of Manchester Street, where it started      leveling out. Going out from London, it was on the left. Then      they finally got Black Brothers buses running from Manchester      to London, and then we still had to walk two or three miles      down to catch that bus. A lot of walking went on back in them      days. I went home every weekend on that bus.       I guess I got grown before my time and I wanted to work.      I'm thinking I made about 20 cents an hour. I believe, best I      can remember. I made $18 to $25 a week, but that was good      money then. I always tried to buy me an outfit. You could buy      one for a little bit of nothing, and I'd get me a new dress      or a new something or other each week. I liked working.      Honey, I liked making money, that's mostly what you worked      for, ain't it? I worked off and on at the laundry for three      or four years. I also worked at a restaurant part-time too,      Crystal Kitchen. It was right by the bank, it was First      National then. I would serve cheeseburgers and hot dogs and      that's basically what we did. But when dad had gardening and      stuff going on, I worked at home. That's why I only worked      part-time. He'd let me work if we didn't have anything to do      on the farm.       Honey, I met Virgil, who would become my husband, about      three times. Before I even knew who he was, he'd always try      to take me home. The first time I met him it was way on      Blackwater or Cane Creek. We had took a cousin home and      that's where I met him first. I was very young, probably 15.       When I first went out with him was probably maybe six or      eights months after that. He was the nephew of my aunt that      lived across the creek there. That was a great courtship.      First place we went was to Renfro Valley. That was actually      my first date with him. Honey, we got there too late for the      first show so we just didn't wait for the second one, we come      back home. Didn't even get to go in. I was sort of      disappointed, but was having a good time. I knew right away      that I liked Virgil. He was just a nice person. He was      someone you was comfortable with.       I was barely 17 when we married. He was 23. He had just got      out of the Army, he was in World War II. He asked me to marry      him when I was 16, but I said, ``Wait 'til I get 17.'' When I      was, he just plain asked, we just set the date right after he      asked me. I think maybe then I was staying with one of my      aunts where she was having baby. I did that a lot when I was      a kid. I worked all the time. I think that was my hobby.       We married Jan. 23, 1943. Lived here ever since. He had a      couple of uncles that drove taxis and that's how we got to      London to get married. Back then, you didn't have a big      wedding. We got married by Morgan Williams, he was a preacher      back then, at the courthouse. My aunt and uncle went with us      to sign me. Honey, I wore a pretty, little, blue cotton      dress, don't remember what I paid for it but it wasn't much.      Then we took a taxi back.       We lived together almost 62 years. We stayed with his      mother and dad for a week or two and we moved in this house.      Virgil built it. Over the years, we just done things we      wanted to the house. At the time, he went to work at a      sawmill and worked there for a few years and then he went to      Chaney's logging. Then he went straight into farming. That's      basically what we've always done.       I was 18 when had my first child, my son Jim. Then three      years later, I had Denver. Later on, I had two girls, Glenda      and Evelyn was the baby. I had Evelyn six years after Glenda.      I spread 'em out. I had little children there for about 20      years.       I remember having Jim. It was terrible. I had him at home,      you know. Doctor Walthen, he came to the house. I think he      was born about 2 in the morning. Doctor Walthen stayed I      think a couple of nights because I had false labor. He hunted      him a bed and went to sleep and stayed until Jim was born.       Once he was born, I just loved him to death--like any      mother that's a good mother loves her children. Being a young      mother, that took a little training. Virgil's mother, Nanny      Overbey, she come every day and bathed the baby and did      whatever needed to be done. I was grateful for her help      because I didn't know the first thing.       I raised my children how I was raised. My kids played      outside a lot. My days were getting up and cooking for them      and doing my washing. I always cooked 'em three meals a day      so that takes a good part of your day right there. Honey, I      canned a lot, and potatoes saved a lot of lives back then. Of      a morning, you'd fry eggs. Virgil always kept us plenty of      meat in the freezer, so I'd fix meat and gravy, everybody      always had gravy then, and biscuits. I cooked full meals      then. That was how I was raised too. That's one thing you      done, you ate good.       Honey, we had enough to get by on. You didn't have any      bills back then. There was no bills to pay, so you just fed      your family and bought what you had to buy and did whatever      you had to do. We sure wasn't rich by no means, but we got      by.       We got electricity the evening after Jim was born, on the      19th of October in '43. Oh, that was great. Got a      refrigerator and a washer and the few things you had to have      then. That beat washing on the board.       Jim was the leader. He always made sure they caught the bus      on time; he was very reliable. They went to Camp Ground. They      liked school pretty well. Well, Denver didn't, but Jim      graduated from high school. My oldest girl got married about      15 and Evelyn started high school, and quit.       When Jim was about 9, he sold the first bushel of beans we      ever sold. Set up on the road, it was just a gravel road back      then. I think he got $1.50 or $2. Jim was like me, he liked      to make money, he liked to have something going all the time.      He was very inventive. From there, we just kept planting      other stuff. It was right up my alley because we like to do      the same thing. Selling, I was better at selling than      anything else, that's what I liked to do. Both of my grandads      had little country stores so I had that in me.       When Jim and his wife come back from Indiana, he started a      greenhouse on the porch. Of an evening, we'd go and pick      beans after we'd close from selling. We'd sell up near the      road at first and several years ago, we backed off of the      road when the main road come through, it got too dangerous.      It got so hot that one year we put fans in the greenhouse      there and that cooled us. It was a lot more comfortable when      we moved off the road.       Having a greenhouse wasn't common back then, not in this      community. It took a while. We even sold in the yard under a      tree for a while. And we'd roll our wagon with the shade as      the day wore on.       Virgil died Nov. 24, '08. We lived together 62 years and      that was a great loss for me. He always farmed, that's what      he loved to do. And he loved working in the greenhouse and he      watered and did a lot of the greenhouse work. It was always a      family affair, we all worked.       Jim still runs the greenhouse and I just help him a little      whenever I can, which is basically every day, except Sunday.      Honey, I still work anywhere from eight to 10 hours a day. I      go over there at 8 and we was closing at 6, but now we're      there 'til 7 or 7:30. But I don't do a lot of work back in      the greenhouse. I like visiting with people. It's just what I      like.       Since Virgil's gone, we don't do a whole lot of gardening.      He was our plower, our planter, everything. He was a good      farmer, Virgil was. I've worked ever since just for my      children, help my youngin's, that's what I like to do. I like      to talk and visit with people and I meet so many nice people.      I do anything I can to help someone who comes along, that's      my nature. I think in life you have to just work and treat      people right, and be honest and the Lord will bless you.''                          ____________________
