Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend and my colleague from Massachusetts for yielding me time.  Today we should be doing one thing, providing housing for people who need it. I must tell you, Mr. Chairman, I am deeply disturbed that we would add language to this bill to prohibit nonprofit organizations and groups, churches, synagogues, mosques, from engaging in civic participation, activity like nonpartisan voter regulation and get-out-the-vote drives. That is wrong. That is dead wrong.
