. 1628, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. The motion is supported by Senators Blumenthal and Carper.  Some of the strongest opponents to the secretive and devastating Republican repeal effort are our hospitals, especially our rural hospitals, critical access hospitals, and safety net hospitals in underserved urban communities.  In particular, they warn us that the devastating cuts in Medicaid will dramatically increase uncompensated care costs.  The Illinois Hospital Association tells us that slashing Medicaid like these Republican repeal bills do will cost Illinois between 60,000 and 95,000 healthcare jobs.  You see, not only are our rural hospitals critical lifelines for healthcare in their communities, they are often the best jobs in town; yet these drastic Medicaid cuts will increase uncompensated care costs by billions, forcing cutbacks in services, staff, and expansion.  So my motion would instruct the Finance Committee to report out a bill--within 3 days--that would protect funding for these hospitals and prohibit increases in uncompensated care costs for these critical facilities.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Motion to Commit With Instructions       Mr. Durbin moves to commit the bill H.R. 1628 to the      Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pension with      instructions to report the same back to the Senate in 3 days,      not counting any day on which the Senate is not in session,      with changes that--       (1) are within the jurisdiction of such Committee; and       (2) would prohibit increases in uncompensated costs or      reductions in funding for rural hospitals, hospitals in      underserved areas, or critical access hospitals.
