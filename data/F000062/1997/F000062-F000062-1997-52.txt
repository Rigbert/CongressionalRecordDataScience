 President, I rise today to introduce legislation on campaign spending reform.  I recognize that this is not the first bill introduced in Congress on this issue. In fact, at last count, there were 85 bills introduced in either the House or the Senate on campaign finance reform--17 of them in the Senate alone.  Frankly, I would be quite satisfied if the bill I am introducing today was tabled in favor of a floor vote on the McCain-Feingold bill, of which I am a cosponsor.  Last week, all 45 Democrats in the Senate pledged to vote for McCain-Feingold if given the opportunity. Combined with the three Republican cosponsors of the bill, this legislation needs only three more votes for passage. Surely there are three more Republicans who will support this bill.  But we are not there yet, and I believe strongly that action must be taken on this subject now. Today. This Congress. This session.   This Congress has spent $10 million in taxpayer funds investigating wrongdoing in the last election cycle.   Eighty-four Members of this Congress have called for special prosecutors.   We've spent 6 months in public hearings decrying how bad the system is, how bad soft money is, and how badly we need reform.  There is nothing to hide behind if this Congress does not act on reform.  I do not believe Members of this body can or should be able to take a pass on reform based on disagreements with McCain-Feingold, or based on an all-or-nothing attitude. Therefore, I offer my legislation as a bill that contains the common denominators--the basic elements--of reform that many of us profess to agree on.  Let me state clearly; I am a cosponsor of McCain-Feingold and will votefor McCain-Feingold if it comes to the floor for approval, as I believe it should.  My legislation is an alternative, focussed on what I, and what most of my colleagues, have said are the most pressing areas in need of reform: the elimination of soft money, greater disclosure on contributions, and regulation of dollars now unregulated.  The cornerstone of any campaign reform bill must address the issue of soft money. After all the charges and disclosures about the abuse of soft money in federal campaigns, we would be hard-pressed to explain to the public why we did not take action at least on this issue.  However, just banning soft money--for which there appears to be sufficient support in both Houses--cannot be our only action. A simple ban on soft money will force the shifting of these dollars into unregulated independent expenditure campaigns where huge amounts of anonymous money is used to influence campaigns and--most commonly--to attack candidates.  Between $135 and $150 million was spent on so-called issue ads in 1996--about 35 percent of the $400 million spent on all campaign advertising in 1996, according to a new study released yesterday by the Annenberg Center at the University of Pennsylvania. The study--the most comprehensive on this issue to date--showed that, compared with other forms of political advertising and coverage, the content of issue ads were the highest in ``pure attack.''  To this end, I have prepared this small package of measures--many of which appear in other bills--which, taken together, is a step on the road to spending reform, and would be a solid step forward in the battle to decrease the flood of unregulated money in campaigns.  Specifically, this bill would:  Ban soft money to national parties. During the last election, both parties spent a combined total of over $270 million in soft money. Democrats spent $122 million and Republicans spent almost $150 million. Over the first 6 months of this year, both parties have raised $34 million in soft money, with Republicans out-pacing Democrats $23 to $11 million.  Change the definition of ``express advocacy'' to include any communication that uses a candidate's name or picture within 60 days of an election as ``express advocacy''. Only ``hard'' dollars--limited in amount and fully disclosed--could be used to fund independent campaigns of a candidate's name or image is used in express advocacy for or against a candidate.  Change the personal contribution limit from $1,000 per election to $2,000 per election and index those contribution limits for inflation in the future. The $1,000 per election limits have not been changed since 1974. That was 23 years ago and, as every candidate knows, the cost of printing postage and buying media has more than quadrupled in that time.  Increase the disclosure requirements so that any group or individual spending more than $10,000 up to 20 days prior to an election would have to report that to the FEC within 48 hours. This threshold drops to $1,000 within 20 days of an election.  Implement a policy whereby if a person is not eligible to vote in U.S. elections, he or she would not be permitted to contribute to candidates or parties.  Lower the threshold for reporting contributions to candidates from $200 to $50. This increases disclosure.  Allow the FEC to seek an injunction in U.S. District Court if it has evidence that a violation of campaign laws is about to occur.  Permit the FEC to refer matters to the Attorney General for prosecution if any significant evidence of criminal wrongdoing exists.  I believe a bill containing these elements is doable this year and I offer it as a package for the consideration of this body.  In closing, it is my sincere hope we will move to enact meaningful campaign finance reform this year. If we can't act now, after all that has been said and done this year, I'm afraid we never will. The American people deserve more than lip service on campaign reform.  I implore the majority leader to bring the McCain-Feingold bill to the floor and allow us to debate it, amend it, and vote on it. If we can't agree on the McCain-Feingold bill, then let us vote on an alternative such as mine. Either way, let us have at it.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1197       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
