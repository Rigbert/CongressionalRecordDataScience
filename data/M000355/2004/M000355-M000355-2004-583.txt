 President, at the risk of repeating myself, we have had this vote once. I am sure there will be other opportunities in the very near future for repetitious votes on the same issue. I know our good friends on the other side will insist on an opportunity to do that. The question is whether we should move the underlying bill now and terminate these sanctions being imposed on American businesses which cost us jobs. Jobs is an important issue here in America. We want to get this bill passed because it will preserve existing jobs and offer the opportunity for more jobs. The overtime issue, to the extent our good friends on the other side of the aisle think is a good issue, is already out there. A move is on by spending millions of dollars of George Soros' money running soft-money issue ads on this subject. I am sure those ads are not going to go away, whether or not we have this vote on this particular bill which, of course, would be our second vote on this issue without further debating the issue.                          ____________________
