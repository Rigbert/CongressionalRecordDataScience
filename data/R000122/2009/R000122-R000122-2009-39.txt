 I appreciate the attention that she has given to a number of key investments, particularly funding for the state revolving funds for sewer and drinking water infrastructure, which I have strongly supported. These investments are not just a matter of improving public health and environmental quality; they are a matter of job creation, which is all important at this time.  I am concerned, however, about a provision that was included at the insistence of the House of Representatives that will exempt certain vessels on the Great Lakes from regulation under a proposed EPA rule designed to limit emissions from marine diesel engines. I know that this provision is not one that was advanced by Chairman Feinstein, and I appreciate her efforts to prevent a larger exemption than is in this bill.  Although the exemption included in this bill is limited to 13 vessels, the impact on public health has not been explained. In addition, the conference report includes language that encourages EPA to adopt additional exemptions for vessels on the Great Lakes in its final rule. As a result, I am alarmed about the potential impact on air quality in downwind States, like Rhode Island, which, I must note, will be required to comply with EPA's regulations on marine diesel engines.  Representing a State that has an unfortunately high unemployment rate, I have great sympathy for those who called for this exemption on the basis of potential economic impact on a local industry. On the other hand, my constituents bear the environmental and health burdens that come from pollution that originates from the Midwest.  Last week, the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, NESCAUM, which represents air quality agencies in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, wrote to express its deep concern about any effort to delay or limit EPA's regulations on marine diesel engines based on the potential environmental impacts and the impacts on international efforts to reduce emissions from marine engines. I will ask that this letter be printed in the Record.  I would hope that after a more thorough deliberation we will have a chance to revisit this issue and provide appropriate protection to downwind States.  Again, I appreciate the efforts of the chairman to limit the reach of this provision and for the important investments she has made in this bill. I am grateful for her leadership and am honored to serve with her.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management,                                     Boston, MA, October 21, 2009.     Sen. Jack Reed,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Reed: The Northeast States for Coordinated Air      Use Management (NESCAUM) has recently learned of an effort to      attach a rider to the FY 2010 Interior and Environment      Appropriations Bill that would have the effect of delaying or      limiting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA)      ability to reduce air pollution from large marine vessels      that operate in domestic waterways. NESCAUM is the      association of eight northeastern state air pollution      programs that includes Rhode Island along with Connecticut,      Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,      and Vermont. Consistent with our mission to protect and      enhance air quality in the Northeast, NESCAUM opposes      attempts to use the federal appropriations process to      obstruct EPA's efforts to reduce emissions from large marine      vessels.       Air pollution is not confined to state boundaries. Through      long-range transport in the atmosphere, pollutants emitted in      domestic waters, such as the Great Lakes, affect air quality      in the Northeast. We point out that one of our member states,      New York, has the third longest shoreline among the Great      Lakes states. The fuel controls proposed by EPA will      significantly reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen      oxides (NOX), which contribute to ground-level      ozone (smog), particulate matter, and acid rain. As a result,      the Northeast will realize significant public health and      other environmental benefits from implementing EPA's proposed      rule not only in the Northeast's local waters, but in upwind      waters as well.       In addition to the negative public health and environmental      implications, a special exclusion for vessels predominantly      operating in domestic waters sends the wrong message to the      international community regarding the U.S. commitment to      reduce emissions from ocean going vessels. The governments of      the United States and Canada have applied to the      International Maritime Organization (IMO) for designation of      their coasts as an Emission Control Area (ECA). The ECA      designation establishes stringent controls for fuel sulfur      and engine NOX emissions for all ships, foreign      and domestic, operating in coastal waterways. A significant      change in U.S. policy at this critical juncture of the ECA      application process, as signaled by such a rider to an      appropriations bill, could jeopardize the standing of U.S.-     Canadian application before the IMO. We should approach the      IMO with ``clean hands'' by demonstrating our commitment to      do for ourselves what we are asking others to do for us as      well.       For these reasons, we urge you to oppose the impending      rider to the FY 2010 Interior and Environment Appropriations      Bill. Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                                  Arthur N. Marin,                                               Executive Director.
