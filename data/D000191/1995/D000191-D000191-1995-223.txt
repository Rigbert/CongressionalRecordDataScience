Let us pick a high tech company, Tectronics--they have not been doing so well lately but back then they did better--$163,300,000 profits over three years, and they got a $13,800,000 tax rebate for a negative 8.5 percent rate of taxation.  Just last night we repealed the law that did away with this scandal. That was part of the contract on America, to do away with the corporate alternative minimum tax. That means that an American who works in a factory job for 10 bucks an hour, if Mr. Gingrich's dream bill here goes through, the crown jewel, will pay absolutely, not in rates, but will pay absolutely more in taxes than some of these largest corporations in the world.
