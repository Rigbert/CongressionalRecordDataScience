Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate a great Alaskan, Mr. John (Jack) G. Fuller, an outstanding soldier, legislator and Alaskan. Mr. Fuller served our country in the Marine Corps, the Michigan National Guard, the Alaskan National Guard and as a Representative to the Alaskan Legislature. His abilities and dedication have been recognized by all who have served with him, and earned him the opinion of others as irreplaceable.  Jack Fuller began his military career with the 21st Regiment of the Third Marine Division in the Pacific Theatre of World War II, in Guam and at Iwo Jima. It was at Iwo Jima that he was awarded the Silver Star for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity. Whilst serving as a Sergeant on February 23, 1945, Mr. Fuller took command of his unit when all its officers were dead or wounded and enabled his platoon to continue the attack. Following this he was promoted to Second Lieutenant.  Following World War II, Mr. Fuller returned to Michigan and joined the Michigan National Guard. During this period he excelled and successfully graduated from the Armor Officer Basic and Advanced courses and the Command and General Staff College. He was eventually granted a permanent commission.  In 1964, Jack Fuller moved to Alaska, with the intention of teaching at the Bureau of Indian Affairs schools on St. Lawrence Island. He also enlisted in the First Scout Battalion, an Eskimo division of the Alaskan National Guard, based in Nome. Jack worked his way up, reaching the rank of Battalion Commander. While under his command, the unit was evaluated as excellent during JACK FROST 1977. Mr. Fuller was further awarded the Legion of Merit, the third highest award of the Army for the outstanding skill, initiative and professionalism he displayed as a Commander. He was the first officer of the Alaskan National Guard to achieve this honor and his dedication to the battalion earned him the admiration of those he served with.  Upon retirement from the Alaskan National Guard in 1978, Mr. Fuller turned to a new challenge and was elected to the Alaskan Legislature as a Representative for District 22, where he served for eight years. In 1986, Mr. Fuller was one of the first to be recruited for the Alaska Defense Force upon its creation, where he used his many skills to aid the State in times of emergency. He also contributed to the State through his work as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Norton. Sound Health Corporation. In recent times Mr. Fuller has also served as President of the Wasilla Senior Center. Regardless of the task at hand, Jack Fuller has committed himself fully to serving others.  On behalf of The United States of America, I extend my thanks and appreciation to Jack Fuller, for his dedication and service to the Great State of Alaska and the entire country. His achievements in both military and civilian life are remarkable and deserve our recognition here, today.                          ____________________
