I commend the bill's chief Republican cosponsor, Senator John Cornyn, for his commitment and dedication to passing FOIA reform legislation this year. I am also appreciative of the efforts of Senator Jon Kyl for cosponsoring this bill and helping us to reach a compromise on this legislation, so that the Senate could consider and pass meaningful FOIA reform legislation this year.  Earlier this year, the Senate passed this historic FOIA reform legislation, S. 849, before adjourning for the August recess. Now that the Senate has unanimously passed a modified bill, to ensure that ``pay/go'' and other concerns of the House are adequately addressed, I hope that the House will promptly enact this bill and send it to the President without further delay.  I have worked very hard to address the concerns of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, to ensure that the Congress can enact meaningful FOIA reform legislation this year. I commend Congressman Waxman, the distinguished Chairman of that Committee, for his commitment to FOIA reform and I thank him and his staff for all of their hard work on this legislation.  The bill that the Senate passed today includes ``pay/go'' language that has been requested by the House and it also eliminates a provision on citations to FOIA exemptions in legislation that was in the previous bill. To accommodate other concerns of the House, the bill also includes a new provision that requires Federal agencies to disclose the FOIA exemptions that they rely upon when redacting information from documents released under FOIA. In addition, the bill adds FOIA duplication fees for noncommercial requesters, including the media, to the fee waiver penalty that will be imposed when an agency fails to meet the 20-day statutory clock under FOIA. While I will continue to work with the House and others to further strengthen this critical open government law, I hope that the House will promptly take up the bipartisan FOIA compromise bill that we have been able to pass so that it may be signed into law before the end of the year.  As the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade, the OPEN Government Act will help to reverse the troubling trends of excessive delays and lax FOIA compliance in our government and help to restore the public's trust in their government. This bill will also improve transparency in the Federal Government's FOIA process by restoring meaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA; imposing real consequences on federal agencies for missing FOIA's 20-day statutory deadline; clarifying that FOIA applies to Government records held by outside privatecontractors; establishing a FOIA hotline service for all Federal agencies; and creating a FOIA Ombudsman to provide FOIA requestors and, federal agencies with a meaningful alternative to costly litigation.  Specifically, the OPEN Government Act will protect the public's right to know, by ensuring that anyone who gathers information to inform the public, including freelance journalists and bloggers, may seek a fee waiver when they request information under FOIA. The bill ensures that Federal agencies will not automatically exclude Internet blogs and other Web-based forms of media when deciding whether to waive FOIA fees. In addition, the bill also clarifies that the definition of news media, for purposes of FOIA fee waivers, includes free newspapers and individuals performing a media function who do not necessarily have a prior history of publication.  The bill also restores meaningful deadlines for agency action, by ensuring that the 20-day statutory clock under FOIA starts when a request is received by the appropriate component of the agency and requiring that agency FOIA offices get FOIA requests to the appropriate agency component within 10 days of the receipt of such requests. To ensure accuracy in FOIA responses, the bill allows federal agencies to toll the 20-day clock while they are awaiting a response to a reasonable request for information from a FOIA requester on one occasion, or while the agency is awaiting clarification regarding a FOIA fee assessment. In addition, to encourage agencies to meet the 20-day time limit the bill requires that an agency refund FOIA search fees--and duplication fees for noncommercial requestors--if it fails to meet the 20-day deadline, except in the case of exceptional circumstances as defined by the FOIA statute.  The bill also addresses a relatively new concern that, under current law, Federal agencies have an incentive to delay compliance with FOIA requests until just before a court decision is made that is favorable to a FOIA requestor. The Supreme Court's decision in Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Dep't of Health and Human Resources, 532 U.S. 598, 2001, eliminated the ``catalyst theory'' for attorneys' fees recovery under certain federal civil rights laws. When applied to FOIA cases, Buckhannon precludes FOIA requesters from ever being eligible to recover attorneys fees under circumstances where an agency provides the records requested in the litigation just prior to a court decision that would have been favorable to the FOIA requestor. The bill clarifies that Buckhannon does not apply to FOIA cases. Under the bill, a FOIA requester can obtain attorneys' fees when he or she files a lawsuit to obtain records from the Government and the Government releases those records before the court orders them to do so. But, this provision would not allow the requester to recover attorneys' fees if the requester's claim is wholly insubstantial. To address House ``pay/go'' concerns, the bill also requires that any attorneys'' fees assessed under this provision be paid from any annually appropriated agency funds.  To address concerns about the growing costs of FOIA litigation, the bill also creates an Office of Government Information Services in the National Archives and creates an ombudsman to mediate agency-level FOIA disputes. In addition the bill ensures that each federal agency will appoint a Chief FOIA Officer, who will monitor the agency's compliance with FOIA requests, and a FOIA Public Liaison who will be available to resolve FOIA related disputes.  Finally, the bill does several things to enhance the agency reporting and tracking requirements under FOIA. The bill creates a tracking system for FOIA requests to assist members of the public and the media. The bill also establishes a FOIA hotline service for all Federal agencies, either by telephone or on the Internet, to enable requestors to track the status of their FOIA requests. The bill also clarifies that FOIA applies to agency records that are held by outside private contractors, no matter where these records are located.  The Freedom of Information Act is an essential tool to ensure that all Americans can access information about the workings of their government. But, after four decades, this open government law needs to be strengthened. I am pleased that the reforms contained in the OPEN Government Act will ensure that FOIA is reinvigorated--so that it works more effectively for the American people.  Again, I commend Senators Cornyn and Kyl and the many other cosponsors of this legislation for their dedication to open government. But, most importantly, I especially want to thank the many concerned citizens who, knowing the importance of this measure to the American people's right to know, have demanded action on this bill. This bill is endorsed by more than 115 business, public interest, and news organizations from across the political and ideological spectrum, including the American Library Association, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, OpenTheGovemment.org, Public Citizen, the Republican Liberty Caucus, the Sunshine in Government Initiative and the Vermont Press Association. The invaluable support of these and many other organizations is what led the opponents of this bill to come around and support this legislation.  By passing this important FOIA reform legislation, the Senate has reaffirmed the principle that open government is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. But, rather, it is an American issue and an American value. I strongly encourage the House of Representatives, which overwhelmingly passed a similar measure earlier this year, to promptly take up and enact this bill before adjourning for the year.                          ____________________
