 Anne, apparently my colleagues did not understand the gravity of this occasion, the solemnness of this occasion, and they did not dress accordingly, apparently.  Anne, I want you to know that I just left the Crown Prince of Denmark and Princess Mary because I told them I had to come see Queen Anne.  I have risen before and talked about our extraordinary staff, the people who really make this institution what it wants to be. They are the best of us, whether they are at the desk, whether they are with the Sergeant at Arms, whether they are recording our debates; and the best of them who has one of the toughest jobs is to help us, as the Speaker has said, manage this floor. Sitting next to me is Shuwanza Goff. She is the floor director on our side.  You cannot leave.
