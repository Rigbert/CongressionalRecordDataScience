 President, I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for yielding me a few moments. I listened very carefully to my good friend and colleague from West Virginia and to his observations about the dangers of drinking and driving, with which I completely concur.  Of course, representing Kentucky, as my friend from West Virginia knows, not only do we have 60,000 tobacco growers, which is, of course, the subject of a number of amendments that may come on this bill; we are also the home of bourbon. If this kind of whiskey is not made in Kentucky, it cannot be called bourbon. Let me suggest that there are no industries--and I checked with the Finance Committee staff--that have been singled out by law and, as a result of being singled out, are not allowed to deduct their expenses for advertising. So this would be a first.  To begin with, as a matter of tax policy, certain kinds of legal industries are not allowed to deduct their advertising, and others are.
