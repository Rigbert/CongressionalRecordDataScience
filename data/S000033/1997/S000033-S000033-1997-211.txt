 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by a high school student from Vermont, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Ms. Wachtel. Two years ago an elderly New York City woman      almost died. Why? She ingested too much medication because      she could not read the prescription label on the bottle. This      woman is not in the minority. One-quarter of the world's      population, 905 million people, cannot read. One in five      American adults is functionally illiterate and 44 percent of      American adults do not read even one book in the course of a      year.       Statistics clearly show that illiteracy is on the increase      and that fewer than ten percent of those in need are being      reached. in 1985 Proctor and Gamble spent more on advertising      than the U.S. Government spent on adult basic education.       The truth is by cutting funding for literacy programs we      are threatening the future of our nation. The cost of      illiteracy to business and the taxpayer is estimated at 20      billion dollars per year.       President Clinton has made literacy a priority with his      America Reads initiative. He says such efforts will help us      to reach a critical goal, that every American child will be      able to read on his or her own by the third grade, but there      are large numbers of people who cannot even read to their own      children.       Public awareness is key. Parents must realize the      importance of education and of literacy. They must know they      are their child's first teacher. Illiteracy is a very quite      problem which needs attention.       Illiteracy plagues rural areas, not only urban ones.      Literacy programs are needed not just in cities but all      across the country. Programs for employees can be installed      at large corporations. The library system must     be supported. It encourages and provides great opportunities      for education.       As President Clinton said, literacy is more than reading.      It is about opportunity and giving people the tools they need      to make the most of their potential. Literacy is one things      that can never be taken away. It determines the future of us,      our nation, our world.       This is necessary not only because it's literacy but      because we need literacy to understand all the problems that      we face today, and without an understanding, we have no way      of solving them.                                                         ____________________
