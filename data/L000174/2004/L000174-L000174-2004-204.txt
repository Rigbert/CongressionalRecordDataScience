This legislation will provide law enforcement with another important tool in fighting the harms wreaked by intellectual property theft, which robs our innovators--not to mention all those working behind the scenes--of compensation owed to them for producing films that carry American culture around the globe. The Motion Picture Association of America estimates that the movie industry loses $3 billion worldwide to piracy each and every year.  Too often, we think of movie piracy as a disease whose symptoms are manifest only in foreign territories. While it is true that much of the movie industry's losses occur due to lax intellectual property enforcement in countries where the authorities are either ill-equipped or disinclined to enforce creators' rights, there is much we can do in this country to get our own IP house in order.  I appreciate that Senator Hatch, Senator Feinstein, and Senator Cornyn have been so willing to address my concerns that the bill as introduced might inadvertently have a negative impact on the TEACH Act. In the 107th Congress, Senator Hatch and I workedto pass the TEACH Act, which ensured that educators could use limited portions of dramatic literary and musical works, audiovisual works, and sound recordings, in addition to the complete versions of non-dramatic literary and musical works that were already permitted, and that they could use the Internet to do so.  I also appreciate my colleagues' willingness to eliminate the presumptions in the criminal liability provisions, and to take up the Copyright Office's creative ideas for addressing pre-release works.  Were it not for their willingness to address these concerns, I would not have been able to offer my support for this bill. I thank my colleagues for their assurances as well as for their hard work in gaining passage of this important legislation.
