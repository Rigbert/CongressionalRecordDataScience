 President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4:30 we proceed to two stacked votes on the pending Feinstein amendment and the Schumer amendment, and do it in that order, with 4 minutes equally divided in the usual form between the two votes, and that no amendments be in order prior to the votes. Maybe I ought to correct this. I think we should say there would be 2 minutes divided on the Feinstein amendment and then 2 minutes before we vote on the Schumer amendment--or 4.
