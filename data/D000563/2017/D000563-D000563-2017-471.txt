'  President Trump is right. The people have borne unimaginable costs: the cost of foreclosure, the cost of inequality, the cost of poverty, and the cost of injustice. Sadly, it doesn't look like that is going to change soon with this administration. Three weeks into this administration, President Trump has already begun to restore power back to Wall Street and the very same people who he said have caused tremendous problems for us. The nomination of Steve Mnuchin, someone who spent his entire career working on behalf of Wall Street at the expense of hard-working Americans, is a clear example.  Let me say at the outset, I have not met him, but I tried to, but we couldn't get an agreement as to when we might be able to get together. I wanted to talk to him about some important issues that many of us remember.  We know what happened with the recession that greeted President Obama when he was sworn into office 8 years ago. We know about the foreclosures. We know of families being literally wiped out, all their savings gone because of misleading tactics by financiers.  I still look at this, and as much as I respect President Obama and his administration, I shake my head and think: Nobody went to jail for all that occurred. People at the highest levels of the financial community on Wall Street and others were engaged in practices that we know now were unfair and just plain wrong and, in many cases, illegal.  I have taken a look at Mr. Mnuchin's record. I have read a lot of stories about him. I have heard from homeowners' personally impacted by his conduct, and let me tell you, what I have seen and heard leads me to believe he is not the right person to be Secretary of the Treasury.  Like most of President Trump's nominees, Mr. Mnuchin was not chosen for his knowledge and experience on critical issues he will face if confirmed as Secretary of the Treasury. He was not chosen for his commitment to work for average working families. He was chosen for his loyalty to the President, the new litmus test in the Republican Party.  Before serving as President Trump's chief fundraiser on the campaign, Mr. Mnuchin worked to help wealthy individuals and powerful special interest groups reap the benefits of what the President has called ``a rigged system.'' He served as an executive at Goldman Sachs and as a hedge fund manager.  Perhaps what troubles me the most about Mr. Mnuchin's experience is his tenure at the helm of a group known as OneWest, which came to be known as a foreclosure machine in America because of the aggressive and questionable practices it used to foreclose on the homes of thousands of American families.  Mr. Mnuchin was the head of the company that was doing the foreclosure. After our country experienced the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, Congress worked around the clock to prevent the economy from going into free-fall and end some of the worst practices that helped bring the American economy to its knees.  As we were working to save American homes, Mr. Mnuchin--like President Trump--saw opportunity to make a profit, personally earning millions from OneWest's success as a foreclosure machine.  As the head of OneWest, Mr. Mnuchin had the power to destroy lives through foreclosure or find ways to help homeowners stay in their homes. He chose to aggressively foreclose on families.  During his nomination hearing, Mr. Mnuchin defended OneWest's foreclosure practices and said he was proud of the work of the bank during the foreclosure crisis.  Let me tell you about some of the stories, and you can decide whether Mr. Mnuchin should be proud of the record of the company he was managing.  Rex Schaffer and his wife Rose lost their home of nearly 50 years, despite having qualified for a loan modification.  Ossie Lofton, a 90-year-old woman, was foreclosed on because she was short 27 cents in her mortgage payment--27 cents.  The locks were changed on Leslie Park's Minneapolis home in the middle of a blizzard.  We have seen how organizations headed by Mr. Mnuchin treat people. If confirmed, Mr. Mnuchin would have the ability to use the power of the U.S. Treasury Department to stand on the side of Wall Street and on the opposite side of millions of working Americans. I don't have confidence, based on his professional record, that Mr. Mnuchin will put the needs of hard-working families first over Wall Street.  While the foreclosure crisis and its aftermath seem like something in the past for so many people, that is not the case in my home State of Illinois. Foreclosures are devastating for the families forced out of their homes, but they are also devastating to surrounding communities and neighborhoods.  If you want to know what a community looks like 50 years after the foreclosure crisis, visit my birthplace, my hometown of East St. Louis, IL, or even some of the neighborhoods on the south side of Chicago, or the west side, for that matter--vacant lot after vacant lot, neglected buildings and homes, an economy devastated. And what is left? Some of the poorest families on earth.  While we have made significant progress since the recession of 2008, many families in my State and across the country are still suffering. There is work to do. If confirmed, Mr. Mnuchinwill be responsible for protecting these families and ensuring that we don't have another financial crisis. All we have seen from him is his ability to profit from the foreclosure crisis and the devastation left in its wake. In the aftermath of the financial crisis of 2008, Congress got together with the President and passed Dodd-Frank. This was Wall Street reform determined not to let another economic crisis follow. The consumer protection act was also passed to prevent these crises and to reform the problems that caused them.  Mr. Mnuchin has made no secret of the fact that his No. 1 regulatory priority is to roll back Wall Street reform, to return the barbarians to the gates. Despite the promises President Trump made during his campaign, including ``not letting Wall Street get away with murder,'' Mr. Mnuchin has an ally in President Trump in undoing Dodd-Frank. President Trump signed an Executive order that would begin rolling back the important consumer and financial system reforms we passed as part of Dodd-Frank. The President signed this order sitting among the biggest beneficiaries of his actions, some of Wall Street's high rollers. Make no mistake, if President Trump gets his way and Steven Mnuchin is confirmed, the banks are going to have the best friend they can think of in the Treasury Department, just like they did before the economic crash of 2008.  It is clear the American people can't count on Mr. Mnuchin, based on his business experience, to decide with them over Wall Street. But, certainly, he should be committed to basic fairness of the Tax Code. He said he was until he wasn't. Shortly after his nomination, Mr. Mnuchin said there would be ``no absolute tax cut for the upper class.'' Yet he has not spoken out against the significant tax cuts the wealthy would receive from the repeal of the Affordable Care Act or under the President's and the House Republican's tax reform plan. We shouldn't be surprised by this because we are asking Mr. Mnuchin to close the loopholes and raise the taxes on the very people he helped to avoid paying taxes by using offshore tax havens as a hedge fund manager.  We are still recovering from the devastation of that financial crisis 8 years ago. We can't afford to have our Nation's top economic official be a man who has only been looking out for Wall Street. For a President who ran on bringing back jobs and being a champion of the working people, the choices of President Trump for his Cabinet are the opposite and have taken advantage of the very system he has derided as rigged against the people.  The American people deserve better. When Mr. Mnuchin's nomination is brought to the Senate floor for a vote, I will vote no, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.                      Nomination of David Shulkin  Madam President, I want to take a moment to address the nomination of Dr. David Shulkin to be confirmed soon as the next Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. We all know the Veterans Affairs Department faced a number of challenges in recent years: long waiting times, disability claims backlogs, issues related to accountability, whistleblowers, and the quality of care. The list is too long. As the second largest Federal agency, employing more than 350,000 people across America and serving as our largest integrated health care system, some challenges are unavoidable.  As the VA provides for the brave men and women who fought and sacrificed for this country, as well as their families, it is critical that it be held to a high standard. We in Congress must work to ensure that, in addition to holding the Department to a high standard, we also ensure that it is well funded and that it has the tools and flexibility to do the job.  It is critical that we strengthen the VA system and not weaken it through privatization, which would only lower the quality of health care for our veterans. That is why I am pleased with the nomination of Dr. Shulkin by President Trump to be the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Despite years of people playing politics with the VA--efforts which have only been counterproductive and have made it difficult for the VA to fill critical vacancies--and despite months of President Trump's talking about privatization without offering real solutions, today we have a nominee who appears to understand that, while there is a role for expanded care options, weakening or dismantling the VA is not the answer. I was heartened by Dr. Shulkin's commitment during his hearing in the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee on February 1, where he said: ``The Department of Veterans Affairs will not be privatized under my watch.''  Dr. Shulkin may not be a veteran himself, but I am encouraged by the fact that he comes from a military family and has decades of medical experience, including serving for 2 years under former VA Secretary Robert McDonald as head of the Veterans Health Administration after being nominated by President Obama. May I add that he left a lucrative private sector job and took a huge pay cut to join the VA.  It is no surprise that a number of veterans service organizations actively support his nomination. Although progress has been made in recent years, there are still challenges at the VA that we need to continue to address. I worry about the veterans' health care, education, homelessness, accountability, and a host of other issues. I look forward to working with Dr. Shulkin on these matters.  But we must not forget that, overall, in terms of health care, the VA is consistently found to provide care in key areas that is better than or on par with care in the private sector. It is significantly more cost effective, as well. And most veterans across the country prefer their veteran-centric health care that they receive in the VA. Despite what some may claim, most of them do not support privatization. I want to be clear that this includes a myriad of efforts under the guise of expanding access or choice.  So I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting Dr. Shulkin to be the next VA Secretary. I shared then-President Obama's sentiment that he was the right person to head up the Veterans Health Administration back in 2015, and I believe he is the right person to head the VA today.  Just 3 days ago, I was in Marion, IL, and visited our veterans hospital there. I met with the administrator. Ms. Ginsberg told me she knew of Dr. Shulkin and had high regard for him. That came as high praise from someone who is on the front line of serving thousands of deserving veterans in southern Illinois every single day. So her endorsement helped me to come forward today and to commit that I will be voting to make sure that Dr. Shulkin gets this opportunity to head the Veterans Affairs agency.  I yield the floor.  I suggest the absence of a quorum.
