Then we want to go on schedule, and I am hoping we will be able to go back and forth and hear from a number of these Members.  First, I thank my colleague from Wyoming.

When the Senator from California talks about temperatures and all this, it happens that we in the State of Oklahoma have had the worst cold spell during this last winter than we have in 30 years.
