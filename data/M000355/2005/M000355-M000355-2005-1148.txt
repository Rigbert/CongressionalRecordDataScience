 DOMENICI. I am pleased to yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Oklahoma that if his amendment became the pending business right after Cantwell, he would be in exactly the same position he is in right now. Our discussions could continue. It would at least allow the Senate to process another amendment.
