 President, I thank the Chair.  I would just like to add to my earlier comments with some of the specific numbers from each of the big States of people that would not be covered by the bipartisan budget agreement.  These are elderly people.  In California it is 163,900. In Florida it would be 44,310. In Illinois 13,360; in Massachusetts 13,410; in New York 65,340; and in Texas, 32,640. These are people who are above the age of 65.  It is my understanding that the administration, with Members in the other House, may have reached an agreement whereby they would agree to try to certify some of these people as disabled. But, nonetheless, these are the people, at least in the statistics of the Social Security Administration, who would be dropped off come August 22 for sure right now.  I think this is living testimony, in terms of numbers of people, to the argument that Senator D'Amato, Senator Chafee, and I are making that: Let us extend this by 2 months and see what we can do to effect a reasonable system where people will not become homeless or a major transfer onto county general assistance rolls.  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.
