Speaker, this is the kind of experience that gives politics a bad name. Consider for a minute this six-page bill which will extend the debt ceiling of the United States, will make certain that our Government does not default on its debts. The United States of America has never defaulted on its debts. We want to make certain that our word is good, not only in the United States, but around the world.  The failure to pass this six-page bill will have a dramatic impact on every family in America, particularly those who happen to have something called an ARM, an adjusted rate mortgage. If the Gingrich Republicans are successful, if they force America into default for some political strategy, it will force interest rates up on every American homeowner paying an ARM, an adjusted rate mortgage. So, for the Gingrich Republican strategy, there is a tax on homeowners.                              {time}  1315  That, of course, would suggest that maybe we ought to just pass this six-page bill and do the responsible thing. But my friends on the Republican side of the aisle have much more in store.  Look at this. This is the beginning of the amendments which they want to offer to the six-page bill. Do not take the time to ask any Member on the floor if they have read these amendments, the answer is no. And guess what, there is another 200-page amendment the gentleman from Pennsylvania wants to offer that we have not even seen. And then the gentleman from Texas [Mr. Archer] has the opportunity under the rule to come in with another mystery amendment.   Mr. Speaker, this is the most suspicious meatloaf that has ever hit this floor of the House of Representatives. What is sad is that we are putting ourselves through these mental and political gyrations so that Speaker Gingrich can have leverage on the President of the United States. See, they want to load this bill up with so many things that Bill Clinton will veto it and that our Government will go into default and that homeowners will pay the bill.  I think that is wrong. People sent Members of Congress here, Democrats and Republicans, to solve problems, to work together, not to impose more burdens on working families and homeworkers across America.  It is about time to stop the politics. Six pages, that is the responsible thing for us to address; 200, 300, 500, is a political game, the kind of political game that gives politics a bad name.
