President, last week the Department of Justice announced that the total U.S. prison population declined 1.7 percent from 2011 to 2012. I was encouraged to see that sentencing reform at the State level continues to pay dividends by simultaneously reducing prison costs and crime rates.  I am troubled, however, that the entirety of the reduction in the U.S. prison population was attributable to the States. The number of Federal prisoners actually increased by almost 1,500 from 2011 to 2012. While this increase was smaller than in previous years, the Federal Government can no longer afford to continue on the course of ever-increasing prison costs. As of last week, the Federal prison population was over 219,000, with almost half of those men and women imprisoned on drug charges. This year, the Bureau of Prisons budget request was just below $7 billion.  A major factor driving the increase in the incarceration rate has been the proliferation of Federal mandatory minimum sentences in the last 20 years. This one-size-fits-all approach to sentencing never made us safer, but it has cost us plenty. We must change course. In September, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing to examine the effects of Federal mandatory minimum sentences and measures to reform the system in order to combat injustice in sentencing and the waste of taxpayer dollars.  In March, I joined with Senator Paul to introduce just such a measure. The Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013 will give judges greater flexibility in sentencing in cases where a mandatory minimum is unnecessary and counterproductive. Since its introduction, the Justice Safety Valve Act has received endorsements from a diverse group that spans the political spectrum, including articles written by George Will, Grover Norquist, David Keene, and the New York Times. I ask unanimous consent that these materials be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  In addition to driving up our prison population, mandatory minimum penalties can lead to terribly unjust results in individual cases. This is why a large majority of judges oppose mandatory minimum sentences. In a 2010 survey by the U.S. Sentencing Commission of more than 600 Federal district court judges, nearly 70 percent agreed that the existing safety valve provision should be extended to all Federal offenses. That is what our bill does. Judges, who hand down sentences and can see close up when they are appropriate and just, overwhelmingly oppose mandatory minimum sentences.  States, including very conservative States like Texas, that have implemented sentencing reform have saved money and seen their crime rates drop. It is long past time that Congress follow their lead, and a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Federal mandatory minimum sentences is an important place to start.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:             [From the Hill's Congress Blog, Mar. 20, 2013]       Paul-Leahy Sentencing Bill Will Ensure Time Fits the Crime                 (By Julie Stewart and Grover Norquist)       Even before the sequester took effect, the Obama      administration's Department of Justice was warning that      federal prison spending had become ``unsustainable'' and was      forcing cuts in other anti-crime initiatives. Despite such      warnings, we have seen little evidence of an administration      strategy on how to control these costs. Fortunately, Senators      Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt) today are stepping      in to fill that void with the introduction of bipartisan      legislation to restore common sense to our criminal      sentencing laws.       The Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013 authorizes federal      courts to depart below a statutory mandatory minimum sentence      only after finding, among other things, that providing a      particular defendant a shorter sentence--say, seven or eight      years in prison for a drug offense rather than the 10-year      mandatory minimum--will not jeopardize public safety. The      bill does not require judges to impose shorter sentences, and      for many crimes, the minimum established by Congress will be      appropriate. But in cases where the mandatory minimum does      not account for the offender's limited role in a crime or      other relevant factors, the judge would be allowed to      consider those factors and craft a more appropriate sentence.       This common sense bill comes at a critical time. The      federal government simply cannot afford to continue to house      so many nonviolent prisoners for such lengthy sentences.      According to a recent Congressional Research Service (CRS)      report, the number of inmates under the Bureau of Prisons'      (BOP) jurisdiction has increased from approximately 25,000 in      FY1 980 to nearly 219,000 in FY2012. BOP prisons are      operating at 38 percent over capacity, endangering the safety      of guards and inmates alike. Last week, the Inspector General      for the Department of Justice testified that it's only going      to get worse: the BOP projects system-wide crowding to exceed      45 percent over rated capacity through 2018. The economic      cost of the prison population boom is staggering. Since FY      2000, appropriations for the BOP have increased from just      over $3.5 billion to more than $6.5 billion.       Locking everyone up costs a lot, but it doesn't always keep      us safer. University of Chicago economist and Freakonomics      author Steven D. Levitt was perhaps the most influential      supporter of pro-prison policies in the 1990s. He later      concluded that, as the crime rate continued to drop and the      prison population continued to grow, the increase in public      safety diminished. ``We know that harsher punishments lead to      less crime, but we also know that the millionth prisoner we      lock up is a lot less dangerous to society than the first guy      we lock up, '' Dr. Levitt recently told The New York Times.      ``In the mid-1990s I concluded that the social benefits      approximately equaled the costs of incarceration.'' Today,      Dr. Levitt says, ``I think we should be shrinking the prison      population by at least one-third.''       The head of the U.S. Justice Department's criminal division      agrees that spending on federal prisons must be scrutinized.      Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer recently wrote, ``In      an era of governmental austerity, maximizing public safety      can only be achieved by finding a proper balance of outlays      that allows, on the one hand, for sufficient numbers of      police, investigative agents, prosecutors and judicial      personnel to investigate, apprehend, prosecute and adjudicate      those who commit federal crimes. And, on the other hand, a      sentencing policy that achieves public safety correctional      goals and justice for victims, the community, and the      offender.'' We are lacking that balance today as skyrocketing      corrections spending, driven by increasing reliance on one-     size-fits-all mandatory minimum sentencing laws, is now      crowding out spending on investigators, police, and      prosecutors.       In short, we are skimping on efforts to arrest and      prosecute violent criminals so that we can keep nonviolent      offenders behind bars for lengthy prison sentences. This is      insanity. Passing the Paul-Leahy bill would enable courts to      make sure the time fits the crime in every criminal case.      While keeping us safe, it would also save money that could be      returned to taxpayers or invested in more effective anti-     crime strategies, such as putting more police on the street      or expanding the use of proven recidivism-reducing programs      in our prisons. We can still be tough on crime, but we do not      have to be tough on taxpayers.                                  ____                [From the New York Times, June 23, 2013]                       Needed: A New Safety Valve                        (By The Editorial Board)       Congress's new bipartisan task force on overcriminalization      in the justice system held its first hearing earlier this      month. It was a timely meeting: national crime rates are at      historic lows, yet the federal prison system is operating at      close to 40 percent over capacity.       Representative Karen Bass, a California Democrat, asked a      panel of experts about the problem of mandatory minimum      sentences, which contribute to prison overcrowding and rising      costs. In the 16-year period through fiscal 2011, the annual      number of federal inmates increased from 37,091 to 76,216,      with mandatory minimum sentences a driving factor. Almost      half of them are in for drugs.       The problem starts with federal drug laws that focus      heavily on the type and quantity of drugs involved in a crime      rather than the role the defendant played. Federal      prosecutors then seek mandatory sentences against defendants      who are not leaders and managers of drug enterprises. The      result is that 93 percent of those convicted of drug      trafficking are low-level offenders.       Both the Senate and the House are considering a bipartisan      bill to allow federal judges more flexibility in sentencing      in the 195 federal crimes that carry mandatory minimums. The      bill, called the Justice Safety Valve Act, deserves committee      hearings and passage soon.       A 1994 federal sentencing law allows judges to reduce      sentences for drug crimes if no one was harmed during the      crime and if the offender had little or no criminal history,      was not a leader in organizing the crime and used neither      violence nor a gun. But that law is far too narrow; all      felony convictions are disqualifying for a reduction, as are      some minor offenses, like passing a bad check.       The proposed bill would apply to all federal crimes with      mandatory minimums, not just drug crimes, so it would include      theft of food stamps and miscellaneous other lesser crimes.      It would also let judges consider less-lengthy sentences for      drug offenders who don't qualify for a reduction under the      current law.       The case of Weldon Angelos has long stood for the injustice      of mandatory minimums. Mr. Angelos received a 55-year prison      sentence in 2004 for selling a few pounds of marijuana while      having handguns in his possession, which he did not use or      display. In an extraordinary opinion, the federal trial judge      said he had no choice but to impose that ``cruel, unjust, and      irrational'' sentence. The Justice Safety Valve Act would      give courts more leeway to avoid that one-size-fits-all      approach.                                  ____                [From the Washington Post, June 5, 2013]        Leahy and Paul Plan on Mandatory Sentencing Makes Sense                          (By George F. Will)       Libertarians believe government should have a compelling      reason before it restricts an individual's liberty. Today's      liberals believe almost any reason will do, because liberty      is less important than equality, fraternity, fighting obesity      and many other aspirations. Now, however, one of the most      senior and liberal U. S. senators and one of the most junior      and libertarian have a proposal that could slow and even      repair some of the fraying of society.       Seven-term Democrat Pat Leahy's 38 Senate years have made      him Judiciary Committee chairman. Republican Rand Paul is in      his third Senate year. They hope to reduce the cruelty,      irrationality and cost of the current regime of mandatory      minimum sentences for federal crimes.       Such crimes are multiplying at a rate of more than 500 a      decade, even though the Constitution explicitly authorizes      Congress to criminalize only a few activities that are      national in nature (e.g., counterfeiting, treason, crimes on      the high seas). The federal government, having failed at core      functions, such as fairly administering a rational revenue      system, acts like a sheriff with attention-deficit disorder,      haphazardly criminalizing this and that behavior in order to      express righteous alarm about various wrongs that excite      attention.       Approximately 80,000 people are sentenced in federal courts      each year. There are an estimated 4,500 federal criminal      statutes and tens of thousands of regulations backed by      criminal penalties, including incarceration. There can be      felony penalties for violating arcane regulations that do not      give clear notice of behavior that is prescribed or      proscribed. This violates the mens rea requirement--people      deserve criminal punishment only if they intentionally engage      in conduct that is inherently wrong or that they know to be      illegal. No wonder that the federal prison population--     currently approximately 219,000, about half serving drug      sentences--has expanded 51 percent since 2000 and federal      prisons are at 138 percent of their supposed capacity.       The Leahy-Paul measure would expand to all federal crimes      the discretion federal judges have in many drug cases to      impose sentences less than the mandatory minimums. This      would, as Leahy says, allow judges--most of whom oppose      mandatory minimums--to judge. Paul says mandatory minimum      sentences, in the context of the proliferation of federal      crimes, undermine federalism, the separation of powers and      ``the bedrock principle that people should be treated as      individuals.''       Almost everyone who enters the desensitizing world of U.S.      prisons is going to return to society, and many will have      been socially handicapped by the experience. Until the 1970s,      about 100 per 100,000 Americans were in prison. Today 700 per      100,000 are. America has nearly 5 percent of the world's      population but almost 25 percent of its prisoners. African      Americans are 13 percent of the nation's population but 37      percent of the prison population, and one in three African      American men spends time incarcerated. All this takes a      staggering toll on shattered families and disordered      neighborhoods.       The House Judiciary Committee has created an Over-     Criminalization Task Force. Its members should read ``Three      Felonies a Day: How the Feds Target the Innocent,'' by Harvey      Silverglate, a libertarian lawyer whose book argues that      prosecutors could indict most of us for three felonies a day.      And the task force should read the short essay ``Ham Sandwich      Nation: Due Process When Everything Is a Crime'' by Glenn      Harlan Reynolds, a professor of law at the University of      Tennessee. Given the axiom that a competent prosecutor can      persuade a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich, and given the      reality of prosecutorial abuse--particularly, compelling plea      bargains by overcharging with ``kitchen sink'' indictments--     Reynolds believes ``the decision to charge a person      criminally should itself undergo some degree of due process      scrutiny.''       He also suggests banning plea bargains: ``An understanding      that every criminal charge filed would have to be either      backed up in open court or ignominiously dropped would      significantly reduce the incentive to overcharge. . . . Our      criminal justice system, as presently practiced, is basically      a plea-bargain system with actual trials of guilt or      innocence a bit of showy froth floating on top.''       U.S. prosecutors win more than 90 percent of their cases,      97 percent of those without complete trials. British and      Canadian prosecutors win significantly less, and for many      offenses, the sentences in those nations are less severe.       Making mandatory minimums less severe would lessen the      power of prosecutors to pressure defendants by overcharging      them in order to expose them to draconian penalties. The      Leahy-Paul measure is a way to begin     reforming a criminal justice system in which justice is a      diminishing component.                                  ____            [From the National Review Online, May 24, 2013]                         Prison-Sentence Reform                            (By David Keene)       Some liberal judges back in the 1970s and '80s enraged the      public by allowing felons back on the street with little more      than a slap on the wrist. In response, Congress and many      state legislatures enacted mandatory-minimum-sentencing laws      that essentially eliminated the discretion judges had always      enjoyed to make the punishment fit the crime. These laws were      incredibly popular when first enacted but have created more      problems than they've solved.       Undoubtedly, the tough-on-crime sentiment these laws      reflected has advanced our welcome, two-decade decline in      drug-related and violent crime. But I have come to believe      that the wholesale adoption of mandatory minimum sentencing      hasn't worked as well as everyone had hoped.       Like many conservatives, I supported many of these laws      when they were enacted and still believe that, in some narrow      situations, mandatory minimums makes sense. But like other      ``one-size-fits-all'' solutions to complicated problems, they      should be reviewed in light of how they work in practice.       Fortunately, Senators Rand Paul (R., Ky.) and Patrick Leahy      (D., Vt.) have crafted a smart and modest reform bill that      will fine-tune these laws to eliminate many of the unforeseen      and, frankly, unfair consequences of their application when      the facts demand more flexibility. This bipartisan measure      deserves conservative support.       The bill, the Justice Safety Valve Act of 2013, maintains      existing federal mandatory-sentencing laws. It enables judges      to depart from the minimums in certain cases, however, such      as when the mandatory sentence is not necessary to protect      public safety and seems blatantly unfair in light of the      circumstances of the offense. In so doing, their proposal      fulfills the primary objective of criminal-justice policy:      protecting public safety, while promoting our constitutional      separation of powers and saving taxpayers the expense of      unnecessary and counterproductive incarceration.       Many people, conservatives as well as liberals, have come      to believe that most mandatory-minimum-sentencing laws should      be repealed. These laws give prosecutors nearly unchecked      power to determine sentences, even though courts are in a      better position to weigh important and relevant facts, such      as an offender's culpability and likelihood of reoffending.       Federal mandatory-minimum-sentencing laws are especially      problematic. Not only do they transfer power from independent      courts to a political executive, they also perpetuate the      harmful trend of federalizing criminal activity that can be      better prosecuted at the state level.       For years, conservatives have wisely argued that the only      government programs, rules, and regulations we should abide      are those that can withstand cost-benefit analysis. Mandatory      minimum sentences, by definition, fail this basic test      because they apply a one-size-fits-all sentence to low-level      offenders, even though the punishments were designed for more      serious criminals.       Economists who once wholeheartedly supported simple pro-     prison policies now believe they have reached the point of      diminishing returns. One is University of Chicago economist      Steven D. Levitt, best known for the best-selling      Freakonomics, which he co-authored with Stephen J. Dubner.      Levitt recently told the New York Times, ``In the mid-1990s I      concluded that the social benefits approximately equaled the      costs of incarceration,'' and, today, ``I think we should be      shrinking the prison population by at least one-third.''       In other words, the initial crackdown was a good thing, but      we are now suffering the effects of too much of that good      thing.       If Levitt's estimate is even close, right now we are      wasting tens of billions of dollars locking people up without      affecting the crime rate or enhancing public safety. In fact,      spending too much on prisons skews state and federal      budgetary priorities, taking funds away from things that are      proven to drive crime even lower, such as increasing police      presence in high-violence areas and providing drug-treatment      services to addicts.       The Paul-Leahy bill will help restore needed balance to our      anti-crime efforts. Repeat and violent criminals will      continue to receive and serve lengthy prison sentences, but      in cases involving lower-level offenders, judges will be      given the flexibility to impose a shorter sentence when      warranted.       The Paul-Leahy bill is a modest fix that will affect only 2      percent of all federal offenders, and even they won't be      spared going to prison. They will simply receive slightly      shorter sentences that are more in line with their actual      offenses.       The bill will improve public safety, save taxpayers      billions of dollars, and restore our constitutional      separation of powers at the federal level while strengthening      federalism. This is a reform conservatives should embrace.                          ____________________
