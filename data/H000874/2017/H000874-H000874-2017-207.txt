Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for the week to come.  I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), my friend.  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, on Monday the House will meet at noon for morning-hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30.  On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning-hour and noon for legislative business.  On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. Last votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.  On Friday, no votes are expected in the House.  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next week, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business tomorrow.  In addition, the House will consider several bipartisan measures from the Committee on Financial Services that will create jobs and support American entrepreneurship. First, H.R. 1343, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act, sponsored by Representative Randy Hultgren, which will open up more opportunities for employees to share a stake in the companies they work for every day.  Next, H.R. 1219, the Supporting America's Innovators Act, sponsored by Chief Deputy Whip Patrick McHenry. This bill will increase access to capital for America's small businesses and startups and ensure our entrepreneurs have the best chance to succeed. Mr. McHenry's bill is also a key component of our Innovation Initiative in the House, which aims to accelerate private sector innovation and leverage more innovation in government.  Finally, Mr. Speaker, additional legislative items are possible, and I will relay scheduling information to Members if any items are added.
