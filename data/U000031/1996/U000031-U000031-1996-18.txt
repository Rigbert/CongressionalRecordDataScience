Speaker, I would like to bring to the attention of this Chamber a rather disturbing element that I have learned about over the last couple of weeks and to share my thoughts with those in the Chamber with regard to an individual by the name of Judge Baer in New York. There is a Wall Street Journal editorial back in the end of January, and I will put all of these into the Record, but I just want to read a little piece of this article. It says:       Winning the war on drugs won't be easy if the battles end      up in courtrooms that like that of Harold Baer, Jr., of the      Federal District Court in Manhattan. Judge Baer ruled     Wednesday that 80 pounds of cocaine and heroin that police      found in a car in the drug-wracked neighborhood of Washington      Heights could not be used as evidence.  It goes on to say that:       In his State of the Union address that Mr. Clinton gave      here in this Chamber, he told Americans that `Every one of us      have to have a role to play on this team.' But the best anti-     drug legislation and the best law enforcement won't work      unless the judiciary is willing to enforce the laws.  In a New York Times editorial, the end of January; ``Judge Baer's Tortured Reasoning'' is the title. It goes on to say that:       What this judge managed to do through his sloppy reasoning      was to undermine respect for the legal system, encourage      citizens to flee the police and deter honest cops in drug-     infested neighborhoods from doing their jobs.  It goes on to say that:       Consider the scene described by the officer. As he and his      partner sat in their unmarked car, they saw four men approach      the defendant's car. With team-like precision and without      speaking to the driver, they opened the trunk, dumped two      duffel bags in back, and then shut the door, running away      when they spotted the officers. Surely these facts, taken      together, present precisely the sort of suspicious      circumstance police are supposed to be looking out for.  The police in this case saw these individuals put 80 pounds of drugs in the back of the car, 5:00 in the morning, that car. The driver admitted she was taking them to Michigan where the street value of these drugs was worth $84 million. Eighty pounds. And, lo and behold, the judge let them off the hook because it was not unusual for folks to run away from the police in New York.  Well, that is outrageous.  An article in today's Washington Post, page 3; the title says ``Accusations of Coddling Criminals Aimed at Two Judges in New York.'' The Speaker in a news conference last week is quoted as saying this is the kind of pro-drug dealer, pro-crime and police and anti-law enforcement attitude that makes it so hard for us to win the war on drugs.  Mr. Speaker, a number of us and my colleague from New York, Mr. Forbes, the chairman of the crime subcommittee, the gentleman from Florida, Mr. McCollum, and I circulated a letter among House colleagues this past week that asked the President to ask for Judge Baer's resignation, and I am proud to say that a majority of this House have now signed that letter, Republicans and Democrats alike. We are going to be sending that letter to the President on Tuesday next, and I would ask those of my colleagues that have not signed the letter to please find me between now and Tuesday so they can add their names to a majority of those in this House.  My colleague, the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Stupak] is a signatory; my colleague, the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Hobson], as well as the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Foley], are also signatories of that letter, so that we can let the President know that this man should not serve as a Federal judge for letting these folks on, and we merely ask the President to ask Judge Baer to step down based on the decision that he made.  The articles referred to are as follows:               [From the Wall St. Journal, Jan. 26, 1996]                             The Drug Judge       Winning the war on drugs won't be easy if the battles end      up in courtrooms like that of Harold Baer Jr. of the Federal      District Court in Manhattan. Judge Baer ruled Wednesday that      80 pounds of cocaine and heroin that police found in a car in      the drug-wracked neighborhood of Washington Heights could not      be used as evidence. The drugs, which have a street value of      $4 million, are ``tainted evidence,'' he said.       He ruled that the police had no good reason for searching      the car, despite the fact that the four men putting duffel      bags into the trunk took off running when they saw the cops.      This, the judge ruled, was not suspicious behavior. Reason:      the ``residents of this neighborhood tended to regard police      officers as corrupt, abusive and violent.'' As a matter of      fact: ``Had the men not run when the cops began to stare at      them, it would have been unusual.''       The woman who was driving the car gave the police a      videotaped confession. Carol Bayless, a 41-year-old Detroit      woman, told police that she expected to be paid $20,000 for      driving the drugs back home, and said that she had made a      total of about 20 trips to New York to buy drugs. Judge Baer      threw out the videotaped confession. Unless the ruling is      overturned by the appeals court, the prosecutors say they no      longer have a case; Ms. Bayless, who faced 10 years to life      in jail, will be free to go.       The year's young, but we doubt Judge Baer will have any      competition for this year's Judge Sarokin Award, named in      honor of the federal judge in New Jersey who ruled for a      homeless man who used to lurk inside the Morristown library,      spreading his ``ambrosia.'' Liberalism manages to deliver us      these rulings on a regular basis, so it's appropriate to      raise a few concerns.       The first has to do with community standards. Aren't the      mostly minority residents of Amsterdam Avenue and 176th      Street, where the incident took place, entitled to the same      level of protection as the mostly white residents 100 blocks      south on Amsterdam in the heart of New York's Yuppiedom? We      suspect the law-abiding residents of Washington Heights might      take a different view about whether the bigger threat to      their well-being is the police or fleeing drug runners.       The other issue raised by the Baer ruling is the politics      of judicial appointments. Judge Baer is a Clinton appointee,      named to the federal bench in 1994 on the advice of the      Democratic Senator from New York, Patrick Moynihan. Now,      certainly it is the case that Democrats have appointed first-     rate jurists to the federal bench. But it's also the case      that it is at the liberal end of the modern judiciary that      communities find their interests trampled by overly expansive      and even absurd legal claims for defendants.       If Mr. Clinton is re-elected, by the end of his second term      he will have filled roughly half of the slots in the federal      judiciary, including majorities on the federal appeals      courts. And that he would get one, two or even three more      appointments to the Supreme Court. Mr. Clinton no doubt would      separate himself from decisions like Judge Baer's, but one      then has to somehow believe that he would actually separate      himself from the constituencies insisting that he pick from      the same candidate pool that produces such judges.       As for the war on drugs, we commend Judge Baer's ruling to      the attention of drug czar-designate, General Barry      McCaffrey. In his State of the Union address Tuesday, Mr.      Clinton told Americans that ``every one of us have a role to      play on this team.'' But the best anti-drug legislation and      the best law enforcement won't work unless the judiciary is      willing to enforce the laws.                                                                    ____                [From the New York Times, Jan. 31, 1996]                    Judge Baer's Tortured Reasoning       With his controversial ruling last week tossing out key      evidence and a voluntary confession in a major drug      conspiracy case, Federal District Judge Harold Baer Jr.      apparently hoped to make a point about the serious problem of      police corruption in New York City that he helped uncover as      a member of the 1993 Mollen commission. What the judge      managed to do instead, through his sloppy reasoning was to      undermine respect for the legal system, encourage citizens to      flee the police and deter honest cops in drug-infested      neighborhoods from doing their job.       This is not to say that the judge was wrong to be concerned      about Fourth Amendment issues and protections against illegal      searches. But in this case he went badly overboard.       Like many Fourth Amendment challenges to police searches      and seizures, the case turned on a question of whether      officers had a ``reasonable suspicion'' to stop the      defendant, a Detroit woman named Carol Bayless, whom police      watched as she drove slowly up Amsterdam Avenue in Upper      Manhattan in a car bearing Michigan plates at 5 A.M. last      April 21. Judge Baer offers defensible, if not entirely      convincing, reasons for believing the rendition of events      provided by the defendant in her confession just after her      arrest rather than the version provided by one of the      arresting officers eight months later.       But even the somewhat less suspicious-looking circumstances      described by the defendant would seem to meet the fairly low      threshold of ``reasonable suspicion'' for stopping and      questioning her. In a high-crime neighborhood, the police      need reasonable leeway to question activity that seems      unusual. Because the judge found no justification for      stopping the car, he did not reach the issue of whether the      officers had either the requisite consent from the woman or      ``probable cause'' that criminal activity was afoot when they      opened the trunk and seized 80 kilos of cocaine and heroin.       By far the most troubling aspect of the decision is the      judge's superfluous finding that even if every detail of the      police account were true, it would still not justify the      investigatory stop. That is not just wrong, it is judicial      malpractice. Consider the scene described by the officer. As      he and his partner sat in their unmarked car, they saw four      men approach the defendant's car. With teamlike precision and      without speaking to the driver, they opened the trunk, dumped      two duffle bags in back and then shut the door, running away      when they spotted the officers. Surely the factors, taken      together, present precisely the sort of suspicious      circumstances police are supposed to be looking out for.       Judge Baer may be correct in observing that the corrupt      scandal in upper Manhattan would have made it ``unusual'' had      the men not run away. But that does not support a legal      finding that flight is not a factor to be weighted in      determining whether there is ``reasonable suspicion.'' Judge      Baer's logic would guarantee that law-abiding citizens in      minority neighborhoods, where tensions with the police are      most strained, get a lower standard of policing.                                                                    ____                [From the Washington Post, Mar. 1, 1996]   Accusations of Coddling Criminals Aimed at Two Judges in New York                          (By John M. Goshko)       New York.--Two recent judicial decisions here--one throwing      out evidence in a big narcotics case and the other freeing a      defendant who then killed his former girlfriend--have ignited      a firestorm of outrage about alleged coddling of criminals.       The controversy has been so intense that many legal experts      fear it could disrupt the dispensing of justice in local      courts and spread beyond New York to become part of the      election year debate about what ails America.       Several judges and legal scholars, while acknowledging that      the decisions were controversial, nevertheless expressed      concern that the abbreviated versions provided by much of the      media have distorted the public's understanding of some very      complex legal issues.       The unrelenting criticism directed against the two      decisions, and the two judges, has put their colleagues at      all levels here under heavy pressure to demonstrate in      rulings and sentences that they are not soft on crime, these      experts said. In an era of growing social conservatism, the      rulings are providing fodder for those who think it is time      for the courts to stop fine-combing evidence and simply lock      up criminals.       Gov. George E. Pataki (R) recently fired the first salvo in      such a campaign when he announced legislative plans to limit      the powers of the state's highest court, the Court of      Appeals, to impose what he called burdensome restrictions on      the police and prosecutors. New York City's law-and-order      police commissioner, William J. Bratton, also denounced ``the      screwball Court of Appeals,'' saying it ``is living off in      Disneyland somewhere. They're not living in the streets of      New York.''       The two decisions at the heart of the controversy did not,      in fact, emanate from the Court of Appeals, but from other,      widely disparate levels of the criminal justice hierarchy.       First, in late January, Judge Harold Baer, Jr. of the U.S.      District Court that serves Manhattan ruled that 80 pounds of      cocaine and heroin found by police in a car could not be used      as evidence. The fact that four men seen putting the      narcotics in the car ran away when they spotted a police      officer was understandable, given fear of the police in many      inner-city neighborhoods, and did not constitute cause to      search the car; the judge decided.       ``As long as there are judges like that, criminals will be      running wild in the streets,'' said Louis Materazzo,      president of the New York Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.      That actually was one of the milder comments in the chorus of      criticism immediately sounded by Pataki, Bratton and even      Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani (R), an old friend and colleague of      Baer from the days when Giuliani was the U.S. attorney in      Manhattan and Baer was one of his aides.       By this week, the ripples from Baer's decision had spread      to Congress, where 150 House members signed a letter to      President Clinton calling on him to ask for the federal      judge's resignation. Among the signers was House Speaker Newt      Gingrich (R-Ga.), who told a news conference: ``This is the      kind of pro-drug dealer, pro-crime, anti-police and anti-law      enforcement attitude that makes it so hard for us to win the      war on drugs.''       On Feb. 12, the dispute about what New York's raucous      tabloids dubbed ``junk justice'' took a new turn. Benito      Oliver, a convicted rapist with a history of domestic      violence, walked into a car dealership where his former      girlfriend, Galina Komar, worked, shot her to death and then      killed himself. It quickly came out that three weeks earlier,      Judge Lorin Duckman of the Criminal Court in Brooklyn, the      lowest rung on New York's judicial ladder, had turned aside      Komar's request for protection and allowed Oliver to go free      while he awaited trial on charges of harassing her.       In transcripts of the court hearing Duckman sounded      dismissive of the injuries Oliver had inflicted on Komar,      noting that she had been ``bruised but not disfigured.'' The      judge expressed repeated concern about the well-being of a      dog that Oliver had left in Komar's care.       The uproar only intensified when it was further revealed      that Duckman, in a similar case last summer, allowed a      Brooklyn man, Maximino Pena, to go free hours after a jury      had convicted Pena of attacking his former girlfriend. On      Feb. 15, Pena was back in jail, this time charged with      dragging the same woman down two flights of stairs and      punching her in the face.       Duckman has since gone on an indefinite vacation. But his      temporary retreat from the bench has not halted the torrent      of denunciations from officials, women's rights advocates and      newspaper editorialists. Giuliani said Duckman displayed ``a      frightening lack of common sense'' that showed he ``should be      doing something else for a living.''       Pataki, asserting that ``Judge Duckman is unfit to serve,''      called on the State Commission on Judicial Conduct to remove      him from the bench. The governor added that if the commission      fails to do so, he would ask the state Senate to oust      Duckman, a punishment that it has administered only once      before, in 1872.       The churning caused by these two cases has even been given      a philosophical counterpoint by the coincidental publication      of a new book, ``Guilty: The Collapse of Criminal Justice,''      written by state acting Supreme Court Justice Harold J.      Rothwax. Rothwax argues that judges today often apply      principles about evidence and defendants' rights so rigidly      that the guilty go free.       However, there is real concern in legal circles that the      fallout from these two cases is causing judges to protect      themselves against charges of being excessively pro-     defendant.       Judith Kaye, New York's chief judge, recently said she was      worried that the castigation of Baer and Duckman could subtly      affect the way cases are decided. And many lawyers say that,      in contrast to just two or three months ago, they now see      signs of defendants being subjected to higher bail, rulings      that lean heavily toward the prosecution and tougher      sentences when found guilty.       The most glaring example of how these pressures appear to      be operating was the agreement by Judge Baer to permit a new      hearing on the narcotics evidence that he earlier suppressed      to such an outcry. A reconsideration like this is almost      never done by federal judges. Moreover, many lawyers said      they will not be surprised if Baer finds reasons to rule that      the drug evidence is admissible.       ``I have no idea what he'll do, but you'd have to be      superhuman not to be affected by all the criticism and abuse      that the man has taken over that ruling,'' said Albert      Alschuler, a law professor at the University of Chicago.       The case turned on a judgment about whether police had a      ``reasonable suspicion'' to stop and search a car at 5 a.m.      in Washington Heights, a largely Hispanic enclave of      Manhattan that is a known center of drug activity. Before      becoming a judge, Baer had served on a commission      investigating police brutality in that neighborhood. In his      opinion, he noted that people there regard the police as      ``corrupt, abusive and violent,'' and he said that under      those circumstances it was not unusual for the suspects to      run away.       ``I'm a native New Yorker from the East Bronx,'' said Yale      Kamisar, a University of Michigan law professor and a leading      expert on criminal procedure. ``When we played stickball as      kids and hit the ball through someone's window, everyone ran      because you knew if the cops caught you, they'd give you a      hard time. It's human nature to run from what you think might      be trouble.''       Kamisar said Baer appears to have decided that the police      used the flight as grounds for searching the car without      following other procedures that might have safeguarded the      legality of their actions.       Even in the Duckman controversy some lawyers think there      were legal considerations involved that have been overlooked      in the tragic aftermath of the case. ``He made what are      undeniably some stupid and insensitive remarks,'' said one      lawyer who asked not to be identified. ``But the facts are      that this fellow, Oliver, had been in jail for 40 days and      the Brooklyn district attorney's office failed to present any      strong evidence that he posed a danger to the woman that      justified holding him longer in what arguably would be a      violation of his constitutional rights.''       The judge also appeared to be reacting to some ``sloppy      handling'' of the case by the prosecutors, and the judge      decided to ``teach them a lesson,'' the attorney said: ``The      only problem with a judge doing something like that--trying      to regulate the way a prosecutor's office works--was that the      rights of the victim got overlooked.''                          ____________________
