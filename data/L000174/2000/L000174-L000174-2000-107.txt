I note, so there is not any confusion, and notwithstanding the fact that the conference report was sent over without people seeing it, I am perfectly happy to have the vote on this today. I am perfectly happy to go to a vote today on each of the aspects, so there will not be any question on that, and I understand that notwithstanding the fact that we can't get any other work done around here, the Republican leadership, which is their right, is going to take a few days off again, but I want to at least have this debate on the day we vote.  I commend the Senator from Kansas and the Senator from Minnesota for their work in getting us to this point. I do not object.
