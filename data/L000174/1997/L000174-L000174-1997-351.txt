. Court of Appeals, the District of Columbia Circuit. I compliment my good friend, the senior Senator from Utah, for his kind remarks about Mr. Garland.  Like the distinguished chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I too believe that Merrick Garland is highly qualified for this appointment and would make an outstanding Federal judge.  My concern that I have expressed before is that this is the first and only judicial nomination scheduled for consideration in these first 3 months of the 105th Congress. The Senate is about to go on vacation for a couple of weeks. It will be the only judgeship considered, as I understand it. In the past, the Senate has not had to wait the Ides of March for the first judicial confirmation. The Federal judiciary has almost 100 vacancies now and, with the Ides of March, we are getting only one vacancy filled.  I, too, am sorry we have not proceeded to confirm and schedule the nomination of Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly to the district court bench. Here is one nominee we could go with, and we ought to be able to do that today, too.  The Senate first received Merrick Garland's nomination from the President on September 5, 1995. We are now way into March of 1997. So we have this nomination that has been here since 1995. All but the most cynical say this man is highly qualified, a decent person, a brilliant lawyer, a public servant who will make an outstanding judge, but his nomination sat here from 1995 until today.  This is a man who has broad bipartisan support. Governor Keating of Oklahoma; Governor Branstad of Iowa; William Coleman, Jr., a former member of a Republican President's Cabinet, former Reagan and Bush administration officials, Robert Mueller, Jay Stephens, Dan Webb, Charles Cooper--all have supported Merrick Garland. So this is not a case of somebody out of the pale. In fact, the Legal Times titled him, ``Garland: A Centrist Choice.'' I will put those recommendation letters in the Record later on.  So why, when you have somebody who, in my 22 years here, is one of the most outstanding nominees for the court of appeals, has that person been held up? What fatal flaw in his character has been uncovered? None, there is no fatal flaw. There was not a person who spoke against, credibly spoke against, his qualifications to be a judge, but he was one of the unlucky victims of the Republican shutdown of the confirmation process last year. I liken it to pulling the wings off a fly. This is what happened.  The Judiciary Committee reported his nomination to the Senate in 1995--in 1995. But here we are in 1997, and we finally get to vote on it.  Madam President, we have 100 vacancies on the Federal bench. At this rate, by the end of this Congress, with normal attrition, we will probably have 130 or 140. We had an abysmal record last session dealing with Federal judicial vacancies.  We ought to show what we have here. Here, Madam President, are the number of judges confirmed during the second Senate session in Presidential election years:  In 1980, 9 appeals court judges, 55 district court judges.  In 1984, 10 appeals court judges, 33 district court judges.  In 1988, 7 Court of Appeals judges, 35 district court judges.  In 1992--incidentally, 1992, Democrats were in charge with a Republican President--11 appeals court judges, 55 district court judges.  So what happens when you switch it over, put in a Republican Senate and Democratic President? Do you see the same sense of bipartisanship? Not on your life.  It is 11 appeals court judges, 55 district court judges with a Republican President and a Democratic Congress. Switch it to a Democratic President and a Republican Congress--zero, nada, zip, goose egg for the court of appeals judges and only 17 for the district court judges. Not too good.  We have some other charts here. Chief Justice Rehnquist spoke on this. A Chief Justice speaks only in a restrained fashion, when he does. But look what he said. Look at what Chief Justice William Rehnquist said about the pace we have seen in this Senate:       The number of judicial vacancies can have a profound impact      on a court's ability to manage its caseload effectively.      Because the number of judges confirmed in 1996 was low in      comparison to the number confirmed in preceding years, the      vacancy rate is beginning to climb . . . It is hoped that the      administration and Congress will continue to recognize that      filling judicial vacancies is crucial to the fair and      effective administration of justice.  The administration is sending up judges, but it is like tossing them down into a black hole in space. Nothing comes back out.  In fact, 25 percent of the current vacancies have persisted for more than 18 months. They are considered a judicial emergency jurisdiction.  There are 69 current vacancies in our Nation's district courts. Almost one in six district court judgeships is or soon will become vacant.  I compliment the distinguished majority leader and my good friend from Utah, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, in scheduling this one nominee to the Federal Court of Appeals, but there are still 24 current vacancies on the Federal courts of appeals. That number is rising.  We are way behind the pace of confirming the judges we have seen in our past Congresses. In fact, let us take a look at--I just happen to have a chart on that, Madam President. I know Senators were anxiously hoping I might.  Number of judges confirmed in past Congresses: 102d Congress, 124; 103d Congress, 129; 104th Congress, 75. So far in the 105th Congress, none. I assume that is going to change later this afternoon when we finally do confirm one judge. But look at this: 102d Congress, 124; 103d Congress, 129 confirmed; 104th Congress, 75 confirmed. The 105th Congress, zippo.  I think we ought to take a look at this next chart. We have 94 judicial vacancies. Just put the old magnifying glass--I used to be in law enforcement, Madam President. We actually used these things. Of course, we were kind of a small jurisdiction and I am just a small-town lawyer from Vermont. We do the best we can. But the magnifying glass shows zero. I am pleased by the end of this afternoon I can put a ``1'' in there, and let us hope that maybe we will get some more. Let us hope maybe we will get some more.  We can joke about it, but it is not a joking matter. We have people with their lives on hold. When the President asks some man or woman to take a Federal courtship, their entire practice is put on hold--it is kind of a good news/bad news situation. The President calls up and says, ``I've got good news for you. I'm going to nominate you for the Federal bench. Now I have bad news for you. I'm going to nominate you for the Federal bench.'' He or she finds their law practice basically stops on the date of that nomination. They cannot bring on new clients. Their partners give him or her a big party and say, ``Please move out of your office,'' because they know it is going to take a year or 2 or 3 to get through the confirmation process.  This is partisanship of an unprecedented nature. I have spoken twice on this floor today on what happens when we forget the normal traditions of the Senate. Traditionally--certainly not in my lifetime--no Democratic majority leader or Republican majority leader of the Senate would bring up a resolution for a vote directly attacking the President of the United States--directly or indirectly attacking the President of the United States--on a day when the President is heading off to a summit with other world leaders, especially with the leader of the other nuclear superpower, Russia. Yet, that tradition, which, as I said, has existed my whole lifetime, was broken today.  The other thing is that no matter which party controls the Senate, nomatter what party controls the Presidency, we have always worked together so that the President, having been elected, can, subject to normal--normal--advise and consent, can appoint the judges he wants. And that tradition has been broken.  If we are going to go against these basic tenets of bipartisanship, then the Senate will not be the conscience of the Nation that it should be. The Senate will suffer. And if the Senate suffers, the country suffers.  I withhold the balance of my time.                         Privilege of the Floor  Madam President, if I might just for a moment, I ask unanimous consent that Tom Perez of Senator Kennedy's staff be granted floor privileges.
