 President, I rise today to introduce the Military and Overseas Citizens Voting Fairness Act of 2001. This bill ensures that the men and women of the military who go into harm's way and bravely serve our country will have their vote counted. Given the great sacrifice these men and women make to defend our country, it is essential that we as lawmakers do all that we can to have their voices heard.  Although military mail is technically supposed to carry a postmark, the reality of the situation is that exigent circumstances aboard Navy ships and in foreign theaters can result in mail being sent without a postmark. Because several states require a postmark for an absentee ballot to be counted, the unfortunate outcome is that many military persons who went through the timely process of registering, applying for and sending in a ballot are disenfranchised through no fault of their own.  My bill provides that lack of a postmark does not result in automatic rejection of an overseas ballots in states that require a postmark. Specifically, the bill states that as long as there is conclusive proof of timely sending and the ballot is received by a state within 10 days after a federal election, mere lack of a postmark will not prevent the ballot from being counted.  My bill lists two ways in which conclusive proof of timely sending may be established, although any conclusive evidence could establish timely sending. If a ballot is received on or before election day, logic dictates that the ballot was sent in a timely manner. Also, timely sending would be conclusively established by examining the date of signature and witness on the outside of the ballot envelope. Fraudulently misstating the date would be punishable by civil and criminal penalties.  In addition to creating a uniform absentee voting law, my bill includes provisions to allow polling places on domestic military bases. These provisionswill make it easier for military personnel located on remote bases to be able to participate in the voting process. Voting is one of the most important civic duties in a democracy. By allowing voting to take place on-base, we as the Senate, will guarantee that the men and women of our military will have every opportunity to exercise their important right to vote.  Mr. President, confidence, clarity, and participation in our voting process are vital to the continuation of our great democracy. The election of this past year illustrates the need for change in our voting procedures. While more reform will be needed, my bill is a crucial step in that direction. For this and all the above reasons, I urge you and all my other colleagues to support the passage of this all important bill.                                 ______                                       By
