 President, I rise today to share with the Senate a tribute to Mickie Pailthorp, a leader in my home State of Washington who passed away on July 31, 2002. On August 8, I was honored to speak at a memorial service for Mickie, and today I want toshare her accomplishments with my colleages.  I will never forget my first meeting with Mickie Pailthorp. It was early in 1992, and I had just announced that I was running for the U.S. Senate. Many in the established political community had written me off. They said I hadn't paid my dues. They said I couldn't raise the money. They even said I was too short.  Many dismissed me sight unseen, but Mickie decided to find out for herself. Shortly after I announced, Mickie called my campaign office. She said she was thinking about supporting me because I was a woman candidate, but she absolutely had to meet me first. I thought, ``No problem.'' We met at a restaurant for what I thought would be a casual dinner.  Instead, Mickie grilled me for over an hour. She wanted to know very specifically what I was going to do about this issue and that issue. She wanted to know why I thought I could win, and she wanted to know that I would work hard. To be honest, by the end of our dinner, I really wasn't sure whether she was going to help me.  But before I knew it, she was one of my strongest behind-the-scenes supporters, and her support made a difference. Mickie quietly opened doors for me. She got me into places that I couldn't go on my own.  When I won the election, she didn't come after me seeking favors or demanding credit, but I knew she was watching. Every year at Joel and Mickie's Christmas party, she would come up to me and say very quietly either: ``I was really proud of what you did here.'' Or more sternly, ``Now you've got to be careful about this.'' So I knew she was watching.  When I think about Mickie, I remember her as whirlwind of passion and energy. She was there fighting the good fight for women on the ERA and so many other issues before it was popular and before it seemed possible. One of the things that made Mickie so unique is that she didn't seek any credit. She was happy to work behind the scenes. Mickie never needed to be the ``picture'' for the cause, but she clearly painted every line.  Some leaders climb up to the top and when they get there they pull up the ladder behind them and leave everyone else stuck below. But Mickie's whole purpose was to help other women make it to the top, and she did that well. So today, while a generation of young women might not know Mickie's name, they know the women she helped elect. And they know that they can make a difference, too.  Mickie Pailthorp was not a visible women's leader, but she made a lot of other women leaders visible. And because Mickie didn't trumpet her own accomplishments, it's up to us to make sure that others know about this remarkable woman and carry on her legacy. So I invite Mickie's friends and fans in Washington State to tell their children and grandchildren about an energetic, passionate woman named Mickie Pailthorp, and the opportunities she gave all of us.                          ____________________
