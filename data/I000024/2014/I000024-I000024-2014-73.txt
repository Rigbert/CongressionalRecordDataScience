President, I wish to remember the life and sacrifice of a remarkable young man, Army 2LT Tobias C. Alexander. Along with one other soldier, Toby died May 20, 2012 of injuries he sustained when his unit was attacked with improvised explosive devices in Tarin Kowt, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  Toby was born June 8, 1981 in Wesel, Germany and graduated from Eglin High School in 1999.  Toby entered the Active Duty Army in August 2002 as a signal intel analyst. He deployed to Afghanistan in 2007 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom with the Combined Joint Special Operations Task Force--Afghanistan (3rd Special Forces Group, Airborne). He obtained the rank of sergeant first class.  In 2011 he earned a bachelors' degree in interdisciplinary studies from Cameron University where he was a part of the Reserve Officer Training Corps. After receiving his commission, he attended the Field Artillery Basic Officer Leader Course B at Fort Sill, OK and was then assigned to the 1st Battalion, 14th Field Artillery, 214th Fires Brigade. He served as a platoon leader for Alpha Battery before being selected for the Security Forces Advisory Team, SFAT, which was responsible for the training of Afghanistan's national security forces. He deployed for his second tour to Afghanistan in June 2011.  His friend, Myles Mendez, said ``He was the guy you went to if you needed to know something, so a lot of people were always going to him with `What's this? What's that? Can you help me?' He was the go-to guy.''  ``I honestly don't think that he would have had it any other way. I think if he had to choose to go out, I think he would have wanted to have it serving his country. He was a patriot.''  On May 30, 2012, the family held funeral services at Cameron Baptist Church in Lawton, OK.  He is survived by his wife Amanda, his children: Angelicia, Kevin and Lexie, and his parents Bill and Heike Alexander.  Today we remember Army 2LT Tobias C. Alexander, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                Army Private First Class Jon R. Townsend  Mr. President, I also wish to remember Army PFC Jon R. Townsend. Along with three other soldiers, Jon died September 16, 2012 in Zabul province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom due to injuries sustained due to enemy small arms fire.  Jon was born October 28, 1992 and was raised in Claremore, OK. Two days after he graduated from Claremore-Sequoyah High School in 2011 he left for Army basic training at 17. His friends and family watched as he transformed--downing 5 dozen eggs a week--from an average kid into a bulked-up recruit.  After completing initial training, Jon was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 23rd Infantry Regiment, 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Infantry Division, based at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, WA. He deployed to Afghanistan in December 2011.  His mother said that Jon believed in the mission and was particularly fond of the children he encountered. He asked her to send him care packages with treats that he could give his ``babies,'' and he'd use his wet wipes to clean the children. ``Jon loved life and wanted to share it with everybody,'' she said. ``He wanted to make everybody happy.''  In February 2012, he went home on leave from Afghanistan and married his high school sweetheart, Brittany Carden. They had 3 days together as a married couple before he departed back to Afghanistan.  ``I'm not mad. . .Jon did this because he loved his country,'' his mother said. ``He wanted to make it safe, and (joining the military) was the only way he knew how.''  On September 28, 2012, the family held a service at First Baptist Church and Jon was laid to rest in Lone Chapel Cemetery in Claremore, OK.  Jon is survived by his wife Brittany Townsend; Lois Harrison, granny; Karen (Katy Harrison) Nelson, mother; Aunt Honee Sue (Harrison) Grumbein and spouse Keith Grumbien and their children: Kobe, Kalvin, and Katelyn of Foyil; respected father-like figure Roland Long of Foyil; Jeremy Nelson, brother, and spouse, Courtney and their children: Austin, Jeremiah, Keegan and Xelia Nelson; Andrew Bingham; and Caleb and Myah Smith; Jennifer (Nelson) Tucker and spouse Paul Tucker and children: Tanner and Addison; Nancy (Roberts) Carden, mother-in-law; James L. Carden, Jr., father; Cherish (Carden) Moye, sister, and husband Brent Moye; and James Larry Carden, III, brother; and faithful four-legged friend, Teddy. He was preceded in death by his father RobertWayne Townsend, cousin Shawn Mersa, maternal grandfather (Bud) or Carroll Harrison, Jr., Sharon Rice (Harrison) aunt.  Today we remember Army PFC Jon R. Townsend, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                       Hospitalman Eric D. Warren  Mr. President, as well I would like to pay tribute to the life and sacrifice of Navy HM Eric D. ``Doc'' Warren. Eric died May 26, 2012 of injuries he sustained from an improvised explosive device in Sangin district, Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.  Eric was born November 22, 1988 and was a resident of Shawnee, OK. As a child, he was active in Cub Scouts, little league sports, and earned a black belt in Tae Kwon Do. Eric was also active in his church youth group, football, wrestling, and drama.  After graduating from McLoud High School, he enlisted in the Navy, graduated from Corpsman School and completed Fleet Marine Force training as a combat corpsman. He was then assigned to 1st Battalion, 8th Marine Regiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force, Camp Lejeune, NC.  He was deployed to Afghanistan in January 2012 for his third tour of duty.  ``When he was home last time, I shook his hand and he hugged my neck and whispered in my ear ``pray for me,'' Reverend Ron Baldridge said. ``I prayed for him every day.''  Eric was a skinny kid with a mischievous streak who took pleasure in challenging his pastor and youth minister, Reverend Baldridge explained. Kevin Spurgin, youth minister at Eric's church said Hospitalman Warren knew the possible consequences of being in one of the most dangerous areas of Afghanistan, but any fears he may have had were overcome by pride for the job he was doing there.  His father, Marvin, said his son never put himself first and the only enemy he knew was at war. ``He was real passionate about being with his guys over there,'' said Marvin, pausing to wipe away his tears. ``He wanted to make sure they were safe.''  On June 5, 2012, the family held a funeral service at Downtown Pentecostal Holiness Church in Shawnee, OK. There was a 60-second standing ovation for Eric during his funeral service to commemorate Hospitalman Warren's service to his country, and the ultimate sacrifice he and his family made.  Eric is the son of Donna Beth and Marvin Warren Jr., who adopted 11-year-old Eric Warren after marrying his mother. His birth father is William Burris, according to his obituary.  Today we remember Navy HM Eric D. ``Doc'' Warren, a young man who loved his family and country, and gave his life as a sacrifice for freedom.                          ____________________
