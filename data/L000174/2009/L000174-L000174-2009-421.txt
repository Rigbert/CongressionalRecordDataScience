President, I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Nevada, the distinguished majority leader. I will stay here for a few minutes, if there are some amendments pending. If there are some amendments pending that we could take by voice vote, I am perfectly willing to do that tonight. If there are rollcalls, if there are amendments people think will need rollcalls, I don't know what time the distinguished leader wants to go back on the bill in the morning, but I would suggest that if we start early on that----
