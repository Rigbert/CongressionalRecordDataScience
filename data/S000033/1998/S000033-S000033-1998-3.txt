 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Republican leadership's process which has brought us to the vote we cast today, a vote which merges eight separate appropriations bills into one huge 4,000-page omnibus bill which will spend some $500 billion with one vote.  Within this huge bill there are some excellent and important provisions which are good for my State of Vermont and which are good for this country, but there are some awful provisions and wasteful provisions which are going to cost taxpayers billions and billions of dollars. It is a travesty and an insult to the democratic process that Members have not been able to vote separately on these provisions to maintain what is good, to get out what is bad, and to end up with the best legislation that would serve the interests of the American people.  I would hope that regardless of our political point of view or the party we may be in, that we will work together to make sure that a process like this does not take place again.  Within the positive aspects of this bill, there is some real help for dairy farmers in the State of Vermont and throughout this country in terms of the extension of the Northeast Dairy Compact. There are some very important provisions for our Gulf War veterans, who have never gotten the kind of treatment that they need, and this bill will provide them with some real help now and in the future.  There is some good help for those home health care agencies in Vermont and throughout this country who have suffered severe cuts as a result of the balanced budget agreement last year. There is good legislation extending the Cancer Registry Act, helping those people who are victims or hurting from cancer. There are some good provisions, but the process has not been good.
