Speaker, I rise today to join with the Mt. Rubidoux District California Inland Empire Council of the Boy Scouts of America in saluting Debbi Huffman Guthrie as their Distinguished Citizen of the Year--2001.  Debbi, a lifelong resident of Riverside, California, is a third generation owner of a roofing company established by her grandfather in 1921. As a native Riversider, Debbi attended Ramona High School and California State University, San Bernardino. Debbi Guthrie and her husband have four daughters and four grandchildren.  Debbi Guthrie has been and continues to be a shining example of a person with passion and principles who has strived to have a positive effect upon her local community. Her approach and policy has been a simple one, that a community's strength comes from just that--the community. We must first start close to home and then radiate out if we hope to have fulfilling lives and impact others.  Debbi Guthrie has unquestionably become a leader of women in her community, whose legacy originates from her company's history of giving back to the community. Her tireless, engaged action can be seen in an incredible array of community life, including: Trustee on the University of California, Riverside Foundation; President of the Riverside Community College/City Task Force; Chair-elect of the United Way of the Inland Valleys; Member of the Executive Committee, Monday Morning Group of Western Riverside County; Chair of the Roofing Apprenticeship Advisory Board; President of the Kiwanis Club of Riverside; and, Trustee on the March Field Museum Foundation.  As a leader among women of the Inland Empire, Debbi has received countless other awards and recognitions, including: 1993 Riverside YWCA's Woman of Achievement ATHENA Award, 1994 Entrepreneur of the Year/Small Business, Ernst & Young, Inc. Magazine and Merrill Lynch; 1997 United States Small Business Administration District Small Business Person of the Year; 1998 Fellow, University of California, Riverside A. Gary Anderson Graduate School of Management; 1999-2000 Volunteer of the Year, Greater Riverside Chamber of Commerce; 2000 Management Leader of the Year, University of California Riverside A. Gary Anderson graduate School of Management; and, 2001 President's Award, Greater Riverside Chamber of Commerce.  Volunteers are critical to fostering a spirit of understanding, good citizenship and good government in the United States and worldwide. Since 1910, the Boy Scouts of America has instilled young men with the drive to ``help other people at all times,'' and to keep themselves ``physically strong, mentally awake, and morally straight.'' Debbi Guthrie exemplifies these attributes and offers herself as a role model to young men and women, thereby assuring that an active interest in the civic, culture, social and moral welfare of our communities is passed on from generation to generation.  Debbi Guthrie has gone above and beyond the Boy Scout protocol. I ask of my colleagues in Congress to please join me in honoring Debbi Guthrie for her courage, innovation, and commitment to the youth of tomorrow as she is recognized on October 20th.                          ____________________
