 President, I commend Senator Kyl for his hard work and determination in bringing S. 474 to the floor today. I am most appreciative that during the process, you have worked closely with several parimutuel industry groups to make certain that S. 474 does not unduly restrict Internet commerce. The bill reflects a clear understanding of this emerging medium and its potential for both honest and unscrupulous purposes.
