President, my understanding is that there are sanctuary cities in about 23 different States across America. What the Vitter amendment will do is to take away the COPS funding from those cities.  The offeror of this amendment has not spoken to the police departments. If you will speak to the policemen, they will tell you they need the cooperation of everyone to solve crimes and stop crime. If you create fear inthe minds of those who are here in an undocumented status that any cooperation with the police will result in their arrest, they will not cooperate and criminals will go free. There will be more people who will become victims--exactly the opposite of what we want to see in America.  Let's not use the COPS Program as some sort of threat. If you want to deal with immigration, deal with it responsibly in a comprehensive way. Please, let's defeat the Vitter amendment.
