 President, today the Senate will turn our attention to legislation. We need to address the debt limit and secure the full faith and credit of the United States. We need to continue to secure the funding our national defense demands. Fortunately, the pending legislation will accomplish precisely that.  In recent weeks, key officials on President Trump's team engaged in extensive negotiations with Speaker Pelosi and the Democratic House. Given the exigencies of a divided government, we knew that any bipartisan agreement on funding levels would not appear perfect to either side, but the administration negotiated a strong deal.  First and foremost, it ensures our Federal Government will not approach any kind of short-term debt crisis in the coming weeks or months. It secures our Nation's full faith and credit and ensures that Congress will not throw this kind of unnecessary wrench into the gears of job growth and a thriving economy.  What is more, despite the desires of the Democratic House, the administration has successfully kept far-left poison pills and policy riders entirely out of the process.  We had heard that our Democratic colleagues across the Capitol were clamoring to take us backward on the issue of life, perhaps even targeting the Hyde Amendment or forcing more taxpayer dollars back toward Planned Parenthood. We had heard they were clamoring to try to handcuff the administration's important work on border security, but on those fronts, and many others, the far left was denied any such victories. There are no poison pills--a big win for the White House.  I ask unanimous consent that the terms of this agreement and the specific prohibition of poison pills be printed in the Record.
