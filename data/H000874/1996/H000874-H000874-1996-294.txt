Speaker, I rise in support of the Kassebaum-Roukema-Kennedy legislation. I rise lamenting the fact that we will not take ``yes'' for an answer. Very frankly, the Kennedy-Kassebaum-Roukema bill was bottled up in the Senate until the heat got so high recently that the Republican in the Senate who then publicly admitted holding up the bill said no, let it go forward.  Mr. Speaker, all of us in a bipartisan way agree that we ought to precludepreexisting conditions being an impediment to our citizens getting insurance. All of us believe that people ought not to be locked into their jobs because they do not have portability of health care security through their insurance. All of us believe that in a bipartisan way. That is what the gentlewoman from New Jersey [Mrs. Roukema] was saying. That is what Senator Kassebaum is saying from Kansas. But we are having trouble taking yes for an answer.  Mr. Speaker, I personally believe that the medical savings account, although superficially appearing to provide some options, in fact will increase the cost for those who are less healthy and less wealthy. That is not just a fancy phrase. I think it is reality.  In addition, as my colleague, the gentleman from Maryland [Mr. Cardin] expressed when he spoke on Ways and Means, our State is very concerned about precluding it from making determinations. In fact, we are stopping States from having the flexibility that our Republican colleagues say they ought to have.
