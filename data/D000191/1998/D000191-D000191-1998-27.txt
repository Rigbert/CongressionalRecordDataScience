Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4079 which will authorize Federal and non-Federal projects at the Bureau of Reclamation's Folsom Dam Reservoir. These projects are intended to help and control and monitor the temperature of water released from Folsom Dam so the fish may benefit from the releases of cooler water. The amount authorized by H.R. 4079 for the temperature control devices at Folsom Dam is $5 million, although no specific requirements for reimbursing of these costs are set forth in the bill. It is my understanding the Bureau of Reclamation will consider these costs as capital improvements to the CVP project and will allocate the costs among CVP water and power customers in accordance with current CVP cost allocation procedures.  The cost estimate report prepared by the Congressional Budget Office on H.R. 4079 clearly states that, quote, about 4 million, end quote, of the cost of constructing temperature control devices and monitoring apparatus at Folsom Dam would be repaid by the water and power users. With this understanding regarding the reimbursement of costs, the administration has advised us they do not object to this legislation. The control of water temperatures released from dams is a proven and cost-effective method of improving survival of fish.                              {time}  1645  I thank the chairman of the Subcommittee on Water and Power for his commitment to this legislation, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 4079.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
