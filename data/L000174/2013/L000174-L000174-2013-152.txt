gave his historic ``I Have a Dream'' speech. That remarkable moment in this Nation's history was a peaceful day of unity and we rightfully remember the inspiring words of Dr. King.  We are reminded this week of just how quickly that hope and positive signs of progress were challenged by a stunning act of violence. Just a few days after Dr. King inspired a nation with his dream for his four children, four other children in Birmingham were killed at their church because of the color of their skin. On September 15, 1963, a bomb was planted by members of the Ku Klux Klan at the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Addie Mae Collins, 14, Denise McNair, 11, Carole Robertson, 14, and Cynthia Wesley, 14, were innocent victims of racial hatred. The inhumanity of those who conspired and killed children in a church may seem unimaginable in our Nation today, but, as Colbert King of the Washington Post noted recently, ``Before al-Qaeda, there was the Ku Klux Klan.''  We celebrate the significant strides we have made with determined efforts in forging a more just and equal America since the KKK's reign of terror, and yet we cannot forget that these events occurred just days after the March on Washington. It occurred in the lifetime of 88 of 100 members of this Senate body. It is our recent history, not ancient history.  The tragic deaths of those four little girls, along with the other shining examples of bravery, patriotism and resolve during the Civil Rights movement, catalyzed passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. These laws helped to transform our Nation and ensure that our most basic promises to our citizens are more than just words on a page, honored only in their breach.  The inspiring possibilities described so eloquently by Dr. King, and the depravity and horror of the Birmingham church bombing just weeks later, reveal an important lesson about our history. The path to progress in our Democracy is winding, and sometimes very, very difficult. We know from our shared experience that we cannot be the Nation that we strive to be by setting the dial on autopilot and assuming that all will be well. There are so many reminders of the winding path to progress, and recently we experienced a considerable detour.  Three months ago, a narrow majority of the Supreme Court held that the coverage provision of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional. Section 5, often called the ``heart of the Voting Rights Act,'' provided a remedy for unconstitutional discrimination in voting by requiring jurisdictions with the worst histories of discrimination to ``preclear'' all voting changes before they could take effect. The remedy is both necessary and important because it stops the discriminatory voting practice before our fellow Americans' rights are violated. By striking down the coverage provision for Section 5, the Supreme Court's ruling leaves this vital protection unenforceable.  While certain barriers to participation have been eliminated, we continue to see discriminatory voting measures such as arbitrary registration rules, polling-place manipulation, voter purges, challenges or other devices to deny access to the ballot, as well as vote dilution tactics. Since the Court's recent decision in Shelby County, several states have already decided to impose new barriers to voting, thereby reversing the gains that we have made through the last five decades.  These include measures taken by Texas, North Carolina, and Florida to undermine their citizens' right to vote and to participate in our democracy. But on this day, when we reflect on the contributions of our children to the cause of liberty, perhaps no story is more worth retelling than the story of the Prairie View A&M students. It is a story that bridges the past with both the present and the future. Students from that historically black university have been fighting for their voting rights for more than four decades now, and if not for the Voting Rights Act, many of these students would have been denied their fundamental right to vote.  The history is well-documented in a recent Houston Chronicle article by Renee Lee. I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record. In the 1970s, the Justice Department filed an action against Waller County and its state officials for using a questionnaire to deny Prairie View students the right to vote. In 1992, 19 students were indicted for improperly voting, which ultimately led to a U.S. Supreme Court ruling that authorized college students to register and vote in communities where they live while at school.  In 2004, the NAACP and four Prairie View students filed a federal case after the county district attorney tried to enforce residency requirements that would keep students from voting. A Section 5 enforcement suit was filed by civil rights organizations around the same time after county officials shortened the early voting period at the campus in violation of Section 5. This effort to narrow student participation came at a time when a student leader sought elective office. Testimony about this recent chapter at Prairie View A&M was submitted to Congress in support of the 2006 Reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act. It was compelling evidence that voting discrimination persists in that community and that even a Supreme Court ruling was not sufficient protection.  Two years after the reauthorization of Section 5, in 2008, nearly 1,000 Prairie View students marched in protest for the lack of an early voting place on campus. The county had reduced the number of early voting polling sites from six to one, requiring students to walk miles to the nearest polling location. If you did not know the long and tortured history of the schemes to block Prairie View A&M voters from their constitutionally protected rights, moving a polling place may seem like merely a matter of administrative convenience, but in voting, both history and context matter. The Justice Department under Attorney General Michael Mukasey ultimately entered into a consent decree with Waller County that required officials to restore three polling sites. And now, the students from this historically black university are once again fighting to exercise their fundamental right to vote by demanding an accessible polling place. The Prairie View A&M story illustrates that sometimes discrimination starts early, and that some officials are surprisingly persistent in their efforts to erect barriers in the path of our youngest voters. The Voting Rights Act stands as a guardian against these schemes to discourage young voter participation.  But now, following the Shelby County ruling, and with a college leader seeking elective office in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, local officials have borrowed the Prairie View A&M disenfranchisement playbook. There, a party chairman challenged the eligibility of Montravius King from standing for office by claiming that Mr. King did not meet the residency requirement because he lived in a dorm. The premise of this challenge is flatly contradicted by Supreme Court precedent and the decades of advocacy over Prairie View A&M students' voter access. Nevertheless, North Carolina local officials were initially able to disqualify Mr. King's candidacy. There were also indications that some in Elizabeth City, North Carolina intended to employ new voter challenge procedures in the state to prevent students from the historically black college from voting. It is perhaps no wonder, then, that part of the officials' plan also involved removing the polling place from the campus. Last week, local election board reversed itself only after a huge public outcry, but these events reveal that some things have changed and some, unfortunately, have not. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an article from the Washington Post by Mary Curtis, which documents the efforts by North Carolina's state officials to infringe on the fundamental right to vote.  When President Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law in 1965, he declared that: ``Through this act, and its enforcement, an important instrument of freedom passes into the hands of millions of our citizens.'' We must remain vigilant and protect the rights of all Americans to exercise this fundamental right.  The recent Supreme Court decision placed the burden on Congress to respond with a legislative fix. It is therefore our duty and constitutional obligation to not waver from the path of greater political inclusion that we have set for ourselves and the Nation through our bipartisan support of the Voting Rights Act.  We must restore the vital protections that were weakened by the Supreme Court's ruling. We must provide additional remedies for states and counties, anywhere in the Nation, that not only have a history of discriminating against their voters, but continue to do so. We must extend the reach of these protections to states that commit serious voting rights violations in the future. We must amend the existing provisions of the Act to make those protections more effective. And we must provide greater transparency for changes to voting procedures so that voters are made aware of these changes. These are the kinds of bipartisan solutions that we should all be able to agree on.  As we continue the fight to combat discrimination, we should remember the words of Dr. King. We should remember the aspirations of students like Montravius King. We should remember the contributions of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Congressional leader John Lewis. And we should remember that those four girls who died in the 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing, and who are being posthumously honored today with Congressional Gold Medals, were part of a movement that helped make America better, stronger andmore just. The way to truly honor them is not by words alone but through our actions and leadership. While we commemorate the sacrifice of these four girls, our work does not end with this commemoration. Our work is ahead of us and we must act together in a bipartisan manner to protect the fundamental right to vote for all Americans. All of our children are depending on it.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Washington Post, Aug. 29, 2013]Past is Present as North Carolina Honors 1963 March and Battles Voting                                   Laws                          (By Mary C. Curtis)       Charlotte.--In North Carolina, commemorations of the 50th      anniversary of the March on Washington and Martin Luther      King's dream credited past struggles while a current battle      over voting laws took center stage.       In an uptown Charlotte park Wednesday, the crowd used the      examples of civil rights pioneers in a continuation of the      Moral Monday protests against conservative laws from the      Republican-controlled state legislature. Similar gatherings      were planned in each of the state's 13 congressional      districts. While many issues, including education and health      care spending, were reflected in comments and emblazoned on      signs, the new state voter-ID bill was a unifying cause.       Later Wednesday evening, several Democratic and Republican      legislators took questions from their Mecklenburg County      constituents in a raucous forum called, ironically as it      turned out, ``Solving It Together.'' At the top of the list      in hundreds of questions submitted beforehand--voter-ID laws.       The new laws have already garnered national publicity, and      not the kind North Carolina likes. At the state CEO Forum in      Raleigh last week, former secretary of state Colin Powell      criticized the voting legislation, saying, ``These kinds of      actions do not build on the base.'' He made those remarks      after GOP Gov. Pat McCrory, who had signed the bill into law,      addressed the group, though McCrory later said he left before      the retired general spoke.       Besides requiring photo ID, the bill shortens early voting      by a week, ends preregistration for 16- and 17-year-olds,      eliminates same-day voter registration, Sunday voting and      straight-ticket voting, prohibits university students from      using their college IDs and increases the number of poll      watchers who can challenge a voter's eligibility, among other      provisions. It is currently being challenged in court and      Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) has asked Attorney General Eric      Holder to take action as the Justice Department has in Texas.       Actions of GOP-controlled elections boards in North      Carolina have also been grabbing headlines, from the closing      of a polling place at Appalachian State University to the      ruling that a student at historically black Elizabeth City      State University cannot run for city council using his      college address to establish residency.       At Charlotte's Marshall Park, a program of speakers and      singers, as well as the sunny weather, duplicated the mood of      the 1963 Washington march. Under a voter registration tent, a      pledge card from the state NAACP urged attendees to be part      of the ``Forward Together, Not One Step Back'' movement voter      empowerment effort. The Rev. William Barber, head of the      state NAACP, was on the program.       Amy Gollinger, a physician from Davidson, N.C., held a sign      reading ``Protect every American's Right to Vote,'' which she      alternated with ones that said ``Protect women's rights'' and      ``Why deny Medicaid to struggling families?'' referencing      McCrory's decision to refuse federal Medicaid funds. She said      Wednesday was a ``perfect time'' to protest. ``Even though      we've come far since 1963, our state legislature has shown we      have much further to go, '' she said. ``It's unbelievable      we've gone from one of the most progressive states to one of      the most regressive. I hope it empowers voters to get out and      make a change.''       Sitting next to Gollinger with a sign reading ``Stop the      attacks on public education!'' James Davidson of Charlotte      said, ``I'm here for Martin Luther King,'' and called      proposals from the legislature ``going back to Jim Crow.'' He      said he hoped new laws would spur citizens to action. ``They      went to sleep and didn't get out to vote,'' he said.       At the Mecklenburg legislators' forum at Central Piedmont      Community College, the crowd in the packed auditorium loudly      registered its approval, disapproval or disbelief as      representatives of the state House and Senate explained      actions on voting, education and the back-and-forth over      attempts to change control of Charlotte Douglas International      Airport from the city to a state authority to a commission.       In heavily Democratic Charlotte, audience sentiment at the      forum, sponsored in part by local media outlets, was loudly      skeptical of the Republican-led changes.       Voting rights led the discussion, with one questioner at      the microphone asking for data on the fraud that is given as      reason for the photo-ID law (the answer came in anecdotal      examples) and another quoting former president Bill Clinton's      words at the Washington commemoration of the 1963 march, ``A      great democracy does not make it harder to vote than to buy      an assault weapon.''       From somewhere in the crowd came the tweet that there was      much more debate onstage than in the North Carolina General      Assembly, where GOP super-majorities were accused of rushing      through bills.       It seemed less Old South vs. New South than voter voices      vs. ALEC (the American Legislative Exchange Council), with      one question comparing North Carolina's bills to model      legislation from the conservative nonprofit. State Rep. Bill      Brawley, a Republican and active ALEC member, said he      believed in the organization's goals of limited government,      free market capitalism and federalism; Rep. Ruth Samuelson, a      Charlotte Republican, said she has attended one of the      group's meetings. All of the legislators said they serve      their constituents, not any organization.       State Sen. Dan Clodfelter, a Charlotte Democrat, said he      remembered a time when ``we weren't afraid in this state to      be different from the states around us,'' when ideas ``didn't      come out of anybody's playbook.''       After the forum, voters lingered to continue the contact      with officials some thought had not been listening closely      enough during the legislative session. Clodfelter was wistful      as he spoke of the times North Carolina passed pioneering      laws, such as the Racial Justice Act, which allowed death-row      inmates to appeal their sentences and have them converted to      life in prison without parole if they could prove racial bias      in their cases. (It was repealed this year.) ``Now we're      known for the wrong kind of things,'' he said. When one of      his Republican colleagues noted that the Democrat had      Wednesday's crowd on his side, Clodfelter said he answered,      ``You made them that way.''       State Sen. Jeff Tarte, a Republican who had managed to be      conciliatory in his conservatism during the panel, insisted      he ``loved'' the night's verbal battles. ``It's what the      American system is all about,'' he said, though since his      party passed its legislative agenda, it was easy for him to      be magnanimous.       Samuelson sat on the edge of the stage as the crowd      filtered out. She defended her support of the voting bill,      and noted a New York Times editorial ``The Decline of North      Carolina'' that criticized the general Assembly's actions and      caused quite a stir in this image-conscious state. She said      studies have found that ``after this bill,'' it's easier to      vote in North Carolina than New York.       When asked what she thought of congressman and civil rights      veteran John Lewis's attack on voter-ID laws, particularly on      the date marking the 50th anniversary of his appearance with      other civil rights leaders at the 1963 March on Washington,      she said, ``I appreciate the sacrifices they made, I      appreciate the emotion around this issue,'' then added, ``I'm      trying to protect the integrity of their vote. . . . They      worked hard for that vote; I want to make sure it doesn't get      stolen.''       State Sen. Malcolm Graham, a Charlotte Democrat, had said      onstage that in North Carolina you're more likely to get      struck by lightning than be affected by voter fraud. He said      that when his daughter returned to historically black      Winston-Salem State University this year, she and other      students were greeted with stories that a county board of      elections chair wanted to eliminate the school's early voting      site. ``Our national brand as a state has been tarnished,''      he said.       After the forum, Graham said he believed the passion would      extend past Wednesday night. ``This thing has legs,'' he      said. The test, he said, would be the tough reelection Hagan      faces in 2014. ``That's the line in the sand the Democrats      have to draw.''                                  ____               [From the Houston Chronicle, Aug. 1, 2013]     Prairie View A&M Student Fights for Voting Poll Site on Campus                           (By Renee C. Lee)       A Prairie View A&M University student leader is calling on      officials to add a campus polling place to remedy what she      and a civil rights leader described as decades of voter      suppression.       Priscilla Barbour, president of the Student Government      Association at the historically black university, sent a      letter to Texas Secretary of State John Steen and Waller      County Registrar Robyn German last week requesting that      action be taken by Oct. 1. Barbour says students' voting      rights are being violated because the nearest polling      location is more than a mile away.       The Oct. 1 first deadline, she said, would allow time to      make students aware of the new polling place before the      November elections.       Barbour, a senior, hopes her request will end a battle that      former Prairie View students have failed to win over the      years.       ``We've always had problems,'' said Barbour, who is active      with the Texas League of Young Voters. ``Voting is supposed      to be something that's convenient, something you have the      right to do without walking a great distance or standing in      line.''       The political science major said students were forced      during last year's general election to wait in a long line to      vote at the polling location at the local community center.       The city of Prairie View accommodates students by placing a      polling location on campus, but Waller County officials have      refused to do the same, she said.       German, the county's new registrar, could not be reached      for comment Wednesday.     Steen's spokeswoman, Alicia Pierce, said Steen was drafting a      letter to German.       ``We don't generally determine polling locations,'' Pierce      said. ``That decision is made at the county level, but the      secretary is willing to meet with Miss Barbour. We'll be glad      to work with her.''       Gary Bledsoe, president of the NAACP state chapter, said      Waller County has a history of voter intimidation and      suppression of black voters.                          Repeated complaints       The lack of polling places on campus, lost voter      registration applications and problems with ballot boxes are      among the many voting issues that have come up time and again      in the county, he said.       ``Students are entitled to a voting poll on campus,''      Bledsoe said. ``They have been fighting for one for many      years. It's a righteous request.''       Barbour's action follows a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling      that struck down a key provision in the Voting Rights Act.      The law protects minority voters from discrimination at the      polls and, until June, required nine states with a      discriminatory history, including Texas, to get federal      approval before making changes to election laws.       The ruling gave Texas and other states the green light to      push through voter ID laws, which civil rights leaders say      will inhibit minority voting.       Prairie View has been at the center of voting right issues      as far back as the 1970s, when the U.S. attorney general      filed action against Waller County and state officials for      the use a questionnaire that denied Prairie View students the      right to vote.       In 1992, 19 students were indicted for improperly voting,      which led to a Supreme Court ruling that authorized students      to register and vote in communities where they live.       The NAACP and four students filed a federal lawsuit in 2004      after the county district attorney tried to enforce residency      requirements that would keep students from voting. Another      suit was filed around the same time after county officials      shortened the early voting period at the campus without      Justice Department approval.       The district attorney rescinded his action as part of a      settlement and county officials added an extra early voting      day on campus after being questioned by the Justice      Department.                            Previous protest       In 2008, nearly 1,000 Prairie View students marched in      protest of the lack of an early voting place on campus. The      county, citing budget concerns, reduced the number of early      voting polling sites from six to one, requiring students to      walk miles to the polling location. The Justice Department      instructed county officials to add three polling sites.       Barbour said she was a apprehensive about sending her      letters but figured she had nothing to lose.       ``Even if nothing's accomplished, now the tone is set,''      she said. ``I'm not the first to tackle the issue and I'm      sure I won't be the last. This gives students a chance to be      knowledgeable and take a stand.''                          ____________________
