Chairman, many of our communities do operate convention centers and they lease out space. If somebody turns on a TV set because they are selling a product or asking to go on vacation someplace, then the city or the owner of the convention center gets hit up for a licensing fee because they could not turn the hand of the tenant on the dial to turn the TV set off.  Mr. Chairman, while considering the underlying bill, we have suggested that Congress is the appropriate place for the expansion of the scope of copyright expansion of business' obligations to pay additional fees. Meanwhile, the licensing societies and their defenders in the Congress claim that this body has no role in the music licensing debate where the central issue is a proposal to perhaps modestly diminish their ability to extract fees. But the Constitution itself suggests the need for balanced intellectual property rights. That is precisely what my amendment accomplishes.  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues not to stand aside and permit this Congress to do the bidding of the copyright holders who seek a one-way street to expand their rights while denying balance and fairness to the small business users of intellectual property. My amendment is supported by virtually every small business organization in the country, including the NFIB, the National Restaurant Association, the National Retail Federation, home builders, florists, and the list goes on.  In the name of balance and in the name of America's small business, I ask my colleagues for an ``aye'' vote on the Sensenbrenner amendment.                              {time}  1200 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. McCollum to Amendment No. 1 Offered by                            Mr. Sensenbrenner  Mr. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:       Amendment No. 3 offered by Mr. McCollum to Amendment No. 1      offered by Mr. Sensenbrenner:       In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted as title II,      insert the following:   TITLE II--MUSIC LICENSING EXEMPTION FOR FOOD SERVICE OR DRINKING                              ESTABLISHMENTS     SEC. 201.

SEC. 203. LICENSING BY PERFORMING RIGHTS SOCIETIES.       (a) In General.--Chapter 5 of title 17, United States Code,      is amended by adding at the end the following:     ``Sec. 512. determinations of reasonable license fee for        individual proprietors       ``In the case of any performing rights society subject to a      consent decree which provides for the determination of      reasonable license fees to be charged by the performing      rights society, notwithstanding the provisions of that      consent decree, an individual proprietor who owns or operates      fewer than 3     food service or drinking establishments in which nondramatic      musical works are performed publicly and who claims that any      license agreement offered by that performing rights society      to the industry of which the individual proprietor is a      member is unreasonable in its license fee as to that      individual proprietor, shall be entitled to determination of      a reasonable license fee as follows:       ``(1) The individual proprietor may commence such      proceeding for determination of a reasonable license fee by      filing an application in the applicable district court under      paragraph (2) that a rate disagreement exists and by serving      a copy of the application on the performing rights society      Such proceeding shall commence in the applicable district      court within 90 days after the service of such copy, except      that such 90-day requirement shall be subject to the      administrative requirements of the court.       ``(2) The proceeding under paragraph (1) shall be held, at      the individual proprietor's election, in the judicial      district of the district court with jurisdiction over the      applicable consent decree or in that place of holding court      of a district court that is the seat of the Federal circuit      (other than the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit) in      which the proprietor's establishment is located.       ``(3) Such proceeding shall be held before the judge of the      court with jurisdiction over the consent decree governing the      performing rights society. At the discretion of the court,      the proceeding shall be held before a special master or      magistrate judge appointed by such judge. Should that consent      decree provide for the appointment of an advisor or advisors      to the court for any purpose, any such advisor shall be the      special master so named by the court.       ``(4) In any such proceeding, the industry rate, or, in the      absence of an industry rate, the most recent license fee      agreed to by the parties or determined by the court, shall be      presumed to have been reasonable at the time it was agreed to      or determined by the court. The burden of proof shall be on      the individual proprietor to establish the reasonableness of      any other fee it requests.       ``(5) Pending the completion of such proceeding, the      individual proprietor shall have the right to perform      publicly the copyrighted musical compositions in the      repertoire of the performing rights society, and shall pay an      interim license fee, subject to retroactive adjustment when a      final fee has been determined, in an amount equal to the      industry rate, or, in the absence of an industry rate, the      amount of the most recent license fee agreed to by the      parties. Failure to pay such interim license fee shall result      in immediate dismissal of the proceeding, and the individual      proprietor shall then be deemed to have had no right to      perform the copyrighted musical compositions in the      repertoire of the performing rights society under this      section from the date it submitted its notice commencing the      proceeding.       ``(6) Any decision rendered in such proceeding by a special      master or magistrate judge named under paragraph (3) shall be      reviewed by the presiding judge. Such proceeding, including      such review, shall be concluded within 6 months after its      commencement.       ``(7) Any such final determination shall be binding only as      to the individual proprietor commencing the proceeding, and      shall not be applicable to any other proprietor or any other      performing rights society, and the performing rights society      shall be relieved of any obligation of nondiscrimination      among similarly situated music users that may be imposed by      the consent decree governing its operations.       ``(8) For purposes of this section, the term `industry      rate' means the license fee a performing rights society has      agreed to with, or which has been determined by the court      for, a significant segment of the music user industry to      which the individual proprietor belongs.''.       (b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of      sections for chapter 5 of title 17, United States Code, is      amended by adding after the item relating to section 511 the      following:``512.Determinations of reasonable license fee for individual               proprietors.''.
