Of course, I join him in his tribute to our colleague from the State of Massachusetts. Senator Kennedy has been a leader on education as long as he has served in the Senate. His speech about the demands of education in the 21st century and how we in Congress have failed to meet those obligations, I think, will become part of the permanent record of this body, and they should inspire us.  My question to the Senator from South Dakota is, if you go across America--any pollster, Republican, Democrat, or otherwise--and ask American families what is the No. 1 priority, they say the first priority in their lives is education--over and over and over again. It is almost a reflex response from American families.  I ask the Senator from South Dakota the following: How can this be the first priority of American families and the dead-last priority in this Congress? The Senator from South Dakota eloquently spoke earlier about the use of this budget for schools as an ``ATM machine.'' For months, we have seen appropriations subcommittee after subcommittee pulling billions of dollars out of the education budget for a variety of uses. Some of them are very good. But I question whether any of them meet the level of importance of education to the people of America and to the families.  I ask the Senator how we can find ourselves in these predicaments where the speeches say education is a first priority, the people say education is a first priority, and this Senate, this Congress makes it dead last in the priority list.
