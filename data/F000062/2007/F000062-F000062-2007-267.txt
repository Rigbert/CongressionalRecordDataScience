 Hopefully, this will pass today.  In that vein, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate consideration of calendar item No. 96, S. 223, a bill to require Senate candidates to file designated statements and reports in electronic form, and that the committee-reported amendment be considered and agreed to, the bill as amended be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action.
