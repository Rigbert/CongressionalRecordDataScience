Speaker, it is with great pride and honor that I pay tribute to an outstanding American, a true patriot, and a hero to his country, Private First Class John Amos II. Pfc. Amos was killed in action on Sunday, April 4, 2004, while serving in Kirkuk, Iraq for the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division of the United States Army. He bravely sacrificed his life to ensure the safety of his fellow soldiers, the Iraqi people, and the very idea of freedom throughout the world. He was remembered at funeral services held on the morning of Tuesday, April 13, 2004, in his hometown of Valparaiso, Indiana.  John Amos was raised in Griffith, Indiana and later moved to Valparaiso, Indiana where he graduated from Valparaiso High School in 2002. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, John's dedication to his country led him to enlist in the United States Army right after his graduation from Valparaiso High School. Although the physical and mental demands were extremely difficult, John remained undeterred in his desire to serve in the military. The son of an Air Force Veteran, John understood the hardships of military life and accepted them with the courage and fortitude befitting a soldier dedicated to the defense of his country.  Pfc. Amos deployed for Iraq as part of the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry Regiment, 25th Infantry Division. John was on patrol near Kirkuk, Iraq when an explosion hit his military vehicle and prematurely took his life. John wanted nothing more than to dedicate his life to the military, and he honored his unit on April 4, 2004, by sacrificing himself to preserve the values he treasured.  Although it was his ambition to serve his nation as a soldier, nothing was more important to Pfc. Amos than his family. He is survived by his mother, Susan Amos, his father, John Amos, a sister, Rebecca Amos, two half brothers, Hunter and Tyler Amos, grandfather, Hank Amos, and grandparents Doug and Lucy Whitehead, as well as a nation and a community who will never forget the sacrifice that he made to protect our freedom. His father, John Amos, was an Air Force Veteran who John looked to for guidance and advice while contemplating service in the military. John remained close to his family until his death, and he will never be forgotten by those he left behind.  Mr. Speaker, at this time I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring a fallen hero, United States Army Private First Class John Amos II. Pfc. Amos is the 21st resident of Indiana to sacrifice his life in Iraq, and his passing comes as a difficult setback to a community already shaken by the realities of war. Pfc. Amos will forever remain a hero in the eyes of his family, his community, and his country; thus, let us never forget the sacrifice he made to preserve the ideals of freedom and democracy.                          ____________________
