Speaker, throughout this country of ours there are a few individuals who, because they contribute so generously of their time and talents to help others, are recognized as pillars of their community. I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Dr. Norman Mellor, whose dedication to the community is unparalleled. And on a personal note, I have special affinity for Dr. Mellor because he is a long-time friend of my family's and is the doctor who delivered me at Corona Hospital 45 years ago.  Since 1929, when he was 13 years old, Dr. Mellor has been involved with the Boy Scouts of America, first as a scout and then as a leader. He earned his Eagle Scout badge in 1933, and went on to earn some of the highest honors a Boy Scout can receive. Dr. Mellor's awards include the National Council's Gold Medal Hornaday Award for helping co-found the Idyllwild Arts Academy; the Silver Beaver Award for scout leadership; and the National Council's Distinguished Eagle Award in medicine for 25 years of being an Eagle Scout and excellence in his field.  In recognition of his accomplishments and lifelong dedication to scouting, the Inland Empire Council of the Boy Scouts of America recently named a campsite at Camp Emerson Boy Scout camp after Dr. Mellor. He still teaches a summer course at the camp on birds and mammals, a passion he developed during his days as a scout at Camp Emerson.  No person is more deserving of recognition than Dr. Mellor. He has dedicated his life to improving the lives of others around him and is a truly exceptional individual. On behalf of the 43rd congressional district, I want to commend Dr. Mellor for his outstanding accomplishments and thank him for his contribution to the betterment of our community.                          ____________________
