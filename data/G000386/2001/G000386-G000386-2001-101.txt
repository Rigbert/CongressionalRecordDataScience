 I strongly urge my colleagues to vote for cloture.  I would like to say at the outset that I am pleased Senator Daschle has decided to move forward with the bankruptcy bill. It's only fair that we go through the regular order on bankruptcy, which is to take up the House-passed version, substitute that with the Senate-passed bill, and then proceed to conference to resolve differences between the two bills.
