Speaker, I thank the ranking member of the Committee on the Budget. Mr. Speaker, we have now spent almost an hour debating what is essentially a joint resolution, a statement of politics. We have essentially agreed on the policy. We all know that.  Yes, there are some differences; yes, there are allegations on both sides. But the fact of the matter is that seven appropriation bills have not been passed and signed by the President, and a third of the Government, or more, is shut down.  We could have spent this hour putting the Government back to work; not saying that we would not address the balanced budget, because my colleagues on the other side have the votes not to adjourn until we do so.  But why we have to, time after time, use as a bludgeon on this institution and the country the shutting off of services to the American public is frankly beyond me.                              {time}  1715  We can do it even tonight if the leadership on my colleague's side decides to do so. Pass a continuing resolution based upon the last one, which was your choice of numbers, and send it to the President, and he will sign it, and we will open the Government tomorrow and serve the American public.
