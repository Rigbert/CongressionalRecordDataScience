President, I wish to associate myself with the comments of the distinguished Senator from South Dakota. I was privileged to be part of some of the discussions the distinguished Republican leader and the Democratic leader had last fall, along with the distinguished Senator from Mississippi. He has fulfilled the commitment he made to us at that time. I suspect that some aspects probably will not be debated with great ease. I wish to commend them for doing that. As I have said all along, I want to be in the position where Senators can vote up or down on these two outstanding nominees.  I thank the Chair.
