 FEINGOLD. Yes, I will yield.  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I assume the Senator is familiar with the legislative process around here. We often begin for purposes of negotiation. I will say, continuing to meet on the first product is not inconsistent with the spirit of bipartisanship, with which we have come to conclusion.  We have a good bill everybody can feel proud to have participated in. I think we proceeded with the best sense of bipartisanship. As Senator Byrd indicated yesterday, it seems to me that we need a little bit more of that around here. I think it would be good for all of us.
