Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the remaining time.  Let me conclude by simply saying that this is what the President suggested, starting at $2 billion. It is consistent with our budget resolution that we passed just 2 weeks ago. It still maintains the $15 billion over 5 years. So there is no disagreement; there is no reduction in total funding.  Again, I quote from Ambassador Rawson who says, ``While there is great need to meet the challenge of AIDS in Africa, front-loading a program might well do more harm than good,'' and he recommends that we support the Smith amendment, which is the President's suggestion, to launch this new initiative at $2 billion in 2004 and steadily escalating that spending.  Mr. Chairman, I also am reluctant to go against my chairman on this amendment, but I thought sure that the gentleman from Illinois would support this amendment with all of the good, rational, logical reasons that I have. I yield my remaining time to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde).
