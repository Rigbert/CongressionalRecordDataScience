President, it was recently brought to our attention by the Office of Compliance that the utility tunnels which carry steam and chilled water throughout the Capitol complex are rapidly deteriorating and are putting the workers who must enter these tunnels in extremely hazardous and potentially life-threatening situations. Falling concrete, the presence of asbestos, inadequate egress routes and a faulty communications system threaten the lives of the utility tunnel employees on a daily basis. Several of these tunnels are on the verge of collapse--not only threatening the lives of the workers in the tunnels, but potentially cutting off steam and chilled water to the entire Capitol complex. The $27.6 million in emergency funding that Senator Allard and I are requesting is critical to allow the Architect of the Capitol to expeditiously address the deplorable conditions that exist in these utility tunnels and make the changes necessary to assure that the health and safety of the workers is not jeopardized. This funding will allow the Architect's office to immediately begin critical design work on replacing the ``Y'' tunnel, which is in the worst condition, including structural repair, egress improvements, asbestos abatement, and temperature improvements. The funding will also accelerate work on replacing the roof on the ``R'' tunnel and for other communications, structural repairs, and emergency escape routes. Without this funding, we continue to place these employees in life-threatening working conditions. I urge my colleagues to support this critically needed funding.
