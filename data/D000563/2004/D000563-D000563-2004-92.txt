President, it is my understanding I have a unanimous consent agreement to speak next as in morning business, but since the chairman of this committee and ranking member have been on the floor all day on this bill, I would withhold my opportunity to speak if they have any pending business on this bill that they want to take care of at this point.  I say to the Senators, I know you want to stay for my speech, but I am sure you would like to take care of the bill before us and pending amendments, and I do not want to stand in your way.  So at this point, Mr. President, if I can speak through you and ask the chairman of the committee if she has any pending business at this point related directly to the bill. If the Senator from Maine could inform me.
