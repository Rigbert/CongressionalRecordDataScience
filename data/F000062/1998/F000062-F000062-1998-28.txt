 It is crucial that we work to pass this legislation before the end of this session. But, there is one provision in this bill that we must resolve before we can go forward. The exemptions to the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport Perimeter Rule has come to our attention as a section of this bill which opens the door to an array of concerns. The change in the Perimeter Rule will allow for six new daily round trip flights between Reagan National Airport and airports beyond the 1,250-mile perimeter.  We have some questions as to who will be served if these exemptions are enacted by Congress. We would like to see the highest level of service provided to the most number of passengers. Do you believe that this Perimeter Rule exemption would prevent airlines from competing to provide the greatest amount of service to the most number of passengers?  Mr. McCAIN. This provision included by the committee is intended to implement a process that will provide numerous domestic cities, including small and medium-sized committees, with improved service. However, the provision allows for competition for routes to larger communities.
