President, Ed Molitor has been coaching basketball at Palatine High School for so long that when the local paper reported on his retirement, the sports trivia question it ran included the name of his predecessor.  When Ed Molitor was in college, he went to a playoff game between two Chicago high school basketball teams--DuSable and DePaul Academy. He credits this game with altering the course of his life.  At the time, Ed Molitor was a premed student at St. Procopius College. When he wasn't consumed with his studies, he helped a friend coach basketball at an elementary school on thecity's south side. It wasn't until he watched the two high school teams battle it out on the court, though, that he realized medicine wasn't his real passion. It was basketball. Molitor transferred to Roosevelt University and shifted his focus to education.  After graduation, Molitor started as assistant coach of the DePaul Academy High School basketball team. As assistant coach, he worked under Coach Bill Gleason, who became both a mentor and friend. Molitor went on to coach basketball at Marist High School on the southwest side of Chicago.  In 1976, Molitor became head coach of Palatine High School's varsity basketball team. He stayed for more than three decades. During his 32 years at Palatine, Molitor coached more than 700 athletes. He left an indelible mark on the players, the school, and the community. No fewer than 16 of his former players have gone on to coach high school basketball, and 5 currently coach collegiate basketball.  On December 28, 2007, Coach Molitor earned his 500th career victory. When honored with the game ball at a postgame ceremony, Molitor admitted that he hadn't been aware he was approaching this impressive milestone until he read about the achievement in the newspaper.  Throughout his remarkable coaching career, Ed Molitor emphasized achievement off the court as much as on it. In his own words, ``you have to convince a kid he's got potential, not only in athletics, but in other walks of life.''  Coach Molitor emphasizes the mental elements of the game over the physical, and this approach has brought him and his players success on the court and in life. He has led teams to six conference championships, seven regional titles, and two sectional championships.  I am happy to report that his peers have recognized Ed Molitor's skills. On two occasions, he has been named Coach of the Year by the Illinois Basketball Coaches Association. In 1997, the association inducted Molitor into its Hall of Fame. Over the years, Coach Molitor has been selected to coach a number of regional, state, and national teams. He also sits on the All-State Selection Board.  Ed Molitor has been a tremendous asset to Illinois high school basketball throughout his coaching career, but his greatest value has always been to his players. Today, I join the current and former members of Palatine High School's varsity basketball team in thanking Coach Molitor for his commitment to coaching and his passion for helping student-athletes develop character, discipline, and perseverance--skills that will prove valuable even after the season has ended.  Mr. President, I congratulate Coach Ed Molitor on his accomplishments throughout his long and successful coaching career, and I wish him many more years of happiness and accomplishment in retirement.                          ____________________
