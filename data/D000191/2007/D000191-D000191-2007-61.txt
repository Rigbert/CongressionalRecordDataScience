Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  First, since the gentleman from Georgia wouldn't allow me to correct his mischaracterization of my position, I guess we are having a little issue over the meaning of the word ``fix.'' Now, if he means ``fixed'' as in ``setting,'' that is, setting the salary, he is totally wrong. I never said that, and that is not what this bill would do. It would just allow a referendum by the owners of the company on the package being paid to the corporate executive.  Now, if he means ``fixed'' in terms of what he stated on his own, he said some are greater than warranted and then he talked about correction; if we are talking about that kind of ``fix,'' he is absolutely right, and that is what this bill would do. It would allow the stockholders a vote. He doesn't want to allow them to vote on that compensation.                              {time}  0945  Then how are you going to fix it? That is extraordinary.  Now, Mr. Putnam makes an interesting argument. This poor CEO, whoever he was who totally underperformed who would receive compensation under his amendment that would be exempt from a vote, saw his compensation, having screwed up the corporation and making the board of directors mad and underperforming, losing money for the stockholders. Hedidn't get that $6.75 million. He only got $3 million. Wow. He was penalized. Well, maybe the stockholders would rather he was fired and he got nothing. Three million bucks for screwing up. That is not exactly a corrective action. I don't know what world you folks live in over there, but for people in my district, that would be like winning the lottery big. Three million bucks. And this is for a guy who didn't do his job properly. And that is the kind of, and that would be exempt from the stockholders, because that is corrective action. He only got three million. Don't worry. He only got three million. And only three million came out of your assets to go to this guy who lowered the value of your investment and messed up the company, probably fired a bunch of workers and who knows what else he did that messed things up. So it is just extraordinary.  So now you are getting in the weeds here. You are actually determining what sorts of compensation would be voted on and what wouldn't. You are getting into fixing something, regulating something. We are just saying we want to allow a referendum. It is kind of the democratic process that most of us understand around here. If people are part of a public corporation, they should get a vote on executive compensation. They should also be allowed to put other measures before the board in a meaningful way. But the Republicans apparently don't believe in corporate democracy.
