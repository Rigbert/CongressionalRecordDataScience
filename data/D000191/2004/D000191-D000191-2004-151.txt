Speaker, I rise today to remember Brigadier General Harold King of the U.S. Air Force, Retired. His death on October 7, 2004, ended a remarkable and distinguished career of service to the Nation.  Benjamin Harold King was born in Oklahoma in 1919. He began his successful military career in February 1942 when he enlisted in the Army Air Force as a flying cadet. He was commissioned a second lieutenant in November and was flying with a fighter squadron in the Philippines a few months later. He served proudly and well during World War II, flying 122 combat missions in the Asiatic-Pacific and European-Middle Eastern theaters. He went on to log 226 combat missions in Korea and over 100 combat missions in Vietnam.  Brigadier General King's decorations include the Purple Heart, the Silver Star, the Legion of Merit, a Distinguished Flying Cross, three oak leaf clusters, the Air Medal with 24 oak leaf clusters, and the French Croix de Guerre.  Brigadier General King will be remembered, as well, for his legacy of leadership as a commander and operations officer. He succeeded at every assignment and is revered as the father of the modern USAF Air Commandos and Special Operations.  Brigadier General King flew combat in three wars and served in the military for over 30 years before retiring in 1971. He resided in Florence, Oregon, in my congressional district, at the time of his death.  A flight of four F-15s flew directly over his memorial service, a few hundred feet above the local airport where his family, friends, and community members watched the perfect ``Missing Man'' formation. It was a fitting tribute to Brigadier General Benjamin H. King, Flying Ace.                          ____________________
