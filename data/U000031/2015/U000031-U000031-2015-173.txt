Chair, the following is my statement in its entirety:  We launched this effort a year-and-a-half ago. And with tomorrow's House vote, we mark an important milestone in our quest for 21st Century Cures--one step closer to the finish line.  There are so many individuals throughout our 18 month journey that helped get us to where we are today. Patients across the country. Advocates. Researchers. Innovators. Experts. Academics. Regulators. Some of the nation's brightest minds. To all we say thank you.  Thank you to the staff--on both sides of the aisle--who took the meetings, did the research, drafted the language, and sat at the negotiating table for countless hours to help us develop this incredible product. Gary Andres, Joan Hillebrands, Alexa Marrero, Clay Alspach, Paul Edattel, Josh Trent, Robert Horne, John Stone, Carly McWilliams, Katie Novaria, Adrianna Simonelli, Graham Pittman, Michelle Rosenberg, Traci Vitek, Sean Bonyun, Noelle Clemente, Macey Sevcik, Mark Ratner, Tom Wilbur, Bits Thomas, Marty Dannenfelser, Tim Pataki, Karen Christian, Peter Kielty, Jeff Carroll, Tiffany Guarascio, Lisa Cohen, Rachel Stauffer, Elizabeth Farrar, Matt Inzeo, Cole Leiter and all the Democratic staff, the staff of our members . . . thank you all. Thank you to House legislative counsel and the Congressional Budget Office for your efforts and dedication. Thank you to the members of both parties who brought their best ideas, partnered with one another to make their case, and delivered so many of the policies we welcome today.  I'd also like to thank Hal Rogers and his staff. The Appropriations Committee has been a critical partner in this effort, working with us and developing the right approach to achieve our shared goal of helping patients in a fiscally responsible way.  I especially want to highlight my partner in this effort from day one, Ms. DeGette. She has been to Michigan, and I have travelled to Colorado--we have been on a number of road trips for Cures and I look forward to the next journey. I also want to thank Mr. Pitts, Mr. Pallone, and Mr. Green for their partnership. We have made great strides but our work continues--and we won't stop until the ink is dry on the 21st Century Cures Act in the Oval Office.  I also want to give a hearty thank you to Max--a 6-year old ambassador for Cures. Although he is faced with the challenge of Noonan syndrome, he has been a little warrior in this effort. He joined us when we had our 51 to zero vote in the committee. And I am delighted Max will be by my side tomorrow on the floor for final passage.  Helping Max is why we're here. Helping my friends Brooke and Brielle is why we are here.  With a resounding vote, we will send a signal to the Senate--loud and clear--that the time is now for Cures 2015. I look forward to working with my Senate counterparts to continue the momentum and get 21st Century Cures to the president's desk.  We have a chance to do something big, and this is our time.  Vote yes.                          ____________________
