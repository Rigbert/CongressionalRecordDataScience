As you know, we think we've passed a historic energy bill. Not only that, as my friend knows, because he's from the State of our distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, we were able to go to conference today, which has been somewhat contentious for a few days. We expect that conference to be on the floor early next week. So we are moving ahead.  But as we've discussed, there are some issues of difficulty that we haven't resolved that we need to resolve, and so we'll have to see whether or not we will be successful.
