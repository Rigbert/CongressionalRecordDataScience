And if I am not mistaken, I think the Senator from Vermont modeled his amendment after a World War II amendment on profiteering. It is amazing to me we struck the language on profiteering in the omnibus bill, and now look what has happened with Halliburton and other companies. They are being investigated. They are being charged with gouging taxpayers. We are losing money. Frankly, I do not think it is reasonable for taxpayers to have to pay this. The Senator from Arizona is on to a good idea.  Let me give you a couple other examples he might be interested in. According to a recent NBC News report, another politically connected Pentagon contractor, DynCorps, is hiring senior people to train Iraqi police at a cost to American taxpayers of some $400,000 a year per trainer. Counting living expenses, tax liability, and reimbursements, it is worth about $50 million so far. It turns out the contract only had one bidder. It is expected to generate about $800 million in revenue to DynCorps over the next 2 years.  Let me say, when the Senator from Arizona yields back his time, I will be offering a second-degree amendment. We will have a chance to vote on Halliburton before we get to the tobacco settlement.
