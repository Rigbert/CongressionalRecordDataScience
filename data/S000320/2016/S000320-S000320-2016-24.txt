 President, today I commend Airbus and its employees at the Mobile Aeroplex facility on the completion of their first aircraft, the Airbus A321. This great achievement was years in the making, and I am delighted that Mobile is home to the first A321 built in the United States.  Aviation manufacturing is extremely valuable to the State of Alabama's economy. Airbus plays a significant role in this sector, which brings welcomed job creation and economic growth to south Alabama and across the State. Airbus's presence in Alabama also underscores the fact that our great State is open for business, leading the Nation in both cutting-edge technology and workforce.  It is my great honor to congratulate Airbus and all of those who played a role in the making of this momentous occasion. I look forward to many more accomplishments by Airbus's Mobile facility and additional aircraft that will be proudly made in Alabama.                          ____________________
