Justice Covington, however, has voted 24 times for reversal in death penalty cases; Justice Holstein, 24 times; Justice Benton, 19 times; and Justice Price, 18 times. It would appear to me that at least Justices Covington, Holstein, Benton and Price, all on the Supreme Court, have voted many more times to reverse death sentences than Justice White has. Are these numbers similar to what the Senator from Missouri has?
