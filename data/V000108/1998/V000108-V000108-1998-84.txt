Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I commend the City of Hobart, Indiana, for dedicating its newest park to the memory of the late Emily Silich. On Saturday, September 26, at 10:00 AM, Emily Silich's family and friends will gather to honor her memory. It is due to Emily's dream, vision, and extraordinary efforts that this park has been created to enrich the lives and neighborhoods of the people of Hobart, and the whole of Northwest Indiana.  Emily Silich Park, as it will be named, began as only an idea, a dream. As the City Councilwoman for the Second District of Hobart, Emily sought to provide her constituents with their first park. From its humble beginnings in 1992, to the final culmination in 1998, this drive to provide a positive, clean, and public park for the Second District has been a study in determination and persistence. After Emily Silich passed away in 1995, her family and friends did not allow her dream to fade away.  Instead, Silich's family and friends enlisted the aid of Mayor Linda Buzinec, the local YMCA Board, and Hobart residents. With the aid of the current City Councilman from the Second District, Carl Lindsey, land was purchased from the YMCA. Tom Silich, Emily's husband, and Carl Lindsey donated $3,000 and $500, respectively, in order to purchase land for the park. These efforts, and the work of countless others, has helped to realize one of Emily's goals. Emily Silich Park is located in Hobart, Indiana, on two acres of land. It has among its features a picnic shelter, and playground equipment for the children of the neighborhood. In the future, the Park Board is seeking to add tennis courts and other attractive features.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my distinguished colleagues to join me in congratulating the selfless efforts of the Silich family,Mayor Buzinec, and Councilman Lindsey. Through their hard work, dedication, and determination, Emily Silich's goal was realized. Citizens like Tom Silich, Robin Toneff, Carl Lindsey, and Linda Buzinec are examples of the true American ideal: Citizens improving themselves, their neighborhoods, and their communities. I am proud to serve such dedicated residents of Indiana's First Congressional District.                          ____________________
