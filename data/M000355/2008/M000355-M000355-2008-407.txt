 President, I wish to celebrate the life of a woman who has greatly affected the lives of so many throughout the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Mrs. Frances Gaddie Clinkscales. For 78 years, Mrs. Clinkscales loved and invested wholeheartedly in everyone she met.  Known to those around her as ``Miss Frances,'' Mrs. Clinkscales was an inspiration. Her time was devoted to caring for individuals, predominantly through her role as a nurse. She graduated from Durham High School in Campbellsville, KY, in 1949 and continued her education at Howard University in Washington, DC, receiving her degree in nursing. Thus began her dedication to caring for others.  Mrs. Clinkscales served at North Point Hospital in Long Island, NY, before returning to Ft. Knox, KY, to work at the Ireland Army Hospital, where she served the military community for 31 years. Mrs. Clinkscales spent her time loving those around her, not only through her nursing career but for decades after. Her devotion to her faith was expressed throughout every aspect of her life. As a community and civic leader, she worked to assure Taylor County and central Kentucky was a quality place for everyone to live.  Her participation in a plethora of organizations only contributed to the love she spread. She was a member of the Campbellsville City Council, Greater Campbellsville United, and held long terms of service on the Lake Cumberland Development Board, Habitat for Humanity, and the Campbellsville Family Resource and Youth Services Council.  Along with service to organizations such as these, Mrs. Clinkscales spent many of her later years fighting for patients receiving dialysis. In June 2007, Mrs. Clinkscales suffered from complete kidney failure and underwent dialysis. Her treatment was conducted at the Taylor County Dialysis Center; a facility that she was instrumental in opening. Mrs. Clinkscales's commitment to organizations like these and the people she worked with and loved exemplified her genuine care for the community.  Regretfully, on February 27, 2008, the Commonwealth of Kentucky lost this most respected member of our State; yet her legacy will not go untold. Mrs. Clinkscales's constant love for those around her will continue to resonate. Her infamous words to anyone she met--``pretty, pretty'' and ``I love you''--will be remembered. Mrs. Clinkscales genuinely dedicated her life and service to her faith and her town. She leaves behind her granddaughter and her grandson-in-law, LaQuita and Christopher Goodin; two grandsons; and seven nieces.  Mrs. Clinkscales served as an important citizen of Kentucky for decades. This service is assuredly not to be forgotten and will carry on as an example to all. I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Frances Gaddie Clinkscales for her dedicated service, her example to the community, and in honoring the legacy she has left us.                          ____________________
