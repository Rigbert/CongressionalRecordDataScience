President, before he leaves the floor, I want to tell the majority leader I very much share his view about this threat of narcoterrorism, and also to express my appreciation to the majority leader for the work he is doing with several of us on this matter of secret holds, which are so relevant at the end of a session. We have made a lot of progress already with the work done by the majority leader and with Senator Daschle. The majority leader knows we are trying to work out some of the last kinds of questions. I want the majority leader to know I think we have already made a real difference in this area.  I express my support to him and look forward to wrapping up the last remaining issues. I think we all know, as we go into the last few days of the session, we can have 100 of these secret holds and Senators rushing about trying to figure out what is going on. Senator Moynihan, in his landmark study on secrecy, has really made the case that secrecy is the most expensive kind of regulation we could have.  Before the majority leader leaves the floor, I want him to know I really appreciate all the progress we have made in working with his staff, Mr. Wilkie doing yeomen work on this, and I look forward to wrapping it up.
