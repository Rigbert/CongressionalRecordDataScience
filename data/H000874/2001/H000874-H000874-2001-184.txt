Speaker, I want to rise a little bit in seriousness and say how proud we are, those of us who were in the ACC, of Duke's magnificent victory, not in derogation of Arizona, a great team itself, but my, my, my, how Duke plays, how Coach Krzyzewski coaches, and the fire that they showed.  I said during the ditty that I was forced to go through, that they were down by 22, and it is because of the character, the heart, the courage and, yes, the extraordinary ability of the Duke players that they came back and prevailed in that game on Saturday night.  I know the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) joins me in congratulating the Duke players, the Duke coach, and Duke itself for a magnificent and winning effort.
