Speaker, I thank my good friend from Massachusetts for his courtesy, and I would only say to my colleagues that there are two ways in America to reduce fraud and protect investors and consumers. We can do it through litigation, and under any circumstances this involves playing catchup ball after a fraud has been perpetrated; or we can detect and deter fraud up front, and that is what this legislation requires.  For the first time in America, under this bill, accountants would be affirmatively required to search for, attempt to detect fraud, and report it to management. If management did not correct it, it would then have to be passed on to Government regulators.  I am of the view, and we saw this under the leadership of the gentleman from Michigan [Mr. Dingell] that had this requirement been in effect in America, Charles Keating could have been stopped in his tracks cold. Because in the Keating case, the auditors had the goods. And instead of reporting the fraud, they simply shrunk away.  The fraud reporting requirement in this legislation, in my view, provides an opportunity to change the psychology in corporate board rooms all across America. Because in the future, management will know that they cannot have an auditor in their pocket. They will know that an auditor has a legal responsibility to report fraud when this legislation is signed.  So I ask my colleagues to support the bill. It provides a chance to try a fresh approach. Litigation is appropriate where consumers are fleeced, but let us do more to prevent fraud up front by requiring the auditors to blow the whistle. That is what this legislation requires, and I thank my good friend for yielding me the time.
