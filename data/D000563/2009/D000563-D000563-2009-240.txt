President, I ask unanimous consent that the next amendment in order be one offered by Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island, which is at the desk; that the other matter in order during today's session be a Hatch motion to commit regarding Medicare Advantage; that no other amendments or motions to commit be in order during today's session; and that the time in sequence following this unanimous consent request--I do not want to disadvantage the Senator from New Hampshire, but if it is our turn on this side of the aisle, I would ask that Senator Whitehouse first be recognized for the purpose of calling up his amendment and then I be recognized next, for no more than 15 minutes; and at that point it is my understanding Senator Hatch has asked for the floor for 1 hour on his motion.  If there are any other requests, I would be glad to add them to the unanimous consent request at this point.
