 How many times have we heard from the folks back home: Why on Earth do you folks back there keep fussing at one another? Why don't you work together to get something done? Well, amen to that. That is the bill we have produced.  I remember the gold medal ceremony of Senator Bob Dole. He was presented a gold medal for his tremendous leadership in the Senate. He was known for working across the aisle and getting things done. When we awarded that gold medal several months ago in Statuary Hall, Bob, at 94 years old, stood up when they played the national anthem, from his wheelchair, on his own.  For a time on a Tuesday, we were partisan in the House and to some degree in the Senate. I could go into all the cloture votes I have felt were not necessary--104, 105; I don't know how many we have had--and 4 months of delay, but I am not going to do that. So on Tuesday, we were partisan; Wednesday, we were bipartisan, paying tribute to Bob. Everybody said: Well, why can't you emulate his example and work together? Then, after Wednesday, on Thursday, we were back to some partisan differences or philosophical differences or ideological differences. Compromise, again, was a dirty word.  Well, this is our opportunity. We have proved that we can work together on the Ag Committee. We are the least partisan committee in the Congress. For goodness' sake, when agriculture is almost in a crisis and we desperately need to provide the farmers with the knowledge that we are fashioning a bill to their benefit and that it is a good bill, why on Earth can't we get this done?  I thank my colleague for her comments.  I yield the floor.
