President, before I make some comments about the national situation, I express my thanks to Senator Craig of Idaho who is the manager on the Republican side of the bill that we considered today. I had the occasion to manage the bill for the Democratic side, and his fairness and his gentlemanlike conduct was deeply appreciated.  I also recognize two of my staff members, Neil Campbell and Steve Eichenauer, who did a superb job. Thank you very much for this opportunity to mention my respect for Senator Craig and also my appreciation for my staff.                          ____________________
