 President, before the Senator from Alabama leaves, I want to thank him again for the hearings he held on the Commonsense Consumption Act, not the bill before us today but another measure that makes, as the title implies, common sense. The common sense embedded in that bill is that it is improper to sue a food manufacturer or a distributor for damages claiming that the seller made you overweight. It is simple justice. It would not deny any of the traditional claims against a distributor or manufacturer of food, but it would prevent such a ridiculous lawsuit.  The American people overwhelmingly support this legislation by well up into the 80 percent. The legislation passed the House of Representatives by an overwhelming bipartisan vote and is at the desk in the Senate. Hopefully sometime this year we will get an opportunity to call that up and see if maybe the Senate will let us at least pass a very modest legal reform bill that deals with a problem that is beginning to evolve in our society of victimhood.
