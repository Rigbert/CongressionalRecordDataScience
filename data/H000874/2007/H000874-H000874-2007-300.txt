Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the 500th anniversary of the first use of the word ``America''--a name that has come to symbolize liberty, opportunity and an unyielding hope for humanity.  In the 500 years that have passed since the word ``America'' was first used, the term has become more of a concept than a name--an idea that celebrates what is truly special about the world in which we live; a principle that defines what democracy, equality, freedom and unity are all about; and a goal that people all over the world have embraced since our country's inception.  We have come a long way since 1507--from a simple name on a map, to a moral, political and economic leader among nations. It gives me great pride to mark this 5th centenary of the name ``America,'' and to express my sincere hope that the next 500 years of our country's history provide just as many benefits to the people of the world as the last 500.
