 President, the Senate's doorkeeper, Ruby Paone, will mark her 40th year of service to the Senate.  Ruby has seen the Senate from a lot of different angles. She has had a lot of unique titles--everything from card desk assistant to Reception Room attendant--as she climbed the ladder to her current post.  I am sure that Ruby will tell you that a lot has changed since her first day here back in 1975. I am sure she will tell you a lot has stayed the same. One thing that won't change is the Senate's gratitude to its many dedicated employees. That is why the Senate community extends its congratulations to Ruby Paone this morning and why we thank her for her many years of service.                          ____________________
