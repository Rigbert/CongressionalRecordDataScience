 President, it is with deep sadness that I address my colleagues today. A hero from my home State, SPC Brent M. Maher of Honey Creek, IA, was killed in action on Monday, April 11, 2011 in the Paktya Province of Afghanistan. He was 31 years old. Specialist Maher was the gunner on a ``Cougar'' mine-resistant ambush protected vehicle, MRAP, that was struck by an improvised explosive device.  Specialist Maher served in the Iowa Army National Guard, Company B, 1st Battalion, 168th Infantry, 2nd Brigade Combat Team, 34th Infantry Division, out of Shenandoah, IA. Specialist Maher has been posthumously promoted to sergeant. Prior to his service in the Iowa National Guard, Specialist Maher served over 7 years in the U.S. Navy. In all, Specialist Maher dedicated 11 years of his life to serving and protecting our Nation. Words simply cannot express the debt we owe to Specialist Maher and all of the other servicemembers fighting for our Nation.  My thoughts and prayers are with Brent Maher's family and friends, including his wife Brenna and his three children, as well as his mother Cheryl and everyone else who will be grieving his loss.  Specialist Maher truly loved his job in the U.S. military. He was proud of the difference that he was making in the lives of the Afghan people. It is because of individuals like specialist Maher and his loving and supportive family that America is the nation it is today. At times like these, I think that it is important that we pause and remember the lives of those lost in order that we can enjoy our way of life. As we go about our lives as free people, we ought to bear in mind the sacrifices made by Specialist Maher and others in our Armed Forces.                          ____________________
