Madam Speaker, last week I introduced legislation that will help people who worked long hours, went to work everyday to support their families, and thought they were earning a retirement package that would be there at the end of their careers. Unfortunately, many in this body know the crisis some workers have endured regarding their defined benefit pension plans. Many people have felt the sting of lost jobs, reduced benefits, and bankrupt employers. Their retirement savings were lost.  The Lost Retirement Savings Act will allow airline workers to recover some of their benefits that were erased when their employers went bankrupt. By creating a retirement savings option for airline workers whose defined benefit plans were terminated or frozen in bankruptcy proceedings we can offer help to workers. This legislation creates an opportunity for airline workers to rollover specified bankruptcy payments into a traditional or Roth individual retirement account.  Airline workers have lost more than $5 billion in wages alone. They have lost an additional $5 billion in defined benefit pension benefits. Some have lost more than their paycheck. Too many people lost their jobs. In my district, which covers metro Atlanta, Delta Air Lines has been particularly hard hit over the past few years. On September 11, there were 10,500 active Delta pilots. Today, there are 6,700.  We need to keep our pension system strong in America. We need to keep it strong for American workers and their families. If the system breaks, we need to stand up for all workers and find a solution. This legislation will restore some lost earnings and some lost opportunities. I look forward to seeing this passed.                          ____________________
