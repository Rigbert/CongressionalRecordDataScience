In my 25 years here, I have seen majority leaders, distinguished majority leaders, both Republican and Democrat, try to whittle down bills in time, and usually when they propose time agreements, the number of amendments has expanded. In this case, I say the good news for the distinguished Senator from Mississippi is, each time he has done this, actually the numbers have dwindled, and dwindle and dwindle.  I suggest that perhaps the distinguished Senator from Utah and I continue our efforts and report to our respective leaders after the caucus where we stand.  I see the distinguished Senator from Utah on the floor. I know that he wants the floor, and so I will yield.
