President, I wish to commend the Senator from North Dakota, and I see the other Senator from North Dakota here about to speak. I will yield immediately to him.  You know what this debate has shown? The two Senators from North Dakota have been in the forefront in discussing this, as was the senior Senator from West Virginia, in describing his own amendment yesterday, and will be in his discussion in the week coming up. It describes what would seem to be a very simple concept: have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. If you do a poll on this, ``Are you in favor of a balanced budget,'' everybody says, ``Sure, of course we are.''  Then comes the question: Do we amend the Constitution? It has only been amended 17 times since the Bill of Rights--only 17 times. Now, we have another issue. If we are going to do that, do we do it for something that looks good on a bumper sticker for a slogan, or do we do it thinking about what we are doing?  Just remember, this Senate has only been involved in successful amending of the Constitution 17 times since the Bill of Rights. That means a lot of our predecessors had to think long and hard about thousands of proposals to amend the Constitution, about what would they do. The Senators from North Dakota, the Senator from West Virginia, the Senator from Nevada, and others who have spoken do us service by saying, ``Just what is it we are buying with this? Is it a balanced budget?'' No, it is a very, very dangerous monkey wrench in the Constitution that will cost our children and our children's children a great deal. It will cost our Social Security recipients, and it will not do what the President said in the State of the Union Message what can be done: Do you want to balance the budget? All we have to do is vote to do that, and he signs it. It is as simple as that. We don't need to amend the Constitution.  I am delighted to yield to my good friend and colleague, the senior Senator from North Dakota.
