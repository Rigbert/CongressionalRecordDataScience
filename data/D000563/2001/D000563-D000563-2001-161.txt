I commend the Senator for the hearing he had on the constitutional rights part of this debate. But I want to make sure I understand exactly what his amendment sets out to do.  Is my understanding correct that under the Feingold amendment there could be surveillance of a computer for 96 hours before there is any court approval, so that in the example given by the Senator from Utah, the law enforcement authorities could, in fact, monitor the communications of someone using this computer for 96 hours before ever going to a court and asking for a warrant for that search?
