 President, I ask that at 10 a.m. tomorrow Senator Feinstein be recognized to speak for up to 10 minutes, to be followed at 11 o'clock by Senator Harkin to be recognized to offer his amendment regarding interest rates, and that there be 45 minutes for debate, 40 minutes under the control of Senator Harkin, 5 minutes under the control of Senator Domenici, and at 11:45, Senator Domenici or his designee be recognized to move to table.
