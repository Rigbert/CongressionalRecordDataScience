President, all of us who knew him during his decade of service in Congress, and others who knew him only by reputation, mourn the recent passing of Gunn McKay.  Gunn McKay was a leading member of the Committee on Appropriations in the other body and chaired the Subcommittee on Military Construction. He was effective. He knew how to lead and how to legislate. His voice was an influential voice on energy issues and military readiness and Federal land policy. And he knew how to bring people together to get things done.  It was not politics that motivated Gunn McKay in his public service; it was people. He thrived in being able to help people get and keep good-paying jobs. He deeply, unequivocally believed that there is a role for government, through programs like Medicare and Social Security and in other ways, in helping those who struggle.  Gunn achieved all of the good he accomplished in life through a deep-down and infectious optimism about people and about the future. More than being a great public servant, he was a good man. Those who worked with him will tell you that Gunn did not have a mean bone in his body. When he left public life Gunn and his wife, Donna, devoted much of their time to church service abroad.  The Nation and its Congress are better for the fact that Gunn McKay served here. And so, certainly, are the people of his beloved State of Utah.  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the Salt Lake Tribune about Gunn McKay be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                      [From the Salt Lake Tribune]                    Utah Demo Gunn McKay Dies at 75                            (By Judy Fahys)       K. Gunn McKay, the Weber County farmer's son and Democrat      who served five terms in Congress in the 1970s and earned      bipartisan praise for his down-home warmth and political      skill, died Friday night from cancer. He was 75.       ``Tell the facts and leave the right impression,'' McKay      used to tell his young congressional aides, and that credo      served the former teacher through a career in state and      national politics and on Mormon mission assignments in      Europe, Africa and Asia.       ``Unassuming'' and ``determined'' are the words Barry      McKay, a Salt Lake City lawyer, used to describe his eldest      brother. He recalled Friday how Gunn McKay spent most of one      Christmas, the day he returned home from a church mission in      England, helping neighbors start their frozen cars.       Political scientist J.D. Williams called McKay ``the      personification of Huntsville,'' McKay's hometown in the      Ogden Valley.       ``He talked with a rural Utah slang when he wanted to,''      said Williams. ``He had a beautiful smile and demeanor, and      he was everybody's friend.''       ``You didn't have to guess what he meant,''said former Sen.      Jake Garn, a Republican who served with the Democrat in      Congress and lived near him outside the nation's capital.       ``He was extremely well-liked,'' said Garn, whose U.S.      Senate service overlapped with six years of McKay's time in      Washington. ``Whether you agreed with him or not, you could      trust him. He would always follow through.''       McKay even converted David L. Bigler, a Utah historian and      former public-relations director for Geneva Steel, then known      as U.S. Steel. Bigler switched political parties to raise      money for McKay's first campaign.       ``He really did care for people,'' said Bigler, who was      struck at once by McKay's integrity. ``All politicians say      that, but few of them do. He did.''       Politics may have been in McKay's blood. His grandfather,      Angus, was House Speaker in Utah's first Legislature. And his      father, James, had run for the 1st Congressional District      seat that McKay would win 35 years later, in 1970.       And unlike most emerging politicians, name recognition was      never a problem for McKay, whose father was a cousin to one      of the most beloved presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ      of Latter-day Saints, Huntsville-born David O. McKay. The      church leader died just a year before his relative took the      oath for his first term in Congress.       The eldest of eight children, McKay was a three-sport star      at Weber High School before serving in the U.S. Coast Guard      during World War II and on an LDS mission to England the      following three years. He later graduated from Utah State      University with a degree in education.       He was teaching history in Ogden City Schools and running a      deli when he was appointed to the first of two terms in the      Utah Legislature.       From there, he was tapped to be chief of staff to      Democratic Gov. Calvin L. Rampton.       During his five terms in Washington from 1971 to 1981,      McKay built a reputation for being one of the half-dozen most      conservative Democrats in a Congress long controlled by      Democrats.       He fought federally funded abortions and backed the U.S.      Supreme Court's decision to outlaw prayer in schools. He      pushed the Central Utah Project, military appropriations that      bolstered Hill Air Force Base and other Utah installations,      ``gasohol'' and a balanced-budget law. He also fought higher      fees for ranchers who leased federal range.       McKay's powers of persuasion helped land him a seat on the      coveted Appropriations Committee upon entering Congress--the      first ever for a Utahn.       ``Most people have to wait [10 years] to be considered,''      said Jim McConkie, a Salt Lake City lawyer who served on      McKay's congressional staff for five years.       McConkie recalled how McKay used his influential role as      chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee to become      close to President Carter, who invited McKay to Camp David a      few times.       ``But he never lost his roots,'' said McConkie. ``He could      see to the heart of an issue.''       Nothwithstanding his Washington successes, McKay lost his      seat to Republican Rep. Jim Hansen in the Ronald Reagan      landslide of 1980.       In 1986, when McKay unsuccessfully challenged Hansen for      his old seat he shared his view of Utah voters, one that      contemporary Utah Democrats have taken to heart.       ``Utah voters are independent thinkers,'' McKay told The      Salt Lake Tribune. ``They are concerned with ineffective      federal policies and lack of congressional action on issues      which are increasingly having a negative impact on their      lives.''       The year after he left Congress, McKay went on an LDS      mission to Scotland with his wife Donna. Later, the couple      was called to serve in Kenya, where McKay found himself a      block away from the embassy bombing in 1998.       They also served in Singapore and Malaysia. McKay took ill      while serving in Pakistan.       The McKays, who married in 1950, had 10 children, 40      grandchildren and one great-grandchild.       Said former Utah First Lady Norma Matheson: ``He loved      being in public service, and it showed.''                          ____________________
