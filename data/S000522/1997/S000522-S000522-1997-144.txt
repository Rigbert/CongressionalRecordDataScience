Mr. Chairman, I thank my good friend, the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman], for yielding this time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to recommend passage of H.R. 1757, and I hope that the House will adopt an important amendment that I will offer later on during consideration of this bill dealing with the pro life issue. I am also pleased to note that Division B of the bill was H.R. 1253, the Foreign Relations Authorization Act for fiscal years 1998 and 1999, which I introduced earlier this year and which was marked up by our Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights.
