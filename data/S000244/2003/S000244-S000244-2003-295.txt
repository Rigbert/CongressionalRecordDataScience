Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 361. This legislation, which is known as the SPARTA Act, is important for the sports industry, which in recent years has become ever more just so that, an industry. The thrill of pure athletic accomplishment has been overwhelmed as a motivating incentive by the desire for economic gain. While understandable, we cannot allow this desire to lead to the abuse of individuals, the public and private universities and colleges, and the system itself.  We as Americans love sports. Who does not enjoy sitting back on a relaxing weekend watching their favorite college and professional sports teams performing? In Wisconsin, every Sunday during the fall we watch the Green Bay Packers with the intensity and caring of a mother bear watching her cubs. We have dedicated a month to an American tradition called March Madness and watch some of the most athletically gifted students in the Nation compete in the drama which can have only one victor at the day's end.                              {time}  1430  However, even with all this talent, only 1 percent of the NCAA athletes make it to the professional level, and then often only in a back-up role. For those who do make it to the big leagues, the rewards are great.  Athlete agents want to reap this reward, as well. As a result, some agents deploy questionable tactics in a generally unregulated field. They send runners to befriend these athletes and give them money and other enticements, and support the friends and family of the athlete with money and gifts.  This is done in consideration of an agreement for future representation, which is illegal by NCAA standards and causes the athlete to lose their collegiate eligibility. In many States, the penalty to the agent is nothing.  Mr. Speaker, the Uniform Athlete Agents Act, which addresses this situation, has been adopted by over 20 States. However, given the nature of intercollegiate sports, State boundaries are crossed constantly. Agents can forum-shop by waiting in a State that has not adopted the UAAA and wait for the visiting team to arrive before approaching college stars.  Because of this unique situation, this Federal solution is necessary. Geographic loopholes must be closed so that agents will comply with the modest guidelines set forth for recruitment by the NCAA.  Mr. Speaker, this bill deserves the full support of the House, and I urge its adoption.
