 President, I today pay tribute to Will Edd Clark, who is the general manager of the Western Dark Fired Tobacco Growers' Association in Murray, KY. Will Edd has served in this role for 27 years, and during that time, he has been a tireless advocate for tobacco farmers in western Kentucky.  The Western Dark Fired Tobacco Growers' Association was established in 1931 and has helped administer the Federal tobacco program as well as represent the interests of tobacco growers in nine counties in western Kentucky, plus three counties in Tennessee. In 2004, the tobacco quota buyout program was signed into law, which dismantled the Federal tobacco program that had been in place since the 1930s. Will Edd realized the benefit that the association's growers would receive from this historical piece of legislation, and he played a vital role in securing its passage.  Now that the tobacco quota program is gone, the Western Dark Fired Tobacco Growers' Association has decided to close its operations at the end of 2006. Although the association will no longer be in existence, the association's historical papers will be kept by Murray State University, which will preserve the legacy of Will Edd as a true supporter of Kentucky's tobacco industry. I ask unanimous consent that an article which appeared in the Murray Ledger & Times on December 1, 2006, detailing the association's history and Will Edd's record of service be printed in the Record. I ask my fellow Senators to join me in thanking Will Edd Clark for his service to the people of Kentucky.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:    Despite Closure, Tobacco Association's History, Efforts Will Be                                Preserved                            (By Greg Travis)       Murray's Western Dark Fired Tobacco Growers' Association is      closing its operations after serving the people of western      Kentucky and west Tennessee since 1931. An absolute auction      of the association's business office and warehouses was held      Thursday for the 4,048 brick, business office complex at 206      Maple Street and property consisting of 55,599 square feet of      three commercial warehouses located at Poplar and Elm      streets.       ``We appreciate everyone's interest in the auction.      Naturally, we would liked to have seen them bring more but we      had to sell them. We had no choice,'' Association General      Manager Will Edd Clark said, adding that the combined totals      realized from the sale was just over $400,000.       ``Those bidding knew this was an absolute auction. We're      proud for them. They got some good buys today.''       He said the office went to Rick Hixon and the warehouses      were purchased by Keith Brandon.       He said that as a result of the tobacco buyout program,      directors of the association decided there was no need or      purpose for the association to continue.       ``The association came about as a result of low prices that      were being realized from the     early 1900s to the 1920s. Farmers were looking for security      in their production of tobacco,'' Clark said. ``The tobacco      industry as we know it today did not exist. There were Night      Riders in the area and other situations that influenced the      production of tobacco for many growers.''       He said the tobacco business that most people are familiar      with existed from the 1930s until the tobacco quota buyout      that was included in the America Jobs Creation Act of 2004      terminated the federal tobacco price support and supply      control programs.       He said the program that had been in place until then      worked well and was one of the best farm programs. ``But      everything has a life span. With the anti-tobacco feelings in      the country today it's hard to generate changes in the      program,'' he said.       He said the local organization had a lot of local history.      ``Tobacco will continue to play a major role in this region.      It will still be here for many years to come, but you have to      change with the changes, and our changes will really start to      be felt with the new owners of our properties.''       Clark said that once the properties are disposed of and all      the business issues are settled, the association will go back      and return those assets to the association's members.       He added that James R. Cash of Mayfield, who is a member of      the association, offered to conduct the auctions at no fee      charge. ``He said that, as a member, he has been fortunate to      assist other members with auctions of land and equipment and      that he wanted to conduct this auction with no fees,'' Clark      noted. ``This will be a great benefit to the association and      its members.''       Clark said the association will still maintain a presence      in the community for some time. He said, as with any industry      of its size, there are still business-related issues that      will require time and attention. He estimated that his final      days on the job would probably be in a few months. ``The      association had a good run. There have been lots of directors      and I have no regrets for my time here.''       The association has approximately 1,000 members, it was      reported.       He noted that, over the years, tobacco has paid billions of      dollars in taxes and those dollars collected have paid for      many things. ``Tobacco has meant so much to so many people      and it has impacted everyone. Our forefathers thought it was      important enough that there are tobacco leaves on the facades      of many important buildings. Tobacco has saved many farmers,      helped families and sent many children to school.''       Throughout the years the local association has administered      the tobacco program and lobbied for the growers in the nine      counties of the Jackson Purchase and the Tennessee counties      of Henry, Weakley and Obion.       ``Since there will not be a tobacco program or a price      support system, then there really isn't a need or purpose for      our association any longer,'' Clark said. ``We have been      working to get things in place for the closure.''       Clark said he has arranged with Murray State University to      take over some of the association's historical papers.       ``This will be a big benefit for residents of the      community. MSU's people will have to go through the old      papers and catalog all of those items before they are      available to the public,'' he said. ``We have old records,      papers and even the minute books from the first meetings.      Many papers date back to 1931. And there are old floor sheets      on tobacco that went to pool. There's lots of information and      names.''       He said the vintage documents will be of interest to a lot      of people.       ``One of the very first things I did when I came to work      here was to go back and read through all of the old minute      books. It really helped me to know where we were as an      association and it helped to plan for the future,'' he noted.       Clark is only the fourth or fifth manager since the      association began. He said he was unsure what he would do,      but he added, ``something will come along.''       Association President Jim Kelly said the sale was the end      of a long era in Calloway County. ``Lots of farmers were      helped through the association. Things are just different      now. Farmers are contracting with companies and that's where      most of the farmers are at these days. The pool was a safety      net that would grade and process tobacco until somebody      needed it,'' he said.       Kelly, who farms 76 acres of burley and dark-fired tobacco,      said more farmers were going for larger acreage and many of      the smaller farmers were dropping out the businesses. ``With      the costs of farming nowadays, it's just not something that      people get into the way they used to do.''       He said farmers were basically at the mercy of what the      companies would pay for the tobacco. But even then, there are      pluses and minuses to the situation.       He added that the association was in a shut-down phase and      assets would eventually be returned to its members.       ``There hasn't been any tobacco stored in those warehouses      in a long time. It's sad to see it all come to a close,'' he      remarked.                          ____________________[Pages S11682-S11683]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                       TRIBUTE TO WILL EDD CLARK  Mr. McCONNELL.
