 President, when we stand in this Capitol dedicated to freedom, we must remember freedom's costs. So I rise to speakabout Jacob Joseph Chestnut and John Michael Gibson.  Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, both of the Capitol Police, gave their lives 11 years ago today in defense of the men and women who work in and visit the Capitol.  A plaque in this building commemorates their bravery. Their names have been etched upon the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, which stands 1 mile from here. And the headquarters of the U.S. Capitol Police bears their names.  Officer Chestnut, or J.J. to his friends, was a 20-year veteran of the Air Force, and had 18 years of service to the Capitol Police. John Gibson also had 18 years of Capitol Police service, and until that day had never had to draw his weapon.  Both men left behind their wives, children, beloved family members, and friends. Both men were part of an elite team. Capitol Police officers, with their unique mission, are charged with protecting not only our lives but our very system of government.  My friend, the majority leader, a former Capitol Police officer himself, knows both the honor and the danger that comes with the job. And so as we honor Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson today, we also honor every man and woman of the Capitol Police who have bravely volunteered for this hazardous but important duty.  So today the Senate honors J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson. We are grateful for their heroic sacrifice, and we remember their families, whom we embrace as we would our own.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
