 I was in the cloakroom having some lunch, and I heard the gentlelady's comments. Most of us--a lot of us--went around this country listening to people as well as speaking on behalf of our respective candidacies and parties. What I heard around America was that they want people who will sit down together and try to solve the problems that confront America's families and America's workers.  I want to say to the gentlelady from Illinois, my experience with her, throughout her career, has been that she is one of those types of people. And I want to thank her. I want to thank her for her decency. I want to thank her for her hard work. I want to thank her for her commitment to country first. It's been a privilege to serve with you, Judy, and I look forward to being your friend for many years to come. I wish you great success in the future.  I wanted to say that because too often the public sees us confronting one another and sometimes being angry with one another, but you and I have had the opportunity to work together and I know the good heart that you have and the openness that you have displayed, and I thank you for that.
