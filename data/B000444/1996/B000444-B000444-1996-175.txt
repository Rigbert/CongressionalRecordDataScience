 President, for the benefit of my colleagues, to review the bidding from yesterday, the distinguished chairman of the committee and I agreed on a unanimous-consent proposal that we have one-half hour on each of up to as many as 14 motions. I doubt there will be that many. But we will move them out seriatim here. I see my distinguished colleague from California, Senator Boxer, is on the floor prepared to go with her motion, to begin to debate her motion. So I would, with the permission of the Senator from Utah, yield to the Senator from California for that purpose.  I will make one important point, Mr. President. At the appropriate time I will make the motion. As I understand the parliamentary situation, debate must be concluded before I make the motion, otherwise the motion is subject to immediately being tabled, which I do not think my friend has anyintention of doing. But just to make sure we do it by the numbers--I beg your pardon. I have been informed by staff we got unanimous consent yesterday that that is not necessary, that we can offer the motion. But I will offer the motion at this point.                           Motion To Recommit
