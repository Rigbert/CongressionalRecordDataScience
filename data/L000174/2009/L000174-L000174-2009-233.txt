President, moments ago I left the Judiciary Committee hearing room where we are considering the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court. In considering this historic and well-qualified nominee, many Americans may believe our country has completely turned the corner in terms of equality and civil rights. While I certainly hope Judge Sotomayor's nomination will unite us as a nation, I am aware that there is a lot more that still has to be done to protect the civil rights of all Americans.  I plan to offer the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 as an amendment to the pending National Defense authorization bill. I thank Senator Collins, Senator Snowe, and a number of other bipartisan cosponsors for their support. This measure has long been a priority bill for Senator Ted Kennedy. I commend him for his steadfast leadership over the last decade in working to expand our Federal hate crime laws.  The amendment I will offer aims to address the serious and growing problem of hate crimes. We all saw the recent event at the Holocaust Museum here in Washington which made it clear that these vicious crimes continue to haunt our country. This bipartisan legislation is carefully designed to help law enforcement most effectively respond to this problem. It has been stalled for far too long. The time to act is now.  The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act has been pending for more than a decade and has actuallypassed the Senate several times. Despite its long history in the Senate, and despite the fact that it is cosponsored by both Democratic and Republican Senators, it continues to draw the same tired, old attacks. Less than 2 years ago the Senate passed a hate crimes bill as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Act. It also passed the Senate in 2004, in 2000, and 1999.  Last month, at the request of the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Sessions, and all Republican members of the committee, I chaired a hearing on this bill to assure that this legislation has been adequately discussed and considered, and to allow an opportunity to explore the minor changes that were made to the bill in this Congress.  It is no doubt a testament to the urgency of this legislation that the Attorney General of the United States returned to the Judiciary Committee to testify in support of the bill. I say it reflects the urgency of it because the Attorney General had been before the committee less than a week before in an oversight hearing. Normally we would not see him before the committee for another 6 to 10 months. Yet, he came back within 6 days so he could testify in support of this important legislation. I commend Attorney General Holder for that. We have also heard from State and local law enforcement organizations, all supportive of the measure, and our committee record includes support letters from dozens of leaders of the faith community and the civil rights community.  I agreed with Senator Sessions when he commented at the end of the hearing that it was a good hearing with a good exchange of views. We have now had more than enough process and consideration of this bill, and it is time to bring it to another Senate vote.  The hate crimes amendment will improve existing law by making it easier for Federal authorities to investigate and prosecute crimes of racial, ethnic, or religious violence. Victims will no longer have to engage in a narrow range of activities, such as serving as a juror, to be protected under Federal law. It also focuses the attention and resources of the Federal Government on the problem of crimes committed against people because of their sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or disability, which is a long overdue protection. In addition, the hate crimes amendment will provide assistance and resources to State and local and tribal law enforcement to address hate crimes.  Last Congress this legislation was attached to the Department of Defense authorization bill and had the bipartisan support of 60 Senators, and I expect we will have even more support today.  President Obama supports the immediate passage of hate crime legislation. In his first few months in office, he has acted to ensure that Federal benefits are awarded more equitably, regardless of sexual orientation. He has shown through his selection of a nominee for the Supreme Court that he understands the greatest talent and experience and the highest devotion to law exists across lines of gender and ethnicity. Unlike in previous years, our bipartisan hate crimes bill does not face a veto threat because we have a President who understands that crimes motivated by bias are particularly pernicious crimes that affect more than just their victims and those victims' families.  I know. In a previous career, I prosecuted crimes that were committed based solely or primarily on bias against the victims. It is a hateful, terrible thing. It is hateful to the victim, to the victim's family, the victim's friends.  Hate crimes instill fear in those who have no connection to the victim other than a shared characteristic such as race or sexual orientation. If you feel somebody with whom you share that connection may have been the victim of a hate crime, you may fear that you will be next.  For nearly 150 years, we have responded as a nation to deter and punish violent denials of civil rights by enacting Federal laws to protect the civil rights of all of our citizens. The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 continues that great and honorable tradition. That is why so many law enforcement--State and local, Federal--support this legislation. Adoption of this amendment will show, once again, that America values tolerance and protects all of its people. I urge the opponents of this measure to consider the message it sends when, year after year, we have been prevented from enacting this broadly supported legislation. The victims of hate deserve better, and those who fear they may be the next victim of a hate crime deserve better. So I hope all Senators will join me in support of this important amendment.  At the appropriate point, I will call up the amendment. I ask unanimous consent that the letters in support of this amendment from the Human Rights Campaign dated July 14, 2009, and the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights dated July 9, 2009, be printed in the Record. I also ask unanimous consent that the list of supporters for the legislation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                        Human Rights Campaign,                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2009.       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Human Rights Campaign and      our more than 750,000 members and supporters nationwide, we      are writing today to urge you to support the Leahy/Collins/     Kennedy/Snowe Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act      amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Act for      Fiscal Year 2010 (S. 1391) and to reject any secondary      amendments. These will be key votes for the Human Rights      Campaign.       The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act has strong      bipartisan support. On April 29, 2009 the House of      Representatives passed a virtually identical bill (H.R. 1913)      by a vote of 249-175. The Senate has previously supported      substantially similar legislation on four separate occasions      by wide bipartisan margins, most recently as an amendment to      the 2008 Department of Defense Authorization bill by a vote      of 60 to 39. In addition to public opinion polling that      consistently finds an overwhelming majority of Americans in      support of such legislation, the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes      Prevention Act has the support of more than 300 law      enforcement, civil rights, civic and religious organizations.       Since the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began      collecting hate crimes statistics in 1991, reported bias-     motivated crimes based on sexual orientation more than      tripled; yet the federal government has no jurisdiction to      assist states and localities in dealing with even the most      violent hate crimes against lesbian, gay, bisexual and      transgender Americans. The FBI's 2007 Uniform Crime Reports--     the most recent year for which we have statistics--showed      that reported violent crimes based on sexual orientation      constituted 16.6 percent of all hate crimes in 2007, with      1,265 reported for the year.       By passing this common sense anti-hate crime measure, we      would bring our nation's laws into the 21st century. The      Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act is a logical      extension of existing federal law. Since 1969, 18 U.S.C.      Sec. 245 has permitted federal prosecution of a hate crime if      the crime was motivated by bias based on race, religion,      national origin, or color, and because the victim was      exercising a ``federally protected right'' (e.g. voting,      attending school, etc.). After forty years, it has become      clear that the statute needs to be amended.       This bill adds actual or perceived sexual orientation,      gender, disability and gender-identity to the list of covered      categories and removes the federally protected activity      requirement, thus bringing a much needed comprehensiveness to      federal law. Removing the outdated intent requirement, would      untie the federal government's hands and allow them to      partner with state and local officials in combating serious      hate crimes that involve death and bodily injury.       We urge you to vote for this historic piece of legislation.      For more information, please contact Allison Herwitt,      Legislative Director, or David Stacy, Senior Public Policy      Advocate. Thank you.           Sincerely,                                                    Joe Solmonese,     President.                                  ____         Leadership Conference on Civil Rights,                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2009.     Hon. Harry Reid,     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Carl Levin,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators: On behalf of the Leadership Conference on      Civil Rights (LCCR), the nation's oldest, largest, and most      diverse civil and human rights coalition, with more than 200      member organizations, we thank you for your support and      leadership of the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act      (S. 909) (HCPA) and applaud your commitment to pass it before      the August recess.       LCCR appreciates your continued support for this bill, and      we are grateful for Senator Levin's willingness to allow an      attempt to attach HCPA to the Department of Defense (DOD)      Authorization, and for Senator Leahy's leadership in offering      the amendment on     the Senate floor. As you know, due to pressure from outside      of the Senate, we have tried but failed to find an      appropriate vehicle on which to attach the HCPA. We recognize      and appreciate that the DOD Authorization bill is the best      and only option to ensure passage before the August recess.       We know that you understand well the importance of S. 909.      The testimony of Attorney General Holder at the Senate      Judiciary Hearing on June 25th, indicating the      administration's strong support for this bill, is an      encouraging reminder that after eleven years of efforts, we      will finally be able to pass the law necessary to protect      victims of violent, bias-motivated attacks. The HCPA would      enhance the federal response to hate crime violence by      covering all violent crimes based on race, color, religion,      or national origin. In addition, the HCPA would permit      federal involvement in the prosecution of bias-motivated      crimes based on the victim's gender, gender identity, sexual      orientation, or disability. This expansion is critical in      order to protect Americans from this most egregious form of      discrimination.       While LCCR recognizes that bigotry cannot be legislated out      of existence, a forceful, moral response to hate violence is      required of us all. This legislation passed the House of      Representatives with a strong bipartisan majority (249-175)      and has the support of more than 300 law enforcement, civil      rights, civic, and religious organizations. We know that you      strongly believe, as we do, that Congress must do everything      possible to empower the federal government to assist in local      hate crime prosecutions and, where appropriate, expand      existing federal authority to permit a wider range of      investigations and prosecutions. We sincerely appreciate your      efforts and leadership in making this happen.       Please contact Rob Randhava, LCCR Counsel, Lisa Bornstein,      LCCR Senior Counsel, or Nancy Zirkin with any questions.      Thank you again for your support and leadership.           Sincerely,     Wade Henderson,       President & CEO.     Nancy Zirkin,       Executive Vice President.                                  ____                          Support Letter List       9to5 Bay Area (CA); 9to5 Colorado; 9to5 Milwaukee; 9to5      National Association of Working Women; A.
