Otana Jakpor may only be 14 years old anda sophomore at Woodcrest Christian High School but she is already establishing herself as a promising scientist. Otana is the Region IX recipient of the 2007 President's Environmental Youth Award (PEYA) for a science project titled ``Indoor Air Pollution: The Pulmonary Effects of Ozone-Generating Air Purifiers.''  Young people from around the country are invited annually to participate in the PEYA program, which is aimed at encouraging individuals, school classes, summer camps, youth organizations and public interest groups to promote environmental awareness and encourage positive community involvement. One award is given for each of the Environmental Protection Agency's 10 regions. (EPA Region 9 includes California, Arizona, Nevada, Hawaii.) On April 17, 2008, President Bush presented the award to Otana at a White House Ceremony.  Ms. Jakpor decided to focus her project on indoor pollution after she read a Consumer Reports article titled ``New Concerns about Ionizing Air Cleaners.'' The article reported that certain models of ionizing air cleaners emit high amounts of ozone, but it did not include any research data. Otana's findings indicated that indoor air purifiers, neck air purifiers and ionizers emit high amounts of ozone, one result was 15 times higher than the level of a State 3 smog alert.  Ms. Jakpor's findings were significant and on September 27, 2007, she presented them to the California Air Resources Board at a hearing on indoor air purifier pollution. The Board voted to adopt a regulation to limit ozone emissions from air purifiers to less than 0.050 parts per million, and now California is the first state in the nation to regulate ozone generators.  Recognition for her scientific achievements are not new to Otana, she has received the NAACP Los Angeles ACT-SO Competition Gold medal in Medicine; eight awards from the RIMS Inland Science and Engineering Fair for both her freshman and sophomore projects; and fourth place award in the Pharmacology/Toxicology Category in the Senior Division for her research on ozone at the California State Science Fair. She is a spokesperson for the American Lung Association and has appeared on the Discovery Channel.  Ms. Jakpor is first in her class at an excellent and competitive school and has a 4.33 Grade Point Average. It is an honor to recognize Otana for all her achievements at such a young age. I commend Ms. Jakpor for her hard work, commitment and outstanding educational achievements. I have no doubt she will continue to contribute to the science community and look forward to hearing about the incredible discoveries of Otana Jakpor in the years to come.                          ____________________
