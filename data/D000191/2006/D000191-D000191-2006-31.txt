You have heard of Christmas in July and you heard the gentleman before me. This is truly Christmas in July for the wealthiest among us, those who have estates worth more than $10 million, so they won't have to carry a share of the burden of paying for our country.  But this is really more of an April Fools in July. The calendar lies to us. Because the Republicans are saying that there is some equivalence between raising the minimum wage, something in 10 years of Republican rule that has never been raised, from $5.15 an hour. Three million kids are dependent upon sole wage earners who earn the minimum wage, living in abject poverty at $10,000 a year.  Some of them are pumping gas into the limousine of Lee Raymond. Who is Lee Raymond? He is the guy who just retired from ExxonMobil with a $400 million pension extorted from the American people by gouging at the gas pump. Guess how much this bill would be worth to Mr. Raymond's heirs if he died next year? $128 million. A $128 million tax savings for one individual in this proposal, which will be financed on the backs of working Americans for the next 30 years.  Because, guess what, we are running a deficit. So if we are going to give Mr. Raymond's heirs a $128 million tax break, then we are going to have to borrow the money to do it. We would borrow $80 billion a year to give the Paris Hiltons and, yes, the Lee Raymonds, and the others who have estates worth more than $10 million a bye. And they say that is a trade-off for after 10 years of delay and disassembling to give a tiny increase that still won't bring 6 million Americans up to the poverty level who are earning the minimum wage.  Shame on you for Christmas for the wealthiest among us in July and shame on you for April Fools on working Americans.  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Delahunt).
