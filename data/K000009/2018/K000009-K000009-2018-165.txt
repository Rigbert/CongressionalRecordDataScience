Speaker, I rise to recognize an important milestone in the life of one of the communities in my district. Sandusky Ohio celebrates it's bicentennial in the coming days, highlighted by a ball on Saturday April 28, 2018.  Founded two hundred years ago in 1818, Sandusky was developed near the town of Portland, which it soon overtook. According to history, part of the city was built on ``land formerly occupied by a Native American man named Ogontz. Thus, the city is said to have been built upon `Ogontz' place.' '' The name ``Sandusky'' was taken from the Native American Wyandot word for ``water.'' In fact, Sandusky sits on the Western Basin of Lake Erie. As a result of its location on the Lake, Sandusky's population grew quickly. It was one of Ohio's first major ports and was ``an original terminus for the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad. Chartered by the state legislature in 1832 and envisioned to run between Sandusky and Dayton to the southwest, the Mad River and Lake Erie Railroad was the first rail line located entirely in Ohio'' when Sandusky was the site of its ground breaking on September 17, 1835.  The State of Ohio established Erie County in 1838 and set Sandusky as the county seat. Charles Dickens, who visited Sandusky in 1842, wrote this about the city in his travelogue American Notes: ``At two o'clock we took the railroad; the travelling-on which was very slow, its construction being indifferent, and the ground wet and marshy; and arrived at Sandusky in time to dine that evening. We put up at a comfortable little hotel on the brink of Lake Erie, lay there that night, and had no choice but to wait there next day, until a steamboat bound for Buffalo appeared. The town, which was sluggish and uninteresting enough, was something like the back of an English watering-place out of the season.''  However, the town soon grew and by 1846 Sandusky had become an economic hub, with its port and two railroads. According to the history, about three thousand people lived in Sandusky and were served by ``numerous stores, two printing offices, two machine shops, two banks, six churches, one high school, and several iron furnaces.'' The city's downtown was laid out similar to the pattern in our nation's Capital.  Sandusky was a critical stop on the Underground Railroad. Many fugitive slaves who sought freedom in Canada boarded a boat in Sandusky to cross Lake Erie into Ontario. They were assisted in their journeys by a strong network of residents.  The history notes that by 1880, ``Sandusky's population had reached almost sixteen thousand residents. This much larger population resulted in an increasing number of social institutions, including twenty churches and three newspapers. The community also became more economically diverse, with at least twenty-nine businesses with ten or more employees. Among the items that Sandusky businesses produced were lime, railroad locomotives and cars, carriages, wheels, crayons, chalk, beer, paper, baskets, and tools. In 1886, residents boasted that they were the leading manufacturers of wooden wheels in the United States. That same year, Sandusky was home to the Ohio Soldiers' and Sailors' Home and the Ohio State Fish Hatchery.''  Sandusky continued to grow and develop through the Twentieth Century. Today, Sandusky is known for its tourism: its beaches, boating and fishing, parkland and Cedar Point. It is home for higher education for adults of all ages at the Firelands Campus of Bowling Green State University, a thriving arts community and the MerryGoRound Museum, the active Sanduky Chapter of the NAACP, historic religious institutions and many thriving businesses. The. Ohio Veterans Home--one of only two in the state--continues to serve veterans. Its nearly 30,000 residents are members of a town that proudly celebrates its history while looking toward its future.                          ____________________
