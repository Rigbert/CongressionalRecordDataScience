Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to the Reactive Materials Team from the Indian Head Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Maryland's Fifth District. Nine scientists composing the Reactive Materials Team were recently awarded the 2010 Dr. Delores M. Etter Top Scientists and Engineers of the Year Award.  This highly competitive and prestigious national award is given annually to Navy civilian and military personnel who exemplify exceptional scientific and engineering achievement. The Department of Navy established this award to honor scientists and engineers attaining superior technical accomplishments and to promote continued scientific and engineering excellence in research. It is named after an outstanding public servant, Dr. Delores M. Etter, former Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research, Development and Acquisition.  Today, I am proud to recognize and congratulate the team--Richard J. Jouet, Joel R. Carney, James M. Lightstone, Richard J. Lee, John H. Wilkinson, Joseph P. Hooper, Sam C. Thuot, Jonathan G. Rogerson, and Edward A. Lustig, Jr.--for their exceptional achievement in developing reactive materials to be used in the explosive cases of our next generation weapon systems. These fine scientists and engineers have are committed public servants--dedicating themselves to research vital to our national security. As Americans, we thank them for their efforts and applaud them on their accomplishments.  Mr. Speaker, I also want to take a moment to recognize the 3,000 active duty and civilian personnel at Indian Head who work and collaborate every day to develop and deploy technologies to improve the safety and effectiveness of the men and women serving in harm's way. Since 1890, this facility has proven to be an Energetics center of excellence for the Department of Defense (Navy) and I thank those men and women in uniform, along with their families and the civilian employees, for their outstanding service to the Indian Head Division and to the United States of America.  Again, I urge my colleagues to join with me in congratulating the members of the Reactive Materials Team at Indian Head on being recognized as the Navy's top scientists and engineers and in honoring all the men and women at the Indian Head Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Maryland for their continued excellence and commitment to our nation's success.                          ____________________
