 Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding. A few moments ago the gentleman from Michigan mentioned St. Albans, VT and the takeover there. I know a little bit about that because I was intimately involved in that entire struggle.  The gentleman neglects to tell us how many workers, many of whom were employed by that company for decades, were laid off and lost their jobs. The gentleman neglects to tell us what the wages are of the new workers who came into that job as compared to the other workers. The gentleman neglects to say that to the degree we got a halfway decent severance package for those workers who were laid off, it is because we fought and the union fought over a period of a year and rallied community support for decency.  What this whole discussion is about is a phenomenon taking place all over this country called the race to the bottom. How do we pay workers lower and lower wages to make them competitive with other low wage workers? How do American workers compete with Mexican workers and Chinese workers?  The problem today is not that railroad workers have too strong worker protection. The problem is that other workers have too weak worker protection. Let us not lower the strong benefits that workers in the railroads have now, but let us increase the benefits that other workers have.
