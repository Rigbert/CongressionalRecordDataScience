On that day, I missed 3 recorded votes. I include in the Record how I would have voted had I been present for those votes.  On Roll Call No. 657 on Ordering the Previous Question, had I been present, I would have voted ``Nay.''  On Roll Call No. 658 on the Adoption of H. Res. 748, had I been present, I would have voted ``Nay.''  On Roll Call No. 659 on the Passage of H.R. 5363, had I been present, I would have voted ``Nay.''                          ____________________
