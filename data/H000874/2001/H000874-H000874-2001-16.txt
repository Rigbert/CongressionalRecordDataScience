I want to say emphatically, nothing in this bill defines anyone's home, nor do we interpret in any way a home as being included as a polling place with the intention of stopping or curbing absentee and at-home voting.  In recognition of Oregon's all-mail voting law, the bill exempted Oregon and other States with all-mail voting from the provisional voting requirements applicable to polling places. So nothing in this bill should be of concern to your State's all-mail voting process.
