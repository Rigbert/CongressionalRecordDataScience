 President, today, as I did a couple days last week, I continue with my discussion on the issues the Senate will face as the Democratic leadership draws up its budget resolution, and that is going to be 2 days next week in the Budget Committee and then I think the week after next, depending on what theDemocratic leader decides to do, we generally will have a whole week of debate on the budget and adoption of the budget.  We face an important milestone because the Democratic leadership controls the Senate for the first time since the 2002 election. Over the past 4 years, there has been a lot of passionate debate over the fiscal policies the Republican leadership proposed and implemented over the last 4 years. In November, the voters sent a Democratic majority to Congress. The budget debate we are about to enter provides Democrats with their opportunity to chart a fiscal policy path for the Nation.  Before the budget arrives, I have taken to the floor to recap and evaluate some of the consistent themes we have heard from the Democratic leadership over the past 4 years. Since the Finance Committee has jurisdiction over nearly all of the revenue side of the budget, I focused on the issues on that side of the ledger, the revenue side.  Since the position of the Democratic leadership has been to let the bipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 and 2003 expire, I talked about the effects of that automatic tax increase--yes, automatic tax increase--that happens without even a vote of the Congress if we don't continue this tax policy that was adopted in 2001 and 2003 beyond the year of 2010.  It is a very important consideration. For the last 4 years, Republican budgets on Capitol Hill have made it clear that our priority was to ensure that virtually every American taxpayer would not see that automatic tax increase come in their earnings of 2011, and that still is our policy. That is a policy reflected in the budget the President of the United States has sent to the Congress. So the year 2011 is the year the bipartisan tax relief sunsets.  I emphasize that 2001 was the year of bipartisan tax relief. I had the good fortune of working that year, 2001, with Senator Max Baucus helping me get that bipartisan tax relief passed. He is now chairman of the committee, being that the Democrats are in the majority. I have the good fortune of maintaining a close working relationship with him.  The President's budget, as I already said, maintains the assurance that these tax policies of the last 7 years will continue in place beyond the year 2010. During the 4-year period 2003 to 2006, the Democratic leadership was harshly critical of this policy which was passed in 2001 and 2003; that is, the Democratic leadership opposed the fiscal policies of preventing a tax increase on virtually every American taxpayer automatically because Congress wouldn't even have to vote on it.  My first speech defined the tax increases built into that fiscal policy. My second speech highlighted some of the macroeconomic risks of that widespread automatic tax increase. Last week, I remarked to the Senate and discussed with the Senate potential omissions in the Democratic leadership's budget; that is, the discussion was about fiscal policy that was present in prior budgets. If the Democratic leadership's past criticisms of those budgets were carried out, the fiscal policy of continuing tax relief would end. This week, I am going to focus on the track record of the Democratic leadership and discuss potential problems from proposals that might be contained in that budget. You could say, from our standpoint, I am examining errors of commission this week, whereas last week I examined errors of omission.  Today, I wish to refer to the use of revenue-raising offsets in the budget context. As any budgeteer can tell you, the budget resolution is not a law. It doesn't amend the Internal Revenue Code or Medicare law or appropriations. The budget resolution is like a blueprint for a building. The actual construction of tax and spending policies will occur later on this year.  The budget resolution is, however, critical to actual tax, actual spending, and actual deficit decisions the Congress will undertake. The matter of offsets is critical in this respect: If additional spending is proposed in the resolution without real offsets, then deficits are more likely. Likewise, if popular tax relief is proposed but not offset with real proposals, then deficits could appear and be larger--though, on this last point, the track record of the last 4 years shows tax relief grew the economy and record levels of Federal revenue came into the Treasury as a direct result.  My basic point is that if a proposed offset is not realistic and the proponents succeed, budget discipline could be undermined. In other words, phony offsets, if incorporated into the budget, can lead to deficits.  Today, I am just going to follow the numbers. Just follow the numbers. I am not going to make any judgments or make any assumptions about the revenue-raising proposals. I am going to analyze these proposals strictly from a fiscal standpoint.  I analyze two categories of offsets from the standpoint of whether the budget arithmetic adds up, and I am going to examine last year's record of the Democratic leadership on offsets but look at it as if they were in control at the time. It is not a pretty picture.  I am going to take a look at proposed offsets from a series of amendments, real amendments that were debated here on the floor of the Senate during last year's budget resolution debate. During that debate, virtually all Democratic members had a common theme in their purported offsets for their amendments to this resolution. That purported theme was that they would close tax loopholes to pay for whatever popular spending program they wanted to propose. Closing corporate tax loopholes was the common refrain to pay for spending.  I will list the amendments and the popular spending proposals:       Senator Kennedy, Vocational Education and Pell Grants;       Senator Akaka, Veterans Medical Services;       Senator Murray, Community Block Grants;       Senator Stabenow, Emergency Responders;       Senator Menendez, Port Security;       Senator Byrd, Amtrak;       Senator Reed of Rhode Island, LIHEAP;       Senator Sarbanes, Corps of Engineers and other Federal      services;       Senator Dorgan, Native American programs;       Senator Stabenow, Veterans' Health Care;       Senator Akaka, Title I Education Grants; and       Senator Lincoln, Agriculture.  These are all here, and more than what I gave are here.  Mr. President, at this point I ask unanimous consent that a list of these amendments by vote and by amendment number, so that they are there for people who aren't listening to what I am saying to consider, be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                   Paid for by Closing Tax Loopholes       Vote #39 Kennedy Amendment, No.3028 Vocational Education      and Pell Grants; Vote #41 Akaka Amendment, No. 3007 Veterans      Medical Services; Vote #43 Murray Amendment, No. 3063      Community Block Grants; Vote #45 Stabenow Amendment, No. 3056      Emergency Responders; Vote #47 Menendez Amendment, No. 3054      Port Security; Vote #51 Byrd Amendment, No. 3086 Amtrak; Vote      #57 Reed Amendment, No.3074 LI-HEAP; Vote #60 Sarbanes      Amendment, No. 3103 Corps of Engineers and Other Federal      Services; Vote #61 Dorgan Amendment, No. 3102 Native American      Programs; Vote #63 Stabenow Amendment, No. 3141 Veterans      Health Care; Vote #64 Akaka Amendment, No. 3071 Title I      Education Grants; Vote #66 Lincoln Amendment, No. 3106      Agriculture.
