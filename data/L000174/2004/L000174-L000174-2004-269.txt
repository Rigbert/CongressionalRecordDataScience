President, if I might retain my right to the floor, the senior Senator from Illinois is absolutely correct; I did. I offered it. We had a debate within the Appropriations Committee to accept it within the Appropriations Committee and it became part of the bill.  My earlier statement may have left confusion, and I apologize. There was no intention of doing that. It was part of the appropriations bill and thus not voted on by the Senate although there was not a single amendment to strike that provision. There were various amendments, as the Senator may recall, that were proposed during the appropriations bill on the Senate floor, but no one moved to strike this. It passed 93-0. About the only difference in that bill, as I recall, was the amendment spoke only to Iraq. This includes other countries besides Iraq.  Yes, we voted on it, we passed it, and then the Senate offered it as their position. Both Republicans and Democrats offered it as our position to the other body, which rejected it on a party-line vote at the request of the White House.
