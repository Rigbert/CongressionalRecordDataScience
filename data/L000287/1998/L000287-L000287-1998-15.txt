Mr. Speaker, we need a Patient Protection Act. I know because I have heard from the people in my district. I have heard from a mother with a sick baby who had to travel 30 miles to a hospital when there was a hospital nearby. I heard from a doctor who had to fight to get coverage to treat his cancer. Mr. Speaker, too many patients are paying more and getting less. Under the present system, too many patients are getting a raw deal. They need a fair deal, a good deal, a better deal.  If insurance companies want to make decisions about medical care for our children and our families, then they must be held accountable. The Democratic bill will give us those rights. The Republican bill will deny them.  Mr. Speaker, we need a real Patient Protection Act and we need it now; not tomorrow, not next week, not next year, but now.                          ____________________
