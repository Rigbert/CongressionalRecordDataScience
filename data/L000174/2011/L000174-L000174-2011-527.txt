 Everyone knows that economic growth is the path toward budget balance. Economic growth and winning the future through American innovation is what the bipartisan American Invents Act is all about.  Accordingly, for all these reasons as well as the reasons for which I opposed the efforts to amend the Constitution in 1982, 1986, 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1997, I oppose amendment No. 115.                               Exhibit 1                     [From the Hill, Mar. 2, 2011]          Delivering Innovation and Jobs Through Patent Reform                  (By Commerce Secretary, Gary Locke)       Today, there are more than 700,000 unexamined patent      applications log-jammed at the U.S. Patent and Trademark      Office (USPTO).Many of them represent inventions that will      come to market and launch new businesses and create new,      high-paying jobs.       But without a patent, securing the funds needed to get a      business or innovation off the ground is nearly impossible,      for both small and large inventors alike.       Patent reform legislation the Senate is considering this      week can change that.       And it can build on the progress USPTO Director David      Kappos has already made in reducing the time it takes to      process the average patent--currently nearly 3 years.       New programs have been introduced to fast-track promising      technologies, reforms have been made to help examiners more      quickly process applications, and the Patent Office recently      announced a plan to give inventors more control over when      their patent is examined.       The result? The backlog of patents is decreasing for the      first time in years, even as new applications have actually      increased 7 percent.       But if the USPTO is to speed the movement of job-creating      ideas to the marketplace, it will take more than internal,      administrative reforms alone. That's where the patent reform      legislation comes in.       Here's what it promises to do: First, it allows the USPTO      to set its own fees--a major part of ensuring that the agency      has reliable funding. This will enable the USPTO to hire more      examiners and bring its IT system into the 21st century so it      can process applications more quickly and produce better      patents that are less likely to be subject to a court      challenge.       Second, it decreases the likelihood of expensive litigation      because it creates a less costly, in-house administrative      alternative to review patent validity claims.       Also, the pending legislation would add certainty to court      damages awards, helping to avoid excessive awards in minor      infringement cases, a phenomenon that essentially serves as a      tax on innovation and an impediment to business development.       Finally, patent reform adopts the ``first-inventor-to-     file'' standard as opposed to the current ``first-to-invent''      standard. First inventor to file is used by the rest of the      world, and would be good for U.S. businesses, providing a      more transparent and cost-effective process that puts them on      a level playing field with their competitors around the      world.       There is some concern among some small, independent      inventors, who feel like the current system is better for      them, but it's our strong opinion that the opposite is true.       Here's why: The cost of proving that one was first to      invent is prohibitive and requires detailed and complex      documentation of the invention process. In cases where      there's a dispute about who the actual inventor is, it      typically costs at least $400,000 in legal fees, and even      more if the case is appealed. By comparison, establishing a      filing date through a provisional application and      establishing priority of invention costs just $110. The      125,000 provisional applications currently filed each year      prove that early filing dates protect the rights of small      inventors.       In the past seven years, of almost 3 million applications      filed, only 2 patents were granted to small entities that      were the second inventor to file but were able to prove they      were first to invent. Of those 25, only one patent was      granted to an individual inventor who was the second to file.      Thus, in the last seven years, only one independent inventor      in nearly 3 million patent filings would have gotten a      different outcome under the ``first-inventor-to-file''      system.       Many proposals in this legislation have been debated for a      decade, but we now have core provisions with broad support      that will undoubtedly add more certainty around the validity      of patents; enable greater work sharing between the USPTO and      other countries; and help the agency continue with      operational changes needed to accelerate innovation, support      entrepreneurship and business development, and drive job      creation and economic prosperity.       And thanks to the leadership of Senate and House Judiciary      Committee Chairmen, Patrick Leahy1 and Lamar Smith, getting      this bipartisan jobs legislation passed is a top priority.       There's a clear case for it. As President Obama said in his      State of the Union address, ``The first step in winning the      future is encouraging American innovation.''       Reforming our patent system is a critical part of that      first step.       Speeding the transformation of an idea into a market-making      product will drive the jobs and industries of the future and      strengthen America's economic competitiveness.
