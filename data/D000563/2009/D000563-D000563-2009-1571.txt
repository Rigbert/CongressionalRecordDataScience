President, this resolution, incidentally, authorizes the use of the Capitol Rotunda on February 12, 2009, on the 200th birthday of Abraham Lincoln. We originally thought a smaller venue would be adequate, but interest in this event has grown. I hope people across America realize that as we celebrate here, there will be celebrations in Springfield, IL, and many other venues.                          ____________________
