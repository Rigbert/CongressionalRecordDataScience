SPECTER. In a moment I will, to Senator Leahy.  When the Senator from Nevada says he doesn't have to explain, he is wrong. He thinks he does have to explain because this is a Senate proceeding by press conference. The Senator from Nevada accurately characterized some of the legislative process on this bill as legislation by press conference. Of course that has never happened before. I mean, it would just be antithetical to the workings of the Senate.  It is hard to walk down that corridor without holding a press conference involuntarily. You either hold a press conference or you are rude.  I can't do more by way of gesturing without drawing an objection from Senator Byrd. I once acknowledged the presence of the Penn State national champions in the gallery, and it was found by the rules that I was out of line.  But we do this all the time, and sometimes by design. A microphone is set up there frequently, and we go there voluntarily, and we utilize the ink and electronic equipment of the media. This little discussion here--more accurately called a charade--is for the media because we want to put some pressure on the Democrats to let us vote.  Senator Reid has come out here to defend his position because he thinks he has to, because if he didn't think he had to, he wouldn't be here. He is too parsimonious with his time, which is very valuable. I daresay he has a long list of calls to return and a long list of calls to make and a lot of business to transact, and he came out to the floor because he thought he needed to state his position that there is a battle and that he is defending himself against the charge that the Democrats are stalling and holding up this bill.  It is late now. It is 4:20 on Tuesday afternoon. We only have--let's see--we only have Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. We only have 5 days in this week to finish this bill.  I yield to the Senator from Vermont with the stipulation that I don't lose my right to the floor.
