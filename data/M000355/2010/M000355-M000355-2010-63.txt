 REID. Of course.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I had the opportunity to meet the father in the hall. I expressed to him my admiration for Senator Dodd. In fact, I said he was my favorite Democrat. We are indeed going to miss Senator Dodd in the Senate in the coming years. I thank him for being with us this morning.                          ____________________
