President, I am also very concerned that we develop policies to more adequately protect our maritime vulnerabilities and protect the public from the threats emerging as a result of maritime trade. I would be happy to work with Chairman Hollings and Ranking Member McCain next year to evaluate whether any gaps in our criminal laws to protect our maritime safety and seaport security exist and the appropriate steps we should take to close those gaps.  Additionally, I have expressed to Chairman Hollings my concerns that we properly limit access to and use of sensitive law enforcement information relating to background checks which are provided for in this bill. Chairman Hollings has assured me that the bill sets strict and appropriate limits as to both when such access will be required and how the information will be used once obtained. I would like to ask Chairman Hollings if he could explain those provisions?
