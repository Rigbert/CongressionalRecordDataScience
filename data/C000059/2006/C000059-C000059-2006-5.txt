Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in hearty support of H. Con. Res. 448, which commends the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for its successful completion of the space shuttle's second return-to-flight test mission. NASA gave the United States a birthday present and the best fireworks show imaginable with the breathtaking launch of the Discovery mission, also known as STS-121, on the Fourth of July this year.  The shuttle Discovery spent nearly 13 days in orbit, 9 of which were spent docked to the international space station. During the 18th shuttle mission to the international space station, the STS-121 crew members delivered over 28,000 pounds of equipment and supplies and transported one additional crew member to the station for a 6-month stay. The astronauts also performed three successful space walks to test equipment and to conduct maintenance.  This Discovery mission is an essential building block for the Vision for Space Exploration to the Moon, Mars, and Beyond. NASA is already fast at work on preparation for the next shuttle launch, with a window that begins on August 28, just a little more than a month away. This mission will resume the assembly of the international space station with the delivery of two truss sections and a set of solar arrays.  NASA Administrator Mike Griffin, the Discovery crew, and the men and women of NASA deserve accolades from the American public for a successful STS-121 mission and for effectively reviving America's space program to the heights of its glory. These astronauts represent the best of humankind. As the President stated upon the return of the Discovery crew on Monday: ``Your courage and commitment to excellence have inspired us all, and a proud Nation sends its congratulations on a job well done. America's space program is a source of great national pride.''                              {time}  1415  I urge the passage of H. Con. Res. 448.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
