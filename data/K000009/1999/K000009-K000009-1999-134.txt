Chairman, I guess, as one ranking member on one of the 13 subcommittees, we did our work and we produced a bill under the mark we were given. As my colleague can imagine, we feel somewhat troubled by the fact that we have been dragged out to the floor here, now 2 days, with every line item picked apart when, in fact, we produced a bill under the rules we were told to play by. And I guess we do not really understand why this is being fought out on the House floor.  Mr. Chairman, is this their only measure to bring it to us? Can my colleagues not do it in their own caucus?
