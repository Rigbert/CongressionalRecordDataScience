 President, today the Senate is continuing to consider S. 1, a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline. Chairman Murkowski and Senator Cantwell are here this morning to manage debate, and there are several amendments pending. We will begin voting on those and any other amendments in the queue shortly after lunch today.  Senators also should begin gathering in the Chamber at 8:20 this evening so that we can proceed as a body to the House for the State of the Union Address.                          ____________________
