With respect to the defense authorization bill, can you tell us now what kind of a rule might be applicable to the consideration of that bill?  Mr. DeLAY. I would anticipate the same types of amendments being allowed that has been sort of tradition around here on the DOD authorization bill. The Rules Committee did make an announcement tonight about filing amendments in a timely fashion. Most of the amendments would be considered by the Rules Committee, but obviously it is too early to tell what the Rules Committee will finally do.
