Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1685, the Basic Pilot Program Extension and Expansion Act of 2003. The basic pilot employment verification system is the only automated system offered to employers to verify employment eligibility of new employees.  In 1994 I spoke with a Border Patrol agent who identified a key need in the enforcement of immigration laws. Employers need a simple way, a reliable tool to verify the worker status of new employees. In response, I introduced a bill to create the basic pilot program to do just that. Operating in six of the most problematic States on a voluntary basis, the basic pilot has proven to be an overwhelming success. The basic pilot program is the best tool available for employers to comply with immigration laws which prohibit hiring undocumented immigrants.  Recently, a contract cleaning service for Wal-Mart was raided by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and over 250 employees were arrested. If Wal-Mart's cleaning service had used the basic pilot program and verified the I-9 documents provided by their workers, this situation could have been avoided. We must provide companies the option of using this employment verification program and assist them in complying with Federal immigration law. This program is in no way mandatory. It is completely voluntary and may be used at the discretion of the employer. Without the option to use the basic pilot program, employers have no means of verifying legal work status for immigrants, causing many employers to discriminate against legal workers.                              {time}  1745  This program gives employers the confidence to hire legal immigrants, reducing discrimination in the workplace. Additionally, S. 1685 allows employers from any State to voluntarily use this program. Many of my colleagues have expressed concerns that this will expand the program too far too fast. The reality is that current pilot States are home to over 80 percent of all illegal immigrants, which means the impact on the program will be negligible. The bill also requires the Department of Homeland Security to complete a report identifying and resolving any problems with the program and the expansion.  After 7 successful years, it is time to give all employers the option of verifying their workforce and avoiding entanglements with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement.  I would like to thank Senator Grassley for sponsoring S. 1685, the Senate counterpart to my bill, and encourage my colleagues to vote for a bill that promotes compliance with Federal law.
