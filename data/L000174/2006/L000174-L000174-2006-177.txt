Now that Congress has passed the law--and the President has signed it--it is up to the President to ensure that this law and all of its provisions are enforced fully and faithfully. I was pleased last Thursday to hear the President commit to aggressive enforcement and to defend the Act from legal attacks. Article I of the Constitution provides for the Congress to write the laws, and Article II provides for the President to enforce them. Congress has done its part, and now the President must do his. I commended him for saying that he will.  Last week I spoke to the Senate about a letter I had sent to the President in which I urged him not to follow his usual practice of signing a bill with his fingers crossed behind his back and later issuing a presidential signing statement undercutting the law that Congress passed. I return today to report to the Senate that, to the best of my knowledge, the President has accepted that advice and has not issued an after-the-fact signing statement. I thank the President for following this course. In fact, the material posted on the White House website includes a ``fact sheet'' in which the White House reaffirms the President's commitment ``to vigorously enforce the provisions of the law and to defend it in court.''  The Voting Rights Act is the keystone in the foundation of civil rights laws and is one of the most important methods of protecting all Americans' foundational right to vote. Several generations have kept the chain of support for the Voting Rights Act unbroken, and now we have once again done our part to continue that legacy and revitalize the Act.  We know that effective enforcement of these provisions is vital in fighting against discrimination that, unfortunately, still exists in this nation today. As the President has acknowledged, the wound is not healed and there is more to do to protect the rights of all Americans to vote and have their votes count.  I also note for the record that today, two weeks after final passage of the House bill to reauthorize and revitalize the Voting Rights Act, and one week after the President signed that historic legislation into law, copies of Senate Report 109-295 have finally been printed. This is the committee report on S.2703 that I commented on during my statement to the Senate on July 27. It contains the objection of all eight Democratic members of the committee. As previously noted, it is unusual in that it does not represent the views of a majority of the committee and certainly does not represent the views of the Democratic sponsors of that Senate legislation.                               Exhibit 1                                              The White House,                                        Washington, July 27, 2006.       I send greetings to those celebrating the reauthorization      of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.       The Voting Rights Act is one of the most important pieces      of legislation in our Nation's history. It has been vital to      guaranteeing the right to vote for generations of Americans      and has helped millions of our citizens enjoy the full      promise of freedom. By refusing to give in to discrimination      and segregation, heroes of the Civil Rights Movement called      our country back to its founding ideals of freedom and      opportunity for everyone. Leaders like Martin Luther King,      Jr., and Thurgood Marshall believed in the constitutional      guarantees of liberty and equality and trusted their fellow      Americans to do the right thing to ensure these blessings for      every man, woman, and child.       Over the years, our Nation has grown more prosperous and      powerful, and it has also grown more equal and just. Yet,      further work remains in the fight against injustice, and each      generation has a responsibility to write a new chapter in the      unfinished story of freedom. Reauthorizing this legislation      is an example of our continued commitment to a united America      where every person is valued and treated with dignity and      respect.       America is grateful for the sacrifices of citizens such as      Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott King, after      whom the bill reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act was named.      I also appreciate the members of the House and Senate for      passing this historic legislation. By working together, we      can help build an America that lives up to our guiding      principle that all men and women are created equal.       Laura and I send our best wishes on this special occasion.     George W. Bush.                          ____________________[Page S8781]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]      VOTING RIGHTS ACT REAUTHORIZATION AND AMENDMENTS ACT OF 2006
