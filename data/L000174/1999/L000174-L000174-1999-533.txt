President, I know the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin and distinguished Senator from Utah have worked in good faith on this amendment. My one concern is that the immunity provision does not define the term ``person,'' so it could include not only individual gun owners but also dealers, manufacturers, possibly even governments. I mention that not to in any way deter this from being agreed to, but I say to the distinguished Senator from Utah and the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, we will all be on the conference if this bill passes. That provision I suggest we may want to define more narrowly in a conference.
