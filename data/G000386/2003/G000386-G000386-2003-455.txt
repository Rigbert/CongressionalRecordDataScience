 President, on behalf of myself and Mr. Baucus, I ask unanimous consent the following statement be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:            Customs Revenue Functions and Homeland Security       Mr. President, On May 15, 2003, Treasury Secretary Snow      signed Treasury Department order No. 100-15, which delegates      authority related to certain revenue functions of the Bureau      of Customs and Border Protection from the Department of      Treasury to the Department of Homeland Security.       The Treasury order identifies a number of essentially      commercial Customs functions over which the Secretary of the      Treasury will continue to exercise sole authority to approve      regulations, including import quotas, classification and      valuation of imports under the U.S. Harmonized Tariff      Schedules, eligibility for trade preference programs, marking      and labeling regulations, and copyright and trademark      enforcement. Authority to approve other regulations will now      fall under the authority of the Secretary of Homeland      Security.       The Customs Bureau serves two vital functions. One function      is to protect our borders by making sure the goods that enter      our country and the vehicles that carry them do not present a      threat to the security of our nation. Customs also plays an      equally critical role in supporting our country's economic      security. By facilitating the movement of critical goods to      American industry and its customers at home and abroad,      Customs assures our continued economic growth and vitality.      We are pleased that the Administration has worked with us to      craft a division of responsibilities between Homeland      Security and Treasury that recognizes the importance of both      these functions.       The new Treasury order is intended to strike a balance      between trade facilitation and security, but there remain      concerns that the scope of authority remaining at Treasury      may be too narrow. Over time and with experience, we may      conclude that the balance requires further adjustment. The      Treasury order calls for a review in twelve months. Two      months prior to expiration, the Administration is required to      consult closely with Congress on the upcoming review, and      discuss where further adjustments to the division of      authorities are warranted.       We look forward to our continued work with the      Administration as the new division of authorities takes      effect. The Finance Committee remains committed to the goal      of assuring that Customs and our nation can advance the twin      goals of enhancing homeland security and promoting economic      growth.                          ____________________
