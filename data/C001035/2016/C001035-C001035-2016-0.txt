President, on January 3, 2013, Senator Mark Kirk climbed the 45 steps to the U.S. Capitol, triumphantly returning to work after a year of intensive recovery from a stroke. To the cheers of colleagues and friends, he called it one of the greatest moments of his life.  It was a moment of courage and determination that defined a life dedicated to serving the people of Illinois and of our Nation. From his service in the Navy Reserve as an intelligence officer, to the World Bank, the State Department, the House International Relations Committee, and five terms representing the 10th Congressional District of Illinois, Senator Kirk brought to this chamber a wealth of experience, wisdom, and commitment.  I had the pleasure of working alongside Senator Kirk on the Appropriations, Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, and Aging Committees. His approach to legislating has been in the highest traditions of the Senate: Informed, passionate, and always civil. He looked at the issues before the Senate not through the lens of a political partisan, but rather through the lens of a pragmatic problem solver and consensus builder.  Senator Kirk has been a valued ally on many fronts. We introduced the REGROW Act to accelerate the development of new therapies for patients living with such diseases as Alzheimer's disease and diabetes and to achieve breakthroughs in stroke recovery. I was proud to be named with him to serve on the Women's and Family Global Health Task Force so that the United States will continue to be a leader in preventing maternal and childhood deaths from treatable causes. We joined together on vital legislation to keep firearms out of the hands of terrorists and in addressing our Nation's opioid addiction crisis. He has always had a deep commitment to good government and was a strong voice for accountability through independent, effective inspectors general.  As chairman and former ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, Senator Kirk has worked tirelessly on behalf of the men and women who serve our country. Following in the tradition of Illinois Senator Everett Dirksen, who helped pass the Civil Rights Act a half-century ago, Senator Kirk has been a leader in ensuring the rights of America's LGBT community.  The past election brought disappointment, but it also revealed character. Senator Kirk ran a vigorous but honorable campaign and never compromised his principles. When the decision went against him, he conceded graciously, reminding Americans that what unites us is far stronger than what divides us.  It has been an honor to serve with Senator Kirk in the U.S. Senate. It has been a joy to develop our friendship, one I will cherish always. I wish him all the best in the years to come, and I know that he will meet any challenges that lie ahead with the strength and fortitude he brought to those 45 steps of the U.S. Capitol.                          ____________________
