Mr. Chairman, I rise today to voice my strong support for the underlying provisions of the legislation, namely title 6, which squarely addresses the issue of NATO expansion. At the outset, let me dispel the notion that this section would somehow hamstring the administration's foreign policy, assuming it has one. Nothing in the National Security Revitalization Act mandates NATO membership for any country or group of countries. Changes in the membership of NATO are determined on the basis of consensus among the alliance's member states as stipulated under article 10 of the North Atlantic Treaty, a point reaffirmed in the pending legislation and known to Members on both sides of the aisle.  The crux of the matter is how best to consolidate and build upon the fundamental political changes which have occurred in many of the countries of Central Europe, the Baltics, and some of the New Independent States of the Former Soviet Union. On the security front, a veritable ``no-man's-land'' has emerged between Germany and Russia following the demise of the Warsaw Pact, and the ensuing moves toward democracy and market economy by many in the region.  The Clinton administration, like the administration before it, the Bush administration, has been slow to move to fill this vacuum. Mr. Chairman, this has been a source of great consternation to the emerging democracies in the region who rightly view it as a source of potential instability.  I think my colleagues would agree that the Partnership for Peace initiative launched a year ago has failed to fill this void. By making the program mandatory, as we do in title 6, we are ensuring that the job gets done. I would urge my colleagues to read the legislation. The legislation clearly states that the program is to assist in the transition to full NATO membership of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and any other European country emerging from Communist domination that is designated by the President, and so on and so forth.  The amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey [Mr. Torricelli], making the transition optional would make this entire section a sense-of-the-Congress resolution. Mr. Chairman, title 7 of the National Security Revitalization Act I believe provides a reasonable framework for addressing the concerns consistent with U.S. interests in ensuring stability in Europe. Very clearly delineated in the bill is a list of criteria, such as respect for democratic principles and human rights enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act, against which to evaluate the suitability of prospective candidates for NATO membership. In addition, it establishes a program to provide the emerging democracies with the necessary tools to facilitate their transition to full NATO membership, which, as I pointed out earlier, will ultimately be up to the members of NATO to decide.  Given the broad range of our political, economic, and security interests in Europe, strengthening new free markets and democracies in that region benefits the United States. Interestingly two of the most prominent members of the foreign policy establishment, Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski, are ardent supporters of the timely expansion of NATO.  Dr. Kissinger sees the existing vacuum as a threat, not only to NATO cohesion, but the very existence of NATO as a meaningful institution, and he writes, ``NATO expansion represents a balancing of two conflicting considerations the fear of alienating Russia against the danger of creating a vacuum in central Europe. A wise policy,'' he counsels, ``would proceed with the membership for Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and to reject a Russian veto.'' Dr. Kissinger concludes, ``NATO cannot long survive if the borders it protects are not threatened while it refuses to protect the borders of adjoining countries that do feel threatened.''  [[Page H1875]] Zbigniew Brzezinski recently urged NATO to formally declare its ``criteria for expansion and indicate which countries appear to meet them. This would end the counterproductive debates with Russia over whether NATO should expand. The longer this step is delayed, the more vociferous Moscow's objections are likely to be.''  Mr. Chairman, this is precisely the purpose of title 6 of the National Security Revitalization Act.  Rather than dodging the issue of NATO expansion, as it has largely done to date, the Clinton administration, should move on the membership issue before more time is lost. But that requires leadership. We must seize upon today's opportunities which could be gone tomorrow. A steady and deliberate course of action is one thing, obfuscation, which has characterized the Clinton administration's approach to date is another.  Russia, perhaps sensing a certain timidity within the administration, has sought to block NATO expansion. It is instructive to recall that the Soviet Union vehemently opposed German membership in NATO in 1955 and attempted to deny unified Germany continued participation in the Alliance. A democratic Russia has nothing to fear from a defensive alliance founded on democratic principles. It would be foolhardy and dangerous, as Henry Kissinger rightly pointed out, to give Russia a veto over NATO expansion, and, as Dr. Brzezinski observed, failure to act now will only make matters worse.  Let's look at the earlier inclusion of new countries. As my colleagues know, when we look at countries that were included into NATO, Greece and Turkey were hardly stellar democracies when they joined in 1952. I remind Members that Portugal, one of the founding members of NATO, was under a dictatorship in 1949. In this bill we lay out clear markers which we think have to be achieved before this program goes forward. We are trying to promote and push these countries in the direction of democracy, free markets, respect for human rights. I believe title 6, as a mandatory program, goes much further to ensure those objectives, and, hopefully, a safer world, rather than making this title a sense-of-the-Congress resolution by amending it to an optional program.                              {time}  1230
