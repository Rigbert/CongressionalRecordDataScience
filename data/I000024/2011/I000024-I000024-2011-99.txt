President, I have made four speeches on the floor in the last month about the disaster, the catastrophe that is taking place in a country in west Africa called Cote d'Ivoire. Cote d'Ivoire is a country whose President, the legitimate President, I might add, is Laurent Gbagbo, with his wife Simone. Someone named Alassane Quattara, from the northern part of Cote d'Ivoire, with a rigged election, came in; it was certified. It was all set up before we knew what was going on.  That individual's name is Quattara. His death squads today, this very moment as we speak, are roaming the streets of Abidjan in Cote d'Ivoire. He is murdering and he is raping. Right now they have in captivity Laurent Gbagbo, the legitimate President of Cote d'Ivoire. I think they are in the process of perhaps killing him right now. We don't know that. The State Department does not know it. No one knows it.  We had a hearing. The State Department was totally without compassion or concern over what is happening in the streets of Abidjan. We saw, we witnessed on video, the helicopters coming through and destroying that city. We have friends there right now who tell us that even today the death squads of Alassane Quattara are roaming the streets murdering people. No one can say within 10,000 people how many people they murdered.  My concern is it is too late to do anything about that. They rigged the election. I documented it. I sent the documentation to the State Department. They paid no attention to it. France was behind the whole thing. France wants to have as much control as they can of west Africa. They conned the United Nations into it and our State Department went along with it.  What is happening right now is so inhumane. I wish I had the pictures I showed before. The beautiful First Lady, Simone Gbagbo, is a beautiful lady, and they took her into captivity, pulled her hair out by the roots, and ran through the streets of Abidjan, holding up her hair in their hands. They are murdering everyone who is a friend of that administration.  Well, I have one plea right now. There are a lot of options on what they can do. They can murder the President and First Lady--and they are considering that now. They are trying to consider some way to make it look like suicide. I don't know what they are doing. The State Department doesn't know what they are doing. Unfortunately, the State Department doesn't even care what they are doing.  One of the options would be to allow the President and the First Lady and some who are close to go to another country in Sub-Saharan Africa and be able to stay in that country. We have already located host countries to allow that to take place.  So I am making an appeal right now. I can't get the Secretary of State to talk to me about it. I can't get anyone else but just a handful of people, but we need to do something and do something now--today. If we wait until after this recess, I would almost say their blood will be on the hands of the State Department because we can do something about it now. All we have to do is encourage the new, illegitimately elected President of Cote d'Ivoire--Alassane Ouattara--and his administration to give an opportunity for another state to host these two individuals. Quite frankly, I think that would be a very smart thing politically for him to do because with the other two options, we all know what happens. We know what martyrs are, and that is what would happen.  So this is, I guess, a final appeal to anyone who is sensitive to the torturing, raping, and murdering that is going on today to join me in encouraging the State Department, the United Nations, France, and Alassane Ouattara to turn over President and Mrs. Gbagbo to a host country for their asylum.  With that, I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Florida.                            Oil Speculation
