Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Dr. John H. Coleman, a longtime Toledo physician who was dedicated to his community.  Dr. Coleman was renowned for his empathy and giving nature. In every situation, Dr. Coleman's first concern was for others. Friends describe his attitude as always seeking to help others and improve the lives of those he has helped. Dr. Coleman's spirit was an inspiration to those who worked with him in Toledo, where he served as a family physician for many decades. In 1999 Dr. Coleman was awarded Family Physician of the Year by the Ohio Academy of Family Physicians, a testament to his skills as a doctor and also his leadership and stewardship.  Dr. Coleman taught at the former Medical College of Ohio and served on the Lucas County Children Services and Cordelia Martin Health Center Boards. These positions enabled him to shape the minds and embolden a new generation of physicians who continue to honor him by serving the Toledo community, including Dr. Imran Andrabi, now the president and chief executive of Mercy Health.  It is unsurprising that Dr. Coleman is held in such high esteem by his colleagues. His story is one that cannot be fabricated. Born in August, 1928, Dr. Coleman grew up in segregated Madison, Indiana, the grandson of a slave. At age fifteen he graduated from high school as the class valedictorian. Genius notwithstanding, Dr. Coleman also showed an early desire to serve his community and his country as a Captain in the Army Medical Corps.  Dr. Coleman will be dearly missed for his enduring kindness and dedication to his community. Dr. Coleman will now join his son David, who died in 1977. He is survived by his wife, Joan, children Michael, Jeffrey, and Linda, and eight grandchildren. His legacy will survive him in Toledo, where he has shaped the current medical landscape and done so much for the community at large, and for the African-American community as a path-breaking role model. We offer his family our prayers and hope that they find comfort in the wonderful memories of their beloved husband and father.                          ____________________
