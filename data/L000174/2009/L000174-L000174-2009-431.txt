Before we left on recess, the Republicans asked to hold them up for 2 weeks. I wish they had not because these are nominiees to vital positions in the Department of Justice. Only four Senators, after holding them up for 2 weeks, not allowing them to be there, only four Senators voted against Tony West to be head of the Civil Division. We now have Lanny Breuer to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. These are people who were voted out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously by Republicans and Democrats. I hope we have a similar vote. A rollcall has been requested on the Republican side, which is fine; they have that right. But I hope we will confirm this nomination also.
