Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 655, a resolution that honors the life and the accomplishments of Mrs. Coretta Scott King, her contributions as a leader in the struggle for civil rights, and express condolences to the King family on her passing.  Mrs. Coretta Scott King, wife of the late Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. was one of our country's most visible members of the civil rights movement, carrying on her husband's legacy with courage, wisdom and dignity. Her life serves as an example of her devotion to making our country, and the world, a better place.  Having experienced firsthand the evils of segregation, Mrs. Coretta Scott King dedicated herself to helping all Americans realize racial equality and justice. She committed herself to her education, earning valedictorian honors from Lincoln High School, earning a Bachelor of Arts from Antioch College, and earning a scholarship to the prestigious New England Conservatory of Music located in Boston, Massachusetts, where she eventually met her husband.  As the spouse and partner of the late Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Mrs. Coretta Scott King gained recognition in her own right, remaining active in the civil rights movement while devoting herself to her family.  Her steadfast devotion to her husband's legacy after his assassination helped bring his message of nonviolent change to millions of Americans. She led the campaign to recognize her late husband's birthday as a national holiday and to establish the Martin Luther King, Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, the first institution established in memory of an African American. This center also houses our country's largest archives of documents from the civil rights movement.  Mrs. King's commitment and devotion to equal justice should serve as a reminder of the foundation and principles upon which this country was founded and should inspire us all to work to ensure that these guarantees are recognized by all Americans.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in honoring Mrs. Coretta Scott King's life, her accomplishments and her contributions to our country by voting in favor of this resolution.                             General Leave
