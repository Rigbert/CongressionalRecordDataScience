Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of an incredible person. I do so, on behalf of myself, former Senators Ted Stevens and Frank Murkowski, the Community of Ketchikan, and the State of Alaska. It is my privilege to recognize Sherrie Slick of Ketchikan, Alaska, for her 25 years of dedicated service as staff to the Alaska Congressional Delegation.  Sherrie is a true community leader and has worked hard to represent the Alaska Congressional Delegation in our Ketchikan office. While we are sad to see her go, we wish her the best during her retirement and future endeavors.  The first thing that comes to mind when I think of Sherrie is her unfailing energy. She has been tireless in her dedication to constituents and her service to the Delegation. She is deeply tied to Ketchikan, and residents value her civic leadership. I am impressed at how Sherrie manages to take on so many projects--from charitable events to Delegation visits, and I always say that Sherrie is so involved that she seems to be in several places at once.  The Alaskans who visited Sherrie over the years, in need of assistance or to voice their opinion on legislation, found her to be both knowledgeable and welcoming. In fact, Sherrie was a staunch advocate for her fellow citizens.  Sherrie is also a great story-teller. I always looked forward to hearing from her about localhappenings when I visited Ketchikan. There was no better guide than Sherrie when members of the Delegation were in town.  To me, Sherrie is a friend, close advisor, and one of the best staffers I have had the pleasure of working with. I know Sherrie is looking forward to a lively retirement, particularly as a grandmother. I'm sure that she will continue to work hard, just as she has during her time serving the Delegation. Today, we remember Sherrie's accomplishments and know that she will achieve many more in the years to come.                          ____________________
