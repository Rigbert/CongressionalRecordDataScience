President, I want to associate myself with the remarks of the Senator from Minnesota. He has stated very well what is at stake--which is the future of the country through the future of individual students who have the opportunity to pursue higher education.  There is something else that I might add. This proposed increase in the Pell grant compliments some of the other provisions in this bill where the President has proposed higher education tax credits and tax deductions which will assist, I think, generally speaking middle- and upper-income Americans. This Pell proposal would be particularly effective in helping low-income working Americans, and also particularly effective in helping a new and growing category of students--not recent high school graduates but those people who through circumstance were forced in midlife to retrain themselves. And there are so many in this situation nowadays due to downsizing.  So for all of these reasons this is a very useful and critical step.  I thank again the Senator for yielding.
