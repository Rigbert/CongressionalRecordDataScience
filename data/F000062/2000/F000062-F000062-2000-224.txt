 President, today Senator DeWine and I are introducing a bill to provide funds to educational organizations to teach the history of the Holocaust. It is entitled the Holocaust Education Assistance Act. Cosponsoring the bill are Senators Smith of Oregon, Moynihan, Lautenberg, Schumer, Boxer, Wellstone, and Durbin.  This bill authorizes $2 million each year for fiscal years 2001-2005 for a competitive grant program under which schools, museums and other non-profit organizations could compete for grants to train teachers, conduct seminars and develop educational materials on the Holocaust. It is the companion bill to H.R. 3105, introduced by Representatives Maloney, Horn, Waxman, and others.  The Holocaust is one of the most horrific events in human history. In the 1930s and 1940s, the German Nazi regime systematically slaughtered more than 6,000,000 Jews and other minorities under the guise of achieving a ``racially pure'' society. Hopefully, this bill can help ensure that the next generation of Americans learns some of the crucial lessons of the Holocaust. The most fundamental of these lessons is that racial and ethnic-based hatred endangers each of us, and that the violation of one person's rights threatens the freedom of all of us.  Five states mandate that the Holocaust be taught in schools. They are California, Florida, Illinois, New Jersey and New York. Eleven others recommend or encourage teaching the Holocaust in school. They are Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and Washington. The bill is needed because most teachers have little training and few resources to teach the history of the Holocaust. This bill does not mandate anything, but it does create a funding source for schools and communities that choose to teach youngsters about this horrible chapter of human history.  In my state, the following groups support the bill:       Holocaust Center of Northern California.       Los Angeles City Human Relations Commission.       Simon Wiesenthal Museum of Tolerance.       The Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern      California.  The following national organizations support the Holocaust Education Assistance Act:       Agudath Israel of America.       American Gathering of Jewish Holocaust Survivors.       American Jewish Committee.       American Society for Yad Vashem, Inc.       Anti-Defamation League.       Association of Holocaust Organizations.       Braun Holocaust Institute.       Facing History and Ourselves.       Hatikvah Holocaust Education Resource Center.

Religious Action Center for Reform Judaism.       Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance.       United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism.       World Jewish Congress.  The following regional organizations support the Holocaust Education Assistance Act:       Florida Holocaust Museum.       Hawaii Holocaust Center.       Holocaust Memorial Foundation of Illinois.       Holocaust Memorial Resource and Education Center of Central      Florida.       Holocaust Resource Center & Archives, Queensboro Community      College.       Jewish Community Relations Council of Greater Philadelphia.       Jewish Community Relations Council of New York.       New Mexico Holocaust and Intolerance Museum and Study      Center.       Tennessee Holocaust Commission.       Tennessee Jewish Federation.       West Virginia Holocaust Education Commission.  As we enter the new century, we must remain vigilant to ensure that we do not forget the lessons of the last century. The admonition that ``those who forget history are doomed to repeat it'' is as true today as ever. After the Holocaust, survivors and others vowed not to let another such tragedy go unchallenged. Rallying behind the cry: ``Never again!'', Holocaust survivors made a promise to the memories of their mothers, fathers, husbands, wives and children. This bill provides a way for us to join with Holocaust survivors in keeping that promise. It ensures that future generations of Americans will remember that bigotry against any group poses a menace to society at large, and that the violation of an individual's rights places every person's freedom in peril.  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.                          ____________________
