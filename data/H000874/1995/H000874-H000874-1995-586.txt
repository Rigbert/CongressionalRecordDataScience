Speaker, let me ask the gentleman two questions that relate to the original announcement made by the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon], the committee chairman.  First of all, the gentleman mentioned legislating on an appropriation bill. Am I correct that the intent of the Committee on Rules will be to protect that legislation that is on the bill as it was reported by the committee?
