Chairman, H.R. 4276, the Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year 1999, includes funding for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Last year the Science Committee and the full House passed H.R. 1274, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Authorization Act of 1997. H.R. 1274 includes authorizations of $621 million for NIST and $7 million for the Technology Administration (TA) for FY 1999. H.R. 4276 largely follows those authorizations by funding NIST at $624 million, and TA at $7 million for FY 1999.  As did the authorization, this bill gives priority to NIST's core laboratory functions, including a $4 million increase over the FY 1998 appropriated level for the Scientific and Technical Research and Services (STRS) account. STRS funds NIST's laboratories and the Baldrige Quality Awards. While the increase is less than the authorization, the increase is a recognition that running NIST's laboratory programs is the agency's most important function.  By contrast, H.R. 4276 includes a $12 million decrease in funding for the Advanced Technology Program (ATP), reducing the program to $180 million from the FY 1998 funding level of $192 million. While H.R. 1274 phased-down ATP funding from the $225 million appropriation in FY 1997 to $150 million in FY 1999, the trajectory of ATP's funding in H.R. 4276, if not the speed of its decline, is in keeping with the authorization.  With respect to the Technology Administration, H.R. 4276 includes funding for the Experimental Program to Stimulate CompetitiveTechnology (EPSCoT) despite the fact that the program was specifically not authorized by H.R. 1274. As expressed in the Science Committee's report accompanying H.R. 1274, I continue to have concerns that once EPSCoT is established, it will grow substantially beyond the $2.1 million contained in H.R. 4276. The program, which was initiated last year and has done little with its $1.6 million FY 1998 appropriation, is now slated to receive a 31% increase. Even with the increased funding, it seems unlikely EPSCoT will be able to help the 18 states it is designed to assist. I hope that EPSCoT is not allowed to grow into another very expensive Administration technology initiative.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 4276 also includes funding for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).  Without the benefit of the increased revenues from a non-existent tobacco settlement, and notwithstanding the very tight budget caps, Chairman Rogers and the Appropriations Committee have managed to increase funding for high-priority programs, most importantly local warnings and forecasts within the National Weather Service.  This was made possible in part after an agreement was reached by the Appropriations Committee, the Science Committee and Secretary Daley to maintain the $550 million budget cap on the Advanced Weather Interactive Processing System (AWIPS) weather modernization program.  I am also pleased that report language in the bill echoes the Science Committee's concern over adequate weather radar coverage for northwest Pennsylvania. I hope during the new fiscal year that NOAA will see the light and place a National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NEXRAD) system in this area that is so obviously necessary.
