 President, I rise today to pay special recognition to two young Alabamians who made the journey to Washington D.C. this summer to learn about and celebrate America's heritage. Erica Brasher, who is 15, and Samuel Brasher, who is 12, spent 2 weeks in Washington and Northern Virginia traveling to the many historical sites located throughout the area. Most importantly, they were chosen for the honor of raising the flag at Mount Vernon on the Fourth of July. For this distinction, they received special citations which commemorated the annual celebration. Erica and Samuel Brasher's trip also included visits to Williamsburg, Harper's Ferry, and the many museums and monuments located in Washington, D.C. Upon their return home, a terrific account of Erica and Samuel's trip was written in their local newspaper, the Shelby County Reporter.  Erica and Samuel Brasher are both grandchildren of Howard and Pattie Brasher of Shelby County. Samuel is also the grandson of Tom and Chestine Cardin of Columbiana. Erica is also the granddaughter of Corinne Williams and the late Bob Williams of Shelby and the daughter of the late Martha Williams-Brasher. I had the chance to meet these two wonderful children when they visited, and I was proud to see young Alabamians so interested in American history.                          ____________________
