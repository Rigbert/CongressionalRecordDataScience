President, Patty Stonesifer's leadership and experience in the corporate sector, coupled with her committed philanthropic work, helped the Smithsonian secure major grants from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to create an endowment to expand youth access to the Smithsonian; to support the construction of the National Museum of African American History and Culture; and to support interdisciplinary scholarship and projects to address the Smithsonian's Four Grand Challenges of ``Understanding the American Experience, Valuing World Cultures, Understanding and Sustaining a Bio-diverse Planet, and Unlocking the Mysteries of the Universe.'' Her service helped advance the very mission of the Smithsonian, and her commitment to public service continues today through her work at Martha's Table.
