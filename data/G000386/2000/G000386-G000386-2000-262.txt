 President, every young person in our country should have the opportunity to grow and learn in an environment that is free of drugs and violence. This is the type of environment Safe and Drug Free Schools promotes.  With the recent results of the annual Monitoring the Future study, it is obvious that we need to continue to provide our young people with effective programs, such as Safe and Drug Free Schools, to assure positive learning environments. This year Monitoring the Future reported that nearly 55 percent of our high school seniors have used an illicit drug in the past month. In addition, the study found that nearly 50 percent of high school seniors have used marijuana in 1999 and this percentage has remained unchanged in 1998, as well as 1997. Sadly, the study also found that the percentage of 10th graders who reported use of marijuana increased from 39.6 percent in 1998 to nearly 41 percent in 1999. With these discouraging drug use and abuse trends, it is clear that we need to use every resource available for anti-drug efforts.  Safe and Drug Free Schools provides our state and local education agencies with the funding necessary to implement effective, research-based programs that prevent and reduce violence and substance abuse in our schools. Studies show a high correlation between drug use and availability and school violence. We need to create a drug-free environment to promote a safe environment.  In fact, many states have reported decreases in incidents of violence and drug use because of Safe and Drug Free Schools funds. It is imperative that we continue to provide our communities with the resources necessary to protect our children from violence and drugs.With our leadership and support, it is certain that these disturbing trends of drug use and increasing school violence will be reduced. I am committed to providing our young people with a positive learning environment free of drugs and safe from harm.
