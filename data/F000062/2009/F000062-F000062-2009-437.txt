 We are both westerners. We did sit together for about 8 years on the committee. As such, I have had a chance to discuss a great deal about this topic. It is a matter of very deep conscience and a sense of values of everything this Nation stands for, the thing that sets us apart from many other countries who pick people up and do horrible things to them. We don't do that. We have always had such pride in that. The Senator hit a nail on the head. People may talk, but they can say anything they want. It is not necessarily valuable. It is not necessarily actionable intelligence. Sometimes it might be. But there are other ways of doing this and not sacrificing the values we hold dear. The nearest tool to achieve that is the Army Field Manual.  It has been great for me to work with the Senator from Oregon, and I look forward to working with him in the future. I thank him very much.  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.
