These Veneta Elementary School students are 2008 National ExploraVision winners. The team earned first place in the grade 4-6 division for designing an underwater energy generator to harness the power of ocean waves.  The team accepted the challenge of this extracurricular activity with enthusiasm, determined to create a technology for clean energy generation that was simple and cost-effective. They were supported and encouraged by their teacher and project coach, Michelle Beller, and Mentor Scottie Barnes. Their working prototype, the Wavemaster, successfully fused science, technology, and imagination, and it worked!  ExploraVision, now in its sixteenth year, is sponsored by the National Science Teachers Association and Toshiba. The competition highlights the natural curiosity and creativity of kids. The student projects showcase their innate desire to explore, experiment, invent, and ask really good questions.  Congratulations to Steven, Connor, Tucker, and Cooper for their outstanding achievement. I am proud to represent these young Oregon scientists and excited about the potential of the Wavemaster.                          ____________________
