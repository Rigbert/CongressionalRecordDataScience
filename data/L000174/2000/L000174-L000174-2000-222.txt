President, today I would like to mark the end of an era in Vermont. Jeff Kaufman, host of Vermont's award-winning program, ``The Talk of Vermont,'' will hang up his headphones at the end of this week. After 5 years on the air in Middlebury, Jeff and his family are leaving the Green Mountain State for the arguably less green pastures of Southern California.  A fixture on Vermont morning radio and a catalyst for thoughtful and provocative discussion of the key issues facing our state and nation, Jeff has not only brought wit and wisdom to the airwaves, but he has consistently managed to recruit big-name guests--Lily Tomlin, Ted Williams, Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist--to our small-market corner of the world, while never neglecting lesser-known local voices. Above all else, Jeff does his homework--he is equally adept at understanding the intricacies of missile defense as he is the physics of baseball.  While living in Middlebury, Jeff did not just entertain his listeners on the radio, but he became a valued member of the community, whether it was raising money for flood victims or serving as a member of the Citizens of Middlebury.  I am certain that I speak for my colleagues in the Vermont Congressional delegation--each of us has had the pleasure of Jeff's unique brand of inquisition--when I say that he will be a tough act to follow. He has provided an extraordinary service to Vermonters who have benefitted from his professionalism, his insights and his curiosity. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jeff for a job well done and to wish him and his family well in every future endeavor.  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record a profile of Jeff from The Burlington Free Press, dated July 23, 2000.  The material follows:            [From the Burlington Free Press, July 23, 2000]     Radio's Inventive ``Talk of Vermont'' Is About To Grow Silent                          (By Chris Bohjalian)       It is an overcast weekday morning smack in the center of      summer. It is hot and sticky, and there's absolutely nothing      in the air that might be mistaken for a breeze.       I am leaning against the side of a gazebo in Middlebury      during the town's annual celebration on the green, waiting      for Jeff Kaufman, host of the WFAD radio show ``The Talk of      Vermont,'' to arrive. The show is about to broadcast live      from the commons.       Abruptly, a slim guy with hair the color of sand just after      the surf has receded coasts across the grass on a bicycle      with a copy of one of my books under his arm. He says      something I can't hear to the engineer, who is battling with      miles of wires and the sort of microphone that I thought      existed only in radio and television museums, and the      engineer laughs. Then he turns to me and introduces himself.       This is Kaufman, and no more than 90 seconds later--still      without breaking a sweat, despite the heat and his last-     minute arrival--he has me seated in a folding metal chair,      and we are on the air. It is clear within minutes that he not      only has read my most recent novel, be has read the ones that      preceded it. All of them. He has read the column I write for      this newspaper. He has read a surprising number of the      articles I have written for different magazines.       You have no idea how rare this is.       I have done easily a hundred-plus radio and television      interviews in my life, and the vast majority of the time the      very first question I am asked is this: ``So, tell us about      your new book.'' The reason? There is a not a soul in the      studio other than me, including the person with whom I am      speaking, who has the slightest idea what the book is      about.       In truth, why should they? How could they? Think of the      number of guests who pass through a radio or television talk      show every week. It's huge, and it takes time to read a      novel.       Almost every weekday morning for the better part of a      decade, Kaufman has done his homework on his guests and then      offered the state some of the very best radio in Vermont.      Sometimes his show has been broadcast on five stations, and      sometimes it has been on only one, but it has never affected      the first-rate quality of the program.       It was three years ago that I met Kaufman on the commons in      Middlebury, and I have come to discover that day in, day out      he corralled terrific guests. Lily Tomlin one day, Ted      Williams the next. One morning he might be moderating a live      debate between U.S. Senate hopefuls Jan Backus and Ed      Flanagan, and the next he might be chatting with Middlebury      biographer, poet and novelist Jay Parini about--basketball.       On any given day, he was as likely to have an acrobat from      the Big Apple Circus performing--literally--on the stool in      his studio as he was to have an expert from Washington, D.C.,      on the proposed ``Star Wars'' missile defense system.       Now, alas, we are about to begin Kaufman's last week. He      and his family are leaving for California in early August,      and Kaufman will no longer be a fixture on Vermont radio.      There is no question in my mind that this is a real loss--and      not simply because Kaufman is a first-rate interviewer and      radio personality. He was also a part of the community. He      used his show to find food and clothes for those families      that had to leave their homes after the summer flood of 1998,      and to raise money to help build a new Lincoln Library.       Sometimes I wonder if Kaufman had the ratings he deserved,      but regardless of whether he had 12 or 1,200 people tuned in,      he never gave his audience a small-market effort.       Happy trails, my friend. We'll miss you.                          ____________________
