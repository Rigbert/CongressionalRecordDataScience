Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The committee does have a great tradition of bipartisanship. It is hard to get partisan about our crumbling infrastructure and the needs for enhanced investment, but one of the keys toward enhancing the investment and dealing with the $68 billion--B, billion--backlog of authorized Corps projects--$68 billion--is to use a tax which is collected from shippers and passed on to the American people. Every day you buy a good from a foreign country, you are paying a little bit more for that under an agreement that the money collected will be used to maintain our harbors, our ports, keep them from silting in, and construct critical infrastructure.  Unfortunately, for years Congress has been diverting part of that money every year. Today there is a theoretical balance of over $9 billion in the nonexistent harbor maintenance trust fund. Look through the entire budget of the United States. You won't find that money anywhere on deposit. But they are saying: oh, don't worry, don't worry, we will get around to spending it some day.  I have been working on this issue for 20 years, starting with Bud Shuster in 1996. It was in the bill, and it passed out of committee unanimously with a number of Republicans and Democrats supporting it, obviously a majority of Republicans on the bill. The chairman and I had an agreement that would bring this bill forward under a suspension of the rules. His leadership objected to that. And then instead, they dictated there should be a rule so that they could strip out the harbor maintenance trust fund.  Now, what kind of rule is it that says we passed a law, we are collecting money from the American people, every day they are paying a little bit more for stuff, but the rules say we can't spend that money for its lawful purpose, we are going to spend it on some other part of government or disappear it into a lose-or-eat deficit reduction. We need that money. We need those investments.  If this continues--right now it is about $400 million a year that is being collected that isn't being spent, yet we have harbors shoaled in, we have jetties that are failing all across America--it will grow up to $20 billion in 10 years. Now tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow we are going to fix this problem. No, this was the time to fix it. It was in the bill. It was bipartisan. It was unanimous, and it was stripped out. That is very, very unfortunate.  There are many good things in this bill. There are many projects that are essential. But, again, the Corps of Engineers has a $68 billion backlog. So all we are doing is putting people in an endless line--$68 billion backlog. We are collecting about $1.6 billion a year to make those projects a reality except that $400-, $500 million of it is being diverted over into other parts of the government. That is not a good way to run the government like a business.  I have a letter from the Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America concerned that this money is revenue from American business that is not being used for its intended purpose in a timely manner, and they will continue to advocate for this provision, among others. I am very, very saddened that this was removed from the bill. It is not in the Senate bill, so it becomes nonconferenceable, which means it will be at least 2 years. That is another $800 million or $1 billion that won't be spent, but taxes will still be collected from the American people.  Secondly, we have made a big deal around here about not having any earmarks. Big deal. Well, there are some ancient earmarks out there still lingering in the darkness. One was for a $220 million project which was earmarked in 2004 by the Committee on Appropriations, and that would have required the Federal Government to spend $110 million. This bill authorizes that project at a price of $526.5 million to the U.S. taxpayers. It has gone from $220 million earmarked, $110 million to the Feds, to a total project cost of $800 million.  Now, associated with that--and I am being told: don't worry, this isn't Federal money. Well, whenever you enter into a project, you have to have a local cost share. And they are saying: well, it will only be local money. Except it is included in the project, meaning the local entity isn't meeting its cost share for the authorized project which is in this bill. In fact, they are diverting money locally from their cost share into recreation projects.  Now, we have harbors silting in and jetties that are falling apart all across the country. We are diverting money from the trust fund, and yet somehow we are going to find $500 million for this project up from a price tag of $110 million when it was first earmarked. It isn't earmarked by any other name except that it is covered by the rule, and it is in this bill.  I regret that this bill does not meet the high standards of the committee and the historical standards of the committee.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.                              {time}  1700
