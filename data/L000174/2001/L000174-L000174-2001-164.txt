President, I know there are several Senators who wish to speak. I will quickly yield the floor.  While the Imam is still here, I join Senator Reid in welcoming him to the Senate Chamber. Of course, I thank Dr. Ogilvie for making him available as a visiting Chaplain. It provides an example of the nature of the United States where we do not subscribe to one religion but have the advantage of many religions; the fact that our country has been stronger and better for that, thatwe make the Nation available to all religions and respect all religions and an individual's right to practice the religion they choose.  We were honored this morning by having the Imam here at the opening of our session. He demonstrated to our Nation that we are a diverse nation, diverse in our heritage. We are all either children or grandchildren or great grandchildren of immigrants, certainly in my family, my mother and my wife, first-generation Americans, speaking in a different language than English until they learned English. But we are also so different in all our religions. Look across the Senate floor. There are a number of different religions represented right here. We have Mormons, Protestants, Jews, and Catholics. It is a wonderful example of the diversity of this Nation. So I was pleased to hear Senator Reid's comments. I associate myself with them. I thank the Imam for opening our session.
