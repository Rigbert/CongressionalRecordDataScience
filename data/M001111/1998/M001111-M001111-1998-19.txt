 President, I rise to address a bill introduced earlier this week called the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998. This bill takes the best ideas and puts them to work providing Americans with the tools they need to make their families safer, their communities healthier, and their schools freer from violence.  I know all of us would like a simple solution to the crime problems facing this great nation. But all of us know, in our hearts, that there is no easy solution. We must come together, join with our neighbors, our police, our leaders, and our children to tackle the terrifying problems facing us.  We must be tough on criminals. We need to continue to send the message that if you do the crime, you will be doing time--hard time. No one can accuse the U.S. justice system of coddling criminals. We have among the highest percentage of our population in prison, more than almost any other country in the world.  In the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994, which I supported, we strengthened penalties for violent, and drug-related crime. We also provided grants to states to build jails and prisons if they required serious violent offenders to serve at least 75 percent of their sentences. We've hired more than 75,000 new police officers to implement to time-tested program of community policing. Our crime bill has worked.  Now we need more of the same. We need to extend the Violent Crime Reduction Trust fund to pay for these important community-policing and grants to state and local government.  We need to extend the Violence Against Women Act. Preventing domestic violence and providing a safe haven for victims of domestic violence has been a top priority for me. I intend to introduce legislation to ensure victims of domestic violence are not further victimized through insurance, job or social security discrimination. Should this bill be considered by the Senate, I would seek to amend it by adding provisions of my Battered Women Economic Security Act to it.  Another top priority for me in this bill is reducing crime in our schools. As a parent and former educator, I share America's horror that our children are not safe in their schools. We simply must invest time and resources into solving this fundamental problem. This bill will provide an additional $10 million for the Safe and Drug Free School program and establish partnerships between schools and local law enforcement. Through my Senate Advisory Youth Involvement team, I am learning from students how they believe we can best solve school violence problems. I will be sharing those ideas with my colleagues when we debate this bill.  In my meetings with law enforcement officers around my state, I learned we have some critical problems in our juvenile justice system. While I believe juvenile justice is fundamentally an issue for our state legislatures to address, there is a federal role in several areas. First, we often should treat those 16 and 17-year-olds who commit violent federal offenses as adults. This bill gives prosecutors important discretion to prosecute these offenders as adults.  In addition to getting tough on our most hardened young criminals, we must replicate successful juvenile crime reduction strategies. There aremany efforts in my state of Washington that bring out the best in kids and communities and they are truly making a dent in the juvenile crime problem. Best SELF in Skagit county; Teamchild in King county; community justice in Spokane county and on the Colville Indian Reservation; Safestreets in Seattle; and TOGETHER! in Thurston county are several examples of communities joining together to make a difference with their youth. It's amazing how far just a few thousand dollars can go in these community-based programs; they need our continued support.  Mr. President, this bill also targets gangs, illegal drugs, and domestic and international terrorism. It extends a recently-passed bill I strongly supported, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Act, and provides other safeguards for our law enforcement officers. It reauthorizes the Drug Czar's office, which coordinates the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area program that is helping establish a coordinated campaign against drug importation and use while also focusing resources of prevention and treatment of abuse.  No bill is perfect and I cannot say I agree with every provision included in this 1220-page bill. However, the Safe Schools, Safe Streets, and Secure Borders Act of 1998 continues to move this country in the right direction. Violent crime must continue to drop. With all of us joining together to fight crime and embrace healthy communities and schools, America can again become a safe place to raise and educate all of our children.  I thank Senator Leahy for his fine leadership on this bill and encourage all Senators to work to pass comprehensive, bi-partisan legislation to prevent crime and strengthen families and communities.                          ____________________
