 Speaker, the key issue under debate now is not whether we balance the budget in 6 years or 7 years or 8 years. They key issue is how we balance the budget, whether we balance it in a fair and just way or whether we balance it on the backs of the weakest and most vulnerable people in our society, the elderly, the children, the working people, and the poor.  In my view, instead of cutting Medicare, we should cut the $125 billion a year we give in tax breaks and subsidies to the big corporations and the wealthy, which is corporate welfare. Instead of cutting back on Medicaid and veterans' needs, we should cut back on the B-2 bombers and star wars and the other military spending that is unnecessary and not asked for by the Pentagon.  Instead of cutting back on education and student loans, we should make absolutely certain that at a time when the rich are becoming richer, we do not give 1 penny of tax breaks to the wealthy or the large corporations.                          ____________________
