 Mr. President, I came to the floor to talk about education. I was a little surprised we were talking about banking since we haven't been able to talk about a lot of education issues that are critical to parents, students and teachers across the country.  I ask my colleague from Texas what his intent is on this amendment. I know we are expected to go to a vote shortly. There are a number of us here who did want to talk about education before a vote occurred. Do you intend to vote in the next several minutes without yielding any Democratic time?
