Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to my friend Joyce Watts.  After 40 years as Allegan County Clerk and Register, this past December Joyce made the tough decision to hang it up and retire.  She did so as the longest-serving elected county clerk in the entire state of Michigan and simply put one of the most dedicated public servants our great state has ever seen.  Joyce juggled many duties in her career. Before she was clerk-register, she was register of deeds for 12 years. She also served on the board of directors of the National Association of County Recorders and Clerks.  Joyce always impressed me with her professionalism, work-ethic, and tireless advocacy on behalf of our corner of the state. Joyce was someone you could trust to get the job done right. And as a clerk handling elections, it's absolutely imperative you have someone of her character and integrity serving in that position.  There is no doubting her passion and commitment. But above all, Joyce was a wife, mother, and a friend to me and countless others in our Allegan community.  And so, I want to wish Joyce, her husband John, and their son Jason and his wife Lesley best of luck in the coming years and I look forward to remaining close friends.                          ____________________
