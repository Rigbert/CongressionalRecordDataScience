 As a result, the President has now proposed some modest spending reductions totaling a fraction--a fraction--of a percent of the trillions his budget would add to the debt.  Well, that is a start, but with Democrats in Congress adding to the national debt at a rate of more than $100 billion every month already this year, and with a budget that triples the already unsustainable public debt over the next decade, it is clear there is not much more we can do to protect our children and grandchildren from the unprecedented trillions in additional debt proposed by this administration.  Madam President, I yield the floor.
