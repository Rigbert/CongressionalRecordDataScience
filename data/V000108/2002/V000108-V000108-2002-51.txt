Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to congratulate Saint Adalbert Roman Catholic Church in Whiting, Indiana, as it commemorates its 100th anniversary as a congregation on April 14, 2002. This parish has been celebrating its centennial for the past year with monthly festivities, and each event has strengthened the sense of community among the church members, united through their Baptismal bonds. The culmination of this revelry will be the jubilee Mass celebrated by Bishop Dale J. Melczek and will include Father Michael Blastic, who will deliver the invocation, and Father Steven Gross, who will serve as toastmaster.  During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the United States became home to more than 20 million European immigrants who brought with them the rich cultural heritage of their homelands. Northwest Indiana pulsed with the influx of Slavic immigrants who settled along the shores of Lake Michigan, eager to make their impact on the region. Throughout the region, the imprint of the Slovak and Polish cultures remain yet today, and are evident in the names these Hoosiers bear and in the traditions passed down from each generation. The most significant contribution to the area, however, has been the establishment of parish churches.  Early Polish Catholics had to travel to neighboring communities throughout Indiana and Illinois in order to worship. In 1902, with the bishop's approval, Whiting's Poles purchased land and constructed a wooden church on Indianapolis Boulevard. First known as St. Peter, the church was later renamed St. Adalbert to honor the congregation's Polish heritage. This simple structure born out of the devotion to their culture and to their faith became the foundation for new generations of Polish Catholics to discover the bonds that bind them together as a spiritual family.  Over the past 100 years, St. Adalbert has been served by many able leaders who have ensured the congregation's spiritual growth and cultural heritage were not compromised as it evolved structurally with each passing decade. Father Peter Budnik was St. Adalbert's first pastor, who established the parish school. St. Adalbert experienced significant growth under Father John Skrzypinski. As the acting pastor from 1911 to 1922, he expanded the service of St. Adalbert's to include a convent for the sisters of Nazareth, which housed the sisters for sixty years, an addition to the school, and the construction of a new rectory. Later, in 1950, Father Walter Pawlicki supervised the construction of the present church, which was completed in 1953.  The church and its members have remained steadfast in its promise to assist those friends less fortunate than they. The St. Hedwig's Society, a society for women, was founded in 1904. Among their philanthropic causes, they donated their time and energy to the church and the school, as well as to homes for the aged, and assisting relief funds for Polish orphans. In 1942, the Holy Name Society was established and was instrumental in providing morale to members overseas fighting on the battlegrounds in World War II. During the 1930's, the St. Adalbert Choir became associated with the Polish Singers Alliance of America. This choir, which was dedicated to the enrichment of Polish musical culture, was recognized as one of the most active singing groups in the alliance.  Father John Zemelko, the current pastor, has imparted this philosophical mustering to his congregation: ``We live in a world that is coming together as a human family. There's no doubt that, if the world exists another 100 years, the human family will become more united than it is today. This of course, will be a reality if, and only if, the Church and other world religions continue to foster a respect and dignity of the culture of life.'' It is this respect and dignity of the culture of life that has sustained St. Adalbert for the past 100 years. As we ourselves advance into this brave new world heralded by the dawn of the twenty-first century, perhaps we might all reflect upon the unity of the human family for whom Father Zemelko is so optimistic, and find opportunities to foster respect and dignity for all in our own lives.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me today in commending the parish family of St. Adalbert as they prepare to celebrate the 100th anniversary of their founding. All past and present parishioners and pastors should be proud of the numerous contributions they have made out of their love and their devotion for their church.                          ____________________
