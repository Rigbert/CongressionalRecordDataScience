We didn't ask him how he would rule on a particular case. We asked him, on deciding cases, to explain his position on an accepted standard of law. We could not and should not and I don't think any Member would ask him how he would rule on a specific case pending before the Court. That is way beyond the bounds.  Let me just say, though, this is an interesting thing on which I think my colleague might reflect. This comes from the Legal Times of April 2002. It's a quote:       President George W. Bush's judicial nominees received some      very specific confirmation advice last week: Keep your mouth      shut. Justice Scalia called DC Circuit Judge Silberman at one      point, the latter recalled, and told him he was about to be      questioned about his views about Marbury v. Madison, the      nearly 200-year-old case that established the principle of      judicial review.  That's almost the first case--McCulloch v. Maryland and Marbury v. Madison--the first two cases you'll ever read in constitutional law. Listen to what Silberman told him.       ``I told him as a matter of principle he should not answer      that question either,'' Silberman said.  So you understand we are not just dealing with my interpretation as to whether or not Miguel Estrada is cooperative; we are dealing with a strategy: Keep your mouth shut. Don't tell the Senate, don't tell the American people, don't put on the record who you are and what you believe. Zip your mouth, hold tight, wait for the vote, and we will give you a lifetime appointment to the second highest court of the land. I don't think that is a fair way to approach this process.
