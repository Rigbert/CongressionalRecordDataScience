. Senate recently approved a 1-year extension of the expiring provisions of the Patriot Act with a voice vote. The extension was subsequently approved by the House and signed into law by President Obama. As I have argued for years that the Patriot Act is in need of serious reform, I would like to outline the changes I will keep working for as a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.  Many of my colleagues who agree with me that reforms are needed think it would be difficult to have a constructive debate on domestic surveillance in the Senate right now. They think that next year will be a better time to have this debate, and that waiting will lead to a better opportunity to restore the best possible balance between fighting terrorism ferociously and protecting American rights and freedoms.  Personally, I think that the reforms I am outlining today should have been made years ago. But based on the debate on the Patriot Act that took place in the Senate Judiciary Committee last fall, I agree that those of us who believe in reform need to spend more time making our case to our colleagues and the American people. So I will briefly address those reforms that I think are necessary, and the ways that I would like to see this debate move forward between now and next February, when these provisions will come up for renewal again.  The three expiring provisions all involve domestic surveillance in one way or another. One regards the use of roving wiretaps for intelligence purposes, one regards the surveillance of so-called ``lone wolf'' terrorist suspects, and one involves government access to business records. I have cosponsored legislation that would create additional safeguards on the use of roving wiretaps, and I think that it is appropriate to debate whether the ``lone wolf'' statute should be reformed or repealed, particularly given the fact that it has never been used. But it is the business records provision, section 215 of the Patriot Act, which I believe is most in need of reform.  Section 215 of the Patriot Act is referred to as the ``business records'' provision, but it actually covers any personal information that is held by any sort of institution or third party--including banks, hospitals, libraries, and retail stores of all types. And it doesn't just apply to documents; it applies to ``any tangible thing'', which means it covers things like blood or tissue samples as well.  Prior to 9/11, if the FBI or another government agency was conducting an intelligence investigation and wanted to obtain an individual's personal records from the business or institution that was holding them, the government agency had to have evidence indicating that the person whose records they wanted was a terrorist or a spy. Section 215 of the Patriot Act lowered this standard to permit the government to collect any records deemed ``relevant to an investigation''.  ``Relevant'' is an incredibly broad standard. In fact, it could potentially permit the government to collect the personal information of large numbers of law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism whatsoever.  As an alternative to ``relevance'', I and other senators have advocated for what I call the ``nexus to terrorism'' standard. Under this standard, the government could use the Patriot Act to obtain any records pertaining to a terrorist suspect, or the suspect's activities, or any individual that the suspect has been in contact with or directlylinked to in any way. This is a much broader standard than the one that existed before 9/11, and it would give the FBI and other government agencies significant flexibility in terrorism investigations. But it is much tighter than the standard that is currently written into law as part of the Patriot Act, and it would greatly reduce potential intrusions on the privacy of law-abiding Americans.  Switching to a ``nexus to terrorism'' standard is not a radical proposal. In 2005, the Senate passed a bill that would have replaced the ``relevance'' standard with one requiring a ``nexus to terrorism''. In fact, this bill was passed by unanimous consent. And President Obama cosponsored similar legislation in 2007. So this proposal has received significant bipartisan support in the past. And in my judgment, it would go a long, long way toward restoring the balance between security and freedom that is so important to Americans.  I have cosponsored legislation that would make ``nexus to terrorism'' the standard for accessing individuals' business records for intelligence purposes. Over the next year, I will continue to argue for the merits of this standard. I will also continue to press for more transparency about how the Patriot Act has actually been interpreted and applied in practice. As I have said before, there is key information that is relevant to the debate on the Patriot Act that is currently classified. Over the past two and a half years, I have pressed the executive branch to declassify this information in a responsible way, so that members of Congress and the public can have an informed debate about what the law should actually be.  I have raised this issue numerous times, in classified letters and in meetings with high-level Administration officials. Many of these classified letters were also signed by other senators, including Senator Feingold and Senator Durbin. In a partial response to our requests, the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence have prepared a classified paper that contains details about how some of the Patriot Act's authorities have actually been used, and this paper is now available to all members of Congress, who can read it in the Intelligence Committee's secure office spaces.  Providing this classified paper to Congress is a good first step, and I would certainly encourage all of my colleagues to come down to the Intelligence Committee and read it, but by itself this step does not go nearly far enough. Ensuring that members of Congress have information about how the law has been interpreted and applied is obviously essential, but it is just as essential for the public to have this information as well. Most members of the public do not expect to have detailed information about how intelligence collection is actually conducted, but they do expect to understand the boundaries of what the law does and does not allow, so that they can ratify or reject the decisions that public officials make on their behalf.  I am particularly concerned about this because I believe that there is a discrepancy between what most Americans believe is legal and what the government is actually doing under the Patriot Act. In my view, any discrepancy of this sort is intolerable and untenable, and can only be fixed by greater transparency and openness. This is why I think it is so important for the executive branch to declassify the information that I have asked them to take action on.  I expect that convincing the executive branch to take decisive action on this issue will not be easy, and that it will not happen quickly. But I have been engaged on this issue for two and a half years already, so I think it should be clear by now that I do not intend to give up. As Congress prepares to resume debate on the Patriot Act next year, I will continue to press the administration to find a way to release this information in a manner that serves the public interest and does not harm national security. And I hope that my colleagues will join me in this effort.                          ____________________
