Mr. President, my amendment would take the Finance Committee bill with its cuts to Medicare of about $115 billion and simply remove several provisions which I think jeopardize the long-term well-being and health of the Medicare system.  These provisions are: raising the age limit to 67; striking the home health care payment; it would add my amendment, the Medicare balanced billing protection; my amendment would also eliminate the provisions that means tests Medicare; and finally, it would eliminate the medical savings account.  This amendment would allow the Senate to vote for solvency of the Medicare system but not engage in some of these experiments that are in the Finance Committee bill, experiments which I think will weaken the overall system by driving healthy seniors away from Medicare and leaving the Medicare system to deal with very sick seniors, which is not a way to run a proper insurance program.  This measure, I believe, will restore solvency and allow a more comprehensive review of the Medicare system.
