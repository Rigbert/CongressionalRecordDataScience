Leader, I hope we are not going to give people the impression that a body that passed a bill 94 to 2 would not agree to us passing their bill because, frankly, I do not think that is the case.  I understand what you are saying, and I understand that they have been told you are not going to take the Senate bill; and, therefore, they need to go to conference. So they are bowing to practicality. What I am saying is we ought to bow to needs and to practicality and pass the bill. And I am saying to you that we can give you and will give you unanimous consent to do exactly that so that these folks can get that which they will not get, and that is, the additional payment which was provided for in the conference but not reported out of the conference, and, therefore, we are going to leave 200,000 armed services personnel not advantaged as others were in the bill.  We are going to leave 6\1/2\ million families with 12 million children not advantaged, as was the intent of the Senate, and I think most of the House.                          ____________________
