Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate an individual who found his spiritual calling, and was able to overcome many obstacles to help his community and to make life better for the citizens of Indiana's First Congressional District. Reverend Thomas C. McKinley of Gary, Indiana will be honored this Friday, July 20, 2001, at the Twentieth Century Missionary Baptist Church for earning his diploma of academic achievement from the State of Indiana.  Thomas C. McKinley came from a humble background and endured a troubled youth. However, his life was changed forever at the age of 17, when McKinley acknowledged his calling to the ministry. On October 15, 1980, he was ordained by the Indiana Christian Bible College. For the past ten years, Reverend McKinley has served as the spiritual shepherd for the Twentieth Century Missionary Baptist Church, located at 700 West 11th Avenue in Gary, Indiana.  Reverend McKinley has proven himself to be a selfless example to his congregation. He has been invaluable to the members of his community as both a teacher and evangelist, and particularly through his teaching ministry for stewardship. While a wonderful pastor, Reverend McKinley's leadership skills do not end with the spiritual realm; he has served as President of the Baptist Ministers' Conference of Gary, and as Treasurer of the Gary Police Chaplain Department.  While Reverend McKinley has selflessly served his community in Gary, his service to humanity has known no boundaries. In 1999, he spent a month in Honduras, completing two pilgrimages aiding hurricane victims with food, clothing, and medicine. Not only did he donate his own time and resources, he also organized other churches back home to assist many other Hondurans in need. His desire to help those overseas also led Reverend McKinley to serve as a missionary in Haiti.  Although Reverend McKinley gives much of his time to others, he is still a devoted family man. Nothing is more important to him than his supportive and beloved wife, Camellia, and his three daughters, Charletta, Charlotte, and Sabrina, and his son Russell.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Reverend Thomas C. McKinley for his commendable efforts towards improving himself, his family, his community, and the world. Reverend McKinley is to be admired for the wonderful example he has set for our community as a pastor, a father, and an involved citizen.                          ____________________
