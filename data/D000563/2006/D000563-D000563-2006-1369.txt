President, first, I commend Senators McCain and Kennedy, who are on the Senate floor. They have really pointed the way for a positive resolution of a problem we have faced for generations in America.  The immigration system in our country is seriously broken, and we know it. It is obvious, as we look at the number of undocumented people in America and as we consider, those of us in this line of work, all of the families who come to us with problems with the current system. There is so much unfairness, so much injustice. We can do better as a nation, a nation of immigrants.  Now the Senate will face a very clear and stark choice. Senator Frist brings to the floor an alternative. His is an alternative that focuses on enforcement.  Well, Senator Frist is not alone in believing we need to be better at enforcing the laws of our country. In fact, Senator Frist's bill and the bill I support--the one that came from the Senate Judiciary Committee, supported by Senator Specter, the chairman of the committee, inspired by Senators McCain and Kennedy in major part--is a bill which also focuses on enforcement.  Both bills double the size of the Border Patrol by adding 12,000 new agents. Both bills strengthen interior enforcement of immigration laws by adding 5,000 new immigration investigators. Both bills would take advantage of new technology to create a ``virtual fence'' at the border. Both bills would improve border controls by expanding entry-exit tracking. Both bills require the construction of new vehicle barriers and new permanent highway checkpoints near the border. The list goes on and on. The bills are the same when it comes to enforcement at our broken borders, as it should be.  But what the Frist bill does beyond that is what is clearly unacceptable, from my point of view, and was unacceptable in the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Frist bill continues the provision that was started in the House of Representatives which criminalizes those who are here in undocumented status and those who help them. That is where this bill, the Frist bill, crosses the line. That is why it is unacceptable. This concept was rejected in the Senate Judiciary Committee and should be rejected on the floor of the U.S. Senate.  Think about it for a moment. Are we serious that we are going to charge 12 million people with the crime that Senator Frist would create in his provision? Are we saying to people who are here in the United States under a myriad of different circumstances that they are going to be treated as criminals amongst us?  To what end? To arrest them, to apprehend them, to prosecute them, to incarcerate them? Of course, we can't do that. With 12 million people, it can't be done.  But by branding them as criminals at the outset, it is a guarantee they will never come out of the shadows. They will stay lurking as part of our culture, part of our economy in illegal status indefinitely. Criminalizing them is not the answer.  Sadly, the bill goes even further. In the instance of undocumented people amongst us, it would subject them to a misdemeanor subject to 6 months in jail, but it goes much further for the Good Samaritans who assist them. That is the most outrageous element of the Frist bill. It is harsh. It is not American.  Consider this for a moment. If a priest counsels a mother that she should remain in the United States with her children who happen to have been born here and are American citizens, that priest can be found guilty of an aggravated felony for having counseled her to stay in the United States. In the city of Chicago, which I am proud to represent, we have a domestic violence shelter, Mujeres Latinas en Accion. It is in a section known as Little Village. It is primarily a Mexican section of our city. Some are citizens; some are not. This domestic violence shelter brings in battered mothers and their children to protect them from their abusive, drunken husbands while they call the police department. The social workers who are standing at the door protecting those mothers and children would be subject to being charged with a felony under the Frist provisions. A nurse who offers to a mother at a medical clinic the advice that she should bring her child back, without checking to make certain she is not undocumented, could be charged with a felony. Is that where we are headed? Is that the kind of America we want to live in? I don't think so.  The Senate Judiciary Committee rejected that. Why Senator Frist continues to offer it, I don't know. I don't think it is consistent with the goal we all share. The goal we share is in repairing the system, better enforcement at the borders, better enforcement when it comes to employment so we will know if employers are exploiting the undocumented. That is part of real enforcement that will lead to fairness and justice in the way we deal with immigration.  There's another problem with the majority leader's bill. It would do nothing to address the situation of 12 million undocumented immigrants who currently live in our country. We need tougher enforcement, but in the Judiciary Committee bill we acknowledge something that the majority leader's bill does not: A strategy that focuses on enforcement only is doomed to failure.  Beyond that, the McCain-Kennedy bill, which is an inspired piece of legislation, would offer a chance for immigrants who work hard and play by the rules to earn their way to citizenship over the course of many years. This is not an amnesty. Amnesty says we forgive you. The McCain-Kennedy bill does not say that. The McCain-Kennedy bill says: If you are here undocumented for a variety of reasons, if you are here without legal status, there is a path you can follow. It is a long path, a demanding path, but at the end, you could end up in a legal position or have a chance. That is the best approach for us to use.  Let me tell you exactly what the McCain-Kennedy provisions would require in this path to legalization. It is not a free ride. It is not a get-out-of-jail-free card. Let me tell you what you would have to do during the course of an 11-year commitment on your part to finally reach citizenship: a clean criminal record, employment since before January 2004, remaining continuously employed during this period, paying approximately $2,000 in fines and fees, passing a security background check, passing a medical examination, learning English, learning U.S. history and government, and paying all back taxes. If you have complied with all of those requirements, you will go to the back of the line behind all applicants currently waiting for green cards. That is not an amnesty; that is a demanding process which will test the undocumented as to whether they really want to be part of America on a legal and permanent basis.  All of us understand--those of us who are the sons and daughters of immigrants--that the people who come to these shores bring a special quality. David Brooks of the New York Times has an article which I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                       Immigrants To Be Proud of                           (By David Brooks)       Everybody says the Republicans are split on immigration.      The law-and-order types want to close the border. The free-     market types want plentiful labor. But today I want to talk      to the social conservatives, because it's you folks who are      really going to swing this debate.       I'd like to get you to believe what Senator Sam Brownback      of Kansas believes: that a balanced immigration bill is      consistent with conservative values. I'd like to try to      persuade the evangelical leaders in the tall grass to stop      hiding on this issue.       My first argument is that the exclusionists are wrong when      they say the current wave of immigration is tearing our      social fabric. The facts show that the recent rise in      immigration hasn't been accompanied by social breakdown, but      by social repair. As immigration has surged, violent crime      has fallen by 57 percent. Teen pregnancies and abortion rates      have declined by a third. Teenagers are having fewer sexual      partners and losing their virginity later. Teen suicide rates      have dropped. The divorce rate for young people is on the way      down.       Over the past decade we've seen the beginnings of a moral      revival, and some of the most important work has been done by      Catholic and evangelical immigrant churches, by faith-based      organizations like the Rev. Luis Cortes's Nueva Esperanza, by      Hispanic mothers and fathers monitoring their kids. The anti-     immigration crowd says this country is under assault. But if      that's so, we're under assault by people who love their      children.       My second argument is that the immigrants themselves are      like a booster shot of traditional morality injected into the      body politic. Immigrants work hard. They build community      groups. They have traditional ideas about family structure,      and they work heroically to make them a reality.       This is evident in everything from divorce rates (which are      low, given immigrants' socioeconomic status) to their      fertility rates (which are high) and even the way they shop.       Hispanics and Hispanic immigrants have less money than      average Americans, but they spend what they have on their      families, usually in wholesome ways. According to Simmons      Research, Hispanics are 57 percent more likely than average      Americans to have purchased children's furniture in the past      year. Mexican-Americans spend 93 percent more on children's      music.       According to the government's Consumer Expenditure Survey,      Hispanics spend more on gifts, on average, than other      Americans. They're more likely to support their parents      financially. They're more likely to have big family dinners      at home.       This isn't alien behavior. It's admirable behavior, the      antidote to the excessive individualism that social      conservatives decry.       My third argument is that good values lead to success, and      that immigrants' long-term contributions more than compensate      for the short-term strains they cause. There's no use denying      the strains immigration imposes on schools, hospitals and      wage levels in some markets (but economists are sharply      divided on this).       So over the long haul, today's immigrants succeed. By the      second generation, most immigrant families are middle class      and paying taxes that more than make up for the costs of the      first generation. By the third generation, 90 percent speak      English fluently and 50 percent marry non-Latinos.       My fourth argument is that government should be at least as      virtuous as the immigrants themselves. Right now (as under      Bill Frist's legislation), government pushes immigrants into      a chaotic underground world. The Judiciary Committee's bill,      which Senator Brownback supports, would tighten the borders;      but it would also reward virtue. Immigrants who worked hard,      paid fines, paid their taxes, stayed out of trouble and      waited their turn would have a chance to become citizens.      This isn't government enabling vice; it's government at its      best, encouraging middle-class morality.       Social conservatives, let me ask you to consider one final      thing. Women who have recently arrived from Mexico have      bigger, healthier babies than more affluent non-Hispanic      white natives. That's because strong family and social      networks support these pregnant women, reminding them what to      eat and do. But the longer they stay, and the more      assimilated they become, the more bad habits they acquire and      the more problems their subsequent babies have.       Please ask yourself this: As we contemplate America's moral      fiber, do the real threats come from immigrants, or are some      people merely blaming them for sins that are already here?
