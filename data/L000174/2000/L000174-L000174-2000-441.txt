President, today I am joining Senators Coverdell, DeWine and Helms in introducing a Joint Resolution regarding the presidential and congressional elections in Peru, which are scheduled for April 9. I want to thank the other sponsors for their leadership and concern for these issues.  These elections have generated a great deal of attention and anticipation, and they have also focused a spotlight on President Fujimori, who is running for an unprecedented third term. He is doing so after firing three of the country's Supreme Court judges, who had determined that a third term was barred by Peru's Constitution.  President Fujimori has often been praised for what he has accomplished since he first took office in 1990. He success in defeating the brutal Sendero Luminoso insurgency, combating cocaine trafficking, and curbing soaring inflation has brought stability and greater economic opportunities.  These are important achievements. Unfortunately, they have often been accomplished through the strong arm tactics of a president who has shown a disturbing willingness to run roughshod over democratic principles and institutions.  In the run up to the April 9th election, President Fujimori's and his supporter's disrespect for democratic procedures and the conditions necessary for free and fair elections has rarely been so blatant.  Journalists and independent election observer groups cite the Peruvian Government's control of key official electoral agencies, systematic restrictions on freedom of the press, manipulation of the judicial process, alleged falsification of electoral petitions and harassment and intimidation of opposition politicians as just a few of the problems plaguing this process.  In February, the National Democratic Institute and the Carter Center concluded that ``extraordinary, immediate and comprehensive measures'' were necessary if the Peruvian elections are to meet international standards. Those measures have not been taken, and NDI and the Carter Center recently reported that ``irreparable damage to the integrity of the election process has already been done.'' The Clinton administration, to its credit, has expressed grave concerns about the transparent attempts by President Fujimori and his supporters to manipulate the election process.  Mr. President, the results of the Peruvian elections will not be known until the final ballot is counted. But one thing is already clear. If the elections are not deemed to have been free and fair, it will be a major setback for the Peruvian people and for democracy in the hemisphere. And if that happens, the United States must react strongly. We will have no choice but to modify our economic and political relations with Peru, and work to restore democracy to that country.  That is the message of this resolution, and I urge other Senators to support it so we can send as strong a message as possible to President Fujimori and the Peruvian people.  Mr. President, I also want to take this opportunity to mention another matter that has caused me and other Members of Congress great concern. The Peruvian Government recently brought to the United States a former Peruvian Army intelligence officer who was responsible for torturing a woman who was left permanently paralyzed as a result. He was convicted in Peru, but released after a military tribunal reversed his conviction. For reasons that I have yet to get a suitable answer to, the U.S. Embassy granted him a visa to come to the United States to testify at a hearing before the Inter-American Human Rights Commission. That was bad enough. But the fact that the Peruvian Government saw fit to include such a person in its official delegation to appear as a witness in a human rights forum says a great deal about that government, and it should be condemned.  Finally, I want to express my personal concern about Lori Berenson, who was convicted by a Peruvian military court and sentenced to life in prison. The United States Government, other governments, Amnesty International and other independent human rights groups, have all concluded that she was denied due process. I and others have called for her release or trial by a civilian court in accordance with international standards. Innocent or guilty, every person deserves a fair trial, and I would hope that a country that professes to respect human rights would recognize the obvious--that Ms. Berenson's conviction was a miscarriage of justice.                          ____________________
