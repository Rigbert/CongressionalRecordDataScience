President, in addition to important improvements to the health reform bill President Obama signed into law this week, the reconciliation measure before the Senate also provides a significant investment in higher education.  I have always strongly believed in the importance of a college education. Unfortunately, in recent years, average college tuition rates have increased faster than inflation, and have far outpaced student financial aid. Skyrocketing tuition is making it increasingly difficult for families to afford higher education. Many students are forced to take on significant debt, and too often are not able to complete college because of soaring costs.  Especially during these difficult economic times we need to be doing more to address the rising costs of higher education and the growing need for student financial aid. I am glad to see that the measure in front of us today streamlines our student lending system and no longer subsidizes banks to lend to students risk free. By requiring that all future student loans be made directly to students through the Federal Government, this bill will save $61 billion over 10 years. Not only will this provision save the government money,but the Direct Loan Program is projected to save students millions of dollars in fees and interest payments.  A portion of the savings from this bill will be used to fund the Pell Grant Program, which is facing a significant shortfall this year.
