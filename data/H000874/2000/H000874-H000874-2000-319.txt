Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, as the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Boehner) has explained, the House originally proposed the printing of four documents about our government, all of which Members and their constituents find extraordinarily useful.  By its amendment, the Senate has proposed the printing of two additional documents. I believe those documents are appropriately added, and I certainly urge Members to support this resolution.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
