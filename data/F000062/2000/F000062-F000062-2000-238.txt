 President, I rise to ask my colleagues to support a bill to name the Santa Ana, California Post Office as the ``Hector G. Godinez Post Office Building.''  Hector Godinez, who passed away in May of 1999, was a true leader in his community of Santa Ana, California. He was a pioneer in the United States Postal Service rising from letter carrier to become the first Mexican-American to achieve the rank of District Manager within the United States Postal Service. He served with honor in World War II, was a ardent civil rights activist and an active participant in civic organizations and local government.  After graduation from Santa Ana High School, Mr. Godinez enlisted into the armed services and was a tank commander in World War II under General George Patton. For his service, he earned a bronze star for bravery under fire and was also awarded a purple heart for wounds received in battle.  Upon his return home in 1946, Mr. Godinez started his first of 48 years of distinguished service as a United States postal worker.  Hector Godinez was a true pillar within the Santa Ana community devoting his tireless energy to such civic groups as the Orange County District Boy Scouts of America, Santa Ana Chamber of Commerce, Orange County YMCA and National President of the League of United Latin American Citizens, one of the country's oldest Hispanic civil rights organizations.  On behalf of the Godinez family and the people of Santa Ana, California, it is my pleasure to introduce this bill to name the Santa Ana, California Post Office in his honor.                                 ______                                       By
