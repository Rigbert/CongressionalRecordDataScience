President, as we wrap up business for the 107th Congress, I would like to engage in a brief colloquy with my Environment and Public Works Committee and budget Committee colleagues regarding an issue that will set the groundwork for reauthorization of the surface transportation program next Congress. Specifically, what the baseline figure will be for the program. Will it reflect the fiscal year 2003 enacted spending level or the pending CR level.  As my colleagues know, although Section 137 of Public Law 107-240, Making Further Continuing Appropriations for fiscal year 2003, provides that the highway program be funded at the fiscal year 2002 level of $31.8 billion, section 137 limits total annual obligations for the program to not more than $27.7 billion. Given that the fiscal year 2003 enacted level for surface transportation may not be known until after the President's fiscal year 2004 budget proposal is submitted, I have a concern that we could be faced with an artificially low baseline figure. I hope we can reach agreement now that it would be the intention of the Budget Committee to use the highest possible figure as the baseline for fiscal year 2003 when developing their fiscal year 2004 resolution. Ideally I would like to see a baseline of $31.8 billion.  At a minimum I hope that next year's Budget Resolution will ensure that all revenues into the highway account of the Highway Trust Fund will be available to the EPW Committee for authorization with the existing budgetary protections.  I know we can all agree that a strong surface transportation program creates and preserves jobs, and thereby boosts the economy. Beginning reauthorization discussions with a low baseline figure stunts the value of the economicactivity that we can realize with a robust program.  If my colleagues would care to comment, I will be happy to yield.
