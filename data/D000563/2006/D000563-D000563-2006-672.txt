President.  Mr. President, first, I ask unanimous consent that Senators Carper and Boxer be added as cosponsors to my pending amendment, and I ask unanimous consent that three commentaries in opposition to the flag amendment be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Chicago Sun Times, June 21, 2006]           Ill-Starred Flag Amendment Would Do Nation No Good       Nearly 30 years after Cubs outfielder Rick Monday snatched      an American flag from two idiots at Dodger Stadium who had      doused it in lighter fluid and were trying to light it with a      match, we still applaud him for his exemplary act of      patriotism--for acting on our behalf. As devoted as we are to      free speech, we would have been hard-pressed to bottle our      anger over the desecration of the Stars and Stripes before      tens of thousands of spectators.       Our appreciation of Monday was not diminished by his      appearance last week at a rally for a proposed flag      desecration amendment--an event at which he exhibited the      rescued flag, which was presented to him by the Dodgers. But      however heartfelt this gesture was, it was wrongheaded in      lending support to a manufactured cause with no real value      except a political one, the equivalent of throwing red meat      on the table.       You would think, from the emotional momentum this issue has      gained in recent times, there is a pressing need for an anti-     flag-burning amendment. Most Americans are in favor of it.      The House has backed the amendment, and the Senate may well      follow suit next week, when it is scheduled to decide on the      constitutional ban. Reportedly, it is within a vote or two of      the two-thirds majority it needs. In 2000, it fell four votes      short.       But, in fact, this is a classic example of a solution in      search of a problem. Flag burnings, which most of us      associate with Vietnam-era protests, have all but disappeared      from the American landscape. No protests of the war in Iraq      (which have been relatively few) have featured flag      desecrations. The closest anyone has come to publicly      mistreating the flag, arguably, was a case of two athletes      wrapping themselves in it at the Olympics.       You might also think this is an issue in need of legal      clarification. But, no, the Supreme Court ruled in 1989 that      as distasteful or offensive as this kind of protest is, it is      protected by the First Amendment. A year later, the high      court overturned the federal Flag Protection Act. The fact      that yet another effort is being mounted tells you not that      the principles have changed, but the political climate has.      Sorry, but that's not a good enough reason to alter the      Constitution.       This represents the consensus of the Sun-Times News Group      of 100 newspapers in the metro Chicago area.                                  ____           Emergency Committee to Defend the First Amendment       The following statement was released today by Professors      Norman Dorsen and Charles Fried, Co-chairs of the Emergency      Committee to Defend the First Amendment. The Committee is      composed of prominent Americans--conservative, moderate and      liberal--including former officials of the Reagan      Administration, former Republican members of Congress, senior      professors of constitutional law, several former presidents      of the American Bar Association, and leaders of other      national organizations.       The First Amendment to the United States Constitution has      served us since 1791 through wars, including a Civil War, and      crises of every sort without the need for amendment. It is an      icon of our freedom. To amend it now comes close to      vandalism.       The proposed constitutional amendment limits how people may      protest and sets a precedent for banning other forms of      dissent. If the flag, why not the Great Seal of the United      States or the Constitution? Why not the Bible or (to be      ecumenical) religious icons of all faiths? The founders of      this country would have been shocked at the notion that the      government could restrict ways by which the people can      protest conditions in the country or the government's own      policies.       As the Boston Tea Party illustrates, the founders were      familiar with symbolic protest. Moreover, the American      revolutionaries were also not exactly kind to their country's      flag, the Union Jack. George Washington ordered thirteen red      and white stripes sewn onto it and called it the ``Thirteen      Rebellious Stripes.'' Pennsylvania's first flag after      declaring independence was a British flag with a coiled      serpent ready to strike at the English ensign. These protests      ``desecrated'' the country's then-existing flag.       Totalitarian countries fear dissenters sufficiently to      suppress their protests. A free nation relies on having the      better argument. It is possible to burn a particular flag,      but no one can destroy the symbol and meaning of the flag. No      matter how many flags are burned, the American flag will      still exist, untarnished and waving bravely in the breeze.       The Emergency Committee urges the Senate to demonstrate the      sort of statesmanship of which it is capable by rejecting the      proposed constitutional amendment.

Re Oppose S.J. Res. 12, the Flag ``Desecration''          Constitutional Amendment.       Dear Senator: As the Commander of American Legion Post #315      in San Francisco, CA, I write to urge you to oppose S.J. Res.      12, the proposed constitutional amendment to prohibit      ``desecration'' of the flag. Although the national American      Legion leadership supports this amendment, I wish to express      my disagreement with that position and my dismay with the      apparent willingness of Congress to amend the First Amendment      to restrict free speech.       Acts of burning or otherwise defacing the flag are rare,      but they can be a powerful form of expression. I should be      clear that it saddens me to think of those who would damage      the flag, but I believe it my duty to defend their right to      do so. The flag stands for freedom, yet this constitutional      amendment would diminish fundamental freedoms by undermining      the right to free expression guaranteed by the Bill of      Rights.       American Legion posts across the country recently marked      the passing of Flag Day by organizing flag burning ceremonies      to dispose of worn and damaged flags. Proponents of the flag      amendment say they seek to ban an act, not a form of      expression. Surely they do not mean to ban respectful flag      disposal ceremonies like these. Rather, they seek to prohibit      acts of flag desecration that are intended to convey a      certain political message. When the founders drafted the      First Amendment, they intended to protect peaceful      expression, however unpopular and offensive. In fact, it is      precisely such unpopular speech that requires the protection      afforded by the Constitution.       There is significant diversity of opinion among veterans in      general and American Legion members in particular on this      issue. In fact, just last year a past National Commander of      the Legion, Keith Kreul, gave Senate testimony in opposition      to the flag amendment. I suggest, as Mr. Kreul did, that this      amendment is not an appropriate way to honor the service of      this nation's veterans. There are many pressing concerns      facing our veterans and active duty troops, including      shortfalls in funding for veterans healthcare and daily      dangers facing troops serving in Iraq. The flag amendment is      an unfortunate distraction from these issues.       If passed, the flag amendment would constitute the first-     ever restriction on the Bill of Rights. I urge you to oppose      this measure. In doing so, you will defend the true spirit of      the Constitution, and the freedoms for which the flag stands.           Sincerely,                                           Sharon Lee Kufeldt,                            Commander, American Legion Post # 315,                                           U.S. Air Force Veteran.
