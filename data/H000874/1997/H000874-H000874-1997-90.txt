Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  The fact of the matter is that I would hope that Members would concentrate on what this bill is, not what it is not, what it possibly could be, what could be added. There are a lot of great things that probably could be added to this bill that are not added to this bill. There are probably a lot of great things or bad things that this bill could preclude that it does not. But what it is, what this bill is that Members are going to consider is an excellent bill that does good and is bipartisan in nature. We all gave to reach agreement.  I thank the chairman for his leadership and effort on this issue.                        Request for Quorum Call
