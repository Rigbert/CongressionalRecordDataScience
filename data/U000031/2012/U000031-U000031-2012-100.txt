Speaker, I rise today to recognize Lieutenant Bennie F. Bowers, Jr., a native of Benton Harbor, Michigan, who is retiring from the Michigan State Police after 25 years of impeccable service.  It is with great pleasure that I congratulate Lieutenant Bowers on his impressive and inspiring service record to the state of Michigan. His 25 years of steadfast community involvement have helped keep Michigan safe, and have made all of us from Southwest Michigan extremely proud. Lieutenant Bowers' renowned career includes protecting Michigan's citizens while posted at Michigan State Police's Battle Creek Post, Paw Paw District Headquarters and Regional Dispatch, Detroit Post, and most recently, the Metro Post. His selfless actions have made a real difference to folks within and outside of my district for decades. Lt. Bowers used innovative methods to enforce law. He was never satisfied with the status quo, and always worked to improve the communities in which he worked. He was respected by his peers and known as one to ``lead by example.''  Lt. Bowers' leadership is exemplified in his founding of the Michigan Youth Leadership Academy. Lt. Bowers recognized the importance of fostering discipline, respect, leadership, and teamwork in our youth. His efforts assisted in the reduction of youth crime and ingrained skills which those youth will carry with them for their whole lives. Lt. Bowers was also instrumental in the Michigan State Police Explorer Program, a program that works with youth interested in pursuing a career in law enforcement. Part of Lt. Bowers' legacy will be the youth he influenced to serve as Michigan's next generation of law enforcement officers.  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to recognize Lt. Bowers' inspiring commitment to our great state and my constituents. I applaud Bennie on a fine career and wish him the best of luck in his retirement and future endeavors.                          ____________________
