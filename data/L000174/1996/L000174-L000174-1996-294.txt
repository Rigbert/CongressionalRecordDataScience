President, the bill expands a great program in Vermont called the Farms for the Future.  Vermont's dairy farms are part of what makes Vermont so special. That is why I want to help Vermont farm families keep their land in agriculture through the Farms for the Future Program.  I included this program in the 1990 farm bill, and since then, Vermont has purchased the development rights for nearly 100 farms throughout the State.  Let me put that another way--nearly 100 Vermont farmers received cash payments under this program. This kept their land in farming.  I am pleased that this bill contains $35 million more for farmland protection programs throughout the Nation.  While this bill has many accomplishments, I wish we could have done even more in environmental areas. For example, the Wetlands Reserve Program places a lower cap on enrollments than the bill passed by the Senate.  Retaining the Senate's cap would have provided further environmental insurance to future generations.  The committee I sit on is called the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee for a reason.  We have a long bipartisan history of making sure every child in our Nation--whether they are rich or poor--has enough to eat.  While agriculture programs now extend for 7 more years, one of our most important child nutrition programs, food stamps, will expire 2 years from now.  Fourteen million children benefit from the Food Stamp Program. I fear that our precious children--those least able to defend themselves in our society--will be at risk in 2 years. I intend to work with Senators Lugar, Daschle, Dole, and others to make certain that this does not happen.  Mr. President, in closing, while this bill adopts important new provisions in farm policy, we must be careful about patting ourselves too much on the back. There are important areas in conservation, the environment and nutrition where we have failed to go the extra step.  Although this bill is called the farm bill, it affects every American every day of their lives. What we pass today will impact families when they take a vacation to one of our national parks, spread a picnic lunch under a tree, bit into a sandwich or drink a glass of juice.  The 2 million farmers are important and this bill will serve them well.  But we cannot forget that farm policy affects the more than 250 million Americans who are concerned about the environment, conservation, and important nutrition programs.  In the last year partisan fights on the budget and other issues have tied up Congress and shut down the Government on two occasions. We all realize that is not the way to govern. That is why last month, when it appeared that the farm bill would be caught in the same trap, I decided to act.  With Senator Lugar and Senator Dole, I offered a bipartisan farm bill with strong conservation, environmental and nutrition provisions. I am proud that a bipartisan step led to this final bill. I want to also thank Chairman Roberts for his efforts in working with me at conference. His freedom-to-farm idea has captured the hearts of many thousands of farmers through America.  This is Congressman Kika de la Garza's last farm bill, as it is the last farm bill for Senator Pryor and Senator Heflin. I have greatly enjoyed working with all of them over the years.  Let me focus on the conservation provisions for a moment. They are different from most--they will provide cash payments to farmers for improvements they would want to make anyway.  One program is a voluntary program of payments to Vermont farmers whowant to protect Lake Champlain, or protect rivers or other lakes near their fields. It is also a voluntary program for farmers around the Nation.  It can be expensive to manage your land. Some may need assistance in getting the job done right. That is why Senator Lugar and I designed a conservation program called EQUIP. It cuts redtape and guarantees funding for conservation assistance for the next 7 years.  This is voluntary assistance that will be available if you need it. It can help Vermont farmers comply with the State's new accepted agricultural practices.  We are in this together. We want to keep our streams full of trout. We want to make sure St. Albans Bay, Lake Memphremagog, and Missiquoi Bay are clean for everyone to enjoy. This bill also protects lakes and rivers in all States.  Keeping our State and regional dairy industry strong is the driving force behind the Northeast Dairy Compact. Working together is how we have gotten so far. At a later date I will thank all those involved in getting the dairy compact approved.  Today I want to thank the agriculture committee chairmen in Vermont, Senator Tom Bahre and Representative Bobby Starr, Governor Dean, Commissioner Graves, Congressman Sanders, and the hundreds of dairy farmers in Vermont who worked with me on getting the job done. And I want to say a special thanks to Jim Jeffords. He and I have worked side by side throughout this fight.  I also need to highlight the role of Danny Smith. He came down to Washington and worked directly with me on getting the compact included in the final bill. His support was vital.  The compact has come a long way, from the State legislatures of New England, to the Congress.  Vermonters and all of New England know the importance of the dairy industry. But in New England people know that the dairy compact is more than helping farmers, and helping the dairy industry in the region.  To New Englanders, a vital rural agricultural economy is part of both the heritage they treasure and the future in which they believe.  This bill represents real reform of Federal dairy policy. This bill phases down dairy price supports saving more than $300 million, more than 20 percent compared to the baseline. This bill fully funds the Dairy Export Incentive Program and poises the U.S. dairy industry to capture expanding world markets.  The Federal milk orders remain in place but mandates their reform and consolidated the current number of 33 by about two-thirds. I am concerned that the Secretary has been given only 3 years to complete this process. These provisions were hard fought compromises addressing the concerns of farmers, processors, consumers, and the various regions. No region or interest group is completely satisfied, but that is the sign of a good compromise.  A major thrust of this bill is to reduce regulations that are imposed on farmers and ranchers. It reduces conservation regulations and farm program regulations.  The conference report gives farmers a lot more flexibility to decide what crops to plant. That means farmers will be able to choose the crop rotations that are best for their farms, rather than planting to meet the requirements of the farm program.  The bill eliminates existing penalties for producing hay and other resource-conserving crops, so the environment should benefit as well.  The conference report also brings to an end the practice of requiring farmers to idle productive cropland. No longer will USDA decide each year how much land a farmer must set aside to get farm program payments. From now on, the Government will pay farmers to idle land only when that land is environmentally sensitive.  A key section of this farm bill is the continuation of international food aid programs--Public Law 480, Food for Progress and the Emerging Democracy Program. These programs are critical in our global efforts to fight world hunger. Our responsibility to help others is a moral obligation and I am delighted that the importance these programs play in the fight against world hunger is understood by all conferees.  I am pleased with the strong emphasis that this bill places on importance of maintaining strong U.S. agricultural export markets. Export of U.S. agricultural products, especially in the value-added market, is one of the most profitable and fastest growing sectors in our Nation's economy. My home State of Vermont understands its importance. Vermont export statistics indicate that Vermont exported more than $175 million in agricultural-derived products--many of these in the value-added category. That translates into a thriving economy and local job creation.  This bill also streamlines USDA farm lending programs. The conferees worked hard with Secretary Glickman to produce a title both the administration, Congress and farm borrowers can support, and I believe we have crafted an effective policy to help farmers prepare for the next century without creating the dependency on USDA loan programs that have existed in past to the detriment of both USDA and the individual borrowers.  I am disappointed that the conference report does not provide a better safety net for farmers. Farm program payments will not be tied to market conditions, so farmers may get large Government payments when they do not need them, and may not get sufficient aid when times are hard. I hope that we can work on new ways to help farmers deal with market risk.  I am also concerned with some of the changes that have been made in the Crop Insurance Program. Farmers will no longer be required to purchase crop insurance to get farm program benefits. While I support giving farmers freedom of choice, I fear that too many farmers will fail to obtain insurance.  If we have widespread crop disaster and many farmers do not have insurance coverage, there will again be political pressure to enact ad hoc disaster programs. I supported the effort to reform crop insurance in 1994 largely because I wanted to bring an end to ad hoc disaster programs. I want everyone to understand that my willingness to accept these changes in the Crop Insurance Program should not be misinterpreted as a willingness to return to wasteful disaster programs.  I have two major concerns with the meat and poultry advisory panel. First, it will waste money that would be better spent on meat and poultry inspectors. Second, the scope of what the panel can investigate is too broad.  However, on the positive side, the panel is advisory and does not have the constitutional or statutory power to delay food safety actions of the Secretary. Delays will only result if the Secretary voluntarily agrees that the delay is appropriate.  I accepted the provision on studying the usefulness of permitting the interstate shipment of State-inspected meat. This idea was proposed by the President of the United States in his farm bill recommendations. I think it would be useful to have the Secretary's most recent views on this issue.  I am especially happy that this legislation includes a proposal that was added at my request, the Flood Risk Reduction Program contained in section 385. I first became interested in this situation after the disastrous floods of 1993. I raised this issue in a hearing with then Secretary Espy.  I asked the Secretary whether it would make more sense to stop fighting the Mississippi River and the natural elements of these lands and instead to enroll them in the Wetland Reserve Program.  In addition, I spoke to the President personally about this proposal. I also wrote a letter to the President detailing my emergency wetlands reserve initiative that would improve the proposed disaster relief program for the Mississippi Valley floods. In this letter I continued to attack the inefficiency and high cost of the disaster relief program.  In addition, I pointed out that there is a very good possibility that many of the cropland areas that were once wetlands would be better off returned to wetland status rather than repaired and kept in crops.  The success of voluntary programs to help farmers move off flood prone bottom land can be seen in the example of Levee District 8 in Iowa. This area had a history of flood damage. It would have cost the taxpayer about $1,500 per acre to return this land to farmable condition. And then a few years later,it would have flooded again. Instead this levee district was voluntarily abolished. A decision that works for the farmers and the taxpayer. I ask unanimous consent that a description of that success story be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:        The 1993 Floods--From Levee District to Wildlife Refuge                          (By Bruce Mountain)       The farmers were grim as they stood at the road below Bob      Hawk's house that leads into the upper end of Levee District      8 and Louisa County, Iowa. It was 7 a.m. on July 8, 1993, and      it appeared they were going to lose again. There had been      record rains in the Iowa River Basin; and Levee District 8,      only six miles from the Mississippi, was feeling the brunt of      the massive run-off as it funneled 12 million acres down the      river.       The levee was built in 1927 to protect 2,000 acres of crop      ground. The area also contained 600 acres of old oxbows and      sloughs (Spitznogle Lake, Sunfish Lake, Rush Lake, Parsons      Lake, Wilson Lake, Hall Lake, and Diggins Slough) and      riverine forests. It had been estimated the levee was a 25-     year levee (able to withstand floods that occur once every 25      years), but in the last 60 years it had been breached 14      times.       This looked like it would be number 15. Ed Yotter and the      other farmers stood at 551 feet above sea level, and the      lower end of the district, at 541 feet, was already under      several feet of water due to seepage up through the saturated      ground and through the levee. By 8 a.m. water started to lap      over the top of the levee at several locations, so the 25      farmers and neighbors moved off the main levee and worked to      reinforce the cross levee between Levee District 8 and the      adjacent up-stream levee district, number 11.       At 9 a.m. word came that the main levee of District 11 had      broken and water was gushing in. By 11 a.m. water was coming      over the main levee in District 8 like a waterfall.      Officially, the main levee was breached in six locations and      the cross levee was breached in five, but actually these were      the accumulation of many smaller breaches all along the      levees. At its height, the flood water was more than two feet      over the top of the levee, drowning the hopes of another      year's crop.       When the flood water finally receded in September, the      farmers looked over the damage. They were stunned by the      numerous scour holes (some 25 to 100 feet long and 17 feet      deep), sand deposits (some 6 inches to 6 feet deep), and      flotsam. The Soil Conservation Service (SCS), now known as      the Natural Resources Conservation Service, moved in to      assess the damage to the crop ground in Levee District 8 (it      was later set at up to $3,000 per acre) and to estimate the      costs to fix the roads and drainage system. The Army Corps of      Engineers obtained estimates to fix the levees.       But the landowners were tired of fighting the river. And      conservationists and public officials knew this oft-flooded      land shouldn't be farmed. For a brief time after the waters      receded and before the repairs would need to begin, the      situation was ripe for change, and a variety of agencies and      nonprofits seized the opportunity. They put together a buy-     out of the properties in Levee District Number 8 and      created--a year and a half later--Horseshoe Bend, a division      of the Mark Twain National Wildlife Refuge and a good case      study of how a coalition can move quickly when conditions--     and the will for change--are right.                   gathering funds and willing buyers       If the flooding of Louisa County's levee had been a      localized incident the levees would have been rebuilt      ($800,000), the drainage ditches cleared ($400,000), the sand      bars removed, the scour holes filled, and the debris removed      ($1.7 million) for an estimated $2.9 million. This excludes      the additional costs and federal dollars for disaster      payments ($200,000) as well as crop insurance payments and      the non-recoverable costs of the landowners. (Today, it is      believed that these estimates were low because in the      adjacent levee district, number 11, where the levee was      actually repaired, the initial estimate proved to be 80      percent below the actual costs.)       This was not, however, a localized incident. The flooding      of the entire Upper Mississippi River Basin in 1993 was the      worst in years. At many of the U.S. Geological Survey gauging      stations along the Mississippi, the flow levels exceeded the      hundred year mark. In response, Congress passed the Emergency      Wet and Reserve Program (EWRP) in October 1993 as a part of      flood relief support. Without the funds provided by this      program, the Louisa Levee District buy-out could not have      occurred.       The federal government's disaster aid program was developed      to provide compensation for severely damaged crop ground and      also to break the cycle of paying for similar damage caused      by future floods. Under the program, the Department of      Agriculture would purchase a permanent easement on crop acres      where the damage caused by the flood exceeded the value of      the easement. The easement would prohibit all but very      limited agricultural practices, and in Louisa County, it was      set at $683 per acre.       In early October, the Iowa office of the SCS proposed the      idea of buying out the entire levee district, but only from      willing sellers and only if the district were dissolved so as      to ensure that future levee reconstruction costs would not be      incurred. The SCS did not have the funds or the statutory      authority to purchase the district, so, in late October, it      organized meeting with its own representatives, the Fish and      Wildlife Service (FWS), the Federal Emergency Management      Agency (FEMA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the      Corps, the Iowa Department of Natural Resources, the Iowa      Natural Heritage Foundation, Pheasants Forever, and other      interested parties to seek a solution.       The group immediately realized that for the project to be      successful, quick action would be needed. With winter      approaching, the dredge barges the Corps needed to repair the      levees would soon be frozen out. The group thought that a      buy-out of the fee title to the parcels in the levee district      could be accomplished through joining the Emergency Wetland      Reserve payment with additional cash to be raised to equal      the fair market value of the property.       The area also qualified for FEMA assistance. Applications      were made to the Iowa Disaster Management Office, which      helped handle FEMA payments, to have the buy-out declared as      an alternative floodplain project. That declaration would      make up to 90 percent of the disaster payments eligible to be      applied for the buy-out. However, an estimated additional      $500,000 to $600,000 would still be needed to accomplish      the project. Representatives for the FWS indicated they      would have the money but not until 1994. The National Fish      and Wildlife Foundation then agreed to provide a $250,000      grant to be matched by $250,000 from The Conservation      Fund; these monies would be used as a loan or stop-gap      funding until the FWS funds became available. Other non-     profits, such as the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation and      Pheasants Forever, also provided funding.       The Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, a 15-year-old private      group, was asked to be the project facilitator. The      Foundation would coordinate the offers to purchase land from      the individual landowners, coordinate the Emergency Wetland      Reserve Program funding with the National Fish and Wildlife      Foundation and Conservation Fund monies, and oversee the      eventual transfer of the properties. Before the buy-out could      proceed, the ultimate owner and manager of the area had to be      determined. The choice was between the Iowa Department of      Natural Resources and the Fish and Wildlife Service. Due in      part to state budgetary constraints and federal management      personnel available at the nearby Mark Twain Wildlife Refuge,      the FWS was the logical choice to hold title and manage the      project.       Another condition for the project to proceed was the      closing of the levee district and drainage district.      Therefore, the statutory requirements for closing the      districts, including legal notice and voting procedures, had      to be researched. The final closing took place on March 31,      1994.       Once the landowners agreed to the concept, offers to      purchase had to be negotiated with each landowner. The      district is owned by 13 different landowners with parcels      ranging in size from 13 acres to more than 1,500 acres. One      farm is owned by an investor/operator, and another was deeded      by President James Polk under federal patent to the owners,      Jack and Merrit Parsons's great-great-grandfather, in 1846.      Two sisters, Mary Boysen and Martha Hawk, each owned Century      Farms, a designation given to farms that have been in the      same family for 100 years. Another farm was acquired by duck      hunters in 1929, and it is still operated as a private duck      hunting club by the heirs of the six original partners.       We concluded that all of the offers to landowners had to be      based on a consistently applied formula. Several of the      landowners said that they were dissatisfied with the offers,      but eventually agreed to them, based on the knowledge that      other landowners were getting the same offers and that there      were no ``special deals.'' By sticking to this strategy,      individual negotiations and appraisals were avoided.       The first offer was signed December 13, 1993, and the last      one was executed May 6, 1994. Seven of the ten landowners had      closed by November 30, 1994. The rest closed by the end of      1994 as the farmers finished their field work.                             many partners       Completing a project with so many partners and landowners      in such a short time required creativity, cooperation, and      attention to detail. One of the more important aspects of      this partnership was the Cooperative Agreement signed by the      Soil Conservation Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and      the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation. This agreement      delineates the responsibilities of each party. One useful      provision of the agreement is one that specifies that access      will be available to top-level officials when efforts were      stymied on the local level.       The public/private mix in the project was important. The      public and private partners can be divided into five      categories, each of which served different roles and      functions: implementing non-profit organizations,      jurisdictional agencies, funding agencies, funding non-     profits, and project managing agencies.       In this project, the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation was      an implementing or facilitating non-profit organization. An      implementing non-profit was necessary because flexibility and      speed were needed to consummate the project. The Iowa Natural      Heritage Foundation's Wetlands for Iowa Program was chosen      for the project, in part, because     it has expertise in land acquisition projects and in forming      partnerships with state and federal agencies and other non-     profits to fund the purchase of such projects. In this case,      the Wetlands for Iowa Program had the responsibility to      educate landowners on the concept of merging the Emergency      Wetland Reserve Program easement with a buy-out.       The Foundation also had many other tasks. It did a      preliminary appraisal of the land in November of 1993 and      devised the uniform buy-out plan. It paid for a quick      appraisal of cropland and non-cropland based on comparable      sales and pre-flood land values. From this, a portion of the      value due to the flood damage, as determined by SCS, was      deducted to arrive at the current value. In dealing with non-     motivated sellers, the Foundation packaged the idea as an      attractive alternative to farming in the floodplain and as      being fair among all neighbors.       The Foundation also negotiated offers to purchase land with      each landowner and provided the flexibility to customize each      transaction. Tax deferments were provided through three-way      land exchanges. For example, the Foundation purchased land      from a third party (pursuant to the instructions of the owner      of levee district land) and then traded the land for land in      the levee district. The Foundation then would receive the      EWRP payment. Non-levee district acres were purchased to      round out tracts that were not eligible for the EWRP. For      example, the Spitznogle brothers owned 12 acres inside the      levee district, but wanted to sell 20 acres to have square      boundaries. The additional eight acres was purchased with      some of the funds provided by other nonprofits.       Finally, the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation developed a      timetable for all public and private participants to ensure      each was fulfilling its responsibilities. These included      appraisals, surveys, title problems, financing, preparing      grant applications, closing on each parcel, and transferring      each to the Fish and Wildlife Service.       The many jurisdictional agencies involved in the project--     the Soil Conservation Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service,      the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Corps--had      responsibilities that varied in breadth and longevity. The      SCS was responsible for evaluating flood damage to each land      parcel and for implementing the Emergency Wetland Reserve      Program. The wetland restoration requirements of the EWRP for      the participating landowners were the responsibility of the      FWS. The FWS also conducted the environmental assessment and      environmental impact studies and engaged an independent      appraiser to assess the properties and develop comparable      figures from in-house appraisers. These figures were very      close to the ``quickie'' appraisal obtained by the Iowa      Natural Heritage Foundation.       FEMA's involvement included assessing damage compensation      under its statutory authority and developing the project as      an alternative plan. FEMA also had a role as a funding agency      for the project as did the SCS and the FWS. Funding non-     profits included the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation, the      National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, The Conservation Fund,      Pheasants Forever, and the Izaak Walton League. The fifth      category of partners were project managing agencies, which      included the SCS, the FWS, and the Corps.       Typically, this type of project does not work in normal      regulatory frameworks. Entrenched bureaucrats, enamored with      their own regulations, can be a death knell to a project. The      time it takes to babysit hesitant landowners and coordinate      state and federal agencies does not permit one agency to be      inflexible in interpreting its regulations when the intent of      the regulations can be met through cooperative and      imaginative initiatives. All partners need access to top      agency personnel because someone outside the organization can      sometimes get results, whereas agency personnel may not have      the authority or the influence to buck their way up the      system.       The Louisa County levee buy-out required close interagency      cooperation. As an example, SCS defined the value of damages      to the land for purposes of qualification for EWRP. FWS then      directed its appraisers to use the same data and valuation      premises in determining the fair market value of the land. We      would have had difficulty closing the project if the agencies      had used two different methods of appraisal and the land      qualified for EWRP but would not qualify for the buy-out.       Another example: Regulations for the SCS for EWRP      easements, and the FWS for land acquisitions, required their      respective legal counsel to determine that landowners had      marketable title to the land, subject to the guidelines of      the project. Through negotiations, SCS agreed to accept FWS      opinions of title. This avoided a separate time-consuming      step by keeping the project out of the hands of at least one      set of government lawyers.       The last ingredient for success was agency flexibility. For      example, EWRP regulations require all easements to be      surveyed and this would have caused an immense delay in the      project. To its credit, SCS waived these regulations, since      most of the acquisitions involved the entire tract. Surveys      were then conducted only on five parcels split on irregular      boundary lines.                             severe lessons       This unique project is giving farmers an opportunity to      find alternative agricultural land to continue farming      without fighting the floods. Additionally, it provides short-      and long-term savings to taxpayers because a one-time, fair-     market purchase of flood-prone land is much cheaper than      continued, expensive federal programs to rebuild levees,      clean drainage districts, repair land, and pay disaster      payments. All of these costs are interspersed with crop-     deficiency payments and insurance claims. In addition, our      latest calculation shows the Fish and Wildlife Service saved      $235,000 by having the Iowa Natural Heritage Foundation      facilitate the transactions. The federal government still has      the responsibility to provide existing protection in certain      floodplains; but it also must develop alternatives to      controlling nature, such as relocating willing landowners and      returning parts of the floodplain to the river.       The great flood of 1993 taught us some severe lessons. We      have to expand our mission from just controlling the water      that affects our individual properties to effectively dealing      with the effects of the water all the way down the river      ecosystem. We also have to learn to live with the river      system by holding more of the rain water where it falls and      by slowing its movement through the system, thereby allowing      the river to reestablish some of its checks and balances.       Lastly, we have to stop ``just greasing the squeaky wheel''      and find ways to spread the available federal funds for      floodplain management among the various alternatives that      benefit the general public. This includes developing a      management plan for the entire river system, coordinating      pertinent programs and agencies and--where there are willing      landowners--giving some of our natural resources back to      nature.
