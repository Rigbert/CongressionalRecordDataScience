 President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. today the Senate resume legislative session and vote on the pending compound motion; further that if the motion is agreed to, Senators Cornyn and Reed each be recognized to offer a motion to instruct conferees; that the Senate vote on the motions in the order listed with no further action on the motion; that there be 2 minutes of debate between each vote, equally divided in the usual form; and that following disposition of the Reed motion and the appointment of conferees, the Senate resume executive session.
