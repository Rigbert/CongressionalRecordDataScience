 I say to the Senator in good faith that I sincerely hope this recession ends tomorrow. I do not care what the political consequences are for Democrats or Republicans, but I hope the Senator from Oklahoma will concede the recession we are in today is unlike those we have had before. There is high unemployment. Maybe we have not reached record levels, but there seems to be a resistance to getting this economy started again. I think that is why we are debating a stimulus and growth package.  I hope the Senator will concede that, though the numbers may not be exactly as bad, the depths of this recession and the impacts of the current recession are really unique and we should respond to them at least in the way we did before.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Voinovich). The Senator from Oklahoma.
