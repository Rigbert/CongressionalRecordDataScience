  Mr. DeFAZIO. In my State the thriving growth of the last 20 years has come from small businesses. We have had a few big corporations move in, but generally we can identify most of the growth that is coming in. Now we will have to cut back on loan guarantees for small businesses in America while we, for example, extend $40 billion to Mexico.
