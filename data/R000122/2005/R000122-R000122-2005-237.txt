President, I have immense respect for the chairman. I appreciate the difficulty of the job in trying to balance all these conflicting requests for funds. He has done a tremendous job with this appropriations bill. Certainly, I will consider his advice with respect to the position of the legislation. I would like to consider it a little further. But I appreciate the difficulty that the committee has in trying to meet all these amendments.  I say, finally, that what I am trying to do now is avoid a situation next year or the following year, as the chairman very well pointed out, where supplementals are not sufficient and the Army and Marine Corps have to look to their acquisition programs, cut combat systems, they have to look to other issues, quality of life for families, since these do keep these forces in uniform.
