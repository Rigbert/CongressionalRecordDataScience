 President, Congress recently passed a tax bill that provides much-needed relief for all Americans. While I am pleased that the tax bill included marriage penalty relief, a reduction in marginal rates and a phase out of the estate tax, these changes unfortunately increase the tax code's complexity. Furthermore, despite the positive changes made this year, the current code still retains the alternative minimum tax, the taxation of Social Security benefits, and marginal rates that increase with income.  I rise today to introduce legislation that takes tax reform to the next level and addresses the fundamental problems of the current code. My bill accomplishes this by repealing the current Internal Revenue Code and replacing it with a flat tax, where all taxpayers pay the same rate.  As with current law, not all wage earners will pay a Federal income tax under a flat tax. In order to assist lower income Americans, I have included large standard deductions. For example, a family of four would need to make more than $35,200 before paying a single penny in taxes.  Some argue that it's fair to tax wealthier people at higher rates. I believe that nothing can be further from the truth. Not only is this type of tax policy fundamentally unfair, it also prevents our economy from realizing its full potential.  A flat tax does not mean that a school teacher will have the same tax liability as Bill Gates. The principles of math dictate that people who make more will still pay more in taxes with a single rate. The difference is that with a flat tax those who earn more will no longer be penalized by rising marginal rates.  My bill also increases tax fairness by eliminating itemized deductions and credits. While these tax breaks benefit those who are lucky enough to claim them, they consequently hurt the taxpayers who are not. As a result, people with the same yearly salaries can pay very different Federal income taxes depending on whether they have children, they decide to own or rent a home, or decide to finance a family vacation through a credit card or a home equity loan.  Over time the tax code has evolved from a way to collect Federal revenue into a way to encourage and reward behavior the government deems important. I believe that the American people are intelligent enough that they do not need the Federal Government dangling a carrot in front of them when they make life decisions. Furthermore, I believe that people should not be punished for deciding to make these decisions in ways that are contrary to what the government decides is right.  Simplification is yet another reason our country needs the flat tax. The National Taxpayer Advocate cited complications in the tax code as the number one issue taxpayers faced in 2001. As the IRS publishes more and more regulations, and new tax laws are enacted, the complexity of the tax code will only grow.  The complexity of the tax code forces many Americans to seek the advice of tax professionals at the cost of many millions of dollars. No tax code should be so puzzling that the average person has to spend his hard-earned money to hire a tax preparer or an accountant. Those who decide to brave the tax code and file their own returns do not fare better. These people face conflicting IRS advice and many hours of completing confusing tax forms. All of these needless hassles results in taxpayer frustration and apathy and less time spent on more productive endeavors.  Under the flat tax, a taxpayers would be able to be quickly and accurately file their returns. There would be no itemized deductions or credits to calculate, no capital gains tabulations and no alternative minimum tax. With this new simplicity, taxpayers would be able to complete their personal income tax return in virtually no time at all compared to the 13 hours the IRS estimates it takes to complete a 1040 form.  I understand that my bill is a major change from the current tax code. Many people have become complacent with the status quo. Still others enjoy using the tax to implement social policy. I on the other hand believe though that a tax code should have one purpose and that is to collect revenue.  I hope that my colleagues will begin to seriously look at alternatives to the current code. The legislation I have introduced today is an excellent opportunity to bring this debate to the floor of the Senate. The combination of freedom, simplicity and fairness make the flat tax the ultimate goal of true tax reform. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of meaningful and comprehensive tax reform.                                 ______                                       By
