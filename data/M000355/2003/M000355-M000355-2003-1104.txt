 President, on behalf of the majority leader, I will announce the schedule for today. This morning, there will be a period for morning business until the hour of 1 p.m., with the time equally divided between the two leaders or their designees. A consent agreement was reached last night for the consideration of the nomination of Gordon England to be Deputy Secretary for Homeland Security. That debate and vote is expected this afternoon. We will notify all Members when that rollcall vote is expected.  In addition, the nomination of John Snow to be Secretary of the Treasury was reported by the Finance Committee by a unanimous vote this morning. It is hoped the Senate will be able to act on that important nomination during today's session. Therefore, additional votes can be expected during today's session of the Senate.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burns). The Senator from Nevada.
