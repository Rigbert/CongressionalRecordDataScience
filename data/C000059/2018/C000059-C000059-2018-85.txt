Chair, don't get me wrong. I am not opposed to what the EPA is doing at the border to improve water quality, but I think it is important to note that the bill already provides $10 million for the program, equal to the fiscal year 2018 level, and did not support the elimination of the program as proposed in the President's budget.  As the gentleman knows, we are level-funded in this year's appropriation bill, so I wasn't able to get additional funds for some of these programs that I like. Because a $5 million reduction could significantly impact the work of the Secretary of the Interior--we have been chewing away at that all night--the programs under this jurisdiction, and other important offices funded by the account, I can't support the amendment.  I will continue to work with the ranking member as we move this through this process because I know the important work we have done in California and along the entire border. It is a good program, and I certainly support it, but I can't support this amendment at this time.  Mr. Chair, I must oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''  I yield back the balance of my time.
