Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, if the gentleman from Texas was so interested in disclosing defendant's fees, he could have gone to the Committee on Rules and askedthem to make in order an amendment for the disclosure of defendant's fees. He failed to do so, and that is why we are not considering this today under the structured rule.  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).
