Speaker, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today to pay tribute to a great journalist, a community leader, a dear friend, but most importantly of all, a father and beloved husband.  Tony Griffin succumbed to cancer on December 30, 1997 only a few weeks after being diagnosed. It is rare that a single voice makes such an impact on so many people, in so many different ways. But Tony Griffin was just such an outstanding individual.  As news and public affairs director at WMUK in Kalamazoo, Michigan, he was all a reporter should be--aggressive, accurate and fair. An alumnus of Western Michigan University, Tony returned home to his alma mater to work at the university's National Public Radio station. He would have celebrated his 25th service anniversary with the station in March of this year.  Under his direction, WMUK won a wall full of prestigious awards, including recognition by the Voice of America, Michigan Associated Press, the Public Radio News Directors, and the Michigan Bar Association.  He built his career and reputation as a dogged, shrewd journalist. A healthy dose of skepticism coupled with voracious appetite for the truth wrapped around a sharp wit and always generous laugh. But the Tony we all knew and loved was more than just a journalist.  Tony took time-out on the other side of the microphone to serve his community. He lent his enormous skills and energies to the local Red Cross, Van Buren County Community Corrections, and a host of other organizations dedicated to improving the quality of life in the Kalamazoo area. He truly cared about the community he represented.  Tony's leadership and dedication will be missed in each of these roles--but not nearlyas much as in his most important one. Tony leaves behind a wonderful wife and beautiful daughter. Over the years, my family grew close to Tony's. Our daughters are just a few years apart. We spent a great deal of time talking about the joys of fatherhood and our hopes and dreams for our daughters.  Shortly before Tony passed away, the two of us had an unforgettable discussion at his bedside. But as it became painfully clear that the end was near, Tony kept his love of life and sense of humor until the very end.  He explained to me what would happen if all politicians and leaders had received the same diagnosis he had. It would be amazing how quickly the mountains we've built between ourselves would come down. We'd realize that the important things--family, community, friends--really outshine everything else. Tony's words are an important lesson for us all.  His memory will continue to live in each of us and grow stronger as the days go by. The greatest tribute we can pay to this man is to care for our community, to fulfill our civic duties, love and support our families, and to understand his lesson.  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues today to share with me in recognizing the accomplishments of a dear friend, Tony Griffin.                          ____________________
