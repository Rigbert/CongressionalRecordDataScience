President, I came to the Senate floor and joined Senator Hatch in introducing S. 2520, the PROTECT Act in April, after the Supreme Court's decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, Free Speech. Although there were some others who raised constitutional concerns about specific provisions in that bill, I believed--and still believe--that unlike the Administration proposal it was a good faith effort to work within the First Amendment.  It is important that we respond to the Supreme Court decision but it is just as important that we avoid repeating our past mistakes. Unlike the 1996 Child Pornography Prevention Act, CPPA, this time we should respond with a law that passes constitutional muster. Our children deserve more than a press conference in on this issue. They deserve a law that will stick.  After joining Senator Hatch in introducing the PROTECT Act, I convened a Judiciary Committee hearing on the legislation. We heard from the Administration, from the Center for Missing and Exploited Children, CMEC, and from experts who came and told us that our bill, as introduced, would pass constitutional muster, but the House-passed bill would not.  I also placed S. 2520 on the Judiciary Committee's calendar for the October 8, 2002 business meeting. I continued to work with Senator Hatch to improve the bill so that it could be quickly enacted. Senator Hatch circulated a Hatch-Leahy proposed Judiciary Committee substitute that improved the bill before our October 8 business meeting. Unfortunately, the committee was unable to consider it because of procedural maneuvering that had nothing to do with this important legislation, including the refusal of committee members on the other side of the aisle to consider any pending legislation on the committee's agenda.  I still wanted to get this bill done. That is why for a week I have been working to clear and have the Senate pass a substitute to S. 2520 that tracks the Hatch-Leahy proposed committee substitute in every area but also made one improvement to the affirmative defense. That one improvement related to the ability of defendants to assert an affirmative defense to a charge of child pornography if they could actually prove that only adults, and no children--virtual or not--were used in making the material in question. Other than that, it was identical to the Hatch-Leahy proposed committee substitute in every way. It did not change the definition of child pornography from the PROTECT Act and it also did not change the tools provided to prosecutors. All these provisions remained unchanged. Indeed, the substitute I offered even adopted parts of the House bill which would help the CMEC to work with local and state law enforcement on these cases.  As I stated many days ago on the Senate floor, every single Democratic Senator cleared that measure. I then urged Republicans to work on their side of the aisle to clear this measure--so similar to the joint Hatch-Leahy substitute--so that we could swiftly enact a law that would pass constitutional muster.  Instead of working to clear that bipartisan, constitutional measure, however, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have opted to use this issue to play politics. They have redrafted the bill, changed crucial definitions, and are now offering a totally new version. Worse yet, the new version is not likely to pass Constitutional muster. Instead, if passed, it will lead to six more years of appellate litigation and yet another law struck down by the Supreme Court. That will help no one and certainly not help the children that these laws are intended to help.  Senator Hatch is offering a new version of the bill that experts have told us is plainly unconstitutional and does not respect or heed the parameters laid down by the Supreme Courtas does the original Hatch-Leahy bill and the Hatch-Leahy substitute circulated to the Judiciary Committee.  First, the new Hatch proposal outlaws precisely the thing that Justice Kennedy and at least 5 other members of the Supreme Court said could not be banned--wholly computer generated child pornography where no real children are involved in the making of the material. The Hatch proposal, in section 5, adds a totally new definition of ``child pornography'' that covers non-obscene ``computer generated images'' not at all related to any real person, if they are ``virtually indistinguishable'' from an actual minor. That is the same approach as the House bill, that we heard so roundly criticized both at our Committee hearing and by other experts. At best, it addresses the concerns of only Justice O'Connor--but she was not the deciding vote in the Free Speech case.  Second, this new definition is particularly problematic because the bill does not allow any affirmative defense for defendants who can show that no children at all were used in the making of the non-obscene image. Thus, even a defendant who can produce an actual 25-year-old in court to prove that the material is not child pornography can be sent to jail under this new provision. So too can the person who can prove in court that the image did not involve real people at all, but only totally computer generated images. Again, that is precisely the problem that Justice Kennedy and even Justice Thomas expressed concern about in the Free Speech case in considering the affirmative defense in the CPPA.  Third, the new Hatch proposal significantly changes the definition of the new crime of ``pandering'' from the original version of S. 2520 that Senator Hatch and I introduced. First, it removes the link to the long-standing obscenity test despite the fact that constitutional experts tell us that this link is necessary for the pandering crime to be constitutional. This changed definition does not address Justice Kennedy's concern that child pornography should be linked to obscenity. We do not want a situation where people who present such movies as Traffic, American Beauty, and Romeo and Juliet could be subjected to criminal prosecution, and this new pandering crime does that.  Second, the new provision compounds the constitutional problems by extending the provision to ``purported material'' in addition to actual material. Thus, not only need the pandering not relate to ``obscene'' material, it need not relate to any material at all.  From a provision that criminalized primarily commercial speech relating to obscene material, the new proposal has changed to criminalize pure ``chat,'' including over the Internet, about non-obscene child pornography. That is protected speech. I have a letter from Professor Fred Schauer, a nationally recognized First Amendment scholar who testified at our hearing, that I will place in the record that confirms that this change would render the provision pandering unconstitutional.  These are only some of the problems with the new Hatch language. I am disappointed that we could not work together to clear the prior substitute that I have been trying to clear through the Senate for almost a week. That proposal was virtually identical to the proposed Hatch-Leahy committee substitute, and was approved by every single Democratic Senator. If my colleagues would have been willing to do that, we would have had quick action on a law that would stick. Instead, we are being asked to consider a brand new version of S. 2520 with considerable constitutional problems. That is not the way to pass legislation quickly in the Senate.  Unlike Senator Hatch's prior proposals that I cosponsored, this provision will only offer the illusion of action. We need a law with teeth, not one with false teeth. In the end, this provision will be struck down just as was the 1996 CPPA and we will have wasted 6 more years without providing prosecutors the tools they need to fight child pornography and put in jeopardy any convictions obtained under a law that in the end is struck down as unconstitutional. I had hoped that we could work together to get a law that will clearly pass constitutional muster. This issue is too important for politics.  I ask that a letter from Frederick Schauer, Frank Stanton Professor of the First Amendment, be printed in the Record.  The material follows:  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                           Harvard University,                                   Cambridge, MA, October 3, 2002.     Re S. 2520.     Hon. Patrick Leahy,     U.S. Senate, Committee on the Judiciary,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Leahy: Following up on my written statement      and on my oral testimony before the Committee on Wednesday,      October 2, 2002, the staff of the committee has asked me to      comment on the constitutional implications of changing the      current version of S. 2520 to change the word ``material'' in      Section 2 of the bill (page 2, lines 17 and 19) to      ``purported material.''       In my opinion the change would push well over the      constitutional edge a provision that is now right up against      that edge, but probably barely on the constitutional side it.       As I explained in my statement and orally, the Supreme      Court has from the Ginzburg decision in 1966 to the Hamling      decision in 1973 to the Free Speech Coalition decision in      2002 consistently refused to accept that ``pandering'' may be      an independent offense, as opposed to being evidence of the      offense of obscenity (and, by implication, child      pornography). The basic premise of the pandering prohibition      S. 2520 is thus in some tension with more than thirty-five      years of Supreme Court doctrine. What may save the provision,      however, is the fact that pandering may also be seen as      commercial advertisement, and the commercial advertisement of      an unlawful product or service is not protected by the      Supreme Court's commercial speech doctrine, as the Court made      clear in both Virginia Pharmacy and also in Pittsburgh Press      v. Human Relations Commission, 413 U.S. 376 (1973). It is      important to recognize, however, that this feature of      commercial speech doctrine does not apply to non-commercial      speech, where the description or advocacy of illegal acts is      fully protected unless under the narrow circumstances, not      applicable here, of immediate incitement.       The implication of this is that moving away from      communication that could be described as an actual commercial      advertisement decreases the availability of this approach to      defending Section 2 of S. 2520. Although it may appear as if      advertising ``material'' that does not exist at all      (``purported material'') makes little difference, there is a      substantial risk that the change moves the entire section      away from the straight commercial speech category into more      general description, conversation, and perhaps even advocacy.      Because the existing arguments for the constitutionality of      this provision are already difficult ones after Free Speech      Coalition, anything that makes this provision less like a      straight offer to engage in a commercial transaction      increases the degree of constitutional jeopardy. By including      ``purported'' in the relevant section, the pandering locks      less commercial, and thus less like commercial speech, and      thus less open to the constitutional defense I outlines in my      written statement and oral testimony.       I hope that this is helpful.           Yours sincerely,                                            Frederick Schauer,                                           Frank Stanton Professor     of the First Amendment.                          ____________________
