 President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute to Tennessee Alloys Co. of Bridgeport, AL, for their remarkable health and safety record. On April 19, 1996, the Tennessee Alloys Co. plant reached the 4-year mark without a single lost time accident. During this time period, the plant worked a total of 678,585 hours. Mr. President, this is an outstanding accomplishment.  Tennessee Alloys Co. is a producer of ferroalloys, and employs nearly 80 people. It is a joint venture of Applied Industrial Materials Corp., the managing partner, and Allegheny Ludlum Corp. Specifically, Tennessee Alloys Co. manufactures 50 percent ferrosilicon, 75 percent ferrosilicon, and high purity ferrosilicon. These products are a critical element used in the production of iron castings and steel and have special application in high performance generators, transformers, and motors.  Bridgeport plant manager Jerry Rich and his management team deserve special recognition on this occasion, as do the Tennessee Alloys Co.'s other hard working employees. Tennessee Alloys Co. sets a fine example by demonstrating the importance of high productivity balanced with concern for the health and safety of employees. This balance is not possible without the total commitment of both employees and management who take great pride in their work and their company. I would therefore like to recognize Tennessee Alloys Co. for its outstanding health and safety record and wish them continued success in the future.                          ____________________
