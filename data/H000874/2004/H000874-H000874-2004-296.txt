Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I understand his analysis of the last 6 months; we have had a good growth in the last 6 months. Not as good, contrary to what the gentleman says, as we had in terms of the Clinton years, because where we grew 23 million new jobs, we have still lost jobs. The gentleman pointed out we raised 300,000 jobs. As he knows, 100,000 of those were returning workers from the strikes around the country.  But the point I would make is that in 1993 when we adopted the Clinton economic program, Mr. Armey and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. DeLay), I cannot say the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Nussle), but Mr. Kasich was then the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, they said that program was going to destroy America's economy, we would lose jobs, have high deficits and high unemployment and high interest rates. In fact, exactly the opposite happened, and we had the best economy we have had in the history of the country.
