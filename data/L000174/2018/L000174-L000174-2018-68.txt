President, on behalf of all Vermonters, I want to honor Clara Ayer of East Montpelier, VT, who will this month be inducted into the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame, in recognition of her status as an emerging leader in the Vermont agriculture community. Clara is a proud 2010 alumna of Cornell University with a degree dairy science who, after graduation, went to work for Yankee Farm Credit. She began working full time at Fairmount Farm, a third-generation dairy farm, alongside her brother Ricky in 2014. Clara is married to Dana Ayer, and the couple has a little boy, Carson. She is a well-respected advocate for agriculture, both in Montpelier and Washington, DC.  In addition to her membership in several dairy-related organizations, Clara also promotes dairy to young people, through a ``Life on the Farm'' summer camp, through educational field trips by the local elementary school, and through the formation of a Dairy 4-H Club. As Clara has provided exceptional service to the Vermont dairy community, further described in her well-deserved nomination to the Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame, I ask unanimous consent that the citation of her nomination be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:       Vermont Agricultural Hall of Fame 2018 Inductee Clara Ayer       Clara is a third-generation dairy farmer and family farm      advocate. She works alongside her family at Fairmount Farm,      where she wears many hats from overseeing human resources for      their staff of fifty employees, to bookkeeping, to marketing,      and events management. She plays an active role in shaping      agricultural policy through her advocacy at the Vermont      Statehouse, and in Washington D.C. as part of her work as an      Agri-Mark Young Cooperator and member of the National Milk      Producers' Federation. She currently serves as the secretary      of the Vermont Holstein Association, and is a delegate of      both Vermont and New England Dairy Promotion. Clara also      created and manages a ``Life on the Farm'' summer camp for      youth, which offers kids the opportunity to experience      agriculture through fun, educational on-farm activities.      Clara graduated from Cornell University in 2010 with a B.A.      in Dairy Science. She and her husband Dana are excited to be      raising their two-year-old son, Carson, on the family farm.                          ____________________
