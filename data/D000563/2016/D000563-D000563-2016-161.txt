There is no town too small and no suburb too wealthy to avoid the opioid addiction, leading to heroin in 80 percent of the cases and heroin overdoses and deaths.  If you pick up an obituary column in downstate Illinois, my home area--small towns and rural areas, much like West Virginia--and you see the name or photograph of someone between the ages of 18 and 30, I have to tell you that in most instances, it is this--a heroin overdose. It is a sad reality all across my State.
