This remarkable event, which will bring together students from over 40 area high schools, will take place on Saturday, March 17, 2007, at Woodland Park in Portage, IN.  The Portage Youth Commission was established in 2002 after local officials recognized the need for greater participation from the youth in the community. They knew the youth had a very influential voice, and that voice needed to be heard. Advised by Mayor Doug Olson and Councilwoman Olga Velasquez, the commission, made up of high school students from the city of Portage, has become a very significant component of the Portage community. Through their efforts, the commission has successfully founded a Youth Service Day and an annual charity art auction, and they have also sponsored various other events focused on the community's youth.  With this year's Youth Leadership Summit, the Portage Youth Commission hopes to set the tone for years to come. During this event, students from all parts of Northwest Indiana will come together to share experiences and learn valuable leadership skills that will benefit them throughout their lifetimes. The goal of the commission is that by learning from each other, as well as teaching each other, these students will realize that they are the leaders of tomorrow, and it is up to them to take responsibility for the progress of their communities and their Nation.  A special guest at this year's event will be Brett Eastburn, a motivational speaker who will address the students on the need for leaders to emerge in their generation. The summit will also consist of various exercises and activities aimed at promoting leadership qualities and a roundtable discussion on the importance of leaders in society.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in recognizing the efforts of the Portage Youth Commission and the organizers of their first annual Youth Leadership Summit as they strive to educate the youth of Northwest Indiana on the importance of true leaders in our society. Their inspiring efforts are to be commended.                          ____________________
