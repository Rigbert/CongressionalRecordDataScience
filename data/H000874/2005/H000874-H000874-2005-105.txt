Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues to reflect upon the life and service of Ed Roybal. I had a great privilege in that I served all of the time that he and I served together, from 1981 until his retirement.  I had the opportunity to serve on two of the appropriations subcommittees with Congressman Roybal. First on the Labor Health Subcommittee, on which I now serve with his daughter Lucille who does an extraordinary job and of whom I know he is extraordinarily proud. I then served with him as well on the Treasury Postal Subcommittee, a subcommittee that was very important to me in my district because of my Federal employees.  I was a young, new Member. Ed Roybal was a mentor. Ed Roybal was someone who had great experience and wisdom and who taught me much as a Member of the House of Representatives. He taught me about commitment to people and keeping people uppermost in our minds as we considered the policies before the House and before the Appropriations Committee.  I was privileged to work with Ed Roybal. I was privileged to learn from Ed Roybal. I was privileged to know a gentleman, an American, a proud Mexican-American, and an American who made a difference.  Lucille, as you sit there and listen to us talk, and you and I have talked before, I know that you are extraordinarily proud to be the daughter of an American who made a difference, of a Mexican-American who made his people proud, of a Californian who represented his State well.  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to rise to honor the memory and the record of a great American, my friend and mentor, Chairman Ed Roybal.                          ____________________
