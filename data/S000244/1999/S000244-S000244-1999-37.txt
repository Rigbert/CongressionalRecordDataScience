Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 1655, the Department of Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Authorization Act of 1999, is the first stand-alone R energy bill to be considered on the floor of the House since 1988.  This bill authorizes $3.878 billion for fiscal year 2000 and $4.099 billion for fiscal year 2001 for the Department of Energy's Supply, Science, and Fossil Energy and Energy Conservation R programs.  Highlights of the bill's authorization for fiscal years 2000 and 2001 include the following: First, it boosts spending for solar and renewable energy technologies. Including the already authorized Hydrogen Research Program and related Office of Science Programs, the bill recommends $401.9 million in fiscal year 2000 for these programs, an increase of $26.8 million, or 6.7 percent above the amount appropriated for fiscal year 1999; and recommends $418.1 million for fiscal year 2001, an increase of $16.8 million, or 4.0 percent above the amount recommended for fiscal year 2000.  Second, the bill revitalizes the DOE's moribund Nuclear Energy Program and recommends $115.7 million in fiscal year 2000 for nuclear energy, an increase of $24.3 million, or 26.6 percent above the amount appropriated for fiscal year 1999 and $3.4 million above the administration's request; and recommends $127.3 million for fiscal year 2001, an increase of $11.5 million, or 9.9 percent above the amount recommended for fiscal year 2000.  Third, the bill preserves and strengthens the Nation's High Energy Physics program, fully funds U.S. participation on the Large Hadron Collider at CERN and prevents layoffs at the two premier U.S. High Energy Physics facilities, Firmi National Accelerator Laboratory, Fermilab, and the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, SLAC.                              {time}  1400  Fourth, the bill also preserves and strengthens the Nation's nuclear physics program, prevents the closure of MIT/Bates Accelerator Center, and increases operations at the two premier nuclear physics facilities, the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Lab in New York.  Fifth, the bill fully funds important biological and environmental research on the human genome and global climate change, as well as basic environmental research.  Sixth, the bill provides robust funding for basic energy sciences, including significant increases to the operating funds for the Nation's existing premier synchroton and neutron sources, and $100 million to initiate construction of the Spallation Neutron Source at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.  Seventh, the bill reinvigorates DOE's fusion energy sciences, and recommends $250 million in fiscal year 2000 and $275 million in fiscal year 2001 to allow increased operations at the Nation's three premier fusion energy facilities, the DIII-D at General Atomics, the Alcator-C Mod at MIT, and the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab, as well as accelerated exploration of advanced magnetic and inertial fusion energy concepts.  Eighth, the bill makes a strong commitment to ensuring the clean and efficient use of the Nation's plentiful supply of fossil fuels, and includes $25 million in fiscal year 2000 and $50 million in fiscal year 2001 for a fossil energy science initiative for grants to be competitively awarded and subject to peer review for research relating to energy efficiency.  And, ninth, the bill also maintains a strong commitment to energy efficiency, and also includes $25 million in fiscal year 2000 and $50 million in fiscal year 2001 for an energy efficiency science initiative for grants to be competitively awarded and subject to peer review for research relating to energy efficiency.  The bill also contains a number of funding limitations and prohibitions that address amounts of funds that may be reprogrammed; demonstration projects; general plant and construction projects; obligation of funds for the construction of the Spallation Neutron Source; U.S. participation in the international thermonuclear experimental reactor engineering design activities; travel costs for DOE and its contractors or subcontractors; noncompetitive financial assistance awards to trade associations and awards of management and operating contract for DOE civilian energy labs; awards, amendments, or modifications of contracts that deviate from the Federal acquisition regulation; and preparation or initiation of requests for proposals for unauthorized programs, projects or activities.  In addition, the bill also prohibits the Secretary of Energy from admitting to any classified area of any DOE-owned or -operated nonmilitary energy laboratory, except for specific laboratories, an individual who is a citizen of a nation that is named on the DOE list of sensitive countries, unless the Secretary waives the prohibition on a case-by-case basis if it is determined that such access is necessary for the furtherance of U.S. civilian science.  I commend the bill to the House for its adoption.  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.
