 President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1409       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Middle East Peace Compliance      Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) On September 9, 1993, Palestinian Liberation      Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat made the following      commitments in an exchange of letters with Prime Minister of      Israel Yitzhak Rabin:       (A) ``The PLO recognizes the right of the State of Israel      to exist in peace and security.''.       (B) ``The PLO accepts United Nations Security Council      Resolutions 242 and 338'' pertaining to the cessation of      hostilities and the establishment of a just and lasting peace      in the Middle East.       (C) ``The PLO commits itself to the Middle East peace      process, and to a peaceful resolution of the conflict between      the two sides and declares that all outstanding issues      relating to permanent status will be resolved through      negotiations.''.       (D) ``The PLO considers that the signing of the Declaration      of Principles constitutes a historic event, inaugurating a      new epoch of peaceful coexistence, free from violence and all      other acts which endanger peace and stability. Accordingly,      the PLO renounces the use of terrorism and other acts of      violence and will assume responsibility over all PLO elements      and personnel in order to assure their compliance, prevent      violence and discipline violators.''.       (E) ``In view of the promise of a new era and the signing      of the Declaration of Principles and based on Palestinian      acceptance of Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, the      PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant      which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the      Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this      letter are now inoperative and no longer valid.''.       (2) The Palestinian Authority, the governing body of      autonomous Palestinian territories, was created as a result      of the agreements between the PLO and the State of Israel      that are a direct outgrowth of the September 9, 1993,      commitments.       (3) The United States Congress has provided authorities to      the President to suspend certain statutory restrictions      relating to the PLO, subject to Presidential certification      that the PLO has continued to abide by commitments made.     SEC. 3. REPORTS.       (a) In General.--The President shall, at the times      specified in subsection (b), transmit to Congress a report--       (1) detailing and assessing the steps that the PLO or the      Palestinian Authority, as appropriate, has taken to      substantially comply with its 1993 commitments, as specified      in section 2(1) of this Act;       (2) a description of the steps taken by the PLO or the      Palestinian Authority, as appropriate, to investigate and      prosecute those responsible for violence against American and      Israeli citizens;       (3) making a determination as to whether the PLO or the      Palestinian Authority, as appropriate, has substantially      complied with such commitments during the period since the      submission of the preceding report, or, in the case of the      initial report, during the preceding 6-month period; and       (4) detailing progress made in determining the designation      of the PLO, or one or more of its constituent groups      (including Fatah and Tanzim) or groups operating as arms of      the Palestinian Authority (including Force 17) as a foreign      terrorist organization, in accordance with section 219(a) of      the Immigration and Nationality Act.       (b) Transmission.--The initial report required under      subsection (a) shall be transmitted not later than 30 days      after the date of enactment of this Act. Each subsequent      report shall be submitted on the date on which the President      is next required to submit a report under the PLO Commitments      Compliance Act of 1989 (title VIII of Public Law 101-246) and      may be combined with such report.     SEC. 4. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS.       (a) In General.--If, in any report transmitted pursuant to      section 3, the President determines that the PLO or      Palestinian Authority, as appropriate, has not substantially      complied with the commitments specified in section 2(1), the      following sanctions shall apply:       (1) Suspension of assistance.--The President shall suspend      all United States assistance to the West Bank and Gaza except      for humanitarian assistance.

(c) Waiver Authority.--The President may waive any or all      of the sanctions imposed under this Act if the President      determines that such a waiver is in the national security      interest of the United States, and reports such a      determination to the appropriate committees of Congress.
