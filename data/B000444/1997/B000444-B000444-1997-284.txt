 President, in the spirit that these negotiations began with me and the chairman of the committee and Senator Kyl, we have continued that spirit. The next speaker we have is undeclared. So we have agreed for a total of 7 minutes he will get. We ask unanimous consent that 3\1/2\ minutes be taken out of the time of the Senator from Delaware and 3\1/2\ minutes out of the time of the Senator from North Carolina.
