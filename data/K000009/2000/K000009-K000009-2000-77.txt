Speaker, reserving the right to object, for the purpose of discussion, I want to just clarify, because we have some Members on this side who have brought amendments up just recently and we had not expected those. I wanted to make sure that those Members understood that under this unanimous consent agreement, which I will ultimately support, I do not believe that they would be able to bring their amendments up. I wanted to clarify that.  The only amendments that would be allowed would be those that have already been printed in the Record?
