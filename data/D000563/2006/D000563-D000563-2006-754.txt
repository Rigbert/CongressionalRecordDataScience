 What do we ask of these men and women in uniform? Quite simply, we say, take an oath to wear this uniform and risk your life for America--how much more could we ask--and they do it. And then they expect from us support--support when they are in the field and support when they come home.  I don't understand why there isn't a sense of outrage in this Congress on a bipartisan basis, on both sides of the aisle, that we are not only being ripped off as taxpayers by these no-bid contracts but that we are shortchanging these men and women who are risking their lives while we stand in the comfort and safety of this Senate.  I know Halliburton is a big political force in this town. I know in some quarters you are not supposed to question Halliburton. This is some sacred institution politically. I don't buy it. I count the soldiers that are putting their lives on the line to be much more sacred and much more valuable than any big, huge, no-bid corporation.  I say to the Senator from North Dakota, we have done this before, the two of us have joined together, and said let's put together a bipartisan commission that will ask the hard questions, a commission that will bring people in and put them under oath, find out if they are cheating us, find out if they are profiteering during a war, find out if they are shortchanging our soldiers, and let the chips fall where they may. If we find there is a violation of law, even if it reaches all the way to the boardroom, so be it.  How many times have we come to the Senate, I ask the Senator from North Dakota, refresh my memory, how many times have we brought this option to the Senate and said to our colleagues, please, for the sake of the troops, let's have real oversight, let's ask these questions.  How many times have we done this during the course of this 3-year war, I ask the Senator from North Dakota who has been the leader in this effort, and I have been glad to join him, how often have we tried?
