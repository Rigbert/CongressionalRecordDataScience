Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and celebrate thelife of Ed Jenkins, a fellow Georgian, a dedicated public servant, and a good friend. I had the honor of serving on the Ways and Means Committee alongside Congressman Jenkins.  Born in the small town of Jasper, Georgia, Congressman Jenkins would often describe himself as a country lawyer, but he was a country lawyer with an extensive knowledge of the tax system. He was knowledgeable; he was very informed. He was an advocate for the people and industries of Georgia. He was a champion of the South's textile industry and a fierce protector of the local economy.  Although often soft-spoken, Ed Jenkins bravely pressed for the facts of the Iran-Contra affair. He believed the American people deserved to hear the truth, and he was not afraid to speak out, he was not afraid to speak up.  He was thoughtful, considerate, a brave negotiator and an unbelievable, just excellent colleague. When I first came to Congress, he was so helpful and so caring. I learned so much from him. He was a good man, a decent human being. I never heard him say a mean thing about anyone.  I only wish we had more Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, with not just his demeanor, but with the pride he took in this institution and this Congress. He was very proud to be a Member of Congress and proud to be a member of the Ways and Means Committee, and that pride made him a powerful leader.  I can remember over the years each time the Ways and Means Committee came together for a reunion. He would always show up long after he retired from the Congress.  I was so sad to hear of his passing and would like to express my deepest sympathy to his wife, Jo; his daughters, Janice and Amy; and his entire family. As a Nation, we greatly benefited from his service. As a colleague, I learned so much from his example and his friendship.  He will be deeply missed by the people of Georgia, the people of this Nation. He made a lasting contribution to our country; and we must never, ever forget this good and great man.                          ____________________
