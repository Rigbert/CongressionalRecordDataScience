Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Chairman, I strongly support the Bunn amendment. I congratulate the gentleman from Oregon for his very, very strong sensitivity to the plight of teenagers and those who may find themselves pregnant.  His amendment, and I would have hoped that the rule would have made in order the cash payment as well, particularly as it went through, as he would have envisioned, a responsible adult, a guardian, a grandmother, perhaps, or a mother, so that it would act as a magnet to keep that child under the roof of that family and help to keep families together.  Regrettably, that is not to be, but this amendment as it is offered will provide tangible assistance to these teenagers, and I think it is a very appropriate amendment.
