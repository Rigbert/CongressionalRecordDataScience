The promised 200,000 high-skill, high-wage jobs have not materialized. Real wages in the United States have decreased by 3 percent, and in Mexico they have plummeted by over 50 percent. Even the Wall Street Journal now calls NAFTA ``a terrible disappointment.'' It's about time. The Journal itself made an awful lot of promises in regard to NAFTA.  Yet NAFTA's supporters now incredibly claim that Mexico has ``turned the corner''--but the financial markets tell us something different. Last week, the peso lost 7 percent of its value in one day, and hit a record low of 7.5 pesos to the dollar--a depreciation to less than half what the peso was worth before NAFTA. At the same time, interest rates jumped 9 percent. And the Mexican Bolsa--their stock market--has continued to plummet in value. This volatility is clearly due to a lack in confidence in Mexico's economy. So who should we believe: NAFTA's supporters, or the market? I'll take the market.  Why should Americans care about volatility in the Mexican market? Isn't it only the Wall Street fat cats and Mexican billionaires who play in that market? My friends, this volatility impacts each and every American as high-skill, high-wage United States jobs are continuing to be shipped to Mexico and our living standards continue to decline.  What is the connection? Think about the volatility in the Mexican market like this: it is like a garage sale for United States corporations. Because pesos cost only half of what they did before NAFTA, for United States corporations, everything in Mexico--including capital, taxes and labor costs--is half as expensive as it used to be. And that is not the end of the story.                              {time}  1845  United States corporations who operate in Mexico then export their goods from Mexico to the United States still charge us high prices for them. In short, it costs United States corporations half as much to manufacture their goods in Mexico so they are able to earn twice as much when they sell those same goods back here. It is no wonder that our corporations are moving production to Mexico at an accelerating rate.  NAFTA has become the deal of the century for them. In 1994, there were 2,000 maquiladora assembly plants along the border. At the end of this year there will be 2,600, an additional 30 percent. Just today, Lee jeans in St. Joseph, MO, announced it will terminate 479 workers, shutting production down there and moving those jobs to Mexico. Yesterday, Fruit of the Loom, an American staple company, said it will slash its U.S. work force, get ready, by 3,200 jobs to streamline operations here and boost profits, closing plants in Florence, AL, and Franklin, KY, Acadia Parish, LA, Batesville, MI and operations in Bowling Green, KY, Rockingham, NC, and the list goes on and on.  Where is the work going? You guessed it. Most of us know it is going south of our border to Mexican plants where Fruit of the Loom can pay Mexican workers less than $1 a day. I guarantee you that the prices of their products will not come down in our country when they ship it back here.  As our colleague the gentleman from Ohio, James Traficant, said today, America is now losing its pants because of trade agreements like NAFTA. Funny, but sad.  We teach our nation's young people that, when they make mistakes, they should admit them and take responsibility for them, not deny them or try to cover them up.  But NAFTA's supporters are in a state of serious denial. Let us hear no more empty rhetoric about Mexico's economy having turned the corner before NAFTA can be fixed. Those who foisted it upon us have to own up to the fact that it is broken.  NAFTA's supporters need to acknowledge that Mexico's economy is fundamentally unsound and that the agreement is costing us jobs and holding down our wages, and it is destabilizing Mexico. They need to take responsibility for what they have done to the working families of our continent. That would be the first step in the right direction; that would be true leadership.  Let me say that growing NAFTA job losses translate into real people like the 14,000 tomato farmers in southern Florida, the more than 2,000 workers being scheduled to be laid off at Briggs & Stratton in the State of Wisconsin. I will include the entire list in the Record here this evening. It is time to wake up, go back to the bargaining table and strike an agreement that works for working people across this continent.  Madam Speaker, I include for the Record the following information:             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 26, 1995]Two Years Later, the Promises Used to Sell Nafta Haven't Come True, But                         Its Foes Were Wrong, Too                             (By Bob Davis)       Washington.--Promises, promises.       Here's what was predicted two years ago for the North      American Free Trade Agreement, followed by what really      happened.       Prediction: ``I believe the Nafta will create 200,000      American jobs in the first two years of its effect,''      President Clinton said, flanked by three of his predecessors      in the Oval Office.       Reality: No evidence of any overall job gain as a result of      trade with Mexico.       Prediction: Quaker Oats Co. said it would add 61 U.S. jobs      in Dallas, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and St. Joseph, Mo., if Nafta      passed, by shifting Gatorade, pancake mix and oatmeal      production from Mexico.       Reality: Quaker Oats continues to make the stuff in Mexico.      No new Nafta related jobs at the factories.       Prediction: ``I believe that you have to just say that the      peso would become stronger if Nafta passes,'' said Mr.      Clinton, ``because it would strengthen the Mexican economy.''       Reality: He should leave futures trading to his wife.                          views of nafta foes       Hardly anything anyone said about Nafta during the      congressional fight, including Nafta foes, has turned out to      be true. That's a problem for all the big players in Nafta,      particularly President Clinton. Meantime, many Nafta foes      consider the trade pact a symbol of fat cat Washington, where      promises aren't kept and the little guy always loses. For      them, says Nafta-opponent Pat Choate: ``Nafta was their first      real issue. They lost by a hair. They feel the vote was      stolen by the president. And it's turned out worse, than they      expected.''       Of course, Nafta's ultimate impact won't be known for      years. But measured by promises used to sell it. Nafta is a      colossal disappointment. Jobs haven't materialized, border-     area congestion has worsened, and environmental cleanup      remains haphazard. But Ross Perot had it wrong, too. He      warned that Nafta would put six million U.S. factory jobs      ``at risk.'' Instead, U.S. manufacturers have added about      300,000 jobs since he made the prediction. Nafta probably      limited the length of the Mexican recession by boosting      exports to the U.S., while also helping some chronically      depressed border towns.       At its core, Nafta is a pact to eliminate tariffs among the      U.S. Canada and Mexico over 15 years, and protect investments      in all three countries. Judging strictly by these criteria,      it works. Two-way trade between the U.S. and Mexico--Canada      already had its own free-trade pact with the U.S.--has grown      30% since 1993.       But Nafta's significance was always greater than trade      statistics; it was a new model for economic development. A      big industrialized nation would merge economically with an      impoverished neighbor, without paying billions of dollars in      aid as the European Union did when pulling in poorer      relations. Liberalized trade and investment would make Mexico      weathier, the White House said, opening markets and creating      jobs. Results were promised--fast.       Improvements should be most obvious at the border, where      trade's impact is the strongest. Lured by cheap wages and      tariff breaks, U.S. companies have run factories on the      Mexican side for 30 years--and aggravated health hazards      as factories and a burgeoning population poured refuse      into canals on the Mexican side. By cutting tariffs      throughout Mexico, the White House argued, development      would extend inland, while environmental funds would clean      up the border.       What really happened?       So-called maquiladora border factories--which import auto      parts and electronics, process them and send them north      again--have boomed. Foreign investment in the interior has      withered. In the nearly two years since Nafta took effect on      Jan. 1, 1994, maquiladora employment rose 20% to 648,000,      according to the Mexican forecasting arm of WEFA Group Inc.      By the year 2000, it will reach 943,000, the consulting firm      predicts.       Maria Luna takes home $31 a week assembling seatbelts at a      TRW Inc. factory in Reynosa, Mexico, a few miles south of      Brownsville, Texas. How has her life changed since Nafta? A      niece from Veracruz recently joined her to seek work and      crowd into Ms. Luna's garage-sized shack with 10 others.      ``People still come,'' she says. ``They though they'd stay      here a little time, but they stay.''       The border boom results largely from Mexico's peso      devaluation, which cut overall labor costs, including      benefits, to $1.80 an hour from $2.54. Human factors      contribute, too. U.S. managers can live in comfortable homes      in Brownsville and El Paso in Texas or in San Diego, sending      their children to American schools and commuting across the      border to work. That can't be duplicated in Mexico's      interior, whose lousy roads and telephone lines also scare      off U.S. companies.       One expanding shantytown is Colonia Salinas de Gortari,      named for the former Mexican president, on the outskirts of      Reynosa. Workers there so they can't afford city rents      anymore, so they seize land and build plywood shacks the size      of tool sheds, with no running water, no sewage, no      electricity, no paved streets. Maria Del Carmen Garcia Luna,      who isn't related to Ms. Luna, lives in one of the shacks      with her toddler and husband, a Zenith maintenance worker.                     Not Enough money for children       In the U.S., jobs like her husband's are the backbone of      countless blue-collar neighborhoods. But he takes home only      $26 a week, and merely buying powered milk for the child      consumers 15% of it. ``We don't have      enough money for meat or chicken,'' she says.       About the best Nafta has done so far is to limit the impact      of the Mexican crisis on the U.S., while offering Mexico a      chance to export its way out of trouble. During the last      crisis in 1982, U.S. border communities were crippled as      Mexico sharply raised tariffs and restricted imports. This      time, Mexico kept tariffs at Nafta-reduced levels and pushed      exports.       In Brownsville, retailers complain that few Mexicans can      afford to shop there for clothes and electronics anymore. But      Brownsville's port, which serves the industrial hub of      Monterrey, is booming. Cranes load five-foot-high coils of      steel into the black-hulled ``Sunny Success,'' bound for      Italy. Port managers lobby for a new bridge to ease border      transport. Local unemployment remains distressingly high,      around 11%, but it hasn't surged, as in 1982.       However, Nafta has failed to deliver on the biggest White      House promise: creating U.S. jobs.       During the Nafta debate, Fortune 500 companies forecast job      gains, which now look foolishly naive, Johnson & Johnson says      it can't locate the person who in 1993 forecast ``800 more      U.S. positions'' as a result of Nafta. ``If there is job      growth, I don't think that's because of Nafta,'' says a      spokesman.       Some big-time exporters do report gains, General Electric      Co. says sales of power equipment and locomotives are up, as      Mexico upgrades its infrastructure. But the company notes      carefully that this work ``isn't creating jobs, it's      supporting jobs.'' In other words, Nafta makes it less likely      that GE will have to lay off workers.                           special nafta math       U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor gamely argues that      Nafta ``created a huge number of net jobs.'' But he needs      special Nafta math to do so. He counts just export growth--     not jobs lost through imports--and adds in Canada. Mr.      Clinton only cited trade with Mexico in his job-growth      prediction, and for good reason. Canada's free-trade      agreement with the U.S. dates to 1989; Nafta barely affected      their trade relations.       Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Institute for      International Economics whose predictions of Nafta job gains      were embraced by the Clinton and Bush White Houses, now      figures the surging trade deficit with Mexico has cost the      U.S. 225,000 jobs. But such estimates are suspect, too. With      the U.S. economy near what's considered to be full      employment, it's difficult to know how many workers actually      lost jobs as a result of Nafta and whether they found new      ones quickly. The Labor Department has certified only 21,500      workers for special unemployment benefits because they lost      their jobs as a result of trade with Mexico.       The Clinton administration pins much blame for missed      promises on the peso's collapse last December, when Mexico      ran out of dollars to support it. The country had become to      dependent on short-term borrowing to finance imports and      didn't recognize enough that it had to devalue.       Some economists say Nafta helped cause delay. It let Mexico      see itself as part of the industrial elite, a self-image      reinforced when it joined the rich-nation Organization for      Economic Cooperation and Development. In August 1994, an      internal U.S. Treasury analysis found the peso overvalued by      10%, but noted Mexico didn't agree because it expected a      Nafta surge.       Optimists contend the Mexican economy will start growing      soon. Yet the peso mess and ensuing recession have pushed the      benefits far into the future. ``If people notice anything      with Nafta, they notice more traffic because there's more      trade,'' says Alfredo Phillips, who runs a border development      bank, ``Expected improvements haven't occurred.'' He then      adds a new prediction: ``We expect we'll see them next      year.''                          ____________________
