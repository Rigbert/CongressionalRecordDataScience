 Established in 1958, Galilee Baptist Church has become a center of faith, hope, and community for several generations of Kalamazoo residents. Over the past five decades, the church and its congregation have undergone many periods of expansion, but have never lost their enthusiasm for the Lord and His powerful word.  I am proud and fortunate to represent the citizens of southwest Michigan because we believe in continually striving to improve our way of life. Because of the good works of the people of Galilee Baptist Church, Michigan is truly a better place to live, work, and worship.  Again, it is my honor to stand today in recognition of the Galilee Baptist Church for its 50 years of service and spiritual outreach to the residents of Kalamazoo, Michigan.                          ____________________
