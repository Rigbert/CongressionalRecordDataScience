Having served their Northwest Indiana surroundings with their charitable efforts, Lodge 1152 is to be commended. The always-prospering establishment will be commemorating this magnificent milestone on July 25, 2009. Not only will this small community be celebrating the longstanding history of their lodge, but they will be celebrating the spirit of Elkdom everywhere.  Since its humble beginning in 1909, the Elks of Gary have been an ambitious bunch and have grown considerably since the time of their first establishment. Beginning with the meeting of thirty-four pioneers, the Gary Lodge 1152 was founded under its first Exalted Ruler, William P. Gleason. After hosting their gatherings in the Feuer building for more than a year, the Gary Elks felt it was time to expand and began construction of a building at 610 Washington Street, which would become home to the Lodge's meetings for the next seventeen years.  They remained there until 1928 when a new three story lodge was built at 8th Avenue and Broadway, which was necessary to comfortably accommodate their increasing civic activities. Among the perks of this new location was the WJKS radio station that very quickly became a tenant of the new establishment, based on an agreement that the broadcasting company would air an eleven o'clock toast nationally and nightly. Elks from as far as Alaska would begin gathering around local turrets to pay respect to their Absent Brothers, thankful to the Gary Lodge for its commitment to sustaining the National Elk community. Due to woes of the Great Depression, the Elks of Gary sold their building and relocated to 633 Washington Street until 1942, when they again moved to a more convenient location at 5th and Jefferson. Assisted by some of the Elks' skilled craftsmen and volunteers, the new building was refurbished to reflect the glory of the Gary Elks.  After 60 years in Gary, members of Lodge 1152 were relocated to the City of Hobart. It was there that they claimed their sanctuary on 61st Avenue. After about a year of construction, the first initiation was held on December 4, 1970. As an improved Hobart Lodge 1152, the Elks flourished so dramatically that they grew too large for the walls of their current structure, and henceforth built their latest addition, the Jubilee Room.  As the Elks of Hobart grew in number, so did their charitable contributions to the city. Such support was allocated to Boy Scout troops, Soccer Shoot and Hoop Shoot programs, and scholarship-worthy students throughout the region. This philanthropy was also expressed through contributions to organizations such as the Elks National Foundation, Cancer Fund, and Parade of Nickels. Additionally, the Hobart Elks have been actively involved with the veterans of Northwest Indiana, namely through their annual Flag Day Celebration.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring and congratulating the Hobart Elks Lodge 1152 on its centennial celebration. Through the years, the establishment's members have graced us with their patriotism and benevolence, and I am truly honored to represent them in Washington, D.C.                          ____________________
