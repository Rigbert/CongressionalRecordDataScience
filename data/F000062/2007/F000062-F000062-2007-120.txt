 President, today I recognize the 50 years of great work by the League to Save Lake Tahoe.  The League to Save Lake Tahoe has a long history of fighting to protect what I consider to be the crown jewel of the Sierra. The league was founded in 1957 as the Tahoe Improvement and Conservation Association to fight runaway development in one of our Nation's most beautiful regions. Since then, its membership has grown to 4,500 people, but its mission remains the same: to protect Lake Tahoe's famously clear waters and the surrounding area's natural beauty.  Protecting Lake Tahoe is an issue very dear to my heart. My love for Tahoe goes back to my childhood, when I attended camp and rode horses through its beautiful forests. Today however, the lake's health is threatened. Water clarity has declined from 102 feet in 1968 to 68 feet today, and the forests are more susceptible to catastrophic wildfires.  The League to Save Lake Tahoe was influential in developing the Environmental Improvement Program that identified actions that needed to be taken to help restore Lake Tahoe and instrumental in organizing the 1997 Presidential Forum. The league has continued to display an unwavering commitment to protecting the irreplaceable natural resources the Lake Tahoe Basin is blessed with.  I would like to congratulate the League to Save Lake Tahoe on a half century of outstanding environmental stewardship and wish them the best of luck in their continuing mission to Keep Tahoe Blue.                          ____________________
