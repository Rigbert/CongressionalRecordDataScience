President, this has been a good debate. I would like to have the same debate of 3 hours, 4 hours as we talked on the McCain-Lieberman amendment on this amendment because it should be essentially the same thing. As I said before, it is not.  One point I neglected to mention, since they talk in the findings about what is happening in the Arctic, one of the reports we used specifically said that the temperature in the Arctic during the late thirties and early forties was greater than it is today.  In this brief time, I only repeat what the National Academy of Sciences stated in their written report--not in any kind of press release but their written report:        . . . there is considerable uncertainty in current      understanding of how the climate system varies naturally and      reacts to emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. . . .        . . . a casual linkage between the buildup of greenhouse      gases and the observed climate changes in the 20th century      cannot be unequivocally established.       The IPCC Summary for Policymakers could give an impression      that the science of global warming is settled, even though      many uncertainties still remain.  That is the National Academy of Sciences.  Lastly, we are refuting not just if we adopt this resolution, which I think we will adopt because it is an easy vote for a lot of people and nobody is going to pay a lot of attention to a sense of the Senate, the fact is, we had 17,800 scientists in the Oregon petition who said:       There is no convincing scientific evidence that human      release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse      gasses is causing or will, in the foreseeable future, cause      catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption      of the Earth's climate. Moreover, there is substantial      scientific evidence that increases in atmospheric carbon      dioxide produce many beneficial effects upon the natural      plant and animal environment of the Earth.  If we adopt this amendment, we are saying that science that has been refuted is a reality.
