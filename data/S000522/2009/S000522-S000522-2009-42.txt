Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the resolution today which honors the OSCE's Mediterranean Partners of Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria. And I do want to express deepest respect and gratitude to Alcee Hastings for his groundbreaking work with each of those six partners. Mr. Hastings is theformer President of the Parliamentary Assembly, and now serves as Special Representative on Mediterranean Affairs, and is trying to bring the Helsinki process, the three baskets of the Helsinki Final Act, which emphasize economic issues, human rights issues and security issues and, really, to bring that good, positive process that has worked wonders over the years in election reform. Mr. Hastings has observed--how many is it now, Alcee?
