 President, on another matter and a sad matter, I wish to start with news of the passing of John Hanford. John was a World War II vet, a great patriot, and the dear brother of our colleague, Senator Dole, who I know is very close to him and will miss him terribly.  This is a sad day for the Dole family, and I wish to extend our deepest sympathies to Senator Dole and all her relatives and friends.                          ____________________
