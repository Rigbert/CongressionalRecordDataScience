 We are working hard on both sides of the aisle to get a bill to the President, and this is part of that process. I concur with him that we are working through this, and our hope is to get up some more amendments tomorrow morning. We should be able to announce that later tonight or tomorrow morning.  Again, I thank the chairman of the committee.                          ____________________
