 President, I will take a moment to congratulate the individuals from Central Academy in Des Moines, IA who participated in the We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution national finals in Washington, DC. This event is the culmination of extensive study by students throughout the country of the American system of constitutional democracy. The students from Central Academy won the State competition in West Des Moines and thus were given the distinction of representing Iowa in the national finals. I had the opportunity to meet with these students when they were in Washington and I am certainly proud to have had them representing the great State of Iowa. I am also pleased that my staff member, Aaron McKay, was able to be involved in this program as a judge for both the Iowa competition and the national finals as well as acting as a mentor for the team going into the finals. The We the People: The Citizen and the Constitution program, run by the Center for Civic Education with the help of Federal funding, provides an outstanding curriculum that promotes civic competence and responsibility among elementary and secondary students. Students take away a solid understanding of the origin of American constitutional democracy as well as the contemporary relevance of our founding documents and ideals. In short, it produces better citizens. In fact, I would like to personally recognize the Central Academy students who participated in this program, Alexander Body, Alec Davis, Ainslee Ericson, Joanna Grillas, Brian Haroldson, Daren Ho, Meryl Houser, Jonathon Kent, Michael Larking, Conrad Lee, Kyle McCord, Jasmine McDowell, Eleanore Neumann, Timothy Smith, Akili Thomas, Sarah Wang, Kyle Wilkinson, Jay Williams and their teacher, Harvey Kimble. They can all be very proud of their knowledge and accomplishments. I look forward to next year's competition.                          ____________________
