Mr. Payson had a very good year. Alan Wise at Coventry gets $21.6 million. This man must be really gifted if he is worth that to run a managed care company, which is nowgoing to be in the category of companies eligible for the $10 billion Federal subsidy.  Down here is United Health Group, where R. Channing Wheeler is getting $9.5 million. I bet he was embarrassed going to the country club with his friends and only making $9.5 million.  Incidentally, United Health Group--do I remember that name from the AARP newsletter? Yes. It turns out they are in business together. It turns out that AARP, which is for this bill, is in business with United Health Group, a managed care company. Frankly, as I understand it, 60 percent of the revenues of AARP come through their insurance and advertising. Is it any wonder that AARP is pushing for this bill, when seniors are opposed to it?  I want to close because I see other colleagues in the Chamber. I say to seniors across America: If you have received your AARP solicitation and sent back your membership card, please call AARP at 1-800-424-3410. Tell them to stand up for seniors for a change, to reject this bad bill that won't result in lower prescription drug costs and will privatize Medicare.  Tell them you are opposed to a slush fund that is being created for HMOS. Tell them you think it is scandalous that we give $6 billion to Golden Rule for health savings accounts. And tell them it is time for your organization, AARP, to stand up for seniors and stand up for Medicare instead of caving in to the special interest groups and supporting this legislation.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
