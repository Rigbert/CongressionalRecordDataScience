His outstanding dedication put forth toward public service has allowed him the opportunity to enrich the lives of countless individuals.  For his tremendous passion to serve those in need and to encourage others to do the same, Chester is a true leader and an inspiration. He has accomplished so much throughout his life and I am grateful for his numerous contributions to the community of Northwest Indiana. Chester, a retired steelworker, founded the American Steelworkers National Day, a day that honors steelworkers who have been committed to improving the quality of life for people in Northwest Indiana. Chester is also the founder of the local chapter of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Old-Timers, an organization that brings people together through public service. Another project that Chester has organized and developed is the Hammond Tech Appreciation Society, which recognizes and honors the faculty and alumni of Hammond Tech High School. In addition to these wonderful organizations, Chester is also a member of American Legion Post 261 in Cedar Lake, Indiana, and has given much of his time to the Crown Point Little League and the Chester Stanley Lobodzinski Hope Foundation for cancer patients, among others. Chester's unwavering perseverance and his enthusiastic outlook when it comes to community service is to be admired, and he is worthy of our highest praise.  Chester's dedication to public service and the community of Northwest Indiana is exceeded only by his devotion to his amazing family. Chester and his lovely wife, Lurene, have been happily married for almost fifty years. They raised four beloved children: Cathy, Stan, Tim, and the late Anita, and have two adoring grandchildren. Mr. Speaker, Chester Lobodzinski has always given his time and efforts generously and compassionately. I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring him for his exceptional charitable work. Chester continues to touch the lives of countless people, and for his unselfish, lifelong commitment, he is to be commended.                          ____________________
