 President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today, it stand in adjournment until 11 a.m. on Tuesday, June 15. I further ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, immediately following the prayer, the Journal of proceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed to have expired, and the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the day.
