Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to our departing colleague from Maryland, Congressman Kweisi Mfume.  For the past 10 years, the people of Maryland's Seventh District have benefited from the representation of Congressman Mfume.  Representative Mfume's political career began as a Baltimore City Council member where he promoted the causes of his inner-city constituents. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1986 and recently served on the Banking and Financial Services and Small Business committees.  His record reflects a dedication of addressing the needs of his district while balancing those with the needs of the Nation. His hard work and legislative ability have earned him the respect of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  Representative Mfume's outspoken support of civil rights and other traditional minority concerns lead to his election as Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus in 1992, where he elevated the level of influence for the caucus to a new level.  I wish Congressman Mfume good luck as he assumes his new responsibilities as chief executive officer of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, where he will have a new platform to fight for the causes he believes in. This is an exciting opportunity for him and I know I am joined by my colleagues in wishing him continued success.                          ____________________
