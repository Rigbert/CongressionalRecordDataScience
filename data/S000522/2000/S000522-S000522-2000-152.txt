Mr. Speaker, the fall of the Soviet Union saw the emergence of open anti-Semitism in Russia. While the government was abandoning its official policy of discrimination against Jews, anti-Semitism was being resurrected by certain political and social elements within Russian society, or ``privatized,'' as one observer put it.  Not that anti-Semitism is a distinctly Russian phenomenon. Our own history has shown that at times of economic difficulties or societal challenge extremist figures and groups peddling anti-Semitic or other hate philosophies may arise within our midst.  Nevertheless, I was surprised and disturbed when the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews called my attention to a recent article in the Russian newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta entitled ``Strategy of `Globallization Leadership' For Russia. First Priority Indirect Strategic Actions To Ensure National Security.'' This article was penned by a Mr. Alexandr Ignatov, the director of a think tank under the jurisdiction of the Presidential Administration of Russia. In his lengthy opus, the author asserts that the activities of a ``world government'' are a key influence on globalization processes, and that a ``Hasidic-paramasonic group'' has usurped power within this world government. Moreover, this ``Hasidic-paramasonic group'' has allegedly decided that Russia should be excluded from leadership in the globalization process and be viewed exclusively as a source of raw materials for the ``New World Order.''  This ``usurpation of power in the world government by the Hasidic-paramasonic group requires immediate correction,'' says Mr.Ignatov, which should include such initiatives as establishing Orthodox and Islam as state religions and imposing a departure tax on persons of childbearing age and ``trained specialists.''  Mr. Speaker, what can we say? Do Mr. Putin and others in the Russian Government take seriously the advice of people who prattle on about ``Hasidic-paramasonic'' groups usurping power in a so-called ``world government''? The Ignatov article is, at best, a vacuous ramble about the ``New World Order and world government, and, at worst, a vicious piece of anti-Semitism reflecting the mind set of the Protocols of the Elders of Zion. To wrap fish in it would be to insult fish.  For the record, the Russian Orthodox Church, for all its claims as the historic Christian faith in Russia, has rejected the idea of becoming the state church. Even the Soviet government backed down from the departure tax idea back in the early 1980s.  In my opinion, this article is unworthy of Nezavisimaya Gazeta, a widely read newspaper of a generally ``centrist'' orientation. I don't deny their right to print whatever they want, but I find it hard to believe that the editors of Nezavisimaya Gazeta want their publication to resemble some of the many anti-Semitic rags that have emerged in post-Soviet Russia.  In any event, I would certainly hope that the leadership of the Russian Government disavows the article, the author and certainly the policy prescriptions suggested.                          ____________________
