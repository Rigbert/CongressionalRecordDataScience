President, today, Senator Wicker of Mississippi and I are reintroducing the Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act. This bill, named for a mentor of mine--the late Senator from Illinois, embodies a vision Paul Simon believed in throughout his life: a vision centered on our country's need for a culturally aware, and globally knowledgeable population and workforce.  Senator Simon saw these characteristics as essential to our country's economy, society, and national security. He believed that by building meaningful relationships with people around the world, America would grow even stronger as a nation. In his words, ``America's incompetence in foreign languages and cultural awareness jeopardizes our Nation's future in global affairs. This lack of global perspective damages America's ability to compete in world markets. The more our country becomes competent in foreign languages and cultures, the more enhanced our foreign policy decisions will become.''  He also believed that to truly be educated, our students needed more than a minimal understanding of the world around them. To be truly educated, they need to immerse themselves in the beliefs, customs, language, and environment of a culture other than their own. I share these beliefs with Senator Simon and many Republicans in this Chamber share them as well.  At a time when there are calls from some to shut out immigrants and refugees and pull away from other parts of the world, these beliefs are more important than ever. We need to continue to give our young people the opportunity to interact with people from all over the world, so they can develop their own informed opinions and beliefs.  Undergraduate study abroad programs are a popular source for this type of engagement. Unfortunately, far too few students take advantage or have the means to take advantage of this opportunity. Annually, less than 2 percent of undergraduate students participate in study abroad.  Those who do study abroad don't reflect the incredible diversity of our postsecondary institutions. Minority students, first-generation college students, community college students, and students with disabilities are significantly underrepresented in the study abroad population. These students miss out on the valuable personal and educational growth that comes from a study abroad experience, including interacting with other cultures, developing foreign language skills, and expanding international knowledge through firsthand experience.  We also know that those who currently study abroad do so mostly in highly developed countries. In fact, over 50 percent of students who study abroad each year do so in Europe. Increasing the diversity of study abroad destinations to include countries in Asia, the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Latin America will help American students develop a global perspective and build the insight and skills needed to better understand the global challenges of the 21st century.  In 2004, Congress took the first step towards expanding study abroad when it authorized the Commission on Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program to provide recommendations to Congress and the President on expanding study abroad programs.  The Senator Paul Simon Study Abroad Program Act combines the vision of Senator Simon with the recommendations of the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Commission. It establishes a competitive grant program for institutions of higher education to encourage the sustainable expansion of study abroad opportunities for students in the United States.  Over the next 10 years, this grant program aims to increase the number of undergraduate students stud g abroad each year to one million students. It also emphasizes increasing opportunities for nontraditional students, minority students, and students with disabilities so that the demographics of students who study abroad more closely reflect the population of current undergraduate students.  This bill also focuses on getting students to study abroad in nontraditional destinations particularly in developing countries. We need to send more students to developing nations because these are the places that America needs to better understand. This legislation takes important steps toward expanding and diversifying participation in study abroad.  Senator Wicker and I are pleased to be joined today in introducing this bill by Senators Reed, Cochran, Merkley, and Brown. I am also pleased that several organizations have endorsed this bill including the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, the Association of International Educators, the American Council on Education, the Association of American Universities, and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities.  In today's increasingly interconnected world, study abroad participation is an important element of a meaningful undergraduate education. Expanded access to study abroad opportunities is necessary to prepare the next generation of Americans with the global knowledge and skills needed to succeed. I hope other colleagues will join us in that effort.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 601       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Senator Paul Simon Study      Abroad Program Act of 2017''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress makes the following findings:       (1) To prepare students for success in the modern global      economy, opportunities for study abroad should be included as      part of a well-rounded education.       (2) Study abroad programs provide students with      unparalleled access to international knowledge, an unmatched      opportunity to learn foreign languages, and a unique      environment for developing cultural understanding, all of      which are knowledge and skills needed in today's global      economy.       (3) Less than 2 percent of all enrolled postsecondary      students in the United States study abroad for credit in any      given year, and minority students, first generation college      students, community college students, and students with      disabilities are significantly underrepresented in study      abroad participation.       (4) Congress authorized the establishment of the Commission      on the Abraham Lincoln Study Abroad Fellowship Program      pursuant to section 104 of the Miscellaneous Appropriations      and Offsets Act, 2004 (division H of Public Law 108-199).      Pursuant to its mandate, the Lincoln Commission submitted to      Congress and the President a report of its recommendations      for greatly expanding the opportunity for students at      institutions of higher education in the United States to      study abroad, with special emphasis on studying in developing      nations.       (5) According to the Lincoln Commission, ``[e]xperience      shows that leadership from administrators and faculty will      drive the number of study abroad participants higher and      improve the quality of programs. Such leadership is the only      way that study abroad will become an integral part of the      undergraduate experience.''. A competitive grant program is      necessary to encourage and support such leadership.     SEC. 3. PURPOSES.       The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to ensure that significantly more students have access      to quality study abroad opportunities;       (2) to ensure that the diversity of students studying      abroad reflects the diversity of students and institutions of      higher education in the United States;       (3) to encourage greater diversity in study abroad      destinations by increasing the portion of study abroad that      takes place in nontraditional study abroad destinations,      especially in developing countries; and       (4) to encourage a greater commitment by institutions of      higher education to expand study abroad opportunities.
