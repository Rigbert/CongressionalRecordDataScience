 President, I wish today to honor a long respected community in the great Commonwealth of Kentucky, the city of Hartford, which on February 3, 2008, will celebrate 200 years of establishment in the Commonwealth.  Since February 3, 1808, the great city of Hartford has been a part of my great State. After an act of the legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, Hartford was formally established on 400 acres of land around Rough River, in the county of Ohio, occupying the land of the late Gabriel Madison. The city humbly began governing with a group of seven trustees overseeing the town and has since grown to a population of over 2,000 outstanding citizens and has developed into the administrative center for Ohio County, becoming the county seat. Now, great leadership comes from Mayor Earl Russell, who proudly carries on the tradition of his family of governing in Hartford.  As proclaimed in Hartford's town slogan, this honored town is home to ``2,000 happy people and a few soreheads.'' These ``soreheads and happy people'' strenuously work to promote civic pride and generate the enthusiasm needed to accomplish future goals throughout their city.  Due to the enthusiasm from citizens like these and great leadership from Mayor Earl Russell, Kentucky has grown to the honorable State it is today. Inhabiting the western coal field region of the State, Hartford has been contributing to the Commonwealth for 200 years and has planned a celebration in honor of this. Because of the continued contribution of the citizens of Hartford to the betterment of their town, county and the Commonwealth, I ask my colleagues to join me in celebrating with them today for 200 years of dedication.                          ____________________
