President, as we bring this very dramatic chapter in U.S. trade policy to its conclusion in the Senate, I wish to take a few minutes to acknowledge the many people who helped in ways large and small tobring about the passage of the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act.  First and foremost, I thank Chairman Hatch for his partnership throughout the process. I think Chairman Hatch and I can smile a bit looking back on some very spirited debates in the process of getting to this point. I do want colleagues to understand that Chairman Hatch has been a true leader in this bipartisan effort in the Finance Committee and on the floor. I thank Chairman Hatch and his staff for all they have done.  I think both Chairman Hatch and I also want to acknowledge our partner in the House, Chairman Ryan. All through the discussions, Chairman Hatch, Chairman Ryan, and myself, all tried to make sure that we would have a bipartisan, bicameral collaborative effort. The three of us obviously don't see eye to eye on everything, but we thought it was very important to try to come together and move an extraordinarily important and challenging economic policy forward for the country. Chairman Ryan has been there every single step of the way, and we look forward to returning the favor as he moves this historic package through the House and on to the President's desk.  We also thank Leader McConnell for his work in shepherding this package through the process. It has not been easy, but Leader McConnell has had a single-minded focus in terms of getting this bill across the finish line.  While we are on the subject of Senate leadership, I especially want to acknowledge the extraordinary contributions of my Pacific Northwest colleague Senator Murray and her staff. Over the last few years, colleagues, we have seen time and time again Senator Murray demonstrate her extraordinary ability. She is a person of modest size, but she is sure good at getting big things done. This bill is no exception, and it could not have happened without her leadership and help.  Finally, I note Chairman Hatch and I wish to thank all the members of the Finance Committee because they had a lot of good ideas, and they were constructive in terms of bringing this debate along, recognizing that we had strong differences. Every single member of the Finance Committee made a meaningful contribution, whether it was to the policy or to the process. Chairman Hatch and I want to say that when you look at a full recounting of all the great work done by Finance Committee members, if we were to do it all night, we would keep you all the way through the recess.  I wrap up with a quick word of my thanks to my staff who have done an exceptional job putting the legislation together: Jayme White, Elissa Alben, Greta Peisch, Anderson Heiman, Keith Chu, Malcolm McGreary, Danielle Deraney, Kara Getz, and Juan Machado.  I close by way of saying I think it is fair to say that there were a lot of observers, both in and outside this body, who thought it would not be possible to move forward on an issue like this--which is going to affect 40 percent of the global economy--in a bipartisan fashion. We know there are going to be a billion middle-class consumers in the developing world in 2025, and they want to ``Buy American.'' They like our brand.  With the extraordinary leadership of Chairman Hatch and many others who contributed to this effort, I think once again there is going to be a very significant array of economic opportunities for the people we represent to get high-skill, high-wage, export-related jobs with products and services that we sell to these countries.  So I close this part of the debate tonight--again, as we began, I think, 7 months ago, Chairman Hatch, by telling you that this, to me, is what we are sent to do, tackle the big issues in a bipartisan way.  With that, I yield the floor.                Recess Subject to the Call of the Chair
