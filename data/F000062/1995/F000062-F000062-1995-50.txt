 President, today I rise to recognize and pay tribute to a great friend to the Senate. The former Chaplain of the Senate, Rev. Richard C. Halverson passed away last week. For 14 years he tended to the spiritual needs of this body and all the people who make it work.  Educated at Wheaton College and Princeton Theological Seminary, Reverend Halverson worked in several places including California, his last place of ministry prior to moving to Washington. As the 60th Chaplain of the Senate most of our Nation knew Reverend Halverson from the prayer he delivered every morning. His respectful and quiet manner was a example to us all for how to conduct ourselves and treat others with dignity. I remember with fondness the mornings when I sat as the acting President of this chamber, and listened to Reverend Halverson speak, urge and console not only the Members of this body but everybody listening throughout the Nation.  Besides his duties as Chaplain of the Senate Reverend Halverson also was a minister to the Fourth Presbyterian Church in Bethesda, MD, and an author of several books. He took a lifetime interest in trying speak to the improvement of the moral being of individuals, and the moral health of our Nation. I will miss Reverend Halverson, our country will miss Reverend Halverson, and this body will miss Reverend Halverson, but we are all better because of his life. I hope the example of his life will continue to set a standard for us all.  I know that Reverend Halverson's wife Doris and all the members of his family know better than all of us what an exceptional and spiritual man he was. I want to express my sympathy to them with this loss.                          ____________________
