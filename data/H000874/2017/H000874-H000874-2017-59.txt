Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  I am going to have some specific questions about the tax bill, but before I do that, it is our understanding that substantial changes are being made in the tax bill that was put on the floor last Thursday, a week ago.  Does the gentleman know whether that is accurate or not?  I yield to the gentleman from California.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  I would not use that term, ``substantial,'' because, as you know, we have gone through this process for quite some time. We are all writing to the same number: $1.5 trillion. But, as you know, any bill, when it moves through regular order, where it gets introduced in committee and we have a markup, just as Ways and Means has done all week long--they will come to the final vote today--whatever amendments pass will be added.  You will then see that bill posted. You will then, next week, see the Rules Committee take it up, and then you will see that bill on the floor, just as with any other regular order bill in the process.
