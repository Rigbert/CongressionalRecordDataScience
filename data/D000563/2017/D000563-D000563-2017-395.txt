As far as we could bring the judge on this subject, he said: Well, someone should ask about where the money is coming from. That, I guess, is a pretty bold statement because many Republicans don't believe that it is fair to even ask where the money is coming from.  There was a time when even the Senate majority leader used to say: I am not going to complain about the amount of money. I just want to make sure it is all disclosed. Well, he is completely vacating that position. He doesn't want disclosure. He doesn't want the American people to know where the money is coming from.  I don't know if the Senator from Oregon noticed the television advertising here in Washington, where there is a lot on an issue like this before us. But the television screens--at least for those morning talk shows--were inundated with advertising in favor of Neil Gorsuch from groups like the 45 Committee, Judicial Justice Committee. They make up these names right and left.  I ask the Senator: When it comes to decisions like Citizens United, doesthat give us clear evidence of why the Republicans are fighting so hard to make sure they put the right person on the Supreme Court?
