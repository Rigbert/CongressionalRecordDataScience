Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I bring the attention of my colleagues to a very special event occurring in Atlanta, GA, next week. On the weekend of June 27, the Atlanta Braves and BellSouth will host a reunion and recognition event in honor of the legendary teams and players of the Negro Baseball League. Approximately 100 Negro leaguers from around the country, fans and friends will be convening in Atlanta to celebrate the remarkable achievements of an unheralded group of African-American men, members of the Negro Baseball League.  In this 50th anniversary year of Jackie Robinson's historic breaking of the color barrier in major league baseball, it is fitting and appropriate that Congress, citizens of Atlanta, and the entire Nation take a moment to pay tribute to the great African-American teams and players that made sports history. These were athletes who played with teams such as the Kansas City Monarchs, the New York Black Yankees, and the Baltimore Elite Giants. In the South, we had the Atlanta Black Crackers and the Birmingham Black Barons, to name but a few. Their daily triumphs were ignored by major newspapers of the Jim Crow era and their accomplishments have all but been overlooked in the annals of sports history. It cannot be denied, however, that the Negro Baseball League and the players that formed these teams made immeasurable contributions to America's favorite pastime, our national sport, baseball.  The term ``Negro Leagues'' describes the all-professional, all-Negro baseball teams operating between 1880 and 1955, hundreds of which traveled throughout the United States during that time. The first Negro leagues started out in Kansas City, MO. Despite the hardships imposed by the Nation's rigid racial barriers, the Negro leagues managed not only to survive, but to thrive and grow. Even the prevailing myth of white supremacy could not deny the talents of these men. Author Robert Peterson, who chronicled the story of the leagues, perhaps summed it best with the title of his book, ``Only the Ball Was White.''  The league served as a showcase of talent and entertainment. The players were truly living legends. Many of the names of the great stars and the teams live on and form an integral part of our cherished sports history. The legendary Satchel Paige was a pitcher whose name is still synonymous with excellence. The league's Josh Gibson was one of the game's greatest hitters. Willie Mays, Roy Campanella, and the homerun king of all time, Hank Aaron, are all legends of the Negro Baseball League.  The significance of the leagues went far beyond the world of sports. The men who formed these teams were pioneers in nurturing and fostering self-pride among African-Americans. These sports heroes have left a powerful legacy that has enriched American history.  As some of the living legends of Negro baseball gather in Atlanta this month, I know my colleagues will join me in sending these outstanding men our appreciation for their glorious accomplishments and the enduring memories they have inscribed in the hearts and minds of millions of Americans.                          ____________________
