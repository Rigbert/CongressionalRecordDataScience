Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition of House Joint Resolution 79, a resolution of disapproval of most-favored-nation [MFN] status for products from China. I believe that it is in the best interest of United States agriculture to continue, and eventually expand, the current trading relationship with China.  United States agriculture exports to China were $2 billion last year, a significant increase over 1993 United States exports of less than one-half of $1 billion. China represents an agriculture market that is vital to the success of our farmers and ranchers. Our agriculture trade with China can strengthen development of private enterprise in that country and bring China more fully into world trade membership.  There are few countries that do not have unconditional MFN status with the United States. MFN status allows a country's products to enter into the United States at the same tariff rates that apply to other trading partners. In fact, MFN provides no special treatment. It allows us to treat all countries' imports in the same manner. Failure to do so often has a serious negative impact on American agriculture, the first to feel the impact of embargoes and retaliation.  It is my intention to work toward the goal of ensuring regular and ongoing trade with China. In fact, the committee has been working closely with the Secretary of Agriculture and the United States Trade Representative on matters related to China's accession to the World Trade Organization. Several issues related to nontariff trade barriers must be resolved prior to any accession.  International trade is important for American agriculture and for the success and prosperity of American farmers and ranchers. I urge my colleagues to reject House Joint Resolution 79.
