President, I oppose this amendment on procedural grounds. This is a highly complex subject. It is a subject that I am sure will be debated extensively as we consider the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. But in principle also I think it is inappropriate to divert these resources to private education when we have so many unmet needs in public education.  I believe also that if we adopt the underlying tax bill there will be even less resources to devote to public education and it will exacerbate the demands that we already must meet with respect to public education.  There is a difference between private schools and public schools. Private schools can exclude children. Public schools must educate every child in America.  I believe our obligation and commitment is to public education, and this amendment will defeat that.  I also note that the pending amendment is not germane.  Therefore, I raise a point of order that the amendment violates Section 305(b)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.
