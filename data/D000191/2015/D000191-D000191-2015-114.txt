This is great. Let's talk about Monsanto and glyphosate-resistant corn.  They are using more pesticides today on cornfields than they did historically, more, and they had glyphosate-resistant corn.  They dumped the glyphosate on the corn: Don't worry. There will never be a glyphosate-resistant weed. Oops. They were wrong. Weeds everywhere now taking over the cornfield.  Let's change that up. We are now going to have 2,4-D--remember Agent Orange? Pretty darn close--resistant corn. They are going to dump thousands, millions, of tons of 2,4-D over this corn.  That is the net result of this sort of forward movement that they are touting as helping us deal with pesticide and herbicide issues: Oh. Don't worry. There will never be a 2,4-D resistant weed. If there is, don't worry. They will get an even more toxic chemical.  They are addicting farmers to their products and addicting farmers to buying more and more of their pesticides.  We have now seen milkweed wiped out in the Midwest, causing a crisis with monarch butterflies, who are actually a pretty critical pollinator. Most people don't know that, apparently. And that is the result of all this glyphosate and the coming of 2,4-D.  I thank the gentleman for the time.
