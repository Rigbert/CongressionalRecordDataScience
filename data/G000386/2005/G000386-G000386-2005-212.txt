 President, I raise the point, first of all, that we voted on a like amendment a couple of weeks ago. But I want to say why the amendment is defective, as I would have said then. It would require us to raise taxes to extend expiring tax cuts, but it would allow entitlement spending to continue to grow without any offset. This then creates a double standard between current tax law and current spending law.  The amendment also is not germane, and so I raise a point of order.
