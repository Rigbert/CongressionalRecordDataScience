 President, for the leader I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate completes its business today it stand in adjournment until 9 a.m. on Thursday, July 9. I further ask that when the Senate reconvenes on Thursday, immediately following the prayer, the routine requests through the morning hour be granted.
