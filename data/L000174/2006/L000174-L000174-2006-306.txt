President, I have spoken earlier about Mr. Anderson. For those of us who have been prosecutors in Vermont or care about the prosecutor's office, I think President Bush has made a fine choice here. And, of course, I strongly support Mr. Anderson for the reasons I stated earlier.  I think everybody here and in the Department of Justice will breathe a sigh of relief. We have had wonderful acting U.S. attorneys for some time since former U.S. attorney Peter Hall went to the Second Circuit. But this will be a very good move to have him as U.S. attorney.  I compliment Tom and his family and, of course, the President.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________[Page S6403]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov] NOMINATION OF THOMAS D.
