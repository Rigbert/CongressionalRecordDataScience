The first question is this: Is it not true that the position we are arguing in the PATRIOT Act is the same position that the Senator from Arizona voted for in the Judiciary Committee and at least did not object to on the floor of the Senate? So to suggest it is a radical position--I would like to ask the Senator, has he changed his view on that?
