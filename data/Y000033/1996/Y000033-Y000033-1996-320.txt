Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to offer alternative legislation with the ranking minority member of the Resources Committee, Mr. George Miller, and Mr. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, to the Indian Child Welfare Act [ICWA]. In May of this year, the House narrowly passed H.R. 3286, which contained amendments to the ICWA. Tribal representatives opposed title III of that bill and have worked with Congresswoman Pryce to reach an agreement on alternative legislation to ICWA. I want to thank Congresswoman Pryce for her efforts to reach a compromise on ICWA. I want to also thank all the tribes for their efforts and important input on legislation which has an affect on Indian families and Alaska Native and American Indian children.  After the May vote, tribal representatives met in Tulsa, OK, to reach a consensus to address the concerns expressed by the authors of title III of H.R. 3286. This legislation provides for notice to tribes for voluntary adoptions, terminations of parental rights, and foster care proceedings. It provides for time lines for tribal intervention in voluntary cases and provides criminal sanctions to discourage fraudulent practices in Indian adoptions. Additionally, it clarifies the limits on withdrawal of parental consent to adoptions. The proposal provides for open adoptions in States where State law prohibits them and clarifies tribal courts authority to declare children wards of the tribal court. In addition, it states that attorneys and public and private agencies have a duty to inform Indian parents of their rights under ICWA, and provides for tribal membership certification in adoptions. These reforms resolve the ambiguities in current law which resulted in needless litigation, and have disrupted Indian adoption placements without reducing this country's commitment to protect native American families and promote the best interest of native children.  Mr. Speaker, all of the provisions contained in this bill have been tentatively embraced by the Department of Justice, the Department of the Interior, Jane Gorman, the attorney for the Rost family, and the American Academy of Adoption Attorneys, the proponents of title III of H.R. 3286. I know that they and others are sincere in their concern about litigation which has delayed a few adoptions. But ICWA is not the problem. The Rost case is a sad and tragic case. But it was caused by an attorney who tried to cover up the natural parent's tribal membership and purposefully avoided checking with the grandparents and extended family of the children to see if the family was available to adopt these children. The sad part is that this attorney did not violate the law, but he inflicted untold sorrow on the Rosts, the grandparents of the children, and ultimately on the children themselves. This proposed legislation will impose criminal sanctions on attorneys who violate ICWA requirements in the adoption of a native child. In closing, I believe we have acceptable legislation which will protect the interests of adoptive parents, native extended families, and most importantly, Alaska Native and American Indian children.
