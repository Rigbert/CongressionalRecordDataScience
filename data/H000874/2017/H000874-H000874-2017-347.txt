Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding environmental conservationist and researcher in my home state of Maryland. Dr. Donald F. Boesch has served as the President of the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science (UMCES) since 1990, and he will be retiring from that position later this year. Throughout his tenure, UMCES has led the charge to study and conserve our state's natural environments, particularly the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed.  UMCES has its roots in a small research laboratory opened at the mouth of the Patuxent River in the Chesapeake Bay in 1925, and was relaunched under its current name and mission in 1997 to provide undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on learning and internships in marine biology, ecology, and environmental subjects. With five locations across the State of Maryland, from its original site in Solomons Island in Calvert County to laboratories in the Appalachians, Baltimore, College Park, and Cambridge on the Eastern Shore, UMCES forms a critical part of the University System of Maryland's commitment to research and to training the next generation of environmental scientists. Its hundred faculty members are conducting ground-breaking research and teaching UMCES's eighty-five graduate students.  Alongside UMCES's academic mission, it also fulfills a public policy role with its faculty advising policymakers in Maryland and in the federal government. UMCES scientists have been instrumental in calling attention to the challenges facing the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed and in proposing ways to clean up this regional and national treasure. Under Dr. Boesch's leadership, UMCES has been especially active in raising awareness about the Chesapeake and its importance to regional ecosystems and supporting our regional economy.  Dr. Boesch began his career by earning his undergraduate degree in biology from Tulane University in his native New Orleans. Later, he received his doctorate in oceanography from the College of William and Mary in Virginia. He spent time in Australia on a Fulbright scholarship before conducting research at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science. In 1980, Dr. Boesch returned to New Orleans to become the inaugural Executive Director of the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium and to teach marine science at Louisiana State University. He came to Maryland in 1990 to lead UMCES and now caps a very successful tenure of twenty-seven years at the helm. During that time, Dr. Boesch advised Maryland governors from both parties, has been as a member of the Governor's Chesapeake Bay Cabinet, and has served on the Maryland Commission on Climate Change. In 2010, President Obama appointed him to the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling. He has served as Chair of the Ocean Studies Board for the National Academy of Sciences and is the author of two books and dozens of scholarly papers.  The people of Maryland have been so fortunate to have Dr. Boesch leading UMCES these past twenty-seven years. We have been blessed to have his intellect, his dedication, and his wise leadership benefiting our students and our researchers. All those who treasure the Chesapeake owe Dr. Boesch much gratitude for his contributions to preserving the Bay and its watershed. I join in congratulating him on a very successful tenure and in wishing him well as he prepares to step down later this year.                          ____________________
