 President, I have been told it is only going to take a minute to run a hotline on the Democratic side, after which I would like to propound, on behalf of myself and Senator Biden, a unanimous consent agreement. This whole matter will take just a minute or so. I would like to, with the consent of my colleagues, get that out of the way here before the debate continues, if the Senator from Vermont finds that acceptable.
