No, no, no, the gentleman is wrong. In the world of the Republican budget, two plus two can be any number that they direct it to be. It is called directed scorekeeping. So if they get a result they do not like from their own Congressional Budget Office, which they have appointed, they direct that in fact two plus two is one, or zero, or maybe minus eight, or whatever they need to do to add up to budget.  But the hard fact is that the money they are spending, which is actually going to be spent by these appropriations bills passed by the majority, originating in this chamber by the Republican majority, that money has to come from somewhere; and that money is coming from the Social Security surplus.  Every time they do one of these funny tricks, yes, it makes it look okay in terms of the Budget Act, emergency spending, directed scorekeeping; but it is coming out of Social Security. So let us drop the charade and develop an honest budget and admit we are probably going to run a real deficit this year. That is where we are headed. Because they have loaded up these bills so much, if we go to the real priorities of the American people and keep all the junk they have loaded into the bills, we are going to be running a deficit. Unless they want to pull out some of those things, the aircraft carriers the Pentagon did not ask for and some of those other things, they are up the creek without a paddle, or a boat or a life jacket.
