Speaker, it is my distinct pleasure to announce that the Indian Medical Association will be celebrating their 24th year of establishment by hosting a gala dinner and banquet on Friday, June 3, 2005 at the Halls of St. George, in Schereville, Indiana.  The Indian Medical Association was created 24 years ago to promote goodwill and bonding friendships among local physicians through an exchange of medical knowledge and other healthcare related issues. They are dedicated to providing affordable and quality health care. The Indian Medical Association is also actively involved in patient care, health care delivery, charitable work, hosting educational seminars for physicians, and health fairs for the general public in the Northwest Indiana region.  In 2004, the Indian Medical Association offered scholarships to medical, nursing, and high school students. In January 2005, they raised more than $100,000 for the Tsunami Relief Fund. The Indian Medical Association is a great asset to Northwest Indiana. This organization has committed itself to providing quality service to the residents of Indiana's First Congressional District in the medical community and has demonstrated exemplary service in its cultural, scholastic, and charitable endeavors.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending the Indian Medical Association for their outstanding contributions. Their commitment to improving the quality of life for the people of Northwest Indiana and throughout the world is truly inspirational and should be recognized and commended.                          ____________________
