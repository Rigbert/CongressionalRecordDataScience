  Mr. President, I submit that there is no socially redeeming use for phony drivers licenses. Indeed, the only conceivable use of such documents is to subvert State and Federal law. And as the Supreme Court recently reaffirmed in United States verses Lopez, on page 9 of the slip opinion, ``The power of Congress to keep the channels of interstate commerce free from immoral and injurious uses has been frequently sustained, and it is no longer open to question.'' Simply put, Mr. President, S. 507 helps to ensure that interstate commerce will not be used to further immoral activities, like providing children with phony drivers licenses so that they can purchase liquor and beer illegally. That is why I am pleased to support S. 507.  From the beginning of our country, States have prohibited the sale of liquor to children. S. 507 helps those States by providing Federal help to combat what is essentially a Federal problem--the interstate transfer of false forms of ID to children. I urge my colleagues to support S. 507.                          ____________________
