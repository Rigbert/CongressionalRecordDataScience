 I look forward to the debate and working with Chairman Simpson, a gracious chairman, to complete the task before us to strengthen liberty as she encounters the challenges of a new era.  I want to thank Rob Blair and Taunja Berquam, our able staff, for moving us to this point.  I reserve the balance of my time.
