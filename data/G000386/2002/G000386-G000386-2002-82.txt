 President, yesterday some on the other side attacked last year's bipartisan tax relief legislation. They were led by the distinguished Majority Leader, Senator Tom Daschle. As an example of these claims, I ask unanimous consent to place in the Record an article from yesterday's edition of Roll Call Daily.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From the Roll Call Daily, July 25, 2002]  Daschle Blames Bush Tax Cut for Failure on Prescription Drug Reform                           (By Polly Forster)       Senate Majority Leader Thomas Daschle (D-S.D.) expressed      frustration with the chamber's failure to enact a sweeping      Medicare prescription drug benefit and blamed President'      Bush's $1.35 trillion tax cut for ``starving'' the      opportunity to pass substantial reform.       Daschle also expressed doubt that a conference committee      will be able to work out the differences in the House and      Senate versions of trade legislation before the Houses      recesses this week.       Daschle charged that House Ways and Means Chairman Bill      Thomas (R-Calif.) was possibly undermining a key component of      the Senate trade bill by revisiting the details of the Trade      Adjustment Assistance bill and thereby delaying a final      result.       ``It sounds like he's trying to undermine the TAA      package,'' Daschle said. ``If that's the case, we'll wait      until September.''       Legislation on prescription drug benefits appeared      similarly in flux. Daschle said Democrats were forced to      revise their priorities because last year's tax cut shrunk      the possibilities available to them.       ``We don't have the resources because, in large measure,      the tax cut precludes it,'' Daschle said.'' Because of the      tax cut and the deficits we are now facing, we've got to be      concerned about the overall cost.''       But a Senate GOP leadership aide dismissed the validity of      that argument, saying that Democrats now find themselves in a      corner and are ``grasping at straws'' to avoid the blame.       ``Because Democrats stopped the bipartisan Finance      Committee from doing its work, they've caused every possible      drug proposal to fail in the Senate,'' said the GOP aid.       Since none of the proposals for drug benefit reform passed      through the Finance Committee, all measures are subject to a      60-vote threshold.       Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) has spent the      last several days in meetings with key lawmakers from both      sides in an effort to craft something most Senators could      agree to.       Daschle said the goal of the talks is to find a proposal      broad enough to win over at least 10 Republicans. ``We only      got 52'' for a Democratic bill, he said, ``and we need the      other eight. That means we've got to scale back and to      broaden our level of support.''       Daschle said Democrats will not be offering any more      proposals but instead will be looking to craft a bipartisan      measure.       Baucus spokesman Michael Siegel said the Senator was      looking at two approaches to the issue: using Medicare as the      channel to deliver drug benefits and where unavailable using      private companies, and also to extending a ``catastrophic''      coverage bill that was short of nine votes Wednesday.       Daschle said the Senate will stay on the issue as long as      it takes,including the early part of September after the      recess, until there is a result--possibly forestalling      consideration of a bill to create the federal department of      Homeland Security.       ``It means our highest priority is to get the bill done and      we don't do other things until we get it done,'' he said.       Daschle vowed an equal commitment to retaining the worker      protection element in the trade package now in conference.       ``We're in no hurry,'' he said. ``It's more important to me      to have a good package even if that means we have to wait      until October.''       A top Senate Democratic aide said negotiations broke down      Thursday morning over the TAA element, which would provide      health coverage for workers displaced by international trade.       Senate Democrats expected Thomas to concede ground on that      part as the House was only just able to pass their bill on      the floor.       The breakdown left at least one Senate Democratic      leadership aid frustrated. ``It's ridiculous for Thomas to be      stuck on this because it's his chamber that needs to attract      the votes to pass the bill, not the Senate,'' said the aide.
