Speaker, I yield our remaining time to the gentleman from New York (Mr. LaFalce), from the Buffalo area, one of the hardest working Members of this Chamber.  (Mr. LaFALCE asked and was given permission to revise and extend his remarks.)                              {time}  1530  Mr. LaFALCE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding time to me.  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased, and I congratulate the conferees on the agriculture appropriations bill for providing crop disaster relief that is so desperately needed by the apple growers in my district and throughout western New York, most especially Orleans County and Niagara County.  Our apple industry in New York State was devastated recently by tornado force winds on Labor Day. It could not have come at a worse time. The latest weather-related damage estimates to this year's apple crop is 41.4 million, fully 28 percent of the total crop value.  The hardest hit area was in Orleans County, in my district. The Labor Day storm there caused more than a $5 million loss to my county's apple crop. Yields are down by as much as 70 percent on over 6,000 acres in my county, and thousands of trees were destroyed.  I applaud this $1.5 billion new disaster grant program that is so crucial to restoring the financial health of New York apple growers. I applaud the conferees for the tremendous work they have done in inserting and including this $1.5 billion.  Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that conferees on the Agriculture Appropriations bill agreed to provide crop disaster relief that is so desperately needed by the apple growers in my district and throughout Western New York.  New York's apple industry has been both physically and financially devastated by a series of unusual weather events this past year--from last frosts in the spring to an intense hail and wind storm on Labor Day.  The tornado force winds on Labor Day could not have come at a worse time. They completely destroyed five million bushels just prior to harvest--more than 20 percent of the entire New York apple crop. The latest weather-related damage estimates to this year's apple crop is $41.4 million--fully 28 percent of the total crop value.  One of the hardest hit areas was Orleans County in my district. The Labor Day storm caused more than a $5 million loss to that county's apple crop. Yields are down by as much as 70 percent on 6,000 acres in the county. And thousands of trees were destroyed.  This appropriations bill will help those farmers by providing $1.5 billion in emergency assistance for 1998 crop losses due to disasters, and an additional $675 million for farmers who have suffered multiyear losses. I am very grateful that this critical funding has been included.  This new disaster grant program is crucial to restore the financial health of New York apple growers. Most of them are carrying huge debt loads. They simply cannot afford emergency disaster loans, no matter how low the interest rate. Without these direct payments, many of them would not be able to survive the devastating losses they have suffered this year.  I want to thank the Chairman, the gentleman from New Mexico, and the ranking Democrat, the gentlelady from Ohio, for the excellent work they've done in responding to this apple crop disaster in New York State, and to the farm crisis nationwide. I also commend the gentleman from New York, Mr. Walsh, for leading the effort on the conference committee to provide this essential disaster relief. And I thank all my New York colleagues who joined Mr. Walsh and me in urging conferees to provide this grant assistance.  I look forward to working with Mr. Walsh and with Secretary Glickman to ensure that the emergency grant assistance program is developed and implemented in a way that will most effectively help New York apple growers and other fruit producers recover from this year's weather disasters and continue producing for year to come.
