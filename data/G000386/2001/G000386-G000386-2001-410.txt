 President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment by Senator Schumer be laid aside and that a vote occur in relation to the amendment at 7:45 p.m. with no second-degree amendment in order prior to the vote. I further ask unanimous consent that the amendment be laid aside following the 5 minutes for Senator Schumer in order for Senator Gregg to offer an amendment and, following that time, the Gregg amendment be laid aside and Senator Carnahan be recognized to offer her amendment.
