Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Riverside County farming and water leader Bennett ``Ben'' Drake, who passed away on Wednesday, November 7, 2018. Ben served the people of Riverside County in many ways throughout his life and he will be deeply missed.  Ben was born in Riverside, California on July 8, 1949, to Richard and Martha Drake. Ben was a graduate of Fresno State University and also a member of Class XII of the California Agricultural Leadership Program. Ben was a fifth generation farmer in Riverside County and a resident of Temecula since 1973. Ben founded Drake Enterprises, Inc., a farm management company 40 years ago. They manage 750 acres of avocados and 450 acres of winegrapes in the Temecula Valley. Ben served as past President of the Temecula Valley Winegrape Growers Association and past Chairman of the California Association of Winegrape Growers.  As a prominent farmer and water advocate, Ben played a significant role in the successful growth of the Temecula Valley Wine Country. In the 1990's, an outbreak of Pierce's Disease threatened to wipe out grape vineyards throughout the region and state. As I witnessed first-hand, Ben's leadership during the crisis made a tremendous impact and resulted in a coordinated response from local, state and federal agencies that ultimately saved the region from devastation. Ben was elected to serve on the Rancho California Water District's Board of Directors in September, 2001, and faithfully served on the Board for 17 years. For all of his many accomplishments Ben was named California Association of Winegrape Growers Leader of the Year 2013; Boy Scouts Distinguished Citizen of the Year 2014; Riverside County 4H All Star; and received the Robert M. Howie Award for Outstanding Service to Riverside Agriculture 2010.  Ben is survived by his wife of 43 years, Sharon (Clark) Drake and his children Katie (Drake) and JD Harkey, Chase Drake, Kourtney Drake, Kara (Drake) and MacLain Atkinson. I want to extend my heartfelt condolences to the entire Drake family, his friends, and everyone who had the pleasure of knowing him. Although Ben may be gone, the many contributions he made in Riverside County will have a lasting impact.                          ____________________
