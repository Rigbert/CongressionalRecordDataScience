Don't take on Chase and all the big banks of America--the ones that have the lion's share of these debit cards--and Visa and MasterCard and not get suited up for battle. This is a darn important battle. It will test beyond the wisdom or justice of this proposal; it is going to test who owns the United States Senate. Is this a Senate that is willing to stand up for small business across America? Is this a Senate that is willing to say we will fight for consumers even at the expense of the profits of the banks and credit card companies?  I think consumers across America know on which side we should be. I hope we will be. We were last year, with 64 Senators, Democrats and Republicans, joining to stand up for small businesses and large businesses alike, retailers and merchants. I know the big banks and credit card companies have enormous resources, and they have a reach in every direction. I know they are running commercials and sending an army of lobbyists to Capitol Hill. They also have allies in the Senate. They will pull out all the stops to roll back any effort to curb their abusive practices.  I want my colleagues to know I think Main Street is worth standing up for--certainly, when it comes to their fights with Wall Street. Small businesses, consumers, universities, labor unions, and merchants are sick and tired of the banking industry's tricks, traps, and hidden fees. They want fees they can see, and they want them set up in competition, not fixed by credit card companies. They want the Wall Street banks to play by the same rules of the road that the Main Street businesses play by every day, and I want that too. I hope the Senate does as well.  I urge my colleagues not to let the big banks and credit card companies avoid accountability for 2 more years. In the name of a study, do not give a $30 billion handout to the biggest banks and credit card companies in America. That is exactly what the amendment filed on the Senate floor will do. Do not delay interchange reform. Do not delay swipe fee reform. Don't give those banks another multibillion-dollar handout with no strings attached.  I urge my colleagues to let the Federal Reserve do the job that was sent their way. Let them move forward with the important process of swipe fee reform.  On behalf of businesses and merchants all across America, they are counting on the Senate to be on their side to help them in reaching profitability and making sure their savings are passed along to consumers and in being the No. 1 engine for the creation of new jobs in America. Our questionis, Whose side are you on? I am on the side of small business and Main Street. I hope my colleagues will be as well.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Coons). The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.                          ____________________
