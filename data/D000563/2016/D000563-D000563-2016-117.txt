I will ask one more, if I may, through the Chair. I would ask the Senator from Florida this: So you have Senator Rubio, a well-known Republican from Florida, and Senator Bill Nelson, maybe the best known Democrat from Florida, agreeing that this is an emergency that needs to be dealt with on a timely basis, that the President's request for $1.9 billion is a reasonable request, that we pass a bipartisan measure--Senate Democrats and Senate Republicans--and that we are moving toward solving this problem and responding to it. Is it not true that this measure fell apart or broke down when it ended up in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, where they did not take a bipartisan approach to the issue?
