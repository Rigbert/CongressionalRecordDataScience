Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4836 would name the VA Medical Center in the City of Amarillo, Texas, for Lance Corporal Thomas E. Creek. This heroic Marine gave his life on February 13, 1969, to save fellow Marines by falling on a grenade near Cam Lo, Vietnam. He was awarded our Nation's highest military declaration, the Congressional Medal of Honor.  Lance Corporal Creek was only 18 years old when he went above and beyond the call of duty while serving as rifleman with Company I, 3rd Battalion, 9th Marines. He was one of three Medal of Honor recipients who served with the 9th Marines during the Vietnam War.  I commend my distinguished colleague, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), for introducing H.R. 4836 to honor one of our Nation's heroes, and I will momentarily yield to him.  The VA medical center in Amarillo, Texas, Mr. Speaker, opened in 1940 and played an important role during and after World War II in caring for and rehabilitating U.S. servicemembers. The medical center today provides general medical and surgical treatment and alcohol rehabilitation and vocational rehab services for veterans. Expansion and renovation projects have kept the facility modern, and it currently has some 69 inpatient beds and 120 nursing care beds. I think it is entirely fitting and appropriate to remember the ultimate sacrifice of this young brave Marine by naming the Amarillo VA Medical Center for him.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), the prime author of this bill.
