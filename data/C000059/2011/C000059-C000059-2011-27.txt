Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, California, are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Brad Hudson is one of these individuals. On August 9, 2011, Brad will be honored at a Riverside City Hall reception as he ends his tenure as the City of Riverside's City Manager.  Brad Hudson came to the City of Riverside after serving as the Assistant County Executive Officer of the Economic Development Agency where he was responsible for broad activities and operations throughout the county.  Earlier, Brad spent more than 14 years with the County of Riverside, where he began as Deputy Chief Executive Officer for Eastern Riverside County. Additionally, Hudson proudly served his country in the United States Air Force. He received his B.S. degree from California State University, Fresno, and an MPA from the University of San Francisco.  Appointed as City Manager by the City Council, Brad has acted as the Chief Administrative Officer of the City. He enforces the laws and carries out the policies of the Council through the control and direction of City Departments. In addition, during his time as City Manager, Brad made numerous recommendations to the Council on legislation, fiscal matters, capital improvements and other City policies, and he oversaw the responsibilities of the Communications Officer and the Intergovernmental Relations Office. Riverside City Council members have extensively praised Hudson for accomplishing so much during his six year tenure, particularly a long list of public works projects known as the Riverside Renaissance. After Brad leaves Riverside, he will take the helm as the City of Sacramento's Chief Executive. As such, he will provide leadership to ensure the smooth operation and management of all City Departments.  In light of all Brad Hudson has done for the community of Riverside, we wish him the best as he moves on to his next professional endeavor. Brad's tireless passion for the community has contributed immensely to the betterment of Riverside, California. I am proud to call Brad a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he ends his time as City Manager for the City of Riverside.                          ____________________
