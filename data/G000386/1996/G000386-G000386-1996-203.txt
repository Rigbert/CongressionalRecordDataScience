 It is expected to continue in the future.  Mr. President, the committee concluded that the number of generals and admirals should be reduced consistent with the predicted reductions in the force structure. I want to repeat, the reduction in the number of general officers should be consistent with the reduction in force structure. That was the logic. As the force structure shrinks, the numbers of generals and admirals should come down at a comparable rate. That was the Armed Services Committee's thinking as expressed in its report in the fiscal year 1991 defense authorization bill. That thinking is outlined on page 159 of that Report 101-384.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that that section of the report be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         GENERAL AND FLAG OFFICER ACTIVE DUTY STRENGTH CEILINGS       The committee recommends (sec. 403) a provision that would      establish ceilings on the number of general and flag officers      authorized to be on active duty for each of the military      Services as shown below:------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                 Fiscal year, committee                                        Current       recommendation                                            ceiling -------------------------                                                    1991         1995   ------------------------------------------------------------------------Army................................       407          386          302Navy................................       258          250          216Marine Corps........................        70           68           61Air Force...........................       338          326          279                                     -----------------------------------  Total.............................     1,073        1,030          858------------------------------------------------------------------------       The ceilings established for fiscal year 1995 are      consistent with the committee's expectation that force      structure and organizational realignments over the next 5      years should result in an overall force reduction of at least      25 percent. The fiscal year 1995 ceilings reflect this      expectation, and the fiscal year 1991 ceilings set the      military Services on a responsible course to achieve the      fiscal year 1995 ceilings.       The committee also believes that these ceilings should      assist the military Services in making critical decisions      regarding the reduction, consolidation, and elimination of      duplicative headquarters. The ceilings should also assist the      military Services in eliminating unnecessary layering in the      staff patterns of general and flag officer positions.
