 President Bush and my party generally have favored permanence of tax relief--not just because it brings in less money, but because permanence of tax policy--when investors and laborers can depend on the tax policy, you are going to get better planning long term. It is better for the economy.  Mr. President, you need to look no further than the budgets to which I have referred. The administration and the Republican Congress have budgeted for an extension of the bipartisan tax relief provisions. That action has affected the bottom lines of these budgets. And as we heard over and over again, the Democratic leadership, the liberal think tanks, and sympathetic east coast media have criticized the bottom lines of those budgets. So the Democratic leadership, the liberal think tanks, and the sympathetic east coast media cannot have it both ways. We are not going to let them have it both ways. They cannot shut off the bipartisan tax relief, take credit for the supposed deficit reduction, and also claim that there is tax relief in this budget that passed the Senate 2 weeks ago and the House a week ago.  Getting back to the blog I referred to, the Daily Kos, one posted as ``Ortcutt'' agrees with this point. Ortcutt, however, incorrectly identifies the purveyor of the phony logic. The blogger puts it on Congressional Republicans and President Bush. As the hard, cold numbers in the Democratic budget resolutions and floor debate in the Congressional Record show, Democrats claim that expired tax relief is not a tax hike. Let me emphasize that.  Are we going to let people get away with that, when they know what the law is on December 31, 2010, and the biggest tax increase in the history of the country is going to happen, without a vote of the people? And when that happens, they are saying it is not a tax hike?  Surely, they don't think the American people are that stupid. The Democratic leadership are the folks trying to claim that their budgets, which don't provide the revenue room for expired tax relief, don't contain tax hikes. Hogwash.  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Ortcutt comment.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                          Having It Both Ways       The Republicans want it both ways on budgets and expiring      tax cuts. If you look at the CBO's budget outlook, there will      be a surplus in 2012. However, the only reason for that is      that the temporary tax cuts of the so-called Economic Growth      and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 will expire on      January 1, 2011. When a temporary tax cut expires is that a      tax increase or not? When the President Bush brags that the      budget will be balanced in 2012 without tax increases, he is      saying that letting a tax cut expire is not a tax increase.      But when Republicans debate extending the tax cuts, how many      Republicans do you think will cast letting a tax cut expire      as a tax increase. All of them. It's fundamentally dishonest      and disgusting. I just hope that we can get this fact through      to the American people.
