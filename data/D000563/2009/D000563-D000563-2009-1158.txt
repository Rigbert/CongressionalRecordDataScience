President, I was saddened to learn about the passing of a man who gave many long years of dedicated service to this Capitol.  If you only know this Senate through C-SPAN, it is likely you never saw Steve.  But if you had the privilege to work in this beautiful building, Steve's work was indispensible.  Steve was a valued member of the Senate Sergeant at Arms' Capitol Facilities team for 32 years--since he was 20 years old.  He was part of the team of hard-working men and women who care for this historic building.  If a room in the Capitol needed to be set up for a meeting, set up again an hour later for a hearing, and set up again for a reception, you knew you could count on Steve to do the work right, and on time.  When a filibuster seemed imminent, Steve was part of the crew that would retrieve the cots from storage and set them up in the Capitol--just in case.  Steve's willingness to be helpful was invaluable. Not long after I moved into my office on the third floor of the Capitol, Steve was in my office to install a rug.  He saw that there was a problem. He told my staff that he had seen the problem in another office--the way the rug was to be laid out, visitors would trip on the corner of the rug and might fall.  This was just one example of how Steve cared for this institution and the people who visited this building every day.  Whatever it took to make this Capitol work for visitors and employees, Steve did--with pride and professionalism.  Steve was a friendly man who liked almost everyone--except the Dallas Cowboys.  He was a generous man who never called attention to his generosity. If a coworker needed a ride, Steve was the first to offer. He brought Easter baskets to his friends' children.  Steve Mosley died suddenly and unexpectedly Wednesday night of a heart attack.  I join my colleagues and all who work in this Capitol in offering our deep condolences to Steve's wife of 26 years, Michelle, and their only child, Steven Jr., whose 25th birthday is today.  He was much admired and he will be much missed, in this Capitol and among those who knew him.                          ____________________
