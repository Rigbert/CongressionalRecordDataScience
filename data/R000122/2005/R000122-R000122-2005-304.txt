There were a series of extraordinarily important questions with respect to the quality of life for our soldiers and their families: childcare amendments, amendments with respect to veterans health care, amendments that applied not only to active-duty personnel but their dependents. We had passed legislation already, an amendment that would increase the number of up-armored HMMWVs we are providing to our soldiers. That stands in abeyance until we finish the legislation.  There were important inducements for additional service and enlistment that are necessary to meet the growing and real crisis in recruiting military personnel. If you want to talk about a crisis, it is a crisis, the fact that our Army, despite efforts, has fallen short of the recruiting goal at a time when we need every person to fill out the demand for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and around the world. It is extraordinarily serious.  I don't know if I can find it, but I saw an editorial cartoon in a magazine, a newspaper, which had a picture of a humvee and three soldiers. The caption, if I recall it, is:       Why don't we just take a 4-week recess during this      difficult time and then return to this operation afterwards?  Essentially, I think it captured the dilemma the soldiers are feeling right now. What are we doing?  As the Senator previously indicated, in the Army Times, they wrote of this:       Senate delays action on the defense bill.  I ask unanimous consent to have two articles printed in the Record, one from the Hill and the other from the Army Times, which talk about this issue of leaving the Defense bill and also the impact on procurement of weapons because of this legislation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From The Hill, July 28, 2005]                  Frist: Lawsuits Threaten Gun Supply                           (By Roxana Tiron)       Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) interrupted      debate on the 2006 defense authorization bill to consider      legislation to block lawsuits against gun manufacturers,      saying that ``frivolous'' litigation could leave the Defense      Department without a U.S. source for sidearms.       Despite Frist's alarming claims, the military is not      currently facing any shortage of small arms, according to      Pentagon officials.       American gun manufacturers supply the military with      hundreds of millions of dollars worth of small arms, which      includes a broad variety of firearms from pistols to machine      guns. The weapons are worth even more when ammunition,      modifications and special features such as optical sights are      included.       The U.S. firearms industry has been facing repeated      lawsuits, an attempt to hold manufacturers liable when guns      that were sold lawfully are subsequently misused by      criminals, explained Lawrence Keane, senior vice president      and general counsel for the National Shooting and Sports      Association, a nonprofit organization representing the      firearms industry.       The Senate is considering a new version of a gun-liability      measure that was effectively killed by its own supporters      last year. Sponsored by Sen. Larry Craig (R-Idaho), the      measure would prohibit civil-liability actions against      manufacturers, dealers and importers of firearms and      ammunition in any state or federal court.       In April, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled      that any victim of a shooting in the District could sue the      industry, which Keane said would make gun manufacturers      ``absolutely and automatically'' liable for a criminal      shooting in D.C. Beretta USA, the manufacturer of the M9      pistol, the standard firearm for the armed forces, expressed      concern that a single jury ruling in the District could      bankrupt the company.       ``Every criminal shooting in the district gives rise to a      suit against the industry, and these are the types that need      to be stopped,'' Keane said.       ``Without this legislation it is probable the American      manufacturers of legal firearms will be faced with a real      prospect of going out of business, ending a critical source      of supply for our armed forces, our police and our      citizens,'' Frist said.       Frist's decision to take up the gun-liability measure comes      amid an Army review of more than a half-dozen requests for      proposals for new small arms. In fact, the Army has extended      the request for six months to allow more companies to compete      and included the Marine Corps's requests, according to an      Army spokesperson.       While the Defense Department refused to comment on      ``speculative legislation,'' an Army spokesperson said the      Army currently is not experiencing any problems with the      supply of its sidearms. The Army is the purchasing agent for      most services' sidearms; some exceptions exist for special-     operations forces.       Army leaders are revamping their small-arms inventories to      be better suited to the kind of guerrilla wars being fought      in Iraq. The spokesperson said the Army has not had problems      buying these weapons, although the spokesperson acknowledged      that because the Defense Department is the largest gun      purchaser, it could serve as a ``relevant hypothesis'' for      Frist's arguments.       ``These frivolous suits threaten a domestic industry that      is critical to our national defense, jeopardize hundreds of      thousands of jobs,'' Frist said. ``Many support this      legislation, and I am hopeful that with the cooperation of      members we can complete all action on this legislation before      the recess.''       Frist used the gun-liability legislation in part as a      strategy to divert attention from amendments related to      treatment of detainees and the Pentagon's base closures and      realignments. The Bush administration opposes those      amendments.       Keane argued that the liability bill still allows      manufacturers to be sued if they violate any laws governing      gun sales.       ``There is nothing in the legislation that prevents the      Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau from enforcing the gun-     control act because a dealer has violated regulations,'' he      said.       According to Keane, the gun industry has spent at least      $225 million on lawsuits in the past 10 years and small      companies such as Charco 2000 have filed for bankruptcy      because of lawsuit expenses. Both Beretta and Sigarms, the      two top suppliers to the military have been sued numerous      times.       ``If . . . [a company] like Beretta, which has been sued,      is driven out of business, it will not be able to fulfill      [its] contractual obligation,'' to the military, Keane said.       He argued that these issues should pose immediate concern      to the Defense Department. The firearms (buying) system      hasn't ``collapsed,'' said the spokesperson.       Beretta recently received a contract to supply 18,744 M9      semiautomatic pistols to the U.S. Air Force with an option to      purchase an additional 5,190 pistols.       The pistol is produced at the Beretta USA headquarters in      Accokeek, MD., where it has been made for 20 years. The Air      Force plans to buy 34,374 M9s between 2004 and 2007 at a      price of $39 million, according to Air Force budget      projections. Meanwhile, the Army is planning to buy $8      million worth of modifications to the M9 and M11, which is      produced by Sigarms, between 2006 and 2007.       The Navy is planning to buy 1,069 M11s through 2011 at a      total cost of $722,000 and to spend $5.6 million on      modifications to the M9 pistols, which are supposed to be      completed this year.       According to Hoovers, a business-information service,      Beretta's revenue is estimated at $72.7 million annually.       Another major gun manufacturer, Smith & Wesson, which      provides firearms to law-enforcement officers, told the      Securities and Exchange Commission that it is expecting its      sales to reach $124 million this year, 5 percent higher than      last year.                                  ____                  [From the Army Times, July 26, 2005]                  Senate Delays Action on Defense Bill                             (By Rick Maze)       Senate Republican leaders decided Tuesday that a gun      manufacturers' liability bill is more important than next      year's $441.6 billion defense authorization bill.       With Democrats expressing amazement that there could be any      higher legislative priority in a time of war than the annual      defense bill that includes money for pay and benefits,      operations and maintenance, and weapons purchases and      research, Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, the Senate Republican      leader, decided Tuesday that a bill protecting gun      manufacturers from lawsuits over the illegal use of firearms      was a higher priority.       The decision came after Republican leaders failed to muster      the 60 votes needed to prevent amendments not strictly      related to the defense budget from being offered to the      defense bill.       In a count of 50-48, seven Republicans joined Democrats in      voting not to restrict debate, a move that Democratic leaders      said would have prevented consideration of amendments to help      veterans and survivors     of deceased service members, along with other issues.       With Congress planning to leave town Friday for one-month      break, debate on S. 397, Protection of Lawful Commerce in      Arms Act, is expected to last two or three days, and then      Senate leaders plan to take up an energy bill, an estate tax      reform bill and an Interior Department funding bill that has      a $1.5 billion bailout attached for veterans' health care      programs, leaving no time until September to get back to the      defense bill.       The House approved its version of the defense bill in May      and has been waiting for the Senate to catch up to begin      negotiations with the Bush administration on a final version.       Delay in the Senate is partly a result of senators spending      three weeks this spring debating federal judicial nominations      before reaching a compromise on President Bush's nominees.       It all points toward a difficult autumn. When the Senate      returns in September from its month long summer recess, it      will need to consider recommendations of the Defense Base      Closure and Realignment Commission, due to finish its work by      Sept. 8, and begin deliberations on the John Roberts to the      Supreme Court vacancy left by retiring Justice Sandra Day      O'Connor.
