Speaker, it is with deep sadness and the utmost respect that I take this time to remember a dear friend and one of Indiana's most distinguished citizens, Bishop Frank Munsey, founder of Family Christian Center in Munster, Indiana. On Saturday, February 5, 2011, Bishop Frank Munsey passed away at the age of 80. Known for his commitment to the church and his missionary work, Bishop Munsey will surely be missed by his family, friends, parishioners, and the many people whose lives he influenced.  Bishop Frank Munsey and his wife, Ruth, founded their church in 1953. Initially, the church was named Evangelistic Temple and was located in Hammond, Indiana. The church's congregation continued to grow, and in 1971, Bishop Munsey moved the church to nearby Griffith, Indiana. It was at this time that the church was renamed Family Christian Center. Bishop Munsey's family has always been very active and dedicated to the Bishop's aspirations for the church, and in 1985, Pastor Steve Munsey, Frank's son, took over leadership of the Family Christian Center. In addition to his son, Steve; Bishop Munsey's daughter-in-law, Melody; grandson, Kent; and Kent's wife, Alli, serve as Pastors for the church. Due to its continued, tremendous growth, in 1999, the church moved to its current location in Munster. Today, because of Bishop Frank Munsey's commitment, loyalty, and spiritual guidance, as well as the continued leadership and dedication of his son, Pastor Steve Munsey, and family, the Family Christian Center has an astounding following of more than 30,000 parishioners.  In addition to founding and building the Family Christian Center, Bishop Munsey's passion for missionary work was a significant part of his life. In 1985, he and Ruth became missionaries in Latin America. After seven years of traveling missionary work, they established a Christian school in Bulgaria. In 1992, the American English Academy opened in the city of Sofia, the capital of Bulgaria. Today, there are 175 students from 31 countries who attend this school.  Bishop Frank Munsey is survived by his wife, four children, nine grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. He has been called, ``an amazing man of God'' and ``a gentleman . . . who walked the walk'' by parishioners. Bishop Munsey will be remembered for his truly outstanding contributions to his community and throughout the world.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Bishop Frank Munsey for his devotion to the numerous people whose lives he touched. His unselfish and lifelong dedication to the church, his family, friends, parishioners, and those he served through his missionary work is worthy of the highest commendation. His legacy will serve as an inspiration to all in the spiritual community, and he will remain an inspiration to the people of Northwest Indiana and beyond.                          ____________________
