My concern has been, I hope and I will go on record right now and I am already on record saying, if we have this referendum, this will be the last time that we should allow a referendum to take place on closing a live range. When one stops and thinks about the domino effect this will have on other places, such as Capo Teulada in Sardinia or Cape Wrath in northern Scotland, it would be a real crisis if we lose those, and yet they logically ask the question--I have seen it in print in Scotland: Wait a minute, if they do not allow the training to take place on land they own, why should we let them come here to our country and bomb it?
