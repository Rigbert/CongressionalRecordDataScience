 President, as I recently mentioned, Speaker Ryan and I had an opportunity to discuss some important public health issues at theWhite House yesterday. One was the Zika virus. We know there is an increasing amount of concern about the spread of this virus and what it could mean for the United States as we head toward warmer summer months.  Given the public concern that followed the first Ebola case in our country, I think we could all benefit from having a better understanding of what preparations are being made to protect Americans. To that end, I have asked Secretary Burwell and her team to come to the Senate to brief relevant committees and leaders in both parties. This briefing will happen next week. I appreciate the Secretary's willingness to meet this request in such a timely manner, and I know the information will be useful to Members and their constituents.  Another public health issue we discussed is the opioid epidemic that continues to have such a profound impact on families and communities across the State I represent and, of course, across the Nation as well.  Despite all of the important steps Kentucky has taken at the State level to address this epidemic, the Commonwealth still suffers from some of the highest drug overdose rates in the country, driven by prescription drug pain killers, heroin, and more recently fentanyl, a synthetic opioid that is more powerful than heroin. Republicans and Democrats are working together to identify bipartisan solutions to this challenge, and I look forward to seeing that collaborative work continue.                          ____________________
