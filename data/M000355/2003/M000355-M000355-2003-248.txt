 Under the previous order, there will be a vote in relation to the Dorgan amendment at approximately 10:40 a.m. This will be the first vote of the day.  Following the disposition of the Dorgan amendment, the Senate will turn to consideration of H.R. 1904, the Healthy Forests bill. Senator Cochran will be on the floor to work through any of those amendments. Amendments to this urgent legislation will be offered and debated throughout the day. Therefore, Senators should expect rollcall votes throughout tomorrow.  Clearly, if anyone has had their television set on in recent days, it is important to move on this Healthy Forests legislation. Fires have been burning all over the West.  A cloture motion was filed this evening on the nomination of Charles Pickering to be a Federal circuit judge. That cloture vote will occur on Thursday, and Senators will be notified when that vote is scheduled.  Also, as a reminder, an agreement was reached tonight for the consideration of the fair credit reporting bill, and that bill will be considered next week.                          ____________________
