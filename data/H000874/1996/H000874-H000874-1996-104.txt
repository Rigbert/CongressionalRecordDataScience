                             {time}  1415  Mr. Chairman, I believe I have seen the two amendments the gentleman is talking about, but I wanted to make sure. One is at page 119 after line 8; one is at page 118 after line 16. Am I correct, however, that the substance, as a matter of fact, the exact verbiage of both is the same?
