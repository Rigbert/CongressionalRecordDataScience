President, we have been talking about a complete energy policy for America. This is a bipartisan effort. I tried to get the Reagan administration to do it, then the Bush administration, the Clinton administration. None of them had done it. Now we have an opportunity to do it. An essential part of that is going to be nuclear energy. Maybe it has been said before, but I only want to put into the Record that after going through this long arduous thing on ambient air and the problems of other forms of energy, each year the U.S. nuclear powerplants prevent 5.1 million tons of sulphur dioxide, 2.4 million tons of nitrogen oxide, and 164 million metric tons of carbon from entering the earth's surface.  Consequently, there are many people who were out protesting against nuclear energy just 20 years ago who now realize this is an abundant and safe and cheap form of energy.  It is necessary in order to do that to have the Price-Anderson Act reauthorized.  I yield the floor                Amendment No. 2986 To Amendment No. 2917
