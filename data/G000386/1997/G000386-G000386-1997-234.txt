 President, today I am pleased to introduce legislation to address a problem of critical importance to this country: The dismal level of individual retirement savings. This measure would encourage retirement savings by initiating an education project and creating a national summit on retirement savings.  Before I go any further let me read you some statistics:  Our national net savings fell from 7.1 to 1.8 percent from the 1970's to the 1990's. On an individual level, this means that individuals may not be able to retire when they desire with the lifestyle that they desire.  In a 1994 survey by the Employee Benefits Research Institute [EBRI]: 14 percent of workers who were saving for their retirement did not know much they had saved, and 13 percent saved less than $1,000.  In another survey by Merrill Lynch of workers in their forties and early fifties, savings levels had dropped by 6 percent from 1988 to 1994.  According to the 1996 Retirement Confidence Survey released earlier this year by the EBRI: Only one-third of American workers have calculated how much money they will need to have saved by retirement in order to live comfortably; of the workers that have tried to determine how much money they should be saving, only one-third felt very confident that they had determined an accurate figure; when asked how much they calculated that they would need to save, 42 percent could not give an amount; and less than 20 percent had a specific number with which to work.  So, the problem is twofold: There is a lack of adequate retirement savings, and Americans workers do not understand the importance of determining how much money they should be saving in order to retire comfortably. The Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, held its first hearing on meeting the challenges of the retiring baby boom generation. At that hearing, witness after witness stressed the need to start a national public education campaign. This downward trend in savings couldn't be happending at a worse time, given the retirement of the first wave of baby boomers is in just over 10 years. When baby boomers retire we will be unable to sustain, as presently structured, the programs on which the elderly rely for their health and income security. Educating the public about the necessity to save for their retirement is vital. That is why I am introducing the Savings Are Vital to Everyone's Retirement, or SAVER, Act of 1997.  The SAVER Act would direct the Department of Labor to maintain an ongoing retirement savings education program. This program would include public service announcements, public meetings, the creation and dissemination of educational materials, and establish a site on the Internet. This project will give the American people the information they need, in terms they can understand, to develop retirement savings goals and a plan to achieve those goals. The information will include the tools necessary for individuals to cacluate how much an individual will need to save. Just a important, this educational effort will also focus on how employers can establish different retirement savings arrangements for their employees.  My legislation will also convene a national summit on retirement savings. The summit will bring together in one forum experts in the field of employee benefits and retirement savings, leaders of Government, and interested parties from the private sector and the general public. By bringing these delegates together we hope to advance the public's knowledge and understanding of the need to put money away for retirement, urge American workers to set aside adequate funds, and identify the impediments for small employers in setting up retirement savings arrangements for their employees.  I want to commend Congressmen Harris Fawell and Donald Payne, chairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Employee-Employer Relations of the Education and Workforce Committee, for their leadership. The House legislation, H.R. 1377, has bipartisan support with over 30 cosponsors across the political spectrum. In addition the bill is endorsed by the several organizations including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the American Association of Retired Persons.  Today's workers need to have confidence and feel good about their retirement and quality of life. One of the most important things Government can do is encourage individuals to acquire the knowledge that will help them achieve a secure retirement. The SAVER Act is by no means a solution to the problem of inadequate retirement savings, but it is a critical first step to facing the future demographic tidalwave.                                 ______                                       By
