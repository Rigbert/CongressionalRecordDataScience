 President, it is with great pleasure that I rise today to commend Police Chief Michael Capriglione of the town of Newport, DE. Chief Capriglione has been recognized by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration with a Public Service Award for his outstanding dedication to the fight against drunken driving in the State of Delaware.  Chief Capriglione was nominated for this award by the mid-Atlantic office of the NHTSA, which began the Checkpoint Strikeforce Campaign in Delaware in 2001. The Checkpoint Strikeforce Campaign is an initiative that works to decrease the number of impaired driving crashes through increased police presence on the roads and statewide sobriety checkpoints on weekends and during holidays. The campaign has continued to grow since its inception, with increasing numbers of affiliated police agencies and officers joining the program each year. In 2003, county teams were created to pool resources and enhance the efficiency of the campaign in each of Delaware's three counties. Chief Capriglione was named the head of the New Castle County DUI Task Force and has served as the primary law enforcement advocate for the Checkpoint Strikeforce Campaign in Delaware.  The campaign had been highly successful; an increasing number of DUI arrests are made each year, with 685 intoxicated drivers arrested between July and December 2005 alone. This results in safer roads for our citizens to travel: 2004 saw the lowest number of alcohol-related highway deaths ever recorded in the State. The campaign has also expanded from its original half-year scope to become a year-round initiative. Under Chief Capriglione's leadership, the New Castle County DUI Task Force has established checkpoints during major holidays and other events typically associated with higher rates of impaired driving, including Super Bowl Sunday and St. Patrick's Day. During the recent Cinco de Mayo holiday, the county teams conducted checkpoints that resulted in 19 DUI arrests, as well as 7 drug arrests, 8 felony arrests, and the apprehension of 3 wanted individuals.  Chief Michael Capriglione has been instrumental in the development and success of the Checkpoint Strikeforce Campaign in Delaware. Through his exceptional leadership and commitment to public service, Delaware's roadways have become safer and its citizens more secure. He is the embodiment of public service and deserves all of the recognition he has received for his remarkable efforts, and more. We are fortunate to have committed, effective law enforcement professionals such as Chief Capriglione working to combat the problem of drunken driving throughout Delaware and the Nation, and I ask the Senate to join me in thanking Chief Capriglione for his dedicated service.                          ____________________
