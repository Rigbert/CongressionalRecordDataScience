Mr. Speaker, the United States has a longstanding dynamic relationship with our NATO ally, the Republic of Turkey, and I believe that the strength of that relationship relies on forthright candor. I have willingly recognized positive developments in Turkey, and I have sought to present fairly the various human rights concerns as they have arisen. Today, I must bring to my colleagues' attention pending actions involving the Government of Turkey which seem incongruous with the record in violation of human rights. I fear the planned sale of additional military aircraft to Turkey could potentially have further long-term, negative effects on human rights in that country.  As Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I presided over a hearing in March of 1999 that addressed many human rights concerns. The State Department had just released its Country Reports on Human Rights Practices covering 1998. Commissioner and Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Harold Hongju Koh noted in testimony before the Commission that ``serious human rights abuses continued in Turkey in 1998, but we had hoped that the 1998 report would reflect significant progress on Turkey's human rights record. Prime Minister Yilmaz had publicly committed himself to making the protection of human rights his government's highest priority in 1998. We had welcomed those assurances and respected the sincerity of his intentions. We were disappointed that Turkey had not fully translated those assurances into actions.''  I noted in my opening statement, ``One year after a commission delegation visited Turkey, our conclusion is that there has been no demonstrable improvement in Ankara's human rights practices and that the prospects for much needed systemic reforms are bleak given the unstable political scene which is likely to continue throughout 1999.''  Thankfully, eighteen months later I can say that the picture has improved--somewhat.  A little over a year ago the president of Turkey's highest court made an extraordinary speech asserting that Turkish citizens should be granted the right to speak freely, urgingthat the legal system and constitution be ``cleansed,'' and that existing ``limits on language'' seriously compromised the freedom of expression. The man who gave that speech, His Excellency Ahmet Necdet Sezer, is the new President of the Republic of Turkey. Last summer several of us on the Commission congratulated President Sezer on his accession to the presidency, saying, in part:       We look forward to working with you and members of your      administration, especially as you endeavor to fulfill your      commitments to the principles of the Helsinki Final Act and      commitments contained in other Organization for Security and      Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) documents. These human rights      fundamentals are the bedrock upon which European human rights      rest, the solid foundation upon which Europe's human rights      structures are built. It is worth remembering, twenty-five      years after the signing of the Final Act, that your      predecessor, President Demerel, signed the commitments at      Helsinki on behalf of Turkey. Your country's engagement in      the Helsinki process was highlighted during last year's OSCE      summit in Istanbul, a meeting which emphasized the importance      of freedom of expression, the role of NGOs in civil society,      and the eradication of torture.       Your Presidency comes at a very critical time in modern      Turkey's history. Adoption and implementation of the reforms      you have advocated would certainly strengthen the ties      between our countries and facilitate fuller integration of      Turkey into Europe. Full respect for the rights of Turkey's      significant Kurdish population would go a long way in      reducing tensions that have festered for more than a decade,      and resulted in the lengthy conflict in the southeast.       Your proposals to consolidate and strengthen democracy,      human rights and the rule of law in Turkey will be      instrumental in ushering in a new era of peace and prosperity      in the Republic. The Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE      documents can serve as important guides in your endeavor.  We all recall the pending $4 billion sale of advanced attack helicopters to the Turkish army. I have objected to this sale as leading human rights organizations, Turkish and western press, and even the State Department documented the use of such helicopters to attack Kurdish villages in Turkey and to transport troops to regions where civilians were killed. Despite repeated promises, the Turkish Government has been slow to take action which would hold accountable and punish those who have committed such atrocities.  And we recently learned of the pending sale of eight even larger helicopters, S-80E heavy lift helicopters for Turkey's Land Forces Command. With a flight radius of over three hundred miles and the ability to carry over fifty armed troops, the S-80E has the potential to greatly expand the ability of Turkey's army to undertake actions such as I just recounted.  Since 1998, there has been recognition in high-level U.S.-Turkish exchanges that Turkey has a number of longstanding issues which must be addressed with demonstrable progress: decriminalization of freedom of expression; the release of imprisoned parliamentarians and journalists; prosecution of police officers who commit torture; an end of harassment of human rights defenders and re-opening of non-governmental organizations; the return of internally displaced people to their villages; cessation of harassment and banning of certain political parties; and, an end to the state of emergency in the southeast.  The human rights picture in Turkey has improved somewhat in the last several years, yet journalists continue to be arrested and jailed, human rights organizations continue to feel pressure from the police, and elected officials who are affiliated with certain political parties, in particular, continue to be harassed.  Anywhere from half a million to 2 million Kurds have been displaced by the Turkish counter insurgency campaigns against the Kurdistan Workers Party, also known as the PKK. The Turkish military has reportedly emptied more than three thousand villages and hamlets in the southeast since 1992, burned homes and fields, and committed other human rights abuses against Kurdish civilians, often using types of helicopters similar to those the Administration is seeking to transfer. Despite repeated promises, the Government of Turkey has taken few steps to facilitate the return of these peoples to their homes, assist them to resettle, or compensate them for the loss of their property. Nor does it allow others to help. Even the ICRC has been unable to operate in Turkey. And, finally, four parliamentarians--Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan, and Selim Sadak--continue to serve time in prison. We can not proceed with this sale, or other sales or transfers, when Turkey's Government fails to live up to the most basic expectations mentioned above.  Mr. Speaker, I think it is also time that the United States establishes an understanding with Turkey and a credible method of consistent monitoring and reporting on the end-use of U.S. weapons, aircraft and service. An August 2000 report from the General Accounting Office (GAO) entitled ``Foreign Military Sales: Changes Needed to Correct Weaknesses in End-Use Monitoring Program'' was a cause for concern on my part regarding the effectiveness of current end-use monitoring and reporting efforts. While we had been assured that end-use monitoring was taking place and that the United States was holding recipient governments accountable to the export license criteria, the GAO report reveals the failure of the Executive Branch to effectively implement monitoring requirements enacted by Congress. For example, the report points out on page 12:       While field personnel may be aware of adverse conditions in      their countries, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency has      not established guidance or procedures for field personnel to      use in determining when such conditions require an end-use      check. For example, significant upheaval occurred in both      Indonesia and Pakistan within the last several years. As a      result, the State Department determined that both countries      are no longer eligible to purchase U.S. defense articles and      services. However, end-use checks of U.S. defense items      already provided were not performed in either country in      response to the standard. DSCA officials believed that the      State Department was responsible for notifying field      personnel that the criteria had been met for an end-use check      to be conducted. However, DSCA and State have never      established a procedure for providing notification to field      personnel.       Currently, the end-use monitoring training that DSCA      provides to field personnel consists of a 30-minute      presentation during the security assistance management course      at the Defense Institute of Security Assistance Management.      This training is intended to familiarize students with en-use      monitoring requirements. However, this training does not      provide any guidance or procedures on how to execute an end-     use monitoring program at overseas posts or when to initiate      end-use checks in response to one of the five standards.In the past there have been largely ad hoc attempts to report on the end-use of U.S. equipment. Therefore, I was pleased to support the passage of H.R. 4919, the Security Assistant Act of 2000 that was signed by the President on October 6. Section 703 of this Act mandates that no later than 180 days after its enactment, the President shall prepare and transmit to Congress a report summarizing the status of efforts by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency to implement the End-Use Monitoring Enhancement Plan relating to government-to-government transfers of defense articles, services, and related technologies. I want to commend House International Relations Committee Chairman Ben Gilman for his efforts in trying to make our end-use monitoring and reporting programs effective and accurate. I look forward to working with him and others to ensure that an effective and credible monitoring program is put in place without further delay.  We must be consistent in our defense of human rights, and our relations, including our military relations, must reflect that commitment. For this reason, Mr. Speaker, I am not prepared to support the sale of additional weaponry and aircraft to Turkey at this time.                          ____________________
