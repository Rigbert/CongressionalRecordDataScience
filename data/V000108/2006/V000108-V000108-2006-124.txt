Speaker, it is my distinct honor to take this time to remember one of Northwest Indiana's most distinguished citizens, Richard ``Dick'' Quattrin, of Whiting, Indiana. On Sunday, February 26, 2006, Dick passed away while in Washington, D.C. As he so often did, Dick made the trip to Washington to take part in a national meeting of the American Legion. Dick will be laid to rest on Saturday, February 4, 2006, at Saint Joseph Cemetery in Hammond, Indiana.  Dick Quattrin was born on August 18, 1932, to Angelo and Laura Quattrin. He was born and raised in the Pullman-Roseland neighborhoods of Chicago before relocating to Whiting, Indiana, which he called home for over fifty years. These fifty years were spent with his beloved wife, Dorothy, who survives him. Dick is also survived by his five daughters, Lydia (Greg) Beer, Karen (Ed) Erminger, Ruth (Wayne) Rodda, Marsha (John) Jerome, and Sharon Quattrin. Dick is also survived by his brothers Norman (Laurie) Quattrin and Ron (Sandy) Quattrin, his sister-in-law Rose (Bill) Tuskan, and his loving grandchildren, whom he truly cherished: Andrew, Jason, Jennifer, Daniel, Jeffrey, Megan, Laura, Allison, Emily, and Claire.  Dick's life of service to his community goes back to his days in the United States Army, where he obtained the rank of Sergeant. Dick felt tremendous pride for his country, and he was willing to endanger his own life to protect the lives of his fellow Americans, as evidenced by his service during the Korean Conflict. His courage and heroism will always be remembered, and his sacrifice will forever live in the hearts and minds of those for whom he battled. Throughout his professional career, Dick continued to serve the community as a member of the fire department for the City of Hammond, Indiana.  Since his discharge from the United States Army, Dick has become most well known in the community for his commitment to veterans and his involvement with the American Legion and other veterans' organizations. Dick's dedication to the American Legion is evident in the many prestigious positions he held. Dick was a past commander of American Legion Post #80 in Whiting, where he remained a constant fixture until his passing. Dick was even named to the revered post of Commander of the Department of Indiana American Legion from 1997-1998. His efforts in this position allowed him to spread his compassion and his unwavering concern for veterans far beyond the borders of Northwest Indiana. Along the way, I am sure Dick crossed paths with many more veterans whose lives were touched, knowing that such a passionate individual was fighting for them. In addition to his service to the American Legion, Dick was also an active member of the 40/8, the Veterans of Foreign Wars Walter Kleiber Post 2724, the Knights of Columbus Council 1696, and the B.P.O.E. Whiting Lodge 68.  While Dick has dedicated considerable time and energy to veterans' rights, he has always made an extra effort to give back to the community. Dick, well known in Northwest Indiana for his talents as a singer, was a member of his church choir and the ``Knight Sounds'' of the Whiting Knights of Columbus. In addition, Dick was highly respected in the community in the area of athletics, having coached the Whiting Post #80 baseball team for the past 40 years. An accomplished athlete in his own right, Dick played professional baseball as a member of the Saint Louis Browns affiliated minor league ball club.  Mr. Speaker, I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in honoring Mr. Richard ``Dick'' Quattrin for his outstanding devotion to Indiana's First Congressional District. His unselfish and lifelong dedication to veterans and the Northwest Indiana community is worthy of the highest commendation. Dick's selflessness was an inspiration to us all, and I am proud to have represented him in Congress.                          ____________________
