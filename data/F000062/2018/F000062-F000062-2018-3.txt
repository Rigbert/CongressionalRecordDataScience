 President, I rise to introduce a Senate Resolution honoring the victims of the mass shooting in Thousand Oaks, California.  On November 7, 2018, a shooter armed with a semiautomatic pistol and high-capacity ammunition magazine attacked the Borderline Bar and Grill. Borderline is known as a popular meeting place for residents and country music fans. That night was a ``college night,'' and students had gathered there for a night of music and dancing.  What happened next was the deadliest mass shooting in California since the 2015 terror attack in San Bernardino. Twelve people lost their lives that night in Thousand Oaks. They included students, military veterans, and 27 year old Telemachus Orfanos, who was a survivor of the October 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas.  Just think about that for a moment. A survivor of the deadliest mass shooting in our Nation's history lost his life in another mass shooting a year later.  Ventura County Sheriff Sergeant Ron Helus also lost his life that night. He was one of the first law enforcement officers on the scene, and he gave his life confronting the assailant and protecting his community. Thousand Oaks is one of the safest cities in America. If an attack like this can happen there, it can happen anywhere.  This Resolution condemns the terrible violence experienced by the Thousand Oaks community and honors the memory of those who we have lost. This Resolution also recognizes the efforts of law enforcement, firefighters, and emergency medical teams, whose steadfast dedication and service to the victims and survivors in Thousand Oaks undoubtedly saved lives.  Finally, this Resolution reaffirms our commitment to ensure that the victims' families and those who were injured receive the assistance they need.  Mr. President, our Nation suffers one mass shooting after another. We no longer have time to grieve before gun violence devastates another community. Thousand Oaks has now joined the ever growing list of communities across America that are mourning the loss of loved ones from this ongoing epidemic. I call upon all of my Republican colleagues to work with us and do everything we can to prevent another attack.  I also ask that each member of this chamber remember the victims, their families, the survivors, and the entire community of Thousand Oaks, and continue to hold them in their hearts.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
