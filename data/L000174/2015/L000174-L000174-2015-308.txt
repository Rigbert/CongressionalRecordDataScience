The delay of her confirmation is unprecedented and unwarranted. It should end.  It has been 121 days since President Obama announced his intention to nominate Ms. Lynch. Her nomination was reported by the Judiciary Committee on a bipartisan basis 11 days ago. In the last 30 years, no Attorney General nominee has waited longer than Loretta Lynch to receive a floor vote after being reported from committee.  I think of what we did when President Bush was in the last 2 years of his Presidency. Democrats had just taken back the majority in the Senate. He nominated a person for Attorney General--actually a person I voted against--but I moved that person forward anyway because I felt the President of the United States deserved to have an Attorney General. I moved that person through in half the time we have had to wait for Loretta Lynch.  Ms. Lynch has broad support from Democrats and Republicans across the legal and law enforcement communities. So there is no excuse. She shouldn't be treated differently than previous nominees. Actually, she should receive a vote tonight, along with the other nominees who are to be confirmed. She should not be treated any differently than President Bush's nominee.  So in the wake of the bipartisan and inspirational celebration in Selma, let us come together to honor the difficult work of the Justice Department. Let's schedule a vote to confirm the first African-American woman to serve as Attorney General of the United States. Let us show the American people what we can do when we come together. Let us finally vote to confirm Loretta Lynch.  I see the majority leader on the floor. I don't want to take his time.  I yield the floor.
