President, recently I spoke to the Senate on the occasion of the consideration of the nomination of Jane Branstetter Stranch of Tennessee to the Sixth Circuit. It was nearly 10 months after her nomination was favorably reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee that Senate Republicans finally consented to a time agreement and vote, despite the support of the senior Senator from Tennessee, a member of the Republican leadership. Nevertheless, I said then that if consideration of the Stranch nomination, after months of needless delay, represented a bipartisan willingness to return to the Senate's tradition of offering advice and consent without extensive delays, I welcomed it. I urged the Senate to consider the other 16 judicial nominations then on the Senate Executive Calendar favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee without further delay.  Regrettably, since Judge Stranch was approved by a bipartisan majority on September 13, the Senate has not considered a single additional judicial nomination, although some were reported as long ago as January. Indeed,during the rest of this work period the list of judicial nominations stalled on the calendar has grown to 23, including 16 that were reported by the committee unanimously. Meanwhile judicial vacancies around the country continue to rise and now number 104. These include 48 vacancies that the Judicial Conference has designated as judicial emergencies.  The Senate is well behind the pace set by a Democratic majority in the Senate considering President Bush's nominations during his first 2 years in office. Republicans have allowed the Senate to consider and confirm only 41 of President Obama's circuit and district court nominations over the last 2 years. In stark contrast, by this date in President Bush's second year in office, the Senate with a Democratic majority had confirmed 78 of his Federal circuit and district court nominations. That number reached 100 by the end of 2002, all considered and confirmed during the 17 months I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee.  During those 17 months, I scheduled 26 hearings for the judicial nominees of a Republican President and the Judiciary Committee worked diligently to consider them. During the 2 years of the Obama administration, I have tried to maintain that same approach, and the committee has held 25 hearings for President Obama's Federal circuit and district court nominees. I have not altered my approach and neither have the Senate Democrats.  One thing that has changed is that we have been able to hold hearings for nominees more regularly because we now receive the paperwork on the nominations, the nominee's completed questionnaire, the confidential background investigation and the America Bar Association, ABA, peer review almost immediately after a nomination is made, allowing us to proceed. During 2001 and 2002, President Bush abandoned the procedure that President Eisenhower had adopted and that had been used by President George H.W. Bush, President Reagan and all Presidents for more than 50 years. Instead, President George W. Bush delayed the start of the ABA peer review process until after the nomination was sent to the Senate. That added weeks and months to the timeline in which hearings were able to be scheduled on nominations.  When I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee midway through President Bush's first tumultuous year in office, I worked very hard to make sure Senate Democrats did not perpetuate the ``judge wars'' as tit-for-tat. Despite that fact that Senate Republicans pocket filibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominations and refused to proceed on them while judicial vacancies skyrocketed during the Clinton administration to more than 110, in 2001 and 2002, during the 17 months I chaired the committee during President Bush's first 2 years in office, the Senate proceeded to confirm 100 of his judicial nominees.  By refusing to proceed on President Clinton's nominations while judicial vacancies skyrocketed during the 6 years they controlled the pace of nominations, Senate Republicans allowed vacancies to rise to more than 110 by the end of the Clinton administration. As a result of their strategy, Federal circuit court vacancies doubled. When Democrats regained the Senate majority halfway into President Bush's first year in office, we turned away from these bad practices. As a result, overall judicial vacancies were reduced during the Bush years from more than 10 percent to less than four percent. During the Bush years, the Federal court vacancies were reduced from 110 to 34 and Federal circuit court vacancies were reduced from a high of 32 down to single digits.  This progress has not continued with a Democratic President back in office. Instead, Senate Republicans have returned to the strategy they used during the Clinton administration of blocking the nominations of a Democratic President, again leading to skyrocketing vacancies. Last year the Senate confirmed only 12 Federal circuit and district court judges, the lowest total in 50 years. This year we have yet to confirm 30 Federal circuit and district judges. We are not even keeping up with retirements and attrition. As a result, judicial vacancies are, again, over 100 and, again, more than 10 percent.  This trend should alarm the American people who expect justice from the Federal courts. I will ask consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement a recent column by Attorney General Eric Holder about the cost to the American system of justice. He writes:       The federal judicial system that has been a rightful source      of pride for the United States--the system on which we all      depend for a prompt and fair hearing of our cases when we      need to call on the law--is stressed to the breaking point.       Last year, 259,000 civil cases and 75,000 criminal cases      were filed in the federal courts, enough to tax the abilities      of the judiciary even when it is fully staffed. But today      there are 103 judicial vacancies--nearly one in eight seats      on the bench. Men and women who need their day in court must      stand in longer and longer lines.  I will also ask consent to have printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement a recent article that appeared on Slate by Dahlia Lithwick and Professor Carl Tobias, pointing out that thousands of hard-working Americans seeking justice in our courts bear the cost of justice delayed and denied as a result of vacant courtrooms and overburdened judges. Many senior and retired judges continue to try to carry the workload, but we fall farther behind. They write:       It stands to reason that if you can't get into a courtroom,      if the docket is too packed for your case to be heard      promptly, or if the judge lacks sufficient time to address      the issues raised, justice suffers. This will directly affect      thousands of ordinary Americans plaintiffs and defendants      whose liberty, safety, or job may be at stake and for whom      justice may arrive too late, if at all. In some      jurisdictions, civil litigants may well wait two to three      years before going to trial. In jurisdictions with the most      vacancies, it will often take far longer for published      opinions to be issued, or courts will come to rely on more      unpublished opinions. More worrisome still, because the      Speedy Trial Act requires that courts give precedence to      criminal cases, some backlogged courts have had to stop      hearing civil cases altogether.  Earlier this month, I spoke to the Senate about the serious warning issued by Justice Anthony Kennedy at the Ninth Circuit Conference about skyrocketing judicial vacancies in California and throughout the country. He said, ``It's important for the public to understand that the excellence of the federal judiciary is at risk.'' He noted that ``if judicial excellence is cast upon a sea of congressional indifference, the rule of law is imperiled.'' A recent editorial in the Los Angeles Times focuses on the acute problems in the Ninth Circuit and urges the Senate to act on three nominations to fill vacancies in Federal courts in California.  President Obama has not made nominations opposed by home State Senators but has, instead, reached out and worked with home State Senators from both parties. Likewise, I have respected the minority. We have tried to develop and improve the cooperation between parties and branches. It is disappointing to see others take the opposite approach. We could help to address this vacancies crisis just by acting on the judicial nominations ready for action but which remain stalled on the Executive Calendar.  I have worked closely with the ranking Republicans on the Judiciary Committee while serving as its chairman. I have enjoyed my relationship with the current Ranking Republican, and I have often thanked Senator Sessions for his cooperation in working with me to hold hearings and consider nominations in committee. I was disappointed by his statement to the Senate last week, however. He is entitled to his own perspective on these matters, of course. I feel very strongly that Democrats in the Senate treated President Bush's judicial nominations better and more fairly than Republicans had those of President Clinton, and certainly better than President Obama's nominees are currently being treated. The comparison of vacancy rates and the number of judges confirmed in President Bush's first 2 years with a Democratic majority--100, including 17 circuit court nominations--bear that out. I also believe that there was a clear difference in the smaller number of judicial nominees opposed by Democratic Senators and the open manner in which Democrats made clear the basis of their opposition in contrast to the secret holds and across the board nature of the Republican opposition. Another indisputable fact is the judicial vacancy crisis during the Clinton administration that has been recreated since President Obama was elected. By contrast, during the Bush administrationSenate Democrats worked to reduce vacancies and the result was that we did so dramatically.  Indeed, much of Senator Sessions' statement last Wednesday reads like an attempted justification for some sort of payback. He does concede that we proceeded promptly to confirm President Bush's district court nominations, but unfortunately attributes a sinister cast even to those actions. Sometimes the statement does not merely attribute the wrong motive or mischaracterize what happened, but is a misstatement of the facts. For example, the Senator suggested that the Senate confirmed only 6 of President Bush's 25 circuit court nominees. In fact, we worked hard to confirm 17 circuit court nominees in the 17 months that I chaired the committee during 2001 and 2002.  By contrast, only 11 of President Obama's circuit court nominees have been confirmed these 2 years--this, despite the fact that 17 have, so far, been reported by the Judiciary Committee. Five of the six circuit court nominations stalled and still being prevented from being considered were reported unanimously, one as long ago as January. This is another good illustration of the difference in how Republican and Democratic Senators have treated judicial nominations by the President of the other party.  Democratic Senators did not stall such consensus nominations for spite or payback. And when we opposed nominations we said why. Unlike President Bush, President Obama has not made a series of judicial nominees designed to pack the courts with ideologues. Instead, he has worked with home State Senators and selected highly qualified, predominately moderate nominees.  Nor have we sought to force through nominations by ignoring the rules and traditions of the Senate or the committee, as Republicans did. Those practices are detailed in my contemporaneous statements at the time but ignored in the statement made last Wednesday. For example, when I became chairman in 2001, I made home State Senators' ``blue slips'' public for the first time, preventing Senators from anonymously blocking committee action on judicial nominees. That was a bad practice that led to the pocket filibusters of more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominees. Also ignored in last Wednesday's statement was the history of earlier filibusters, such as that of the Supreme Court nomination of Abe Fortas to be the Chief Justice and of President Clinton's nominations to the Ninth Circuit.  The statement was in many regards ahistorical or anti-historical. In complaining about a handful of Fourth Circuit nominees in the last 2 years of President Bush's administration, the statement ignored the fact that we had broken the logjam caused by 8 years of Republican obstruction of President Clinton's nominations to that circuit and that the examples cited were after vacancies had been reduced and in light of opposition from home State Senators to some of the nominees. Indeed, we might have made even more progress had President Bush not proceeded for years to make several extreme nominations. The statement also seems unaware of the work we did to resolve the impasse in the Sixth Circuit, resulting in every single vacancy in the circuit being filled by President Bush.  Regrettably, the Senate this year is not being allowed to consider the consensus, mainstream judicial nominees favorably reported from the Judiciary Committee. It has taken nearly five times as long to consider President Obama's judicial nominations as it did to consider President Bush's during his first 2 years in office. During the first 2 years of the Bush administration, the 100 judges confirmed were considered by the Senate an average of 25 days from being reported by the Judiciary Committee. The average time for confirmed circuit court nominees was 26 days. By contrast, the average time for the 41 Federal circuit and district and circuit court judges confirmed since President Obama took office is 90 days and the average time for circuit nominees is 148 days--and that disparity is increasing.  Senate Republicans have refused to allow prompt consideration even to those consensus nominations that are reported unanimously and without opposition by the Judiciary Committee. There is no good reason to hold up consideration for weeks and months of nominees reported without opposition from the Judiciary Committee. I have been urging since last year that these consensus nominees be considered promptly and confirmed.  In 2001 and 2002, the first 2 years of the Bush administration, the Senate with a Democratic majority confirmed 100 judicial nominees. We obviously will not reach that level or reduce judicial vacancies as effectively as we did in those 2 years. What we can do is consider the 23 judicial nominations already on the calendar. That could bring us to 64 Federal circuit and district court confirmations. If we also completed action on the 11 additional judicial nominees who participated in September hearings, that could bring us to a respectable total of 75 circuit and district court confirmations. That would be in the range of judicial confirmations during President Reagan's first 2 years (88) and President George H.W. Bush's, 72, but pale in comparison to the 100 confirmed in the first 2 years of the George W. Bush administration or those confirmed during President Clinton's first 2 years, 126.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record those materials to which I referred.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               [From The Washington Post, Sep. 28, 2010]            Now Vacant: A Confirmation Crisis in our Courts                        (By Eric H. Holder, Jr.)       More than a year ago, President Obama nominated Jane      Stranch, a respected Nashville labor lawyer, to a seat on the      U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. That vacancy had      been declared a ``judicial emergency'' because the Sixth      Circuit does not have enough judges to promptly or      effectively handle the court's caseload, leading to serious      delays in the administration of justice to people in      Tennessee and other parts of the 6th Circuit. Yet despite the      fact that Judge Stranch enjoyed the support of both of her      Republican home-state senators and bipartisan support in the      Senate Judiciary Committee, she was forced to wait almost 300      days for an up-or-down vote by the full Senate. When she      finally received that vote earlier this month, she was      confirmed overwhelmingly.       Unfortunately, her story is all too typical. Nominee after      nominee has languished in the Senate for many months, only to      be confirmed by wide bipartisan margins when they finally do      receive a vote. As Congress finishes its last week in session      before the November elections, our judicial system      desperately needs the Senate to act.       Today, 23 judicial nominees--honest and qualified men and      women eager to serve the cause of justice--are enduring long      delays while awaiting up-or-down votes, even though 16 of      them received unanimous bipartisan approval in the Judiciary      Committee. The confirmation process is so twisted in knots      that we are losing ground--there are more vacancies today      than when President Obama took office. The men and women      whose confirmations have been delayed have received high      marks from the nonpartisan American Bar Association, have the      support of their home-state senators (including Republicans),      and have received little or no opposition in committee. These      outstanding lawyers and jurists deserve better, as do      litigants who bring cases to increasingly understaffed      courts.       In the Eastern District of California, in Sacramento, there      are 1,097 cases filed per judge annually. Six months ago, the      president nominated California Judge Kimberly Mueller to help      relieve that workload. Judge Mueller is a distinguished      jurist with seven years' experience as a magistrate judge, a      unanimous rating of well qualified from the American Bar      Association and the unanimous backing of the Senate Judiciary      Committee. Yet she has still not been confirmed.       For the 4th Circuit, the president nominated Albert Diaz,      an experienced state court judge and former Marine and      officer in the Navy's Judge Advocate General Corps, to a seat      on the U.S. Court of Appeals that has been vacant for more      than three years. He was approved unanimously by the Senate      Judiciary Committee in January and is strongly backed by both      of North Carolina's senators. Yet Judge Diaz has waited 242      days for a vote by the full Senate.       In the rotunda outside my Justice Department office, it is      inscribed that ``The United States wins its point whenever      justice is done its citizens in the courts.'' As attorney      general, I have the privilege of leading a strong department      in which public servants seek justice every day. But the      quotation that has greeted attorneys general for the past 70      years serves as a reminder that justice depends on effective      courts. The federal judicial system that has been a rightful      source of pride for the United States--the system on which we      all depend for a prompt and fair hearing of our cases when we      need to call on the law--is stressed to the breaking point.       Last year, 259,000 civil cases and 75,000 criminal cases      were filed in the federal courts, enough to tax the abilities      of the judiciary even when it is fully staffed. But today      there are 103 judicial vacancies--nearly one in eight seats      on the bench. Men and women who need their day in court must      stand in longer and longer lines.       The problem is about to get worse. Because of projected      retirements and other demographic changes, the number of      annual new vacancies in the next decade will be 33 percent      greater than in the past three decades. If the historic pace      of Senate confirmations continues, one third of the federal      judiciary will be vacant by 2020. If we stay on the pace that      the Senate has set in the past two years--the slowest pace of      confirmations in history--fully half the federal judiciary      will be vacant by 2020.       As Justice Anthony Kennedy recently noted, the ``rule of      law is imperiled'' if these important judicial vacancies      remain unfilled. In 2005, Senate Republican leader Mitch      McConnell called on Congress to return to the way the Senate      operated for over 200 years, and give nominees who have      majority support in the Senate an up-or-down floor vote.       I agree. It's time to address the crisis in our courts.      It's time to confirm these judges.                                  ____                    [From Slate.com, Sep. 27, 2010]  Vacant Stares--Why Don't Americans Worry About How an Understaffed               Federal Bench is Hazardous to Their Health?                  (By Dahlia Lithwick and Carl Tobias)       The prospect of a federal bench with nearly one out of      every eight judicial seats vacant should scare the pants off      every American. Yet few Americans are as worked up about it      as those of us who think and worry about it a lot. Our      argument was already a tough sell before the threat of global      terrorism and a collapsed economy ate up every moment of the      national political conversation. Now a 10 percent judicial      vacancy rate seems like a Code Beige emergency in a Code Red      world.       Part of the problem is politics: It has often seemed that      the only people screaming for speedy judicial confirmations      are panicked because it's their judges being blocked. The      party not currently in control of the White House and Senate      often sees less crisis than opportunity in a dwindling bench.      Moreover, when the entire judicial selection process has been      as fiercely politicized as it is has become lately, most      Americans may suspect that empty benches might be better for      democracy than full ones. But judicial vacancies are      disastrous for Americans, all Americans, and not merely for      partisan reasons, but also for practical ones. That's why in      a recent speech, Justice Anthony Kennedy warned: ``[I]t's      important for the public to understand that the excellence of      the federal judiciary is at risk. If judicial excellence is      cast upon a sea of congressional indifference, the rule of      law is imperiled.''       Yet this issue, which seems to light up editorial writers      and Brookings scholars with such ease, appears to leave the      rest of you cold. So here we are taking one last crack at      scaring your pants off with some strictly nonpartisan facts      about the dangers of judicial vacancies.       Justice delayed truly is justice denied. There are      approximately 850 lower-court federal judgeships, of which      more than 100 are currently vacant, while 49 openings in 22      states are classified ``judicial emergencies.'' Eighty-three      of these are on the district courts--the trial courts that      decide every important federal question in the country, on      issues ranging from civil rights to environmental, economic,      privacy, and basic freedoms. Whereas judicial obstruction      once reached no further than the federal appeals courts, for      the first time even noncontroversial district court nominees      are being stalled by arcane Senate reindeer games. It stands      to reason that if you can't get into a courtroom, if the      docket is too packed for your case to be heard promptly, or      if the judge lacks sufficient time to address the issues      raised, justice suffers. This will directly affect thousands      of ordinary Americans--plaintiffs and defendants--whose      liberty, safety, or job may be at stake and for whom justice      may arrive too late, if at all. In some jurisdictions, civil      litigants may well wait two to three years before going to      trial. In jurisdictions with the most vacancies, it will      often take far longer for published opinions to be issued, or      courts will come to rely on more unpublished opinions. More      worrisome still, because the Speedy Trial Act requires that      courts give precedence to criminal cases, some backlogged      courts have had to stop hearing civil cases altogether.       Overtaxed federal judges can't do justice at some point.      Take, for instance, the federal court based in Denver, where      five active judges are doing the work that ought to be done      by seven. The Judicial Conference of the United States      suggests the court needs another judgeship and has labeled      the two vacancies a ``judicial emergency'' because the judges      there each carry 593 instead of the 430 cases deemed optimal.      Alliance for Justice today put out a new report on the      jurisdictions designated as judicial emergencies. Among their      findings: Judicial emergencies have more than doubled over      the first 20 months of the Obama administration, and judicial      emergencies now exist in 30 states. In many jurisdictions,      judges who should have retired years ago are still actively      hearing cases on courts that can't afford to lose even one      more judge. This places unfair, undue pressure on every      federal judge now sitting. Most judges have been stoic in the      face of mounting work and caseloads. Few openly complain,      lest they appear to be taking sides in the confirmation wars.      Still the crisis is so urgent that some judges have begun to      speak out: In May, Chief Judge Wiley Daniel of the U.S.      District Court in Denver wrote to the majority and minority      leaders in the Senate urging prompt confirmation and      explaining that lingering vacancies impede public access to      justice. Six highly regarded retired federal judges at the      same time wrote to the senators that the current gridlock is      not tenable for a nation ``that believes in the rule of      law.'' In 1997 and again in 2001, Chief Justice William      Rehnquist admonished the White House and Senate, then in      control of opposite parties, to fill the many vacancies for      the good of the nation. Imagine how you would feel if your      heart surgeon had to perform thousands of surgeries each day.      That's how worried you should be about federal judges forced      to manage ever-expanding caseloads.       Potential judges won't agree to be nominated. Depending on      who's doing the calculations, the average length of time      between being nominated and confirmed has more than      quadrupled in the Obama administration. As a result of      procedural shenanigans in the Senate, nominees may remain in      limbo for months, with careers and law practices stuck on      hold as they await a vote that may never come. Indeed, 6th      Circuit Judge Jane Stranch waited 13 months for a 71-21 vote,      while Judge Albert Diaz, a 4th Circuit nominee, has waited      nearly 11. As the wait for confirmation drags on ever longer,      the best nominees will be inclined to start to wonder whether      it's worth the bother. Many excellent potential nominees may      not even entertain the prospect of judicial service anymore.      As President Stephen Zack, president of the American Bar      Association, recently put it: ``The current gridlock      discourages anyone from subjecting themselves to the judicial      nomination process.''       The more seats remain vacant, the greater the incentive to      politicize the process. In the George W. Bush administration,      the judicial-vacancy rate dropped to 4 percent. Now it's up      to 10 percent again. The stakes become higher and higher as      the opportunity to significantly reshape the federal bench      becomes more real. The incentive for a Senate minority to      obstruct nominees also grows with the vacancy rate. The party      not in control of the White House invariably believes it will      recapture the presidency in the next election and thus has      the opportunity to appoint judges more to its liking.      Accordingly, each nominee obstructed now is another vacancy      reserved for the out-of-power party's president. These      dynamics are evident with the midterm elections approaching:      The process has now essentially shut down. That's why only      one appellate nominee even received floor consideration      between April 23 and Sept. 12 of this year.       The rampant politicization of the selection process is      undermining public respect for the co-equal branches of      government. President George W. Bush's use of the White House      for a ceremony introducing his first 11 appellate nominees      and his promotion of his judicial nominees exacerbated the      sense that federal judgeships were a political prize for the      winning party. Obama has attempted to depoliticize the      confirmation process by naming judges generally regarded as      centrist and moderate--much to the dismay of many liberals.      But it has changed nothing. When the Senate confirmation      process degenerates into cartoonish charges of judicial      unfitness, name-calling, recriminations, and endless      paybacks, the consequences go far beyond the legitimacy of      Congress, to the legitimacy of the courts themselves. As      courts are batted around for partisan political purposes,      nominees and judges appear to be purely political actors--no      different than members of Congress or the president. That      doesn't just hurt judges. It hurts those of us who rely on      judges to deliver just outcomes.       Americans watching the confirmation wars won't ultimately      recall which president named which judge or what the final      vote was. But they may begin to accept as normal an      inaccurate and deeply politicized vision of judges as a bunch      of alternating partisan hacks and a federal bench that is      limping, rather than racing, to do justice.                          ____________________
