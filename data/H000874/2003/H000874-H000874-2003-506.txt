 Mr. DeLAY. The House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. We will consider several measures under suspension of the rules. A final list of those bills will be sent to the Members' offices early next week. There will be no votes in the House before 6:30 on Tuesday.  On Wednesday, we expect to consider several health-related measures: the Automatic Defibrillation in Adam's Memory Act, the Organ Donation Improvement Act, the Mosquito Abatement for Safety and Health Act, the Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities Prevention Act. We will also consider a bill addressing medical errors. We expect several of those measures to be considered under suspension of the rules.  On Thursday, we expect to consider H.R. 5, the HEALTH Act, to improve patients' access to health care and reduce health care costs by reforming our medical liability system, and that is the schedule for next week.  I thank the gentleman for yielding and happy to answer any questions.
