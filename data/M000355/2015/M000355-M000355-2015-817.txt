 President, I rise to recognize and congratulate a distinguished Kentuckian who is closely associated with the Commonwealth's most famous product. Jim Rutledge, the master distiller of Four Roses Bourbon, has announced his retirement from that position effective September 1, 2015.  Jim is in his 49th year working in the bourbon business, and has been the master distiller at Four Roses since 1995. As master distiller, Jim is in charge of perfecting each Four Roses bottle. He oversees every stage of the distillation process and oversees the character, quality and consistency of each barrel.  Jim began his career in the distilled spirits industry with Seagram's Louisville Research & Development operation in 1966. He was transferred to the Four Roses distillery in Lawrenceburg, as the Kentucky area manager, in 1994 and then named master distiller in 1995. In 1998, Jim received Seagram's top award, the Mel Griffin Quality Award for North America, and in 2001, Jim was indicted into the inaugural class of the Kentucky Bourbon Hall of Fame.  In 2007, Jim received the Lifetime Achievement Award from Malt Advocate Magazine, and in 2008, the leading liquor industry publication, Whisky Magazine, named him the Ambassador of the Year for American Whiskies as part of their annual Icons of Whisky Awards. Jim was also inducted into Whisky Magazine's Hall of Fame in2013. He was only the second American inducted into this elite group.  Jim was also active with the Kentucky Distillers Association board of directors for 13 years, and served as chairman of the internationally attended Kentucky Bourbon Festival for 7 of the 9 years he was on the board. The Kentucky Bourbon Festival is a 6-day event that takes place in Bardstown, KY.  Jim graduated from the University of Louisville with a BSC in marketing and a minor in chemistry. Let me add that not only did Jim and I both attend the University of Louisville, we are also fraternity brothers.  In retirement, Jim hopes to stay involved with bourbon and the distilled spirits industry. I suspect he will also get to spend more time with his wife Beverly Anne, as well as his children Dennis, Deborah, Cynthia, and Doralee, and his grandchildren.  Jim will be missed as the face of Four Roses Bourbon but I know the entire distilled spirits industry in Kentucky joins me in recognizing his lifetime of accomplishment and wishing him the best in retirement. I want to wish congratulations again to Jim Rutledge for his many successes in the world of bourbon.                          ____________________
