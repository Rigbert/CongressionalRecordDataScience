Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader the schedule for tomorrow, and I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy).  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House will vote on H.R. 1644, our North Korean sanctions bill. I do believe it is important that the House speak with one voice against the recent actions of the Kim regime.  Next, as I said in our colloquy on Friday, additional legislative items are possible. As soon as any items are added to our schedule, I will be sure to notify Members. However, Members should be prepared to be here and voting tomorrow.
