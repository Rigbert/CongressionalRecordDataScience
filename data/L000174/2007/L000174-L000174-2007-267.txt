President, I would hope people would vote against this amendment. It would completely prohibit the World Bank from supporting programs to combat malaria.  We have $1 billion in this bill for the U.S. contribution to the World Bank--money the United States has pledged and President Bush has requested.  Malaria kills a million children a year and infects half a billion people, 95 percent of whom are in Africa. We should do everything we can to combat malaria.  I agree with the administration on this request. I agree with President Bush, who has stated throughout the world his support for these antimalaria matters. I would hope that all people, all Senators of good will and good conscience, would vote no on this amendment.
