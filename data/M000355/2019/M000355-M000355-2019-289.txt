 President, now, on another matter, while we wait on the House, the Senate will take the opportunity to consider three more of President Trump's well-qualified nominees to the Federal bench and the diplomatic corps.  Later today, we will vote to advance the nomination of Justice RobertLuck, of Florida--the President's impressive nominee--to be a U.S. circuit judge for the 11th Circuit. Then we will consider Justice Barbara Lagoa, who has also been nominated to the 11th Circuit. Both are impressive nominees who have sterling qualifications--two more fine choices by President Trump. Finally, the Senate will turn its attention to the diplomatic corps and confirm Adrian Zuckerman, of New Jersey, to serve as the Ambassador to Romania.  I hope each of my colleagues will join me in supporting all three confirmations as the Senate continues to give the American people the government for which they voted.                          ____________________
