Mr. Speaker, we have not done our work. The Republican controlled Congress has not finished its work.  Where is the Patients' Bill of Rights? Where is a prescription drug benefit? Where is the minimum wage legislation? Where are the 100,000 new teachers? Where is the new school construction? Where is the juvenile justice bill?  The majority party has not done its work. We have not been fair to the American people. They deserve better. They should get better. They need our help, and Congress has done nothing.  We are nearing the end of another ``do nothing'' Congress that has not done anything, not anything, not one thing for the American people. We should be ashamed to leave this place, be ashamed to close this Congress and not to be finished with the American people's agenda.                announcement by the speaker pro tempore
