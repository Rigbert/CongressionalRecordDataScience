There is no excuse for that. But the President wants his way, and he has taken 800,000 people hostage, and the ransom he demands is his wall.                              {time}  1245  Nancy Pelosi has nothing to do with shutting down this government. We have passed bill after bill over the last 2 weeks to open up this government.  If the minority whip thinks it is good for border security not to pay people who are protecting the border, he and I differ.  Let me tell you what Mick Mulvaney said. Now, he wasn't there last night, and I talked to Senator Graham last night. He made the statement that I just reflected to you.  Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said, in 2015--I understand it is not when he is working for the President, who is paying his salary--``To just say build the darn fence and have that be the end of an immigration discussion is absurd and almost childish for someone running for President to take that simplistic of a view.''  He said that on WRHI on 8/25/15. Look it up.  The government is shut down. If the minority whip will look at the record, we funded more money for border security in 2009 than was funded in the next 7 years under Republican control.  They didn't bring their bill, Mr. Speaker, to the floor until 11\1/2\ months had passed. But now border security has to be done right this second or we are going to close down government, keep it shut, and keep hostage 800,000 people and millions and millions and millions of Americans who rely on the services of government.  A, we are for border security. We do not want people coming into this country who are not authorized to come into this country.  B, we care about crime. We care about drugs. We care about investing money to stop drugs coming into the country and to treat those who are afflicted with drugs.  The record reflects that, Mr. Speaker. But the record also reflects that the Republicans have, over and over and over again, used the shutting down of government, the taking hostage of the people's government, to get their way.  Newt Gingrich did it first for a long period of time in 1995 and 1996, 21 days. We are going to surpass that this time. He did it because President Clinton said: I am not going to allow you to cut education spending for the people of United States as deeply as you want to cut it.  Then Senator Cruz came over here and talked to the so-called Freedom Caucus and said: Unless Obama agrees to repeal the Affordable Care Act, we are going to shut down government.  And they shut down government. Very frankly, when we tried to open it up, the minority whip didn't vote to open it up. So maybe he doesn't care about opening up government, paying people who are working for the people of the United States. I don't know.  Then, just recently, a few weeks ago, when they came to the end of the fiscal year, they had not done their job. The Republicans are in charge of the Senate; they were in charge of the House; and they have the Presidency of the United States.  So we did a CR, and we voted for it because we didn't want to shut down government. Then we came to the December date to which that CR ran, and, lo and behold, the majority leader of the United States Senate sent us over a bill. It was not our bill; it was a bill from the Republican majority leader. It came here under unanimous consent. Their Republican-led Senate sent it here, and, lo and behold, the leadership in the House would not take up that bill.  Why? The President, who had told Senator McConnell he would sign it, changed his mind. Whether it was Ann Coulter, Sean Hannity, Rush Limbaugh, I don't know who the principal adviser in that decision was, but one person communicated: I won't sign that bill.  So the Republican leadership decided: We won't put that bill on the floor.  They put a bill on the floor--they said over and over and over again: This week, we put bills on the floor that wouldn't pass the Senate.  They put a bill that they knew would not pass the United States Senate on the floor, sent it over there. It didn't pass, and government has been shut down.  The gentleman continues to want to talk about, can we negotiate? We can negotiate. The President walked out. He walked out because Nancy Pelosi, when asked, ``Thirty days from now, will you support the wall?'' said, ``No.''  The President had a tantrum, and he walked out. He said: Well, this is a waste of my time.  This is not a process where the President tells us to do things. As I recall, Mr. Speaker, the Constitution of the United States, Article I, says we are the policymakers; we are the ones who pass the laws; we are the ones who say what the executive department carries out as policy.  So we ought to pass these bills. Then, yes, we ought to deal, honestly and openly and together, to make sure the borders are secure.  The gentleman said the immigration system does not work; it is broken. He is absolutely right. The Senate, 5 or 6 years ago, passed a bill, in a bipartisan way, with over 62 votes, 14 Republicans, and sent it to the House under Republican leadership 6 years ago. They have never brought that bill to the floor. We have pleaded with them to bring that bill to the floor to fix the immigration system. It has never come, Mr. Speaker, to the floor of this House.  But what we should never do, we should never take hostage the government of the United States, the employees who toil every day on behalf of the policies that we adopt and on behalf of the American people. We should never take them hostage and say: If you don't do what I say to do, we are going to keep them in an unpaid status, working if they are critical employees and locked out if they are not.  Mr. Speaker, it is very, very unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position. I would urge that the Republicanwhip, who is my friend and whom I respect, talk to the President of the United States and say: Let's open up the government. Mr. Hoyer has told me we will sit down and have a rational, reasonable fact-based, expert-based discussion on how, in fact, we accomplish the objective we all say we want to accomplish, and that is to make our borders secure.  We are prepared to do that, open this government.
