Burton, in representing every member of the Indiana delegation, to inform the House of the passing of our good friend and colleague, Julia Carson from Indianapolis.  I would simply point out, under the auspices of Mr. Burton and the Congressional Black Caucus and myself, to truly honor Julia's life and her good work, we will have a Special Order for 1 hour tomorrow. I note this happens to be the darkest time of year as far as the winter solstice upon us, but it causes one to think about the light that Julia Carson has cast throughout her life. Whether it was the twinkle of her eye, that I think we are all very familiar with, or the fire that burned brightly in Julia, compelling her every hour of every day to help those most in need, and the light of her shining example which should lead all of us to lead better lives and to do our best, her constituents, her State, this House, and this country have suffered a very great loss of a very good friend who has enlightened all of us and who has enriched ours and everyone's life she has touched. And again I very deeply appreciate the courtesy of Mr. Burton for asking for this period of time.
