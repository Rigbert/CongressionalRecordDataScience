President, late last night, about 11:30 p.m., I received an e-mail on my BlackBerry from my fellow Senator from Illinois, Senator Obama. He said he needed to talk to me. I called him this morning, reached him at about 8 a.m. this morning, and we had a conversation. He said: I am going to call Senator McCain and I am going to suggest to him that we both come out with a joint statement saying that Congress should respond as quickly as possible to deal with the economic challenges facing the United States and that we should find a solution which includes four basic principles: makes certain there is transparency there so we know there are conflicts of interest, that they will be dealt with;  Make certain you protect the taxpayers, give a helping hand to the homeowners facing foreclosure, and do something about the issue of executive compensation.  He said: I have said these publicly. Senator McCain has said these publicly. I think it would be a healthy thing for the American political scene and the economy for us to depoliticize this situation, to take the partisan politics out of it, and to issue this joint statement. He asked me for my reaction, and I said I thought it was a good idea.  At 9 o'clock this morning, Senator Obama made that call to Senator McCain, and Senator McCain returned the call at 12:30, a few hours later. I think they have issued that statement, and it is a positive one. It puts in perspective the seriousness of the challenge we face and establishes core principles we should follow to try to resolve it.  Other things have happened since. There has been a suggestion by Senator McCain that he is going to suspend his Presidential campaign and come back to Washington. He can make that decision if he chooses to, but I think the honest answer is, he will be bringing the Presidential campaign with him to Washington. I am not sure that is going to help create a positive bipartisan or nonpartisan atmosphere to solve the problem.  I think we understand what faces us here, the challenges we face. I think we also understand that it is best for us to meet in serious--maybe even behind doors--closed-door meetings, and come up with a plan that is bipartisan, that the administration agrees with and a majority in Congress will agree with on a bipartisan basis. I think we should go forward.  During the course of the last statement by several of my Republican colleagues, two of them came over to say to me: This really isn't political; we really think we need to work to find a solution. I couldn't agree more. We need to work to find a solution, and a good one.  Let's remember where we are. It hasn't been 72 hours since we have seen the administration's proposal giving the Secretary of the Treasury $700 billion--more money than ever allocated in the history of our Republic--with virtually no strings attached. There are many of us who think we need to be more careful--we need to be decisive, but we need to be thoughtful as well. I heard Senator Dodd, as chairman of the Banking Committee, say: Speed is important, but getting it right is more important. And I think he is correct. We need to stick with this, roll our sleeves up, and try to find an answer.  I will tell you, we do it in a very highly charged political atmosphere. I have spoken to my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, whose e-mail and phone responses to the bailout proposal Secretary Paulson has brought forward are overwhelmingly negative. It is a charged political atmosphere. Bringing a Presidential campaign into this atmosphere is not going to make it easier or more likely that it will come to a good ending.  I think we need to do this in a thoughtful, quiet, and sensible way. I think the joint statement by Senator Obama and Senator McCain set the right tone, depoliticizing it at the Presidential level, and now we need to roll up our sleeves and go to work. Bringing all of the lights and cameras to Capitol Hill, bringing the Presidential campaign here is certainly not going to be the answer.  I also remember that we have one of the most important events before us this Friday night: the first Presidential campaign debate. I think these debates will be widely followed by Americans across the board, who will measure the major candidates and make their decisions. The American people are entitled to that, and we need to move forward to make certain those debates take place so that at the Presidential and Vice Presidential level voters can take their measure of the candidates.  But now we need to roll up our sleeves here as Members of Congress and the Senate and work to find this bipartisan answer. I hope we can do that, and I hope we follow the four principles which Senator McCain and Senator Obama announced today.                          ____________________
