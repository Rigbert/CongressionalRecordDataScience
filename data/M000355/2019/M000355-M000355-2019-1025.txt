 President, the Democratic leader and I just want to take a few minutes here to point out to everyone that our colleague, the senior Senator from Vermont, just cast a truly historic vote. Of course, these tax treaties are significant, but I am talking about the fact that Senator Leahy just cast his 16,000th vote of his Senate career. We know of no single statistic that could begin to capture such a tenure, but this figure comes close--16,000 votes cast for his constituents. With numbers like that, Senator Leahy has already left towering figures like our late colleagues Ted Stevens and Ted Kennedy in the dust. Now he is gaining on legends like Danny Inouye.  I think it is safe to say that all of Senator Leahy's colleagues on both sides of the aisle are reminded every day why the good people of Vermont made him the youngest U.S. Senator ever from Vermont back in 1974 and why they have rehired him over and over. He must be a hard act to follow, too, because, believe this or not, he is still technically--technically--the only Democrat Vermont has ever sent to the Senate.  I know we all admire the Senator's passion and perseverance. I remember him fondly from our time together as chair and ranking member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on State and Foreign Operations. Foreign Ops was one of my favorite committee assignments, and I am proud of the investments Senator Leahy and I helped make in support of democracy, good governance, and human rights around the world.  I think I speak for all of us when I offer congratulations to our good friend from Vermont on his historic milestone.  (Applause.)
