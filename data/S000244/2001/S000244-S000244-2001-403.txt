Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 802, the Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor Act of 2001, was introduced by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, together with the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking minority member of the Subcommittee on Crime.  This bill establishes a National Medal of Valor to be awarded each year by the President in the name of Congress to public safety officers who have displayed the highest degree of valor in the performance of their duties.  The bill is substantially similar to H.R. 802, introduced in the 106th and 105th Congresses. In the 106th Congress, the Committee on the Judiciary reported H.R. 46 by voice vote, and the bill passed the House by a recorded vote of 412 to 2. In the 105th Congress, the committee reported H.R. 4090 by voice vote, and the House passed the bill by voice vote as well. Unfortunately, neither bill became law. H.R. 802 presently before us was ordered favorably reported by voice vote out of the Committee on the Judiciary on March 8.  Mr. Speaker, many countries award a national medal to public safety officers for heroism in the line of duty. Unfortunately, the United States does not. This bill would rectify that shortcoming. I believe it fitting and proper that our Nation honor those public safety officers who demonstrate the highest forms of heroism and valor in the course of their duties. I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
