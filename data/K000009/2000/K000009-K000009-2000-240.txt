Speaker, it is a great honor for me to be able to enter these precious remembrances of our dear friend and able attorney, Congressman Sidney Yates, into the Congressional Record. His illustrated career spanned half a century, 24 terms as a Member of the people's House. And what a stellar human being, citizen, and Member he was! I had the distinct pleasure of serving with him on the Appropriations Committee and in that capacity deepened my respect for him each passing year.  When I think of this true gentleman from Illinois, I remember his engaging smile, his brillant intellect, his love of the arts and of the environment, his puckish humor, and his devotion to human and civil rights. His knowledge of the Rules of the House knew no equal. And he applied his legislative skills with a mastery that elevated us all. Yes, Sid Yates, Master of the House.  How many times I recall Sid standing up for recognition in the Committee to carry his arguments. Eloquent. I admired his ability highly. So erudite was he, holding the attention of all listeners. Were it not for the fact that he left the House briefly to run for the U.S. Senate, I have no doubt he would have attained the Chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee. He certainly possessed all the ability and respect required of it.  Just before Sid left Congress, I asked him what he considered his major accomplishments as a tenured Member of this body. I thought he would answer that his legacy included major expansion of our national park system, or our institutions of art and culture, or improvements to his home district on Chicago's northwest side. Or, I imagined he would mention the major donations of art he had given to museums across our nation. For indeed his accomplishments included all of these. Yet he mentioned none of this. First, he said he considered his efforts to achieve the integration of the Capitol Police Force in the late 1940's to be a stellar achievement. Then, he said helping establish the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum would remain in his memory always.  One cold winter evening, when the National Gallery of Art had a modernist exhibition, I was strolling through the galleries and came upon Sid with his beloved wife, Addie. As always, he greeted me warmly and called me ``dearie'', too, as I imagine he did with all the women Members. He was always encouraging, cajoling, lifting us all. I think he took special satisfaction in helping the minority of women in this institution rise to full acceptance.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the family of this magnificent man who loved his nation and dedicated his entire life to the business of democratic governance. What a joy to have known him and learned from him! What a legacy he has left for America.                          ____________________
