Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and congratulate the students, faculty, and alumni of Holy Cross School in Trenton, New Jersey on the school's 100th anniversary.  In 1901, the Reverend Francis Czernecki and the Felician Sisters founded the school to educate students in a family-oriented atmosphere while instilling the rich tradition of Catholicism into the cultural and intellectual life of every pupil. Today, 100 years later, Holy Cross School is leading 280 students into this millennium with a Catholic value-centered education, and supported by a strong community of faith.  The current generation of lay teachers follow in the footsteps of Felician Sisters who came to Trenton in 1901. The religious teaching community, known as the Sisters of Saint Felix of Cantalice, was founded in Warsaw, Poland in 1855. Many Sisters from the community taught at Holy Cross up until 12 years ago, when the remaining Felician Sisters retired. Nevertheless, the values, dedication, and vision that these Felician Sisters started so many years ago continues to flourish at Holy Cross School today.  Mr. Speaker, in the South Ward of Trenton, New Jersey, many people count three priorities in their community: family, friends, and the Holy Cross School. I would like to thank the school and the surrounding community for their hard work and dedication to providing an outstanding educational institution filled with tradition and faith that serves the people of Trenton, New Jersey.                          ____________________
