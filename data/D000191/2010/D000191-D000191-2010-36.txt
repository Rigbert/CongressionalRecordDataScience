You know, the one thing I would reflect on, I was a little puzzled yesterday when I kept hearing him say, We are the market makers. We are the market makers.  After awhile I started thinking about book makers, market makers, is there a difference. What is the difference when they are not dealing in reality or productive investment, they are dealing in manipulated investments, products that are designed to fail. I mean,we have too-big-to-fail institutions that create products that are designed to fail, and they profit immensely by doing that. What's that about market making?
