Congresswoman Sewell is on the floor.  The March to Selma, of course, which was interdicted by members of the Alabama State Police at the direction of the Governor, was one of the advances, the gentleman knows, that led to the introduction, passage, and signing by President Johnson of the Voting Rights Act. We are privileged to serve with someone whose contribution to this country and to the realization of its promise of equality to all was so enhanced by the life and commitment and courage of John Lewis, our colleague. And I was glad that the gentleman participated with us on that. I also am very pleased to hear about the Web site. I think that's a very positive step. I want to thank the gentleman also for the information about next week.  Mr. Leader, I would first like to ask about the budget resolution that you referenced that will be coming next week. I wondered if there's any plan on the floor to replace the sequester, which all of us seem to think is irrational--at least I think it's irrational and most of the colleagues I talk to think that it is irrational in that it is a meat-ax approach, and we have offered a number of times to get to the same budget savings--but notwithstanding that, whether there was any thought of replacing the sequester with its cuts to high priority and low priority by the same percentage to replace that. Is there any plan to do that, as far as you know?
