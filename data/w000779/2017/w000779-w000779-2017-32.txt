President and colleagues, the Senate is looking at making $10 trillion of changes in tax policy on the fly. This is the biggest change in Federal income tax policy in more than three decades. This is legislation that will determine our country's economic future for a generation, and, at this time, the Senate does not have the language the Senate will be voting on. My colleagues have been saying that they are out looking for it.  I have a couple of questions I would like to ask the distinguished majority leader.  When will the Senate be able to actually see the full text of this legislation?  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would say to my friend from Oregon that there will be plenty of time for him to read it.
