Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Health Care Safety Net Improvement Act of 2001. This legislation reauthorizes the Consolidated Health Centers program, the National Health Service Corps, and several programs vital to access to care in rural America. It also provides statutory authority for and direction to the Health Resources and Services Administration's Office for the Advancement of Telehealth and provides for a study on overcoming the barriers that many migrant farm workers and their families experience in seeking health care services as they move from state to state. Taken together, these programs and activities will help to strengthen our nation's health care delivery system by improving access to care and quality of care in our rural and inner-city medically underserved communities.  Health centers are located in 3,000 rural and urban communities throughout the country and provide quality primary and preventive health services to over 10 million low-income and uninsured patients. With the number of uninsured in this nation growing by more than 100,000 per month, it is estimated that 53 million people will lack health insurance by 2007. Health centers have played and will continue to play a vital role in addressing this serious problem.  We are fortunate in my Southwest Michigan district to have two strong networks of community and migrant health centers providing care to over 40,000 people. These centers and the people they serve benefit greatly from the doctors and dentists who are participating in the National Health Service Corps Loan Repayment program.  As Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee's Telecommunications and the Internet Subcommittee and a senior member of its Health Subcommittee, I have been particularly interested in the role that rapidly emerging telehealth technologies can play in increasing access to care and quality of care in rural and inner-city America. I was pleased to work with my colleagues on the Committee to include provisions in the Health Care Safety Net Improvement Act formally authorizing the Office for the Advancement of Telehealth (OAT). The OAT is currently the focal point for the telehealth activities and programs across federal agencies. It was instrumental in the formation of the Joint Working Group on telemedicine, for which it provides both leadership and staffing.  One of the greatest barriers to recruiting physicians to our rural communities is the sense of isolation they may feel in their practices. Telehealth services can address that barrier by linking rural primary care physicians and their patients with specialists in major medical centers across the nation. Further, one of the looming threats to access to care and quality of care is the growing shortage of nurses, pharmacists, and clinical laboratory personnel. Telehealth services can address this problem by bringing education and training programs right into local communities.  I hope everyone will join me today in strongly supporting the Health Care Safety Net Improvement Act. This bipartisan, thoughtful and innovative legislation will improve access to care and quality of care for millions in urban and rural America.                          ____________________
