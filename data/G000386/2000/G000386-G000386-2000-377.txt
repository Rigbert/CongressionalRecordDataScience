 President, for the leader, I would like to give today's schedule.  Today the Senate will resume consideration of the bankruptcy reform bill. Senator Schumer will be recognized to debate his amendments regarding safe harbor and clinic violence. There are several other amendments remaining, and those amendments will be debated throughout this morning's session.  All votes, including final passage, will be stacked and are expected to begin at approximately 12 o'clock noon. After disposition of the bankruptcy bill, the Senate is expected to begin consideration of the nomination of Alan Greenspan to continue as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.  The leader thanks all Senators for their attention.  I yield the floor.                          ____________________
