President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be placed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 957       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Health Emergency      Response Act of 2009''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:       (1) Since 2000, the Secretary of Health and Human Services      has declared that a public health emergency existed      nationwide in response to the attacks of September 11th and      in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.       (2) In the event of a public health emergency, compliance      with recommendations to seek immediate care may be critical      to containing the spread of an infectious disease outbreak or      responding to a bioterror attack.       (3) Nearly 16 percent of Americans lack health insurance      coverage.       (4) Fears of out-of-pocket expenses may cause individuals      to delay seeking medical attention during a public health      emergency.       (5) A public health emergency may disrupt health care      assistance programs for individuals with chronic conditions,      exacerbating the costs and risks to their health.       (6) The uninsured could place great financial strain on      health care providers during a public health emergency.       (7) The Department of Health and Human Services Pandemic      Influenza Plan projects that a pandemic influenza outbreak      could result in 45,000,000 additional outpatient visits, with      865,000 to 9,900,000 individuals requiring hospitalization,      depending upon the severity of the pandemic.       (8) Hospitals in the United States could lose as much as      $3,900,000,000 in uncompensated care and cash flow losses in      the event of a severe pandemic.       (9) Under current statute, no dedicated mechanism exists to      reimburse providers for uncompensated care during a public      health emergency.       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--       (1) to provide temporary emergency health care coverage for      uninsured and certain otherwise qualified individuals in the      event of a public health emergency declared by the Secretary      of Health and Human Services;       (2) to ensure that health care providers remain fiscally      solvent and are not overburdened by the cost of uncompensated      care during a public health emergency;       (3) to eliminate a primary disincentive for uninsured and      certain otherwise qualified individuals to promptly seek      medical care during a public health emergency; and       (4) to minimize delays in the provision of emergency health      care coverage by clarifying eligibility requirements and the      scope of such coverage and identifying the funding mechanisms      for emergency health care services.     SEC. 3. EMERGENCY HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.       (a) In General.--Title III of the Public Health Service Act      (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section      319K the following new section:     ``SEC. 319K-1.

The Secretary shall include in such report      recommendations, if deemed appropriate, that Congress provide      a further extension of the public health emergency period      beyond the second 90-day period.       ``(B) Report contents.--A report under subparagraph (A)      shall include a discussion of the health care needs of      emergency victims and affected individuals including the      likely need for follow-up care over a 2-year period.       ``(5) Coordination.--The Secretary shall ensure that the      activation, implementation, and termination of emergency      health care services under this section in response to a      public health emergency is coordinated with all functions,      personnel, and assets of the Federal, State, local, and      tribal responses to the emergency.       ``(6) Medical monitoring program.--The Secretary shall      establish a medical monitoring program for monitoring and      reporting on health care needs of the affected population      over time. At least annually during the 5-year period      following the date of a public health emergency, the      Secretary shall report to Congress on any continuing health      care needs of the affected population related to the public      health emergency. Such reports shall include recommendations      on how to ensure that emergency victims and affected      individuals have access to needed health care services.       ``(b) Eligibility for Coverage of Emergency Health Care      Services.--       ``(1) Limited eligibility.--       ``(A) In general.--Eligibility for coverage of emergency      health care services under this section for a public health      emergency is limited to individuals who--       ``(i) are emergency victims who are uninsured or otherwise      qualified; or       ``(ii) are affected individuals who are uninsured.       ``(B) Definitions.--For purposes of this section with      respect to a public health emergency:       ``(i) Insured.--An individual is `insured' if the      individual has group or individual health insurance coverage      or publicly financed health insurance (as defined by the      Secretary).       ``(ii) Otherwise qualified.--An individual is ``otherwise      qualified'' if the individual is insured but the Secretary      determines that the individual's health care insurance      coverage is not at least actuarially-equivalent to benchmark      coverage.
