  Even though it ``freezes in'' funding to districts--including some in my state--that got funds last year, even though they do not qualify, it makes a mockery of the basic purpose of the Title I program, its eligibility rules and the requirement to use recent poverty data. If Congress continues to override these basic rules of the authorizing law, we are effectively operating with no rules, or at least, constantly changing rules. Districts will not know whether they are eligible or what they can or cannot count on. This is just plain wrong. In my state, even though 39 districts would have their funding ``frozen in'' by this provision, next year, California will have 166 new school districts that will become eligible. If these ``hold harmlesses'' keep appearing in the dark of night, these eligible districts, with concentrations of poor children, could be deprived of funds to which they are entitled.  Because this is a conference report, under our procedures, I am not allowed to offer an amendment to delete this provision.  But let me put my colleagues on notice that I find this provision and this procedure very objectionable.  I hope my colleagues will join me in ending this practice so that our children can get the education Congress intended in creating the Title I program in the first place.  I thank the Chair, and I thank the ranking member.
