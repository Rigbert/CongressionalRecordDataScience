 President, the tradition and success of collegiate athletics in California is as deep and rich as our academic excellence. Three different California universities have won the national championship in both men's and women's basketball in the past 53 years, and over a century of football competition has been played. Over the years our universities have been equally adept in producing winners of Olympic medals as Nobel prizes.  California is home to more division 1 schools than any other State. So it should come as no surprise California has sent a team to both the men's and women's college basketball Final Four. It also should not be a surprise that those two teams are the University of California, Los Angeles, and Stanford University, my alma mater.  These two teams are not unique among Golden State colleges, rather they are representative of numerous schools with great academic and athletic traditions. In this past year California has provided the national champions in men's tennis, men's water polo, women's volleyball, and men's golf. California's universities and colleges have produced such sports legends as Jackie Robinson, Bill Walsh, Matt Biondi, Jackie-Joyner Kersee, Marcus Allen, Cheryl Miller, Arthur Ashe, Bill Russell, Dwight Stones, Rafer Johnson, and Kathy Jordan.  The UCLA basketball program is one of the finest in the Nation, and is currently the No. 1 ranked team. It has won more national championships than any other school. More than Kentucky, Kansas, North Carolina, or Indiana.  Under the leadership of John Wooden, the UCLA men's basketball team won 10 national titles in 12 years. To follow in Wooden's footsteps has been difficult at UCLA. The last time they went to the Final Four was 1980, where they lost to Louisville, coached by Wooden protege Denny Crum.  Coach Jim Harrick has returned them to the Final Four now, for the first time in 15 years. But, maybe what is more impressive, at least to the Senator from California, is that it is a team of Californians. Four out of five starting players are from California, Tyus Edney from Long Beach, the sensational siblings Charles and Ed O'Bannon from Lakewood, and freshman Toby Bailey from Los Angeles. Other Californians on the team are J.R. Henderson, Bob Myers, Kris Johnson, and Kevin Dempsey. I am proud to say that not only is it a California school, it is a California team.  Rounding out the team are Cameron Dollar, George Zidek, Ike Nwanko, omm'A Givens. The players on this team are worthy successors of the greats of a generation ago Alcinder, Johnson, Walton, and Hazzard. In fact Marques Johnson's son, Kris, is a member of the current team.  Stanford women's basketball Coach Tara VanDerveer is creating a legend of her own. In the 10 years since she took over the Stanford program they have gone to the Final Four four times and won the national championship twice.  Rachel Hemmer and Anita Kaplan are the senior low-post players who lead the way with aggressive defense and consistent offense. Kristin Folkl, a two-sport star who was part of the national championship Stanford volleyball team this fall, got her first [[Page S4758]] start of the year this past Saturday, and she knocked down ``clutch'' three pointers for her team to advance to next weeks game against the No. 1 ranked women of the University of Connecticut. Kate Paye paces the team from the guard position, while Kate Starbird leads the team in scoring.  Also contributing to the team effort are Olympia Scott, Jamila Wideman, Vanessa Nygaard, Regan Freuen, Charmin Smith, Bobbie Kelsey, Tara Harrington, Naomi Mulitauaopele, and Heather Owen. Their 30-2 record this year is a mark of dedication and talent. The trip they make to Minnesota to be in the Final Four is a deserved reward.  I salute these two teams and all the student athletes from California, and wish them the best in both competition and scholarship.                          ____________________
