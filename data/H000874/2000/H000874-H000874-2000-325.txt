Speaker, today I recognize the unfortunate deaths of two Navy test pilots at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station on July 11, 2000. Lt. Cmdr. Gareth Rietz, 33, and Lt. Raymond O'Hare, 33, lost their lives while training to become test pilots at the prestigious U.S. Naval Test Pilot School. The students were flying on a familiarization flight aimed at refreshing their flying proficiencies following a short break. Both seniors, they were experienced aviators and were scheduled to graduate in December 2000.  Commander Bob Stoney, the Naval Test Pilot School's Commanding Officer, in an interview with the Washington Post following the incident, commented, ``What they would have wanted us to do is get back on our horses and ride.'' There are safety and legal investigations under way, but life is returning to normal as a new class is beginning its training.  Gareth Rietz, a native of Washington State, ``was the cheerleader for everybody, the coach, the quarterback,'' Stoney said. A graduate of Washington State University, he leaves his wife and daughters behind.  Raymond O'Hare, a native of Illinois, was, as Stoney said, ``a tremendously gifted man who seemed to have a calling to higher things. He was extremely smart, good at everything he did.'' A graduate of Harvard University, he is survived by his wife and three children. Before he died, he had been selected for the grade of Lieutenant Commander.  Their untimely deaths should prompt us all to take a moment to reflect on the sacrifices that they and thousands of others have made to keep this Nation safe and free. We should also take this time to re-evaluate the benefits for our troops and their families. It is easy for us to take the military for granted in this time of relative peace and prosperity. But the crash at Pax River should remind us that what our military does each and every day is still dangerous.  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues in the House to join me in expressing our sincere condolences to the families of these two proud Americans who have sacrificed their lives for their Country. We should all pause to reflect on the loss of these two distinguished individuals who were being trained as test pilots, an occupation that directly benefits the safety and performance abilities of aircraft weapons systems. I also would ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the men and women who are left behind at the Test Pilot School to carry on the proud mission of this small elite program which has produced so many American heroes, both the famous, including John Glenn, dozens of Space Shuttle astronauts, and the unsung heroes who quietly dedicate their careers to pushing the technology envelope for aviation systems.  Past and present members of the U.S. Armed Forces deserve to have our full and continued support and we should not wait for another tragedy like the one at Pax River, to remind ourselves that our troops are in danger on a daily basis, whether in harm's way or preparing to go into conflict. The men and women of our armed services are defending this nation so that we may go about our daily lives feeling safe and protected. I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the Congress to ensure that we provide them with the latest and best weapons systems available and that we continue to recognize their hard work and honor the sacrifices they make on a daily basis.                          ____________________
