Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information.  I might ask, and I know it will be the leader and the leader's office, but part of the leader's distinguished staff is on the floor, so he will hear us. I know my friend from California will be appreciative of this.  As I understand it, one of the planes to California is at 2:55, or late, just before 3. This says ``early afternoon.'' The request on our side has been that if we could try to conclude by 1:30 so they could get from here to Dulles in time to catch that plane, so, of course, they could get home by sunset, if we could try to do that?
