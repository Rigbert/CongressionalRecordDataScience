 President, if I might respond to that. Of course I want to cooperate, but I wish to use the 20 minutes of Democratic time. I would be prepared to extend the time for morning business if the Senators would agree to that.  Perhaps there could be a unanimous consent agreement that Senator Specter is allowed 10 minutes, and I would be allowed the 20 minutes of Democratic time, requiring an extension of 10 minutes of morning business.
