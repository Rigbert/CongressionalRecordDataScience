President, this amendment would prohibit funds for promotional and marketing materials that promote the affordable health care act and its benefits at taxpayer expense.  According to HHS's own documents obtained by the House Ways and Means Committee, which issued the subpoena last year, HHS spent almost $52 million in behalf of the affordable health care act public relations work using outside contractors. That is just not right. When the media is reporting more and more problems, more costs, more regulations, more lost jobs, higher premiums, this is a gratuitous use of taxpayer dollars. It sets a very bad precedent for the Department of Health and Human Services stretching the truth, at best, at public expense.  This administration should not be using American taxpayer dollars to fund marketing and promotional campaigns promoting a law and regulations that a majority of Americans oppose.
