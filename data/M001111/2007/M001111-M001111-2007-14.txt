 President, as I was saying, Secretary Paulson has been complaining about the need for mortgage counseling, and he said:       For this public outreach campaign to be successful, there      must be enough trained mortgage counselors to answer the      phone when homeowners call. The administration requested      funding for NeighborWorks America and other nonprofit      mortgage counseling operations in its budget. But the      appropriations bill has yet to be finalized; Congress needs      to get it done quickly.  That was not me, that was Secretary Paulson. We can do that right now. In fact, we could have done it last month. We are trying desperately to send this bill in its final stages that includes critical investment in housing counseling to the White House, just as Secretary Paulson said he wanted us to do.  The bipartisan conferees on this bill agree that the amount the President asked for was too low to meet the demand for housing counseling, given the size of the problem. Congress acted. We increased it substantially. But even though every Republican conferee on our bill signed onto that plan, we are now being blocked from sending it to the White House. I only wish the Senate Republican leadership would follow the words of Secretary Paulson and Secretary Jackson about the need for this urgent initiative.  Yesterday's Washington Post published an article on our $200 million housing counseling initiative. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Washington Post article.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 4, 2007]                   Nonprofit Groups Take Center Stage                            (By Renae Merle)       In the middle of his speech yesterday on the      administration's efforts to fix the mortgage crisis, Treasury      Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. paused to carefully spell out      a toll-free telephone number that troubled homeowners can      call for help.       The hotline is not staffed by government officials or      mortgage lenders. Rather, the calls are answered by consumer      counselors from nonprofit groups, which are taking an      increasingly high-profile role in helping borrowers with      mortgage problems.       The groups are acting in some cases as a buffer between      lenders and homeowners. Legislation is pending before      Congress that would tap NeighborWorks America, a national      nonprofit group, to distribute $200 million to local      counseling centers. In October, the Neighborhood Assistance      Corporation of America, often a vocal critic of mortgage      lenders, signed a deal with Countrywide Financial, the      nation's biggest mortgage lender, to help restructure loans      for struggling Countrywide clients.       However the administration addresses the mortgage crisis,      ``they are going to need the nonprofit community,'' said      Kenneth D. Wade, chief executive of NeighborWorks.       His group is training new housing counselors and plans to      double its counseling staff by next month. ``We think every      consumer needs a mortgage adviser,'' he said.       Nonprofit organizations around the country are already      seeing a soaring demand for their services. St. Ambrose      Housing Aid Center in Baltimore, which usually sees about 700      families a year, says it has met with almost 2,000 so far      this year.       At the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, where      about half the counselors at its member agencies focus on      housing issues, President Susan Keating says: ``We are very,      very busy.''       Government and mortgage industry officials don't often      agree on what caused the mortgage crisis, what its impact      will be, or how to cure it, but they all say that reaching      homeowners before they go into foreclosure is difficult.       If a homeowner with an adjustable-rate mortgage that is      about to reset, or one who is behind in payments receives      mail from his lender offering help, the homeowner responds 3      to 5 percent of the time, according to Hope Now, a new      alliance of mortgage industry and nonprofit organizations. If      the offer comes from a community group, the response rate is      about 25 percent. About 50 percent of homeowners who go into      foreclosure do so without ever contacting their lender.       ``If we are to make a difference, that number has to be      reduced,'' Paulson said.       The best hope, many think, may be through the nonprofit      community. The toll-free number Paulson touted--888-995-     HOPE--has seen a spike in volume, to 3,000 calls a day from      300 a year ago.       There are 180 consumer counselors from six nonprofit groups      answering those calls. That will increase to 250 by the end      of the year, according to the Homeownership Preservation      Foundation, which manages the hotline.       With an estimated 2 million adjustable-rate mortgages      scheduled to reset in the next two years, even that likely      will not be enough. ``We are definitely not going to be      stopping at 250,'' said Tracy Morgan, a spokeswoman for the      foundation, which is largely financed by the mortgage      industry.       The counselors focus on diagnosing the homeowners'      problems, then direct them to a local community group for      help or guide them through a call with their lender. The      initial call usually lasts about 45 minutes as the counselor      puts together a detailed budget analysis and creates an      action plan for the homeowner, according to the foundation.      That could include getting a second job or reducing spending.      The foundation does not charge homeowners for the service.       In a separate program, the Neighborhood Assistance      Corporation of America acts as a go-between, working out      deals with lenders on behalf of borrowers. Under its deal      with Countrywide, the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of      America has restructured about 200 loans.       Like many nonprofit groups, it has seen demand for its      services climb in the past year and attributes most of the      increase to homeowners with adjustable-rate mortgages. To      keep up with demand, the organization is opening five offices      around the country and is hiring about 30 employees a month.       ``This is just the beginning. It is going to get far      worse,'' said Bruce Marks, the group's chief executive.
