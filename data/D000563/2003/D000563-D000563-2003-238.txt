It used to be you could separate on trade and health care, business on one side and labor on the other. If I took you into a room and did not tell you the origin of a group in a room and you listened to a business group on these issues of trade and health care, you would think you were in the labor group. If you went to a labor group, you would expect to hear some concerns about what trade policy in this country has done and what health care does.  I find over and over again that these people are despairing. They are despairing because they have been told by this administration, let the marketplace solve the problem. The marketplace has not solved the problem.                          ____________________
