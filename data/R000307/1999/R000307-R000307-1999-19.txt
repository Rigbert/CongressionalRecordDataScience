 I tell the distinguished Presiding Officer, nurses in Colorado must ask the questions of these patients about their feelings--it sounds like a Barbara Streisand song--such as if they have ever felt depressed, had trouble sleeping, or even if they have ever attempted suicide. The thought occurs to me that Members of this distinguished body from time to time feel depressed and have trouble sleeping. I hope that would not be the case with regard to suicide.  I am being too sarcastic.  Do we really think we need to ask a nurse to bother a physical therapy patient for this information so that he or she can send the answers over to some computer someplace in Baltimore that will then use this information to develop a prospective payment system, and we can't find out when it is going to be proposed? Who in Baltimore reads these? I asked that in regard to HCFA, in regard to all of their requirements back when it was Health, Education, and Welfare in regard to Kansas City. I wanted to go to Kansas City and say: Who reads this stuff? What do they do with it? Maybe the Senator and I could go to Baltimore and figure that out. Why on Earth would we ask a nurse to bother a physical therapy patient for this information so they can send the answers? It hasn't anything to do with physical therapy patients. Why is that?
