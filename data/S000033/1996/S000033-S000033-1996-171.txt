 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by Acacia Fanto, a high school student from Brattleboro, VT, who was speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       My name is Acacia Fanto, and my topic is property tax      funding of public school education.       Primary funding of public school education through property      tax is inherently unfair. There are huge differences in      property wealth from district to district. Based on this      funding system . . . unequal from one area to another. The      amount of money spent on education is a significant factor in      determining the quality of education. Money is necessary to      hire good teachers, buy the latest textbooks, get the latest      classroom equipment, and attract good administrators. Despite      this, cuts are prevalent everywhere. The biggest cuts are in      arts, extracurricular activities and technology.       If money is a significant factor of a good education, and      money is the biggest variable from one public school to      another, then education quality is not equal in this country.      The differences from one district to another are astonishing.      There are tremendous disparities based on where you live. The      property tax funding system is making it difficult for many      areas to meet even basic educational needs, at a time when      more and more money is needed for special programs. We need      these programs in schools to deal with the problems of today,      such as violence, teen pregnancy and broken families. All      these necessities take money away from academic programs.       Property tax funding of public school education is not only      unfair, but also a regressive funding system, one that often      turns homeowners against schools because they don't want, or      can't afford, to have their property taxes raised. The      property tax funding system is unfair, unequal and      ineffective, so alternatives need to be sought. The Robin      Hood plan shifts money from wealthy districts to poorer ones,      to try to equalize funding. This plan turns the ``haves''      against the ``have-nots,'' and injects race and class into      the equity funding fight. A statewide property tax, or income      tax, could turn the problem from a local funding issue to a      state one. These solutions would decrease inequalities within      a state, but not within the country.       An alternative to the property tax funding system which      would provide consistency, and would eliminate the      unfairness, inequalities, and the opposition between the      ``haves'' and     the ``have-nots,'' would be a federal progressive income tax      system. People would be taxed based on a percentage of their      income, then the money raised would be distributed fairly      among the districts by the federal government.       In the search for a fair alternative, the first step that      needs to be taken is to change America's attitude towards      education. Education needs to be valued by this society in      order to demonstrate its value to its youth. When money is      spent on education, its value shines through, and creates a      positive outcome in the future. We need to be able to put the      funding issue behind us, so that the issue can become how to      deliver best education possible. Instead of working to help      the people, government is working against us, at a time when      America is trying to create an educational system which      responds to the future needs of America's youth. The      government passed cuts in education, while at the same time      approving bigger budgets for construction of prisons.      Government needs to take a look at the long term effect of      what it cuts and what it supports. If would support our      youth, keep them in school and educate them, we may not have      such growing need for prisons.       Equal opportunity is the basis of this country's ideals,      but by looking at our schools, you wouldn't know it. This      unfair educational system is based on the unequal      distribution of money in our schools caused by the property      tax funding system. The U.S. has created a caste system of      public education that is increasingly separate and unequal.      We must work to make this a country of equal opportunity.                          ____________________
