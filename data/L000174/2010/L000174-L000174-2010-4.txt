President, today, the Senate is finally being allowed to consider a judicial nomination that has been stalled since August--the nomination of Judge Mary Murguia of Arizona to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. I would understand the resistance to considering the nomination if President Obama had selected someone opposed by her home state Senators. But both Republican home state Senators support this nomination. Unlike his predecessor, President Obama has worked with home state Senators, including Republican Senators. Despite all his efforts, this consensus nominee has been stalled for months and months while awaiting final Senate action.  When the nomination was considered by the Judiciary Committee before the August recess, it was reported unanimously. Every Republican and every Democrat, all 19 members of the Judiciary Committee, voted in favor of her nomination. Still, she has been stalled for months and months. This is part of the dangerous pattern perpetrated the past two years as President Obama's highly-qualified judicial nominees have been stalled from final Senate action for extended periods. This is another example of the unnecessary delays that have led to a judicial vacancies crisis throughout the country. Judicial vacancies have skyrocketed to over 100 while nominations are forced to languish without final Senate action. In fact, President Obama's nominees have been forced to wait on average six times longer to be considered than President Bush's judicial nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee during the first 2 years of his Presidency.  When the Senate is finally allowed to take action, most of his nominations are confirmed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities or unanimously. Final Senate action on dozens of President Obama's judicial nominations has been delayed without explanation or good reason and then confirmed unanimously.
