Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from California, Ms. Maxine Waters, the chairperson of the Congressional Black Caucus, and my friend, the gentleman from Mississippi, Mr. Bennie Thompson, for bringing this budget before us.  The CBC budget, Mr. Chairman, is the right budget. It is the budget to prepare us as we enter the 21st century. It is the budget that will look out for the needs of all of our people, that segment of the population that has been left out and left behind.  This budget is a fair budget. It provides education for our children. It takes care of our seniors. It protects the environment. This budget says over and over again that all of our people have a right to know what is in the water we drink, what is in the food we eat, and what is in the air we breathe.  I urge all Members to vote to support the CBC budget because we have a mission, a mandate, and a moral obligation to help our people help themselves.
