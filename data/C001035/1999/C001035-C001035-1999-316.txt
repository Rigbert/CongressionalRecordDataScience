President, there is no question that cold-water marine aquaculture holds enormous exciting potential that remains untapped by the Federal Government. Despite its cryptic name, cold-water marine aquaculture is the lifeblood of a very tangible important industry. Each year millions of Atlantic salmon are raised in the cold quick-moving coastal water off the coast of Downeast Maine. The strong tides and rocky coast combined with many sheltering islands provide the perfect environment for a commercially viable finfish aquaculture industry. My discussions with the Agricultural Resources Service, experienced aquaculturalists, and researchers at the University of Maine have confirmed that the coast of Maine would, indeed, be an excellent location for Federal research into marine aquaculture.  I understand that language included in the Agricultural appropriations bill requires ARS to study all of its current aquacultural activities. Is it the chairman's understanding that the study referenced in this bill will focus on, among other things, the feasibility of marine cold-water research program?
