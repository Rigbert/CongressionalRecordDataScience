  Representative Jim Moran, Democrat of Virginia, one of the top members on the House Appropriations Committee, said this yesterday:       Our bill is done, and it should go to the president      immediately. . . . We're not holding it up. . . . I can't      speak for Harry Reid. I can't speak for him. As far as I'm      concerned, it should be done.  A government shutdown is 2 days away. We have an agreement based on what all the appropriators on the conference report are saying. We can pass that and do first things first--prevent a government shutdown. I agree with the majority leader, a government shutdown is a terrible idea. He has said that repeatedly. We have all said it repeatedly.
