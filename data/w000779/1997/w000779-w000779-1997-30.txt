I have had a chance to discuss this with the majority leader who has been gracious in offering me his time on this matter.  I ask only that the further discussion of this amendment take place at a time when the majority leader could be on the floor and he and I could discuss this briefly. I believe the proposals he has made with respect to holds are constructive. This proposal goes one step further, to have public disclosure of holds.  I ask only that the majority leader, at a time convenient with his schedule, be allowed to participate in that 20-minute discussion so he and I could briefly discuss that.  With that, I have no objection.
