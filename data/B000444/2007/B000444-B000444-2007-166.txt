 President, I introduce today with my colleagues Senators Specter, Brownback, and Leahy the Recidivism Reduction and Second Chance Act of 2007, which takes direct aim at reducing recidivism rates by improving the transition of offenders from prison back into the community. As this bill reflects, preventing recidivism is not only the right thing to do, it makes our communities safer and it saves us money.  Today, we have over two million individuals in our Federal and State prisons and millions more in local jails. Our Federal and State prisons will release nearly 650,000 of these offenders back into our communities this year. A staggering \2/3\ of released State prisoners will be rearrested for a felony or serious misdemeanor within 3 years of release.  It's not difficult to see why. These ex-offenders face a number of difficult challenges upon release. The unemployment rate among former inmates is as high as 60 percent; 15-27 percent of prisoners expect to go to homeless shelters upon release; and 57 percent of Federal and 70 percent of State inmates used drugs regularly before prison. This addiction and dependency often continues during incarceration.  Unless we address these problems, these individuals will commit hundreds of thousands of serious crimes after their release, and our communities will bear the human and economic cost. If we are going to reduce recidivism and crime, we simply have to make concerted, common-sense efforts now to help ex-offenders successfully reenter and reintegrate into their communities.  The Recidivism Reduction and Second Chance Act of 2007 confronts head-on the dire situation of prisoners reentering our communities with insufficient monitoring, little or no job skills, inadequate drug treatment, insufficient housing, lack of basic physical and mental health services, and deficient basic life skills. Through commonsense and cost effective measures, it offers a second chance for ex-offenders, and the children and families that depend on them, and it strengthens our communities and ensures safe neighborhoods.  The Second Chance Act provides a competitive grant program to study current approaches to reducing recidivism rates. It also provides grants for the development and implementation of comprehensive substance abuse treatment programs, academic and vocational education programs, housing and job counseling programs, and mentoring for offenders who are approaching release and who have been released. To ensure accountability, the bill requires grantees to establish performance goals and benchmarks and report the results to Congress.  The bill authorizes $192 million per year in competitive grant funding. This represents an investment in our future and an acknowledgement of the problem we face. We must remember that the average cost of incarcerating each prisoner exceeds $20,000 per year, with expenditures on corrections alone having increased from $9 billion in 1982 to $60 billion in 2002. That's more than a six-fold increase, and the costs keep going up.  A relatively modest investment in offender reentry efforts today is far more cost-effective than the alternative--building more prisons for these ex-offenders to return to if they can't reenter their communities and are convicted of further crimes. An ounce of prevention, as the saying goes, is worth a pound of cure.  I'm proud today to join with Senator Specter, Senator Brownback, and Senator Leahy in introducing the Recidivism Reduction and Second Chance Act and ask that our colleagues join with us in this vital effort. The safety of our neighbors, our children, and our communities depends on it.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1060       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

Congress finds the following:       (1) In 2002, over 7,000,000 people were incarcerated in      Federal or State prisons or in local jails. Nearly 650,000      people are released from Federal and State incarceration into      communities nationwide each year.       (2) There are over 3,200 jails throughout the United      States, the vast majority of which are operated by county      governments. Each year, these jails will release more than      10,000,000 people back into the community.       (3) Recent studies indicate that over \2/3\ of released      State prisoners are expected to be rearrested for a felony or      serious misdemeanor within 3 years after release.       (4) According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics,      expenditures on corrections alone increased from      $9,000,000,000 in 1982, to $59,600,000,000 in 2002. These      figures do not include the cost of arrest and prosecution,      nor do they take into account the cost to victims.       (5) The Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative      provided $139,000,000 in funding for State governments to      develop and implement education, job training, mental health      treatment, and substance abuse treatment for serious and      violent offenders. This Act seeks to build upon the      innovative and successful State reentry programs developed      under the Serious and Violent Offender Reentry Initiative,      which terminated after fiscal year 2005.       (6) Between 1991 and 1999, the number of children with a      parent in a Federal or State correctional facility increased      by more than 100 percent, from approximately 900,000 to      approximately 2,000,000. According to the Bureau of Prisons,      there is evidence to suggest that inmates who are connected      to their children and families are more likely to avoid      negative incidents and have reduced sentences.       (7) Released prisoners cite family support as the most      important factor in helping them stay out of prison. Research      suggests that families are an often underutilized resource in      the reentry process.       (8) Approximately 100,000 juveniles (ages 17 years and      under) leave juvenile correctional facilities, State prison,      or Federal prison each year. Juveniles released from secure      confinement still have their likely prime crime years ahead      of them. Juveniles released from secure confinement have a      recidivism rate ranging from 55 to 75 percent. The chances      that young people will successfully transition into society      improve with effective reentry and aftercare programs.       (9) Studies have shown that between 15 percent and 27      percent of prisoners expect to go to homeless shelters upon      release from prison.       (10) Fifty-seven percent of Federal and 70 percent of State      inmates used drugs regularly before going to prison, and the      Bureau of Justice Statistics report titled ``Trends in State      Parole, 1990-2000'' estimates the use of drugs or alcohol      around the time of the offense that resulted in the      incarceration of the inmate at as high as 84 percent.       (11) Family-based treatment programs have proven results      for serving the special populations of female offenders and      substance abusers with children. An evaluation by the      Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration of      family-based treatment for substance-abusing mothers and      children found that 6 months after such treatment, 60 percent      of the mothers remained alcohol and drug free, and drug-     related offenses declined from 28 percent to 7 percent.      Additionally, a 2003 evaluation of residential family-based      treatment programs revealed that 60 percent of mothers      remained clean and sober 6 months after treatment, criminal      arrests declined by 43 percent, and 88 percent of the      children treated in the program with their mothers remained      stabilized.       (12) A Bureau of Justice Statistics analysis indicated that      only 33 percent of Federal inmates and 36 percent of State      inmates had participated in residential in-patient treatment      programs for alcohol and drug abuse 12 months before their      release. Further, over \1/3\ of all jail inmates have some      physical or mental disability and 25 percent of jail inmates      have been treated at some time for a mental or emotional      problem.       (13) State Substance Abuse Agency Directors, also known as      Single State Authorities (in this paragraph referred to as      ``SSAs''), manage the publicly funded substance abuse      prevention and treatment system of the Nation. SSAs are      responsible for planning and implementing State-wide systems      of care that provide clinically appropriate substance abuse      services. Given the high rate of substance use disorders      among offenders reentering our communities, successful      reentry programs require close interaction and collaboration      with each SSA as the program is planned, implemented and      evaluated.       (14) According to the National Institute of Literacy, 70      percent of all prisoners function at the lowest literacy      levels.       (15) Less than 32 percent of State prison inmates have a      high school diploma or a higher level of education, compared      to 82 percent of the general population.       (16) Approximately 38 percent of inmates who completed 11      years or less of school were not working before entry into      prison.       (17) The percentage of State prisoners participating in      educational programs decreased by more than 8 percent between      1991 and 1997, despite growing evidence of how educational      programming while incarcerated reduces recidivism.       (18) The National Institute of Justice has found that 1      year after release, up to 60 percent of former inmates are      not employed.       (19) Transitional jobs programs have proven to help people      with criminal records to successfully return to the workplace      and to the community, and therefore can reduce recidivism.     SEC. 4. SUBMISSION OF REPORTS TO CONGRESS.       Not later than January 31 of each year, the Attorney      General shall submit each report received under this Act or      an amendment made by this Act during the preceding year to      the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and the      Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives.
