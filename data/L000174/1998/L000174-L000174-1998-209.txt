This is a Xerox copy, but I do have the actual signoff from DOD on the amendment, which I will give to the distinguished chairman.  Mr. President, I note this was primarily a clarification so the Department of Defense and Department of State could be saying the same thing in this area. I understand the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Hawaii may want to discuss it further between now and conference. I will be a conferee on that, and will be happy to do so.
