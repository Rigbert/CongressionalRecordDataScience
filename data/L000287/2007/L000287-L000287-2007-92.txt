Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I don't understand it, Mr. Speaker, how my colleague, my friend, my brother from Georgia can come here and state in an open way that this is the most oppressive Congress. We have only been in the majority for 4 months, 4 short months, not quite 4 months. You really don't believe that.
