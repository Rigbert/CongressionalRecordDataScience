Again, I stress that what our direction to the Finance Committee would say, when you report an economic growth package, fiscal relief up to at least $30 billion should be part of that package.  So our sense-of-the-Senate amendment does not increase the deficit. It does not increase the overall spending in this resolution. It does not increase the budget caps that are in this resolution. All it says is, when an economic growth package is reported by the Finance Committee, it should include the $30 billion in State fiscal relief.  So this proposal is budget neutral and it is deficit neutral. It does not have the impact that might cause some people otherwise to oppose it.
