 President.  Mr. President, we should be on the floor today debating a prescription drug benefit package, not a proposal to radically alter Medicare. This should be a fight about providing good, affordable, stable coverage, not about experimenting with Medicare.  I do want to thank my friend and colleague, Senator Baucus, for his efforts. I know he worked hard to do the best he could. Senator Baucus understands the importance of Medicare for seniors and the disabled, and I know he fought against incredible odds. He was sitting across the table from Members of Congress who tried before to privatize Medicare, and many who still hope to turn Social Security over to Wall Street. He faced an impossible task.  I know he did all he could, and I thank him for his fight.  Mr. President, I do want to note there are some things in this bill that I fought for that are important.  It does prevent additional cuts in payments to doctors who are scheduled to take effect early next year. The scheduled reduction of 4.5 percent, as we all know, is unacceptable. I worked hard to prevent that scheduled reduction of 4 percent in 2003, and I do applaud the conferees for meeting our demands on this issue.  The package also provides additional relief for rural hospitals, home health care agencies, and rural health care providers. This relief is truly a life linefor saving rural health care. I have always supported these provisions, and I will continue to fight for fair and equitable rural payments.  I can promise health care providers and patients in my home State that regardless of the outcome of this legislation, I remain committed to stabilizing Medicare payments.  Now, Mr. President, I know many organizations representing doctors and hospitals think we can come back in 2006 and correct the mechanisms in this bill that undermine Medicare. That is a pretty dangerous gamble. Not only that, but we don't know what the people who put this bill together will demand down the road in exchange for changes--premiums support or vouchers for States; larger gaps in coverage; more copayments; more restrictions on access; more deals on the House floor in the middle of the night?  We do not know what the pricetag will be to undo the damage that this bill will impose. I assure everyone, it will not be easy.  I had looked forward to the day when the Senate would pass a Medicare prescription drug benefit. That day is upon us, but I believe that the price of this benefit is far too high.  In the coming months and years we will see the theory behind this bill put to practice. As more and more people discover what this bill and this President have done to their health care, I am confident we will hear from seniors as we have never heard before.  This is a difficult decision. The $400 billion in this bill does represent a step forward. The provider payments contained in this bill are needed in my State, and seniors deserve the prescription drug coverage they have been asking for. Passage of this bill and being signed into law is not the end of the story. A tremendous amount of work will be required to fix the deficiencies in this bill. I will be there, as I have been all these years, working the best I can to do the right thing for the people I represent in my State and the people across this country.  I yield the floor.                               Exhibit 1                            Democratic Governors' Association,                                Washington, DC, November 21, 2003.     Members of the U.S. Senate,     U.S. Capitol,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator: As you know, the near 700-page Medicare      reform bill was unveiled yesterday. As a consequence, states      have not thoroughly reviewed the language or seen individual      cost estimates needed to make an accurate determination of      its benefits and/or costs. Late yesterday, the Congressional      Budget Office (CBO) released numbers portraying a net savings      to states of $17 billion over ten years. Notwithstanding this      projected rosy scenario, neither CBO, nor any other      independent entity has completed a state-by-state impact      analysis of this legislation. Even CBO is projecting that      states will be $900 million in the red in the first year of      the Medicare's program implementation in 2006. States need to      ensure that their reading of the legislation confirms that      the projected new state costs have not been underestimated by      CBO.       With this in mind, we urge you to reject any effort to vote      on this legislation before you know its full content and cost      impact on your state and the people we both serve. To this      end, CBO estimates on Medicare reform impact and expedited      state reviews of the direct and indirect cost/savings impact      from this legislation must be done and fully disseminated.      Any rush to judgment, without this information, may have both      short and long-term consequences that could prove to be      irrevocably severe.        Early in the deliberations of the Medicare reform      conference, governors were advised that at a minimum, the      conferees were committed to ensuring that states would face      no new costs as a consequence of the Medicare Prescription      Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. This      commitment was made for each and every state, for each and      every year, of the ten-year budget. For this reason, we are      writing to urge you to not vote on this legislation until it      is absolutely clear that this assurance has been upheld.        In recent days, there have been reports that the new      administrative and other indirect state costs of this      program--combined with the bill's exceedingly high ``claw-     back'' of state savings--would more than exceed any Medicare      savings for many states. Such an unacceptable outcome would      be in addition to another misguided policy, reportedly      seeking to mandate states and the territories to permanently      pay 75 percent of the current Federal prescription drug cost-     shift to states. In 2006, the first year of the bill's      enactment, states would have to pay 90 percent of these      costs.        Some have already suggested that this is a poorly crafted      bill and in the long run it would do more harm than good to      the very population it was intended to benefit. Although some      states are witnessing a small increase in revenues, most      states will continue to experience budget shortfalls for the      current fiscal year. Some analysts believe that the overall      shortfall will likely be $25 to $40 billion. With the      continued sluggish growth in state revenues, any increases in      state costs imposed by this legislation would be yet another      unfunded federal mandate, creating additional pressure on      states to cut essential programs and/or raise taxes.        Similarly, any permanent continuation of the Federal      government's prescription drug cost-shift to states runs      counter to existing National Governors Association (NGA)      policy that, ``if Congress decides to expand prescription      drug coverage to seniors, it should not shift that      responsibility or its costs to the states and territories''      and establishes a damaging precedent.           Sincerely,     Gov. Gary Locke,                                            Washington, DGA Chair.     Gov. Tom Vilsack,                                             Iowa, DGA Vice-Chair.     Gov. Bill Richardson,                                  New Mexico, DGA Federal Liaison.
