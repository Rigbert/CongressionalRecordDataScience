. Army Private First Class Joshua Stephen Modgling. Today I ask that the House of Representatives honor and remember this incredible young man who died in service to his country.  Joshua, born January 3, 1985 in Rapid City, South Dakota, was the son of Air Force parents. Joshua grew up all around the country, including my congressional district. His mother, Julie Montano, resides in Mira Lorna, California where Joshua attended high school. Joshua was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 30th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Brigade Combat Team of the 3rd Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia. His unit conducts missions out of Forward Operating Base Falcon to find improvised explosive devices. Joshua was driving an armored Buffalo mine sweeper on June 19, 2007, when he was killed by a bomb. On July 6, 2007, he was laid to rest next to his brother, Ryan, at Riverside National Cemetery.  In reading about Joshua's life, I was impressed by his devotion to family and love of sports. Joshua's father, Keith, describes a young man who developed an early interest in explosives; an interest that found a home as a combat engineer in the Army. He is survived by his parents; his sisters Kellilynn, Courtney and Michelle; brothers, Christopher and Kenneth; stepfather, Serefino; and grandmother, Virginia.  As we look at the incredibly rich military history of our country we realize that this history is comprised of men, just like Joshua, who bravely fought for the ideals of freedom and democracy. Each story is unique and humbling for those of us who, far from the dangers they have faced, live our lives in relative comfort and ease. The day the Modgling family had to lay Joshua to rest was probably the hardest moment the family has ever faced and my thoughts, prayers and deepest gratitude for their sacrifice goes out to them. There are no words that can relieve their pain and what words I offer only begin to convey my deep respect and highest appreciation.  Private First Class Modgling's mother, father, sisters, brothers and all his relatives have given a part of themselves in the loss of their loved one and I hope they know that their son, brother, and grandson, the goodness he brought to this world and the sacrifice he has made, will be remembered.                          ____________________
