 ENZI. Sure.  Mr. McCONNELL. It was my understanding that cloture was filed last night. Would my friend from Wyoming not agree, that cloture vote brings the bill to a conclusion? I am not in any way trying to delay the passage of the bill. I support the underlying bill. I believe my amendment is appropriate to be considered.
