Phyllis Reeder, longtime employee of the Lake County Soil and Water Conservation District (LCSWCD), and current LCSWCD Administrative Treasurer. After serving the community of Lake County, Indiana in this capacity for the past twenty-five years, Phyllis will be retiring at the end of this month. In honor of Phyllis, a retirement open house will be held by the LCSWCD on Friday, May 28, 2010 at the Lake County Soil and Water Conservation District office in Crown Point, Indiana.  Phyllis Reeder is a lifelong resident of Northwest Indiana who is extremely proud of her Hoosier heritage. In 1944, Phyllis was born in LaPorte County, Indiana. Her family later moved to Schererville where Phyllis attended Saint Michael's Elementary School. She went on to graduate from Dyer Central High School in 1963. She then attended and graduated from Keypunch School in Hammond. Phyllis then began to work in the data processing department at Simmons Mattress Company in Munster. Later that year, on November 22, 1963, Phyllis married her beloved husband, Charles ``Chuck'' Reeder. They started a family and raised four girls: Theresa, Debbie, Donna, and Diana, and one boy, Charles. Phyllis was an active parent and also continued to work at Simmons until July 1980 when the company closed its doors. In 1977, Phyllis and her family moved to a ten-acre mini-farm in Cedar Creek Township. It was during this time that Phyllis's passion for environmental conservation began to grow. On the farm, they have a large garden which, at the time, provided their large family with fruit, vegetables, and herbs. The farm also has a windbreak on the property, which helps to prevent wind erosion and also saves energy. In addition, Phyllis's five children participated in many 4-H projects, which included such topics as water conservation, wetlands, foods, basketry, and food preservation.  In 1985, Phyllis's passion for conservation led to her career at the Lake County Soil and Water Conservation District. Phyllis currently serves as Administrative Treasurer for the LCSWCD, where she is known for her friendly demeanor and positive attitude. She consistently goes out of her way to assist co-workers and customers with their needs. Included in her many achievements at the LCSWCD, she expanded the LCSWCD's educational program and trained as a facilitator for Project Wild and Aquatic, Project Learning Tree, and Project WET. These workshops are offered throughout the county to local schools and are facilitated by Phyllis. Because of her strong belief in conservation, her efforts extend well beyond her working hours at the LCSWCD. Phyllis is actively involved in numerous volunteer organizations and has served on many boards throughout the community. For her unwavering commitment to environmental conservation efforts and to Northwest Indiana, she is worthy of the highest praise.  Phyllis's dedication to the community and her career is exceeded only by her devotion to her wonderful family. Phyllis and Chuck have been married for 47 years and they enjoy spending much of their time with their beloved children and grandchildren.  Madam Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Phyllis Reeder for her lifetime of leadership, service and dedication to the community of Lake County, Indiana. She has touched the lives of numerous people through her efforts at the Lake County Soil and Water Conservation District and through her extensive volunteer work. While she will be missed by the people with whom she worked, Phyllis's service and selfless dedication will forever be remembered, and I ask that you join me in wishing her well in her retirement.                          ____________________
