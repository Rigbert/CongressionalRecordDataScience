Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, like my colleagues, I strongly support marriage penalty relief and tax benefit for families. That is why I support the Democratic substitute. It provides married couples and families significant tax relief, but it does it in a way that is good for all Americans and allows us to prepare for our future. H.R. 6 may seem small today, but we cannot ignore the fact that it is only part of a $3 trillion Republican tax plan. That is a lot of money, especially when it is based on an unreliable surplus projection. There are no assurances, no guarantees. What if we are wrong?  Mr. Speaker, the Republican $3 trillion plan puts at risk our ability to prepare for our future. What we should be doing today is paying down the national debt, saving Social Security and Medicare, and taking care of all of the basic needs of all of our citizens. The Republican tax plan is not right for America. It tends to move us in the wrong direction. And I say, Mr. Speaker, this plan is not fair, and it is not just.  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to vote against it and vote for the Democratic substitute.
