It does a lot of very important things in terms of highways and roads and infrastructure. What the Senator from Kentucky was talking about is all the overregulations that come from that. I am very sensitive to that.  That is not why I am here tonight. In fact, I wish to talk a little bit about the nuclear option, about how this has changed things around here, and it is somewhat of a crisis level we have arrived at. Before I do, I wish to share something on ObamaCare. A lot of things have been said on this floor about the problems with ObamaCare. I wish to elaborate a little bit about that in a minute but not right now. I only wish to say that 2 months ago, when my good friend from Texas, Senator Cruz, and 11 of us were concerned about trying to do something to stop ObamaCare and we took some pretty drastic steps--he actually stayed up and spoke all night--I did not, but I spoke during the evening and again in the morning. But I told a story at that time. It puts it into a context that people don't understand.  The story was this: Keep in mind this was 2 months ago. I said it has been admitted by Obama and by many of the leaders--even the leader of the Senate--that the ultimate goal of ObamaCare would be the single-payer health care system, very much like what was talked about back in the early 1990s when Bill Clinton was President and Hillary had her Hillary health care and at that time I think it was ultimately going to be a single-payer system. As my colleagues well know, a single-payer system by definition is socialized medicine, and that was what it was going to be at that time. I remember talking--and we ultimately did defeat it, but at that time I asked the question, I said: Wait a minute. You are talking about socialized medicine. It doesn't work in Denmark or Sweden or Canada or in the UK. Why do you think it would work if you were doing it? They never tell us this, but they say it may not work somewhere else, but if I were running it, it would work. We defeated that back in the 1990s.  Now, some time has gone by, and we have very much the same situation. We have a system that is edging into socialized medicine, a single-payer system. This is what they want. This is what liberals normally do want. They somehow think that government can run things better than people can.  So I told this story, I say to my good friend in the Chair. Keep in mind, this was 2 months ago. It had been less than a year before that when something happened to my wife--and my wife is just a year younger than I am--something happened, and all of a sudden she found out she had to have emergency open-heart surgery. It was a valve that was the problem at that time. We did some research. She immediately had open-heart surgery. It was successful. She is great now. They replaced the valve, and she is in really good shape.  But the point I am making is that if this had happened and we had been citizens of Canada--we went and checked--someone that age with that kind of an emergency would have to wait 6 months before they could determine whether they were going to allow them to have that operation. If it were in the UK, it would be 2 months. She would not have lasted that long.  That was to let people know that when it hits close to home, it really means lot more, instead of just talking about how many people are not happy with the enrollment and all this stuff.  Well, ironically, what happened to me 5 weeks ago was exactly the same thing. I ended up having to have emergency surgery. I had four heart bypasses. I got to thinking. Just a few weeks before, I had been talking about my wife. I would not be here now. That is how serious this is. Because those individuals who are talking about ObamaCare, they really want a system that the government is running, and it has not worked anywhere else in the world. In cases like mine, I would be on the waiting list and I probably would not have made it this far and would not have been here today.  I only say that--and I want to elaborate a little bit on that shortly, but I need to get in something very significant that is going to take place.  First of all, I do not like the idea of what is going on right now. I am very much upset that we had the nuclear option. I think most people--and it has been said over and over on the floor--constitutionally, we have a system that is set up that puts the Senate in a position where there has to be a supermajority that will ratify the various treaties and will confirm nominees. Well, the nominees who are confirmed are confirmed with a supermajority. Consequently, that would preclude one party from being able to control the confirmation of nominees.  Well, the makeup of the Senate today and for the next year is going to be 53 Democrats dominating, which means, of course, they can always get the 53 votes for confirmation but not any more, not enough to reach 60. So they changed all that, and that is wrong. They should not have done it.  So now we are going through this operation, and I decided that rather than to stay here during this Christmas season for the next few days just voting noon judges, I am going to say right now that I am going to vote against all the judges, but I am not going to be around here to do it. I will say this though.                            James Nomination  There is one vote that is coming up, and I am going to appeal to the leadership that I hope the confirmation of Deborah Lee James to be Secretary of the Air Force does not come up until this next week because I want to be here for that, and I would hope it could be postponed until Monday. The reason for that is I think that is a great appointment. I do not remember in the years I have been here--and I am the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee--I do not remember anytime when we have had someone who is as qualified at the outset as she is. She has an incredible background for this position. I have met her. I have talked to her. I have talked to her about the concerns about the readiness, which is very serious right now. Our readiness capabilities are lower than they have ever been since World War II. I know she is the right person to be at the helm to take care of that.  It was not long ago that through the sequestration or preparing for sequestration they made a decision to ground one-third of the combat-coded Active squadrons. Now, let's keep in mind that she is nominated to be Secretary of the Air Force, so this is something she would directly be interested in and concerned about.  What they did was, in order to--I suppose at that time the motivation was to try to save money. They grounded one-third of the combat-coded Active squadrons. That was in April of this year. It was not until 3 months later that they decided this is not good because you have the idle airplanes, the idle pilots. Pilots were resigning; they were upset because they were not being used. So they reinstated the squadrons that had been closed.  General Welsh, a great general, the commander of the Air Force, made the statement, and made it in a very articulate way, that it is going to cost us more to reinstate and to requalify the pilots and to make sure the planes are back in flying order than just the amount of money that was saved during that 3-month period.  That is really quite a statement. It is very serious. He said it could cut the flying hours by 15 percent in the months to come--and it has--as a result of that closure.  Well, I have to say to Ms. James that I am convinced you are going to be confirmed as Secretary of the Air Force. I will do all I can to make sure you are confirmed. But you are walking into a hornet's nest. It is a real serious problem there. The things that are happening to our military, which I am going to talk about in just a minute, are very serious.  She has a background. She served with a technical defense contractor in Virginia. It was the SAIC Technical and Engineering Sector. She was the executive vice president for communications and government affairs and the senior vice president for homeland security. Prior to that, she served as vice president for international operations marketing at United Technologies. That was all the way from 1998 to 2000. She served as Assistant Secretary of Defense for Reserve Affairs from 1993 to 1998, overseeing all matters pertaining to the Guard and Reserve forces. So she has probably as much preparation, background, expertise, education, and knowledge as anyone who has ever been nominated to be Secretary of the Air Force.  I hope we will be able to have that vote maybe on Monday as opposed to some time in the next few hours since I want to be here. I want to be one of the first to congratulate her.  (
