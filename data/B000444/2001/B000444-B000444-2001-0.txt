 President, I am very pleased to urge Senate adoption of S. 1803, the Security Assistance Act of 2001. This is legislation that the Foreign Relations Committee reports out each year, either free-standing or as a title in our State Department authorization bill.  But the substance of the Security Assistance Act is anything but routine. It includes: foreign military assistance, including Foreign Military Financing, FMF, and International Military Education and Training, IMET; international arms transfers; and many of our arms control, nonproliferation and anti-terrorism programs.
