 President, I want to take a brief moment to update my colleagues on the situation in Burma.  In short: there has been no progress: Burmese democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi remains under house arrest; 1,300 prisoners of conscience remain in Burmese jails--with others threatened by arrest for speaking out against the convention; and the SPDC nightmare of rape and repression continues unabated in Burma.  I expect that the junta may again release Suu Kyi in the houses leading up to the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, orchestrated May 17 constitutional convention charade. The world must hold the applause.  The generals in Rangoon need to do much more to prove they are serious about reconciliation than staging bad political theater in which they control every line and cue.  What should the SPDC do? First, release all political prisoners including those rounded up in the anticipation of the convention. Second, permit the NLD to operate freely, including immediately reopening all party offices. Third, allow NLD members to meet with ethnic leaders without threats of harassment, imprisonment or worse. Finally, provide the international press with unfettered access to Burmese democrats, throughout the country.  While the NLD will decide whether or not to attend the constitutional charade, the international community bears the responsibility to condemn a fundamentally flawed process that offers little in the way of transition to democracy. I remain deeply concerned that the regime has not rescinded their order which imposes lengthy prison sentences on anyone who speaks out against the national convention. What more evidence of a Potemkin village is needed?  As we think about Burma, it is important to consider the comments of Tashika Elbegdorj, former Mongolian Prime Minister, who wrote in a recent op-ed on Burma:       That the regime attempts to justify its behavior by talking      about ``managed democracy'' and the ``Asian way to      democracy'' is an outrage. The fact that Burma's regional      neighbors look the other way while making pretenses about      ``internal affairs'' is a stain on all Asians, and this must      change.  Tashika Elbegdorj speaks the truth and I commend his interest in the struggle of freedom for Burma. I encourage other democrats in the region to find their voices in support of Suu Kyi and the NLD in the days, weeks, and months to come.  I close by highlighting yesterday's Baltimore Sun editorial on Burma entitled ``Window Dressing'' that encouraged the U.S. Senate to ``. . . act quickly to renew import sanctions. . . . And this time sanctions must be followed by a U.S. diplomatic campaign--with the generals, their Southeast Asian apologists and the U.N. Security Council--that will be more strongly focused on forcing the junta to begin sharing power. Ms. Suu Kyi has deservedly gained world renown as a symbol of the Burmese quest for freedom, but she is also just one of 50 million people who remain under this regime's lock and key.''  The Sun editors got it right: the Senate must act quickly to pass S.J. Res. 36, which renews import sanctions against Burma. By doing so, we send a clear message that America continues to stand with the people of Burma. It is my hope that we can get agreement to consider and pass this resolution before the May recess.  I ask unanimous consent that the former Prime Minister's op-ed, which appeared in The Nation, an English-language newspaper in Thailand, and the Baltimore Sun editorial be printed in the Record following my remarks.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 [From the Baltimore Sun, May 12, 2004]                            Window Dressing       On Monday, 14 years after a pack of generals stole control      of Myanmar from a legally elected democracy party, the still-     ruling military junta will convene a national constitutional      convention to which it has invited its long-suppressed      opponents. In advance, the National League for Democracy,      which won those last parliamentary elections in 1990, has      been allowed to reopen an office. And there's mounting      anticipation that its leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu      Kyi, will be released from house arrest to participate in the      national political conference.       If this sounds all too familiar, it should. Those concerned      with the brutal suppression of freedom in the national once      known as Burma have been down this road before--in 1996 and,      more recently, last year, when the indomitable Ms. Suu Kyi      and her supporters, briefly free to speak out, came under      violent ambush leading to her last rearrest. Her release      now--it would be her third since her first arrest in 1989--     would be welcome, but it also would impart credibility to a      political process that Sen. Mitch McConnell has aptly      denounced as ``window dressing.''       All but a few of the more than 1,000 convention delegates      are said to be hand-picked supporters of the generals. Even      as the illegal regime talks of a new road map to resolving      this long standoff with the NLD, 1,300 political prisoners      remain jailed, and in recent     weeks more dissidents reportedly have been receiving long      sentences. Ms. Suu Kyi's party is in a tough spot: It can      boycott the convention as a sham and be accused by the regime      of being noncooperative, or it can legitimize a sham. Either      way, the Yangon generals again seem to be stringing along the      world.       All this speaks to the need for the U.S. Senate to act      quickly to renew import sanctions placed on Myanmarese goods      after Ms. Suu Kyi was rearrested last year. And this time,      sanctions must be followed by a U.S. diplomatic campaign--     with the generals, their Southeast Asian apologists and the      U.N. Security Council--that will be more strongly focused on      forcing the junta to begin sharing power.       Ms. Suu Kyi has deservedly gained world renown as a symbol      of the Burmese quest for freedom, but she also is just one of      50 million people who remain under this regime's lock and      key.                                  ____                           [From the Nation]                  Now Is the Time for Action on Burma                         (By Tashika Elbegdorj)       Nobody should be clinking champagne glasses over the recent      announcement that Burma's National League for Democracy      (NLD), lead by Aung San Suu Kyi, has tentatively accepted an      invitation to attend the national convention being organized      by the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC). If      this is to be a credible process, the regime must first meet      a number of reasonable demands by the NLD--something the      ruling junta has never done in the past. Now is the time to      step up pressure on Rangoon to ensure the NLD's demands are      met and to prevent another attempt by the SPDC to place a      veneer of democracy over their brutal rule.       Beginning a so-called process of national reconciliation      and charting a way out of Burma's political impasse without      the full participation of Suu Kyi and the NLD (as a party and      not as individuals) is destined to failure. The legitimacy of      the NLD cannot be denied. The Burmese people overwhelmingly      elected NLD candidates in 1990 to represent them in      parliamentary elections the SPDC refuses to recognize.       Few regimes in the world are as repugnant as the SPDC led      by Senior General Than Shwe. Human rights reports and      documentation by international organizations such as the      United Nations have catalogued a long series of horrors the      ruling regime inflicts on its people. For example, the SPDC      demands forced labor from its citizens, uses rape as a weapon      of fear and intimidation against ethnic groups, fills its      jails with political prisoners and torture and summary      executions are common. In one of the greatest crimes against      our youth, Human Rights Watch reports that nearly 70,000      child soldiers, some as young as 11, have been dragooned into      the Burma army.       That the regime attempts to justify its behavior by talking      about ``managed democracy'' and the ``Asian way to      democracy'' is an outrage. The fact that Burma's regional      neighbors look the other way while making pretenses about      ``internal affairs'' is a stain on all Asians--and this must      change.       The SPDC's national convention continues a process begun in      1995 to guarantee a future constitution that cements the      military's role in power. Statements by senior SPDC officials      that this convention will pick up where the last one left off      demonstrates a striking lack of sincerely and strongly      indicates that this exercise has nothing to do with democracy      and everything to do with dictatorship.       The Burmese people are not the only victims of the regime.      Burma's neighbors also suffer. In Thailand, the junta's      actions have forced tens of thousands of refugees across the      Thai-Burma border. Methamphetimines, or ya ba as it is known      locally, wash into Thailand from Burma, saddling Thai social      services with skyrocketing addiction rates and increased      crime. China is battling an HIV-AIDS epidemic that has its      roots in Burma's opium smuggling. Regionally, Association of      Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), who have long provided      Burma's generals with political cover, are forced to pick up      the tab for the regime's behavior. Meetings with the U.S. and      EU officials that should be focused on enhancing economic,      security and social ties are instead devoted to explaining      the outrageous actions of a brutal regime. This tension is a      drag on the region.       It is time for Asian governments to realize that it is time      to get tough with Burma's thugs. After expending considerable      political capital and prestige, Prime Minister Thaksin      Shinawatra received a slap in the face when the junta refused      to participate in a second meeting of the Bangkok Process, a      mechanism he put in place to allow the regime to brief the      international community on its road map to democracy and      national convention.       Thaksin has bent over backwards to curry favor with Burma's      generals by cracking down on Burmese refugees and democracy      activists promoting non-violence in their opposition to the      SPDC. Thaksin should communicate strongly to the regime that      they will not find solace or cover with his government.      Allowing Burmese democracy activists to meet and organize in      Thailand would serve to demonstrate his commitment to freedom      in Thailand as well as sending a strong signal to the regime      that their actions are unacceptable and their support waning.      Asean could take the step of suspending Burma's membership in      the regional grouping putting the SPDC on notice they are      unwilling to foot the rising political and financial bill for      the regime's acts of violence and abuse.       A peaceful Burma holds the promise of returning refugees,      addressing narcotics smuggling, and investing in a social      infrastructure that can unleash the talents and potential of      the people. This will create a huge new economic market for      Asean and be a catalyst for further development in an      environment of peace and stability. None of this will exist      under the SPDC.       It is testimony to the bravery of the Burmese people that      despite the regime's oppression and terror they are unable to      subdue the country's democracy movement. The strength of the      movement lies in its legitimacy and the demand by the country      for governance derived from the will of the people. It is      long past time for Asian governments to hear their call and      take the actions necessary for a peaceful transition of power      that can begin to heal this torn land.                          ____________________
