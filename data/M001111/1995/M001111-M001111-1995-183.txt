 It is because of the women we know--personal friends and personal relatives who have died from breast cancer because it was not detected early. One out of nine women today will be diagnosed with breast cancer. Nine out of ten women will survive if it is detected early. I am determined to make sure that on my watch on this floor of this Senate that I will not allow any of those women to go undetected. I think it is incumbent upon all of us to see that that occurs.
