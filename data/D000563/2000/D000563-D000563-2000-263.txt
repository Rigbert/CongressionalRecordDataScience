President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                           Office of the Secretary of Defense,                                    Washington, DC, July 11, 2000.     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Durbin: This letter is to support your effort      to reinforce the need for realistic testing of the National      Missile Defense (NMD) system. It is still very early in the      developmental testing of NMD. As we move forward, test      realism will need to grow with system capability, and it will      become more and more important to achieve realistic      operational conditions in NMD system tests. This will include      realistic countermeasures and engagement conditions.       The very nature of missile defense means that it will not      be possible to demonstrate all possible engagements in open      air flight intercept tests. Accordingly, it will be necessary      to develop realistic ground test simulations, including      realistic hardware-in-the-loop and scene generation      facilities. I especially appreciate your commitment to both      ground based and open air flight tests.       If I can provide additional information, please don't      hesitate to call me.           Sincerely,                                                  Philip E. Coyle,                                                         Director.
