 President, let me start this morning by commending Chairman Kent Conrad for his leadership of our Budget Committee and especially for the hundreds of hours he and his staff have dedicated to getting this budget done and accommodating both the priorities and concerns of so many of us in this body. Putting together a budget is never an easy process, but I believe our chairman has achieved a good balance that will setus on a course to both reducing our deficit and investing in the areas that we know will make us stronger in the future--energy, health care, and education.  I know that in addition to his work on this budget, this is a particularly difficult time for the State of North Dakota and the families and businesses there. I want to say to Chairman Kent Conrad, who will be on the floor shortly, that all of our hearts go out to him and his State as they struggle with these horrific storms that are going through his area.  A budget is a statement of priorities. Ours is very clear: We put the middle class first, and we get our country back on track by investing in our future.  To be clear, we have inherited some very great challenges. We now face the worst economic crisis in generations. Since December 2007, we have lost 4.4 million jobs, including 2.6 million of those in the past 4 months. So before we consider where we are going, it is important to talk a little bit about where we have been.  For weeks now, my friends on the other side of the aisle have been bemoaning deficits and debt with not a moment of consideration for their own record on those issues. Back in 2001, Republicans controlled the full power of our Government. Under the leadership of President Bush and Republicans in Congress, record surpluses created under President Clinton became record deficits.
