 President, I come to the floor today to join my colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, in urging the Senate to adopt our Internet filtering amendment, the Childsafe Internet bill.  We come here today for one simple reason: to find a way to protect children on the Internet. The Internet is growing and expanding faster than we ever thought possible. It has become a daily tool for many Americans. As the Internet continues to grow, I believe it is our responsibility to do something to protect children from harmful material.  I have worked hard over the last 6 years to get computers and technology into our schools. I have sponsored legislation to allow surplus Government computers to be put into schools. The Senate, in fact, just passed my Teacher Technology Training Act, to make sure teachers can incorporate technology into their curriculum.  I have worked hard to establish the e-rate to help our schools get connected to the Internet. I have been out in schools, and I know personally what a great educational tool the Internet can be. And I represent a state that is leading the way in many of these new technologies.  I want our students and I want our teachers to have access to this information. But, as we continue to see, there is a small amount of information on the Internet to which children should simply not have access.  In fact, a 1997 national survey of U.S. public libraries and the Internet revealed that students often unintentionally download pornography while on the Net. Mr. President, 22 percent of the children surveyed admitted that this had happened in school, while 25 percent admitted it had occurred in a public library.  I understand no solution is perfect. Technology alone won't filter every objectionable item on the Internet. We must remember, though, that this technology has made enormous strides in just a short amount of time.  I have heard from people who say health information, such as breast cancer, would be blocked from viewing. That may have been the case, but filtering companies have developed new technologies and are employing new procedures that do protect children while allowing more and more educational information to be used.  Our legislation is a first step. It is the right thing to do. The Childsafe Internet bill would simply require any school or library that gets reduced Internet access, the e-rate, to install some technology on their computers that keeps inappropriate material away from young children.  What is great about our bill is that it gives power to local school districts and libraries to determine which filtering device to use and what constitutes inappropriate material. Decisions must remain at the local level with those who best know their students.  Mr. President, let me give a few examples I have heard of the need for the Childsafe Internet Act.  Last month, a seventh grade teacher in Washington state told me that it was impossible to watch 30 young students at their computers all of the time. She did not want a situation in which a child found inappropriate material, complained to their parents, and then have a parent come screaming back to the classroom, where the teacher was ultimately responsible. She turned off the Internet.  I do not want that to happen. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a number of letters I have received from parents about the need for this bill.  There being no objection, the letters were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                   April 19, 1998.       Dear Senators: You were both in Vancouver this week, and I      wasn't able to reach you through your office. Would you      please update me on the status of SB 1619 the Internet School      Filtering Act? In SW Washington, the regional group reported      that they are the state internet provider service is looking      at filtering at the state level as a result of SB 1619. As      you can see from this report, filtering isn't perfect.      However, without any filtering, far more youth at much      younger ages come up with inappropriate material.       In Camas, pop. 9000, elementary students are not allowed to      do searches on the internet for this reason. There is no      reason to allow technology to serve as an excuse for lowering      standards of acceptable material in publicly funded      institutions. The Camas library continues to fight filtering,      and points to the schools lack of one as justification. The      Ft. Vancouver library board most recently on Monday April 13      though optional filtering was a good idea. That defeats the      whole purpose and keeps the porn option wide open to kids. I      hope you got my report of abuses noted. If they had a log      like this, I'm sure the number of accesses reported would be      much higher. Please continue to work so that our tax dollars      do not found porn and inappropriate material to children.      Thank you for your time to reply please. E-mail is best,      since it is faster, and a number of meetings are coming up      the first week in May.           Sincerely,     Margaret Tweet.                                  ____                                                     May 29, 1998.     Senator Patty Murray,     Attn: Kay       Dear Kay: This also came out today. Ft. Vancouver records      show one employee who quit rather than provide porn to minors      with that as the stated reason. At the KOMO Town Hall,      another Washington librarian announced she made the same      decision after 6 months of wrangling over whether providing      access to internet porn to a 14 year old patron was a part of      her job she could live with. Adult businesses cannot sell      pornography to children, an indication of public policy. It      should not be an option for youth in libraries either. Thank      you again for your time.           Sincerely,                                                   Margaret Tweet.                                       ____                                                     May 17, 1998.     To: Senator Murray,     Subject: Filtering Library Internet Access.       Dear Senator Murray: I just finished watching Town Meeting      on ABC. You go girl! I am a parent of a 17 month old. I am      horrified that she could go to the library in 4 years and      pull up pornography or any other sexual sites. Yes, the      library is a public place, that does not mean they have to      provide information about such things. Why protect the bad      guys when children are our future. And people wonder how this      world came to what it is now with these kind of issues. If      someone wants to look at pornography let them buy their own      computer and do it in the privacy of their own home, not      expose our kids to it, that's just what the sickos want. I'm      with you all the way. Even if the filtering isn't perfect,      software companies will continue to upgrade and patch their      software, and why not do what we can now to protect our      children!!!!       Good luck June 9th, you have our prayers.                                  ____                                                  Shelton, WA,                                                     May 30, 1998.     To: Senator Murray.     Subject: Cyber porn.       Senator Murray: You and I disagree on most issues, but on      the issues of limiting access to highly graphic pornography      to children on the Internet is something we do agree upon.       I support the concept of schools mandated to utilize an      electronic block to preclude elementary, middle school, and      high school students from entering pornographic websites.      There isn't any defensible reason why these websites should      be available for the children to explore. I am certain most      parents do not allow their children to surf porn sites so at      home, and the same expectation is needed to protect the      children while they are in school.       The technology is currently available for school districts      to block out websites which are deemed pornographic. This      does not in anyway impede the purveyors and pimps of this      demeaning material of their First Amendment rights. You would      defend these children if some individual were to turn the      school into a toxic waste dump. The same fervor is needed to      prevent pornographic pollutants from being introduced into      the minds of impressionable children.       Since the educational establishment benefits from taxpayer      dollars, it is not an onerous request to have this country's      school system voluntarily act upon this issue in a      responsible manner. School districts which are non-compliant      may have their federal funding significantly impacted until      compliance is gained.       Thank you for taking this time to read my this piece of      email.     Jeffrey K. Meyers.                                  ____                                                 Bellevue, WA,                                                February 11, 1998.     Hon. Patty Murray,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Murray: My family has a concern regarding      pornography on the Internet that is dramatically different      than you may have been asked to look into or even aware of. A      few days ago, our fifteen year old daughter was doing school      work using the Internet. The address for one of the most      popular search engines is, ``www.infoseek.com.'' She made a      one adjacent character key typing error and typed,      ``www.infoseel.com.''       She was shocked, stunned, and nauseated at the vile      explicit pictures that instantly were presented on the      screen. Enclosed are black and white print outs. As you can      see the first shows anal intercourse with the text, ``Free      Live Fucking, Now With Sound.'' The second is a gynecological      close-up with the text, ``hot hole, enter free.'' This      brought our traumatized daughter running out of the room in      tears.       This kind of revolting garbage has no place in our home and      no place in American society. There are two aspects of this      issue that warrant federal action. One, the people behind      this website, by their intentional choice of their URL      address, were seeking to put their pornography in front of      those who made reasonably foreseeable typing errors. This      amounts to intentional interstate delivery of pornography to      minors. It should be immediately prosecuted as such.       Second, the National Science Foundation assigns the      Internet URL addresses. It should be a simple matter for      Congress to legislate the denial of URL addresses to people      and organizations who engage in this kind of malicious      perversion.       The apologists for the present laissez faire state of      affairs on the Internet are fond of telling us parents that      it's our responsibility to supervise our own children. This      disgusting incident proves that to be a totally inadequate      approach, and is in fact a self serving ruse. My family sees      this as nothing less than visual child rape. Please let me      know what actions you can take to quickly curtail this abuse      and protect our children from this kind of intrusive filth.           Sincerely,     Dock Brown.                                  ____                                                  Bothell, WA,                                                February 26, 1998.     Subject: Childsafe Internet Bill.       I am writing to urge your support of the Childsafe Internet      Bill being pushed by Senators John McCain, Patty Murray and      others which will limit the right of access by children to      smut on the internet when federally funded commuters are used      in classrooms.       This one is a ``no-brainer''. Institutions who want federal      money to buy computers must agree to block and/or filter      pornography when children are using computers in the      classroom.       Will you support the Childsafe Bill?       Respectfully,     Vincent T. Saulin.                                  ____                                               Oak Harbor, WA,                                                 November 4, 1997.     Tom Mayer,     Director,     Marysville, WA.       Dear Mr. Mayer: For over a year people in our community      have been doing research on children's access to pornography      on the Internet at public libraries. Among other material      such as feature articles in ``The Wall Street Journal,'' and      ``New York Times, '' and numerous news magazines, we have      studied the ``Report and Recommendation on Internet Filtering      Software and Its Use in Public Libraries, July 1997'',      prepared by the Sno-Isle Regional Library System.       We sincerely hope that we can persuade the Sno-Isle Library      system to install filters on the juvenile computers. We      believe that the filters are a sensible and reasonable way of      copying with the problem.       A list of our concerns is attached, but the basis of our      decision is as follows:       1. Public libraries have always been held accountable for      their resource material, especially where children's sections      are concerned.       2. The Internet should pass the same criteria as all other      material.       3. Filtering software is available to block child      pornography and other smut sites, and libraries all across      the country have installed this software without any legal      challenges so far.       We urge the Sno-Isle Library system to follow the advice of      your internal staff report of July 1997, which recommended      filtering software on juvenile computers.       Someone has to speak for our children. We the parents,      grandparents, teachers, law enforcement officers and social      service workers are doing just that.       May we hear from you soon?           Sincerely yours,                                                Trudy J. Sundberg,                                   Founder, Save Our Kids Crusade.
