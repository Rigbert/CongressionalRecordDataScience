He has described the process exactly. The small, relatively small appropriation which I manage in the Senate Appropriations Committee includes a plus up, an increase in the funding for several key agencies, one of which is the Securities and Exchange Commission. If one watched ``60 Minutes'' on Sunday night and heard about Bernard Madoff and criticisms of the SEC dropping the ball, not hearing the whistle being blown, we have to change that. We have to make sure the SEC is a regulatory agency that has the resources it needs to deal with an ever-expanding area of jurisdiction. The same thing is true for the Commodities Futures Trading Commission which also deals with futures and derivatives and the like. We have to make certain they have resources, and they have an increase in this budget to be the policemen on the beat. I put money in there as well for the Consumer Product Safety Commission. It was not that long ago we were frightened by the prospect of lead toys that might endanger our children. This agency is finally growing into the 21st century responsibility it has.  These are areas where we have increased funding so that government can be vigilant and helpful and we can avoid economic disasters so that investors' and savers' money can be carefully reviewed.  This was all debated in the subcommittee. It was brought forward in the full committee. In most cases it received full committee review months ago. Today we are trying to get the homework we should have done last year done and moved forward. We have so many important things to do.  I will speak for a minute or two more, if I may, on a related issue.
