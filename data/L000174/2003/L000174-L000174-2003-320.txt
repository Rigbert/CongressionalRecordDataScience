President, I am pleased to introduce the ``September 11 Victim Compensation Fund Extension Act of 2003'' to extend the pending deadline of the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund to December 31, 2004. I thank Senators Durbin, Schumer, Dodd, Lieberman, Clinton, Corzine, and Lautenberg for joining me as original cosponsors of this legislation.  Along with Senator Daschle, Representative Gephardt and others, I worked hard to create the Victims Fund over the objections of some in the administration and Congress. We insisted that it be included in the legislation to bail out the airlines passed in the wake of the most devastating terrorist attacks on American soil. The current deadline for applying for compensation from the Victims Fund is rapidly approaching, but it has become apparent that many families need more time. Thus far, just under a third of eligible families have applied to the Fund for compensation--only about 1,282 death claims and 1,050 injury claims have been filed so far by victim families, according to the Department of Justice.  Ken Feinberg, the Special Master for the Fund, is doing his best to get victims families to understand their rights. Recently, he has even taken out extensive advertisements in a number of newspapers and created a series of informational meetings and claim assistance sites to assist victims' families to file for compensation with the Victims Fund instead of filing a lawsuit against the airlines industry. I commend him for his efforts.  It appears that only a few relatives of victims of September 11 are opting out of eligibility for the fund by filing a lawsuit against the airlines industry. While some families are likely weighing that decision, the number of disqualifying lawsuits is low--69 as of last month--and only three of those were in the last three months, according to The New York Times.  Instead, victims support groups have told me that they receive calls daily from individuals who understand that the deadline is approaching but cannot face the emotional pain of preparing a claim. Mr. Feinberg has also commented that many victims are still too paralyzed by their grief to confront the logistical burden and emotional pain of filing a death claim.  In light of this painful reality, I believe it is appropriate to extend the deadline for filing applications to the Victims Fund to December 31, 2004--an extension of just over a year. This extension would give grieving families additional time to mourn those who were lost and to overcome the emotional challenges of filing paperwork with the Victims Fund. In recent days, I have been in contact with several September 11 victims support groups, all of which agreed that such an extension would provide some relief during these dark days for victims' families as they endure the grieving process.  As the anniversary of the tragedy of September 11 approaches, victims' families have many burdens. They do not need this arbitrary deadline confronting them between September 11 and the year-end holidays. This is something we can do now for victims of September 11. I urge my colleagues to support the ``September 11 Victim Compensation Fund Extension Act of 2003.''                          ____________________
