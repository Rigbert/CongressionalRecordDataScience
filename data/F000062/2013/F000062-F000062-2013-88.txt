 President, the Senator from New Hampshire, Ms. Ayotte, has filed Senate amendment No. 161, which reinforces the current requirement for the Department of Defense to be fully financially auditable by the year 2017. I fully support theamendment and have joined as a co-sponsor, as auditability is an important step to managing a budget, especially one in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  I wish to clarify, however, that the amendment should not be seen as superseding existing requirements for agencies within the Intelligence Community, including those in the Department of Defense, to be fully auditable by 2016.
