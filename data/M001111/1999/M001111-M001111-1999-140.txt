 I, too, was struck by this new concept of adding a month to our calendar in order to solve the problems of the country. I agree, it has to be humorous; otherwise, we would all be crying. Because, truly, when I go home what my constituents tell me is what I think everyone is hearing: We have priorities in this country, particularly education. They are worried about preschool. They are worried about Head Start. They are worried about whether or not their child is in a class that is small enough that they get the individual attention they need. They are worried about whether or not their teachers have the kind of training they need to teach their children. They certainly are worried about school construction and the ability to send their child to a safe school.  We had a whole hearing this morning about school violence. But teachers have not come to me and said: How do we add this to our curriculum, explaining a whole new month that has been added by the Senate?  I know my colleague has worked with me on the Budget Committee for the last 7 years. We have worked very hard to reduce the deficit. There was a $300 billion deficit when we arrived here in 1993.  We worked hard to be real. Despite the humor we have in this debate today, we need to get real about the budget; we need to get real about our priorities; we need to recognize we cannot put a priority on education verbally and put it at the end of the pile when it comes to the budget and then come up with gimmicks to pay for it.  I ask the Senator to comment because we worked on this together for many years.
