President, as a native of Montpelier and as one who attended the christening of the USS Montpelier, I was so happy to see an article in the Times Argus regarding its return to the United States after a 6-month deployment last month. Steve Martin and Debra Smith have both been involved for years and supported the crew of the USS Montpelier. Marcelle and I had a memorable time at a picnic they held for the crew in Middlesex. As a Vermonter, they both make me proud, and I wanted my fellow Senators to see what they have done.  I ask unanimous consent that the Times Argus article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                  [From the Times Argus, Feb. 8, 2016]                    USS Montpelier Returns to States                           (By Josh O'Gorman)       Norfolk, Va.--The USS Montpelier has returned home to the      United States following a six-month deployment.       Friday afternoon, the submarine--the third naval vessel to      share the name of Vermont's capital--docked at Naval Station      Norfolk after logging more than 38,000 nautical miles during      its most recent deployment.       The crew of the Los Angeles-class fast-attack submarine,      which includes 15 officers and 129 enlisted crew, spent the      recent deployment supporting national security interests in      Europe and the Middle East, with stops in Bahrain, France,      Greece and the United Arab Emirates.       ``I have been connected with this amazing group of men for      14 or 15 years now,'' said Debra Smith, of Middlesex, who      chairs the Veterans and Family Support Committee for the      Montpelier VFW.       Smith's support for the sailors of the USS Montpelier began      with her efforts to keep them entertained while at sea.      Smith, who used to operate Capital Video in Montpelier before      it closed, would send the sailors movies to watch during      their down time.       Most recently, Smith organized an effort in which students      from Hardwick Elementary School are making ``Welcome Home''      and Valentine's Day cards, which are expected to go out in      the mail to the crew this week.       Both Smith and Steve Martin, also of Middlesex, have been      passengers of the 360-foot submarine, which was commissioned      in 1993 and which launched the first Tomahawk cruise missiles      during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.       ``It was pretty awesome,'' Martin said. ``It's pretty tight      in there. We spent the day out at sea and when they surfaced      we were able to go up on the bridge with the captain.''       He also described the steepness with which the submarine      dives and surfaces.       ``You're keeping your balance and your face is a few feet      from the floor,'' Martin said.       Next month, Smith and Martin will take a road trip that      will include a stop in Norfolk to visit the boat and its      crew.                            ____________________
