Everything he mentioned was controversial. Fortunately, we didn't have to handle a lot of the problems with transit because that was done in another committee, and I certainly commend the chairman of the committee, as well as the ranking member, as well as the subcommittee ranking member and subcommittee chairman. I understand the subcommittee chairman is going to come on the floor and make some comments.  When the Senator talks about safe routes to school, I think that is a good example of the weeks and months we spent coming to an agreement. Frankly, Senator Jeffords is the one driving force to get up from $50 million to $75 million. I felt that perhaps priorities could be in some other areas.  In looking at this, I want to commend the Senator for the work he did because I think he is right. We probably spent several months just on the freight area. Everyone knows that was not adequately addressed in TEA-21 and was not adequately addressed in ISTEA. I appreciate very much the time the Senator has spent in these very sensitive and controversial areas where it was give and take, it was compromise. Many times we gave up something we believed in in order to accomplish it and come up with a bill, a good bill, which we have right now.
