Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I pay tribute to one of Northwest Indiana's most dedicated social workers, Shirley L. Story, of Gary, Indiana. On March 20, 1998, Shirley was honored at the Annual Social Worker of the Year and Citizen of the Year Awards Celebration with the Social Workers of the Year Award. The highest honor for a member of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW), this award is given yearly to a person who displays outstanding leadership, commitment, and professionalism beyond the normal clientele relationship.  Shirley was honored for her exemplary work as a Social Worker Supervisor at St. Joseph's Carmelite School for Girls in East Chicago, Indiana. During her twelve years at the Carmelite School for Girls, Shirley has instituted programs dedicated to improving the lives of the young women with whom she has contact. Indeed, she has created such initiatives as the Independent Living Program, where high school seniors are allowed to rent an apartment. The girls pay bills, utilities, and work their own jobs learning valuable skills for their future. Shirley is also dedicated to improving the field of social work as a whole. She is currently serving her second term as a representative to the NASW Indiana Chapter, which allows her to share her knowledge and experience with other social workers around the state.  Deeply committed to the community through her work, Shirley also volunteers much of her personal time. She is actively involved in her church, the New Revelation Church, in Gary. Some examples of the dedication Shirley has for her church include her service as the First Vice President of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Baptist State Convention of Indiana, Inc., the Recording Secretary in the Progressive Baptist Convention Midwest Region, and a Co-Sunday School teacher for young women. In addition, Shirley is active in the Delta Sigma Theta Public Service Sorority, Church Women United, and the alumna associations of Loyola University and Ball State University. Though certainly dedicated to her work and community, Shirley is also a caring, family-oriented person. Her children, Chisle Leah and Vaughn Michael, are twenty-one and nineteen, respectively. Chisle is a licensed cosmetologist and Vaughn will attend Purdue University this fall. Part of a family, Shirley often takes care of her nieces and nephews, especially the children of her sister who passed away three years ago. In addition, she often visits her relatives to spend quality time with them.  Shirley plans to remain with the St. Joseph's Carmelite School for Girls. With the opportunities for creating new programs, positive effects of the community, and helping individuals in need, she is very satisfied in her current position as Social Worker Supervisor. However, Shirley has not limited her potential for good works in the future. She is considering opening a consulting firm to broaden her activities throughout the region.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating Shirley Story for being named Social Worker of the Year. Her dedication, service, and leadership to her community and her family has rewarded the people of Indiana's First Congressional District with one of the real heroes of our time.                          ____________________
