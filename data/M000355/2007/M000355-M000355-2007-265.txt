 President, I rise today to honor the life of John A. Strosnider, D.O., a respected Kentuckian who passed away on July 1, 2007, of cancer. Dr. Strosnider was the founding dean of the Pikeville College School of Osteopathic Medicine and also served as president of the American Osteopathic Association, AOA.  Dr. Strosnider accepted the challenge to create the Pikeville College School of Osteopathic Medicine in 1996. The school, located in eastern Kentucky, opened in 1997 with 60 students and has since produced more than 400 physicians. In keeping with the school's mission, many of them have stayed in the region to practice medicine. In fact, according to Pikeville College officials, 55 of the new physicians have opened offices within a 2-hour drive of the city.  Throughout his career, Dr. Strosnider was honored by several organizations for his dedication to the profession. At the time of his death, he was serving as president of the AOA, and, in 2005, he was named Kentucky Osteopathic Medical Association Physician of the Year.  After being named AOA president, Dr. Strosnider said, ``I hope to raise students' awareness and remind osteopathic physicians of the history and philosophy of osteopathic medicine. The osteopathic medical profession was built on a primary care philosophy, and we need to get back to those basics so that our patients in these areas have access to the distinctive health care promised by osteopathic medicine.''  When Dr. Strosnider was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer earlier this year, he gathered his students and faculty together to inform them of his illness. He told the assembly he wanted to be open with them and remain optimistic. Shortly after his passing, Pikeville College President Hal Smith wrote a letter to colleagues and friends. In it, he wrote, ``John's vision and work will continue to impact the lives of thousands of individuals he never knew.''  I got to know Dr. Strosnider several years ago. Every year, he would bring a group of his students to Washington, DC, and I had the privilege of meeting with him and his students on several occasions. I was always impressed with how Dr. Strosnider encouraged the future doctors to remain close to home and provide critical health care to the underserved people of eastern Kentucky.  Mr. President, I ask you to join me in remembering this outstanding Kentuckian. He is survived by his wife Jo Ann and three children, John Adam, Alisha, and Paul. He will be missed.                          ____________________
