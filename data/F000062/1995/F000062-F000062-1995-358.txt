 President, I would like to express my deep dismay over the defeat of the Murray-Gorton amendment.  Frankly, it was my intention if the Murray-Gorton amendment were successful, to move an amendment which would be a slight change to take California's situation into consideration.  I cannot help but note that there have been a number of specific amendments to deal with a number of States. Nine States have received some preferential treatment in this bill. For my State, and I speak for Senator Boxer, as well, California has a unique situation.  We have a State law which mandates a 50-percent reduction in solid waste by the year 2000. How can a State do that if it does not have some flow control over its waste?  Eight local governments in my State, based on last year's bill, made agreements and incurred debts totaling $125 million which are unaddressed by this bill. Those counties are very concerned.  The California Association of Counties had asked that if the Gorton-Murray amendment were successful, an amendment be introduced based on that amendment which would clarify certain gray areas in the bill. The gray areas are contracts and franchises that have been consummated after the grandfather date, but based on last year's bill.  I very much regret that these issues are not taken into consideration, particularly by a Congress that is very concerned about States' rights.  I, for one, and Senator Boxer as well, will have to vote against this bill, based on the fact that we believe our State is seriously disadvantaged by it. I yield the floor.
