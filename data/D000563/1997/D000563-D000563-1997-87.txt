President, speaking to the second-degree amendment offered by the Senator from Kentucky, he and I have been in disagreement on this issue in the short time I have served in this body, but I stand today in support of his second-degree amendment. Though I may disagree with one or two provisions in it, I believe the central element of his amendment is a suggestion that tobacco growers should be protected in any settlement agreement, and I certainly think that is a worthy goal as part of the settlement negotiations. For that reason, though I may disagree with some other particulars, I will support his second-degree amendment.
