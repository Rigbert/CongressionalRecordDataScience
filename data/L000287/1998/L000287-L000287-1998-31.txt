Mr. Speaker, this bill is a thinly veiled attack on America's organized workers. It is a Republican retribution bill. If one disagrees with the Republican majority, it will not be long before they are under investigation or under attack right here on the floor of the House of Representatives.  Mr. Speaker, this bill is not just an antiunion bill, it is un-American. This bill will allow employers to discriminate against and deny employment to workers based solely on their connection with a union.  What happened to freedom of speech? What happened to freedom of assembly? What happened to freedom of association? This bill is a naked attempt to intimidate American working families. It is a shame, it is a disgrace, and it has no place on this House floor.  I urge my colleagues to kill this bad un-American bill. Get it off of the floor, and send it to the trash heap dump right now.                              {time}  1715
