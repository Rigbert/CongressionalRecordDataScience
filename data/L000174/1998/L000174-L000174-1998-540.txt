President, I am delighted that we have finally broken the logjam on Ninth Circuit vacancies. Judge Silverman is the first judge to be confirmed to this Court in two years. In the meantime, the Court has been suffering from vacancies amounting to more than one-third of the authorized judgeships for the court and had to cancel over 600 arguments last year.  I congratulate Judge Silverman and his family and thank Senator Kyl for his cooperation in this effort. I hope that we will move forward promptly to consider the nominations of Judge Richard Paez, Professor William Fletcher, Margaret McKeown and the others needed to staff this important court.                          ____________________
