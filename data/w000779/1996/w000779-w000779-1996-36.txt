President, in this Congress, there has been considerable debate on the issue of property rights. But the debate so far has essentially ignored the interests of the largest group of property owners in America--the 60 million homeowners.  Until today, property rights legislation has tended to protect only a limited group of property owners, those whose use or development of their property is regulated by the Federal Government. The typical homeowners who we all represent live in already constructed homes; they are not developing their property. When they use their property in a typical fashion, they are not regulated under the wetlands law, the endangered species law, or any other Federal status.  The typical homeowner is helped, not hurt, by many government policies that keep our air clean and our water health and pure. When these homeowners' property rights and property values are threatened, the threat is more likely to come from pollution from neighboring factories than from government actions to protect the environment.  Today, along with Senator Warner, I am introducing the Homeowners Protection and Empowerment Act to make sure the interests of America's homeowners are protected. Our legislation provides homeowners with the right to sue for compensation whenever their property values are diminished by an action regulated by the Federal Government. It provides homeowners with a Federal right of action against anyone responsible for decreasing a private party homeowner's property value by $10,000 or more, whether it's a Federal agency or a private party acting under authority of Federal law.  For example, if a developer fills in federally regulated wetlands, the result may be increased flooding on downstream homeowners' properties, because undeveloped wetlands help to control flooding. This increased risk offlooding diminishes the value of downstream homeowners' properties. Under the Homeowners Protection and Empowerment Act, any affected homeowner whose property value declined by at least $10,000 because of the developer's wetland filling would have the right to sue the developer for compensation.  The legislation also requires anyone conducting an activity that both requires a permit or other authorization under Federal law and generates pollution or has other property damaging impacts to give written notice about the activity and its potential impact to each homeowner living within a quarter mile of the activity.  I want to thank Senator Warner for working with me on this legislation and for helping to clarify that the intent of the legislation is to protect typical homeowners. I look forward to working with him to move the legislation forward.                                 ______                                       By
