 President, David H. Kraus, assistant chief of the European Division of the Library of Congress, died on October 27 in Lanham, MD. In a career at the Library of Congress that spanned a quarter-century, Mr. Kraus played a pivotal role in developing the library's unparalleled European collections and in advising the Congress in a variety of ways, most recently in the training of parliamentarians and librarians from the newly independent, former Communist States of Europe.  A native of Minnesota, Mr. Kraus received his undergraduate education at the University of Wisconsin and did graduate work at Harvard University. A consummate bibliographer and administrator, he was also a remarkable linguist who attained reading fluency in most of the major languages of Eastern and Western Europe. Mr. Kraus was nationally prominent in library circles and ably represented the Congress at scores of professional meetings.  David Kraus was a wise and gentleman, possessed with a ready wit to go with his enormous erudition. He served the Congress long and faithfully, and he leaves many friends on Capitol Hill where he will be sorely missed.                          ____________________
