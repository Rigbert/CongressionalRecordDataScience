President, as I recall, the tax bill actually lowered taxes for the vast majority of Americans. I can understand some concern for some who may have had it higher, those who serve in this Chamber, because they are in the highest income bracket anyway. They may have felt their taxes go up slightly. But the vast majority of people we represent saw their taxes go down.  I raise this, however, the fact that without all the rhetoric that we have been hearing for years, rhetoric about balancing the budget at a time when the national debt was tripled in the two previous administrations, we have had a President who has brought down, with very tough votes and very tough action, brought the deficit down 4 years in a row. I would only suggest to my good friend and colleague from Utah, the President laid it out very well in the State of the Union message. He said all that's needed for a balanced budget: We vote it, he signs it.  The Republicans are in the majority in the Senate. The Republicans are in the majority in the House. All they have to do is bring up the various spending bills, entitlement bills or anything else. They should have the votes.
