 Mr. Chairman, I have one final point that needs clarification. The bill requires the IRS maintain taxpayer services at 1995 levels. I am concerned that this provision will require IRS to reopen walk-in taxpayer service centers rather than allow IRS to rely on more cost-effective telephone service. Can the gentleman clarify his intent on this provision?
