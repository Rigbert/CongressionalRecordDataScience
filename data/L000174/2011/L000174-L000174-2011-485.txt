We debated this change at some length in connection with the Feinstein amendment. That amendment was rejected by the Senate by a vote of 87 to 13. The Senate has come down firmly and decisively in favor of modernizing and harmonizing the American patent system with the rest of the world.  When we began the patent reform debate 6 years ago, there was also a significant concern that the costs and uncertainty associated with patent litigation had been escalating, which was resulting in a drag on innovation. Damage awards had been inconsistent and not always related to the value of the invention. This disconnect and uncertainty was a problem that also led to unreasonable posturing during licensing negotiations.  Fortunately, the courts have made great strides in addressing this issue, and there is general consensus that legislation need not and, in fact, should not affect the law of damages as a result.  The Senate has before it bipartisan legislation that can lead to long-needed improvements in our patent laws and system. This is a measure that can help facilitate invention, innovation and job creation, and do so in the private sector. This can help everyone from startups and small businesses to our largest, cutting edge companies.  The America Invents Act promotes innovation, and will improve our economy, by addressing the impediments to innovation. As the President challenges Americans to win the future, Congress cannot afford to sit idly by while innovation--the engine of our economy--is impeded by outdated laws. Our legislation leverages the ingenuity of our businesses, our universities, and our independent inventors, and creates a system in which that ingenuity can improve our economy. It will create jobs, improve products and reduce costs for American companies and American consumers.  I began working on patent reform years ago, along with Chairman Smith in the House, because of my belief that we needed a more efficient and streamlined system. For many years, patent law interested only a niche audience, and developments were reported only in trade publications. Now they are discussed everywhere from the front page of the Wall Street Journal to the New York Times, and all three branches of government have taken an active role.  The America Invents Act is about economic development. It is about jobs; it is about innovation; it is about consumers. All benefit under a patent system that reduces unnecessary costs, removes inefficiencies, and holds true to the vision of our Founders that Congress should establish a national policy that promotes the progress of science and the useful arts.  When Thomas Jefferson examined that first patent in 1790--a patent that went to a Vermonter--no one could have predicted how the American economy would develop and what changes would be needed for the law to keep pace, but the purpose then remains the purpose today: promoting progress.  If we are to maintain our position at the forefront of the world's economy, if we are to continue to lead the globe in innovation and production, if we are to continue to enjoy the fruits of the most creative citizens, then we must have a patent system that produces high quality patents, that limits counterproductive litigation over those patents, and that makes the entire system more streamlined and efficient.  Now is the time to bolster our role as the world leader in innovation. Now is the time to create jobs at home. Now is the time for Congress to act on patent reform. I urge all Senators to support the American Invents Act.                               Exhibit 1                [From the New York Times, Mar. 7, 2011]                   Patents, Reform and the Little Guy       In the last decade, Congress has missed several chances to      reform a patent system that is slow, costly and puts the      United States at odds with the rest of the industrial world.      On Wednesday, the Senate has another opportunity to reform      the nation's patent law.       The America Invents Act offers a step toward a more      effective and transparent patent protection system. This      should encourage investment in inventions and faster      diffusion of ideas. The bill, which has broad bipartisan      support, would boost the patent office's resources by letting      it keep all the fees it collects. This would enable it to      speed up the review of patent applications--which currently      takes almost three years to process--and work through an      immense backlog of 715,000 applications.       The bill should reduce costly litigation by creating an in-     house system to look into claims of patent infringement      before they go to court.       The bill would also replace the first-to-invent standard      prevailing in the United States--which grants formal      protection to the creator of an innovation--with the first-     inventor-to-file system used in most nations.       This change would make it cheaper for American patent      holders to get patent protection around the world. But it has      been met with vocal opposition from some groups of small      businesses and inventors who claim the change would benefit      big corporations at their expense.       We disagree. The new law would make the process simpler and      cheaper. That should benefit the little guy.       Small inventors who needed time and money to fully develop      and test their ideas could request a provisional patent until      they were ready for a full filing. It costs $110. And because      it is easy to determine who filed a patent first, the new      system would better protect small inventors from challenges      by corporations with deep pockets, reducing the chance of      costly litigation.       Right now, proving who invented something first is      difficult and expensive. According to the patent office, it      costs $400,000 to $500,000 to challenge a patent on the      grounds of a prior invention. Most small inventors don't have      that kind of money. Big corporations do.       In fact, the current system mostly protects whoever files      first for a patent. Of the last three million applications      filed, only 113 were granted to entities who filed second but      proved they had invented first. In 88 of these cases, the      winners were large corporations.       The patent system is too cumbersome, and it doesn't protect      the small inventor. The America Invents Act is a smart      reform.
