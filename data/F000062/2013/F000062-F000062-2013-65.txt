 President, I rise today to recognize the dedicated career and service to the Congress and the Nation of Ms. Margaret ``Peggy'' Evans, who is retiring at the end of this month after over 22 years of service in both the executive and legislative branches of our government. She has dedicated most of her life to helping keep our Nation and its citizens secure, and we honor her for her service.  Peggy is leaving the Senate as the budget director of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. During her 4 years on the committee, Peggy has been integral to the development and passage of four annual intelligence authorizations bills, including three within a span of 15 months. She oversaw the committee's budget staff in drafting the classified annexes to the bills, worked collaboratively with the intelligence community agencies and the Office of Management and Budget, and negotiated legislation with other Senate and House committees.  Through her time with the committee, Peggy brought new and creative proposals to the committee and was a fierce advocate for programs that she believed would provide greater effectiveness or efficiency to the intelligence community. She also worked very closely with our committee's Technical Advisory Group, our science and technical advisors, especially in the group's review of imagery satellites, which will no doubt come to be seen as being ahead of its time.  Prior to coming to Capitol Hill, Ms. Evans had served 13 years at the Central Intelligence Agency. Reflecting her many skills, she worked in both the analysis and the operations side of the CIA and also led covert action programs. Although we may not disclose the details, Peggy spent much of her CIA career countering terrorist groups and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.  Her next national security assignment was in the White House Office of Management and Budget. During her 5 years in that job, Peggy rose from a budget examiner to be Acting Deputy Associate Director for National Security--the President's senior civil servant adviser on the national security budget.  During her time in the private sector, Peggy has also founded and led two companies, one that builds environmentally sustainable homes and one that provides environmental consulting services to homeowners, builders, and facilities managers. These companies earned numerous Energy Star and Green Home Choice Awards.  She is a renaissance woman, skilled in public and private life, and the committee wishes her continued success in her professional endeavors as she returns to private life.  But Peggy's devotion to the Nation's security is matched by her dedication to her family. Peggy and her husband Roger Ney have raised six children and guided them through college and into the start of their careers. With her retirement, she will have more time to spend with them and with her hobbies of reading, pottery, soccer, memorizing arcana from the ``Lord of the Rings,'' designing homes, and spending time at the beach.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to publicly thank Peggy and to note my appreciation for her dedicated and dignified efforts. We will miss your insight and experience and your commitment to pursuing the right policies to protect our Nation.                          ____________________
