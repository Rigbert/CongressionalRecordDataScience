 I am holding in my hand the energy bill we are debating. On at least four separate occasions now, we have had the chance to do something sensible for energy security and energy independence--to lessen our dependence on Mideastern oil. We had a chance to do it with the fuel efficiency of the trucks and cars that we want to drive in America for years to come, and we failed. The special interests won. We could have done it by improving and increasing the renewable fuels used across America that are environmentally friendly, which give us a chance toward independence. The special interests opposed us. We lost.  Now we see the battle that is being joined: Whether or not we are going to have full disclosure of these energy trades, whether we are going to have the kind of openness that Americans want. And the special interests oppose it.  I stand in complete support of the efforts of the Senator from California, and I thank her for her leadership.  I yield the floor.
