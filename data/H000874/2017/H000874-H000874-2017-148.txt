Speaker, I thank the majority leader for his observation.  I might say, if I can, the first year I was majority leader, which was in 2007, we passed all appropriations bills before the August break to the Senate, but I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee is moving forward, and let's hope that we can honor regular order.  Does the majority leader expect us to consider each of the bills that the gentleman refers to as having been passed through subcommittee, some through full committee? Do we expect to consider those discretely one at a time on the floor?  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, no decision has been made yet. Knowing that we are in a different situation with a new administration, there is an opportunity to do it differently but be able to make sure we take up all the bills. I will keep the gentleman notified of when decisions are made.
