 President, I join Vice Chairman Rockefeller in calling for the Senate to take up and pass the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007. As has been said already, this legislation is the primary way in which the Congress directs the Nation's 16 intelligence agencies.  In writing this legislation, the Committee worked closely with the Director of National Intelligence, or DNI, to identify new authorities needed to protect our national security. The bill authorizes a pilot program to allow intelligence agencies to better share information that could help uncover and thwart a terrorist; empowers the DNI to build information-sharing systems across the Federal Government; and creates a strong inspector general for the intelligence community.  The bill also requires the intelligence community to explain how it is complying with the Detainee Treatment Act and provide Congress with information on any ``alleged clandestine detention facilities'' that it may be operating and continues the process of intelligence reform begun in 2004.  It is not surprising that the creation of the DNI and major organizational changes across the Government's national security apparatus left some things undone. This Intelligence authorization bill makes a number of small but useful changes to allow the DNI and the Nation's 16 intelligence agencies to operate on a day-to-day basis more effectively.  These are a few of the important provisions in this legislation. But here I would like to focus on language in the bill that was adopted on a bipartisan basis at committee. The provisions, sections 304 and 307 of the bill, ensure that the congressional Intelligence Committees are fully informed of all intelligence activities.  The National Security Act of 1947 requires the President to ``ensure that the congressional intelligence committees are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the United States. . .''.  Even more than other committees, the Intelligence Committee relies on the executive branch to provide it with information. Without full and timely notification of intelligence programs, problems, and plans, the committee cannot judge whether agencies have adhered to the law, nor can we judge whether changes in authorities or resources are needed to better protect national security.  It was, in fact, Congress's lack of regular oversight that led to the creationof the Senate Intelligence Committee in 1976. Following the Church Committee's report on Executive abuses, the Senate established the Committee to ``provide vigilant legislative oversight over the intelligence activities of the United States to assure that such activities are in conformity with the Constitution and laws of the United States.''  Thirty years after the Senate Intelligence Committee was created, however, it is not living up to its charge. Members of the committee are not provided with sufficient information on intelligence programs and activities to legislate or oversee to intelligence community. Provisions in the stalled legislation--the Intelligence authorization bill--would fix this problem.  A good example of how the system fails to work is the so-called Terrorist Surveillance Program, which was publicly revealed last December but which had not previously been briefed to the committees.  According to the White House, this National Security Agency program was too sensitive to be briefed to the 15 Senators on the committee--the 15 Senators hand-selected by the majority and minority leaders for this assignment.  Instead, the President and Vice President decided to inform only 8 of the 535 Members of Congress: the party leadership in both houses and the leadership of the two intelligence committees.  The National Security Act does provide for limited briefings to these eight Members of Congress but only for especially sensitive covert actions. The NSA program is not a covert action.  The administration also points to statute saying that it must take ``due regard for the protection from unauthorized disclosure of classified information relating to sensitive intelligence sources and methods or other exceptionally sensitive matters. . .''  The 1980 Senate report accompanying this ``due regard'' provision explained this provision more directly--and makes clear that it does not allow the administration to restrict information from the committee indefinitely as was done with the Terrorist Surveillance Program.  The report recognized ``that in extremely rare circumstances a need to preserve essential secrecy may result in a decision not to impart certain sensitive aspects of operations or collection programs to the oversight committees in order to protect extremely sensitive intelligence sources and methods.''  The ``due regard'' language that the administration cites was intended, at most, to limit briefings on the most sensitive aspects of operations, in extremely rare circumstances. It was also expected that withholding this sensitive information would be a temporary measure. This language was not intended to conceal the existence of entire programs from all committee members.  So in effect, the White House has broadly interpreted the National Security Act to void meeting its responsibility to inform Congress.  This Intelligence authorization bill's changes to the National Security Act close the loopholes but, in fact, are far more generous to the executive branch than many would like. The bill acknowledges that there are times when not all Members have to be ``fully and currently'' briefed on all intelligence matters. However, in those cases, it requires that all committee members receive a summary of the intelligence collection or covert action in question.  This arrangement would allow the intelligence agencies to protect the most sensitive details of sources and methods, but crucially, it would allow the full committee to assess the legality, costs and benefits, and advisability of an intelligence operation.  The authorization bill also changes a definition in the National Security Act to make clear that the requirement to keep the committees ``fully and currently informed'' means that all Members will be kept informed. Congress has allowed the intelligence community to brief only the chairman and vice chairman on too many programs for too long.  I do not need to remind my colleagues that full committees, not a single Democrat and Republican, vote to authorize programs and funding. All Members must be informed if they are to perform their Constitutional duties.  The pending authorization bill would make one additional change to what it means for an intelligence activity to be authorized by Congress.  Stemming from the wiretapping abuses in the 1970s and because of the special challenges to conducting oversight of classified programs, the National Security Act prohibits the use of appropriated funds for any intelligence activities unless they are authorized by Congress. The pending bill would specify that an activity can only be ``authorized'' if the members of the authorizing committees have been fully briefed on it--or given a summary in the especially sensitive cases I described before.                          ____________________
