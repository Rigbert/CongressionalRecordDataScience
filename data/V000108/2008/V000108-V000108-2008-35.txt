John Diederich of Crown Point, Indiana. On Thursday, September 25, 2008, John will be honored by the Northwest Indiana Forum for his many years of service as a dedicated executive and his many contributions to the Northwest Indiana community. This extraordinary event will be taking place at Gamba's Ristorante in Merrillville, Indiana.  John Diederich has been a fixture in the banking industry in Northwest Indiana for the past thirty-four years. Following his collegiate studies, where he earned a degree in Accounting from Calumet College of Saint Joseph in Whiting, Indiana, and a degree in Finance from Saint Joseph's College in Rensselaer, Indiana, John entered the banking industry as a controller at Commercial Bank in Crown Point, Indiana. From there, he went on to serve as a commercial lender for Gainer Bank before being named its Division Manager for Commercial Lending in 1989. Mr. Diederich remained in this position until 1996, when he was named Manager of Private Banking and Investments for First Chicago NBD. Following a brief stint as Manager of Commercial Lending with Bank One, he was named Regional President of Bank One in 2000, and remained in that role with JPMorgan for the last eight years.  Throughout the years, John Diederich has become known just as much for his contributions to his community as to the banking industry. One of the most giving and selfless individuals I have ever had the pleasure of knowing, John has dedicated much of his time focusing on the development of the economy in Northwest Indiana, most notably as a past chairman of the Managing Board of Directors for the Northwest Indiana Forum and as a founding member and past president of the Regional Development Company. John has also volunteered much of his free time working with organizations that help children in hiscommunity. He serves or has served in various capacities on the boards for numerous organizations, including: the Boys and Girls Club of Northwest Indiana, where he is a past chairman of the board, the Southlake YMCA, for which he is a past president, the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, Trade Winds, the Crown Point Community Foundation, the Diocese of Gary, and the Crisis Center in Gary, Indiana, where he currently serves as its chairman of the board.  While John has always been committed to his work and has remained active in the Northwest Indiana community, his greatest enjoyment is the time spent with his beautiful family. He and his wife, Louise, have one daughter, Lisa, a graduate of Butler University, and one son, Brian, who currently attends the University of Dayton.  Madam Speaker, at this time, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in commending Mr. John Diederich as he is honored for his lifetime of service and dedication to the Northwest Indiana community. His years of service have touched and improved the lives of all whom he has served. His unselfish and lifelong dedication is worthy of the highest commendation, and I am proud to represent him in Congress.                          ____________________
