 Speaker, I am delighted that the House passed an amendment that I offered yesterday demanding that Ngawang Choephel, a young Tibetan who studied music at Middlebury College in Vermont, be released immediately from a Chinese jail where he is being held on trumped up charges.  Unfortunately, however, Ngawang Choephel is not alone as a political prisoner in China. In fact, there are large numbers of them. According to the U.S. State Department's own human rights report released earlier this year:       All public dissent against the party and government was      effectively silenced by intimidation, exile, and the      imposition of prison terms. No dissidents were known to be      active at year's end.  Mr. Speaker, Congress should not be supporting most-favored-nation status with China when that country has absolutely no respect for civil liberties. Congress should not be supporting most-favored-nation status with China when we have a $39 billion trade deficit with them and when corporate America is throwing American workers out on the street as they move factories to China and hire workers there for 20 or 30 cents an hour.  Let us say yes to the freedom of Ngawang Choephel and no to MFN with China.                          ____________________
