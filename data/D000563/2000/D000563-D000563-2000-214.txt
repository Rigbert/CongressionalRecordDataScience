President, I just listened carefully to my colleague from Oklahoma correcting the press, and of course I would join him on many days in that effort. As a public figure, I am often quoted enough and read things that I think are a little bit different than what I believe are the facts. I would say in this instance perhaps his characterization of the information presented by the Washington Post at least deserves to be discussed for a moment. He made reference to the Citizens for Tax Justice, a group with which I have worked. He referred to them as, I believe, a left wing or left leaning group. His characterization is his own and he is entitled to it. But I suggest to the Senator from Oklahoma and to anyone who is following this matter, when we assess how much it will cost for the so-called marriage penalty tax relief, we usually make assessments on a 10-year basis. Though the bill may say 5 years, it really strains credulity to suggest at the end of 5 years we are going to reimpose the tax once we have taken it off.
