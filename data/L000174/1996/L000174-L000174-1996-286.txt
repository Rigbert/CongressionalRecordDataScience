President, yesterday the Senate gave final passage to the 1996 farm bill. With House action, the bill will be sent to President Clinton who is expected to sign it.  The farm bill contains many important environmental and conservation provisions. One of these provides for the spending of up to $300 million by the Secretary of the Interior to help restore the Florida Everglades. This rapid and significant infusion of funds--$200 million of which will be available in less than 100 days--is a critical first step to implement the administration's ambitious $1.5 billion proposal to save one of the world's most unique ecosystems. The farm bill conferees intend that this national treasure receive immediate attention.  Prior to the 1940's the Everglades ecosystem covered most of south Florida, from its headwaters in the Kissimmee River basin to the coral reefs of Florida Bay. Because of man's alterations, the once ``river of grass'' is now fragmented and deteriorating, threatening not only the wildlife of the ecosystem, but also the water supply, economy, and quality of life for the people who live in Florida.  Throughout the system, clean, fresh water has been replaced by murky, nutrient-laden water that does not support native plant and animal species. Years of water diversion and pollutants have degraded not only the Everglades, but also Florida Bay, one of the most important estuaries and fisheries in America. The bay is suffering from a lack of fresh water that had led to algal blooms and contributed to the extinction of North America's only native coral reef. As a consequence, this once teeming estuary now is closed to commercial fishing, and the tourism industry of the region is threatened.  We must not let the Everglades die. Although the decline of the ecosystem continues, it is reversible.  To speed the Everglades restoration, the farm bill conferees created a $200 million entitlement, to be available in less than 100 days, for this important project. The conferees also approved an additional $100 million of spending for Everglades restoration which will come from the sale of surplus Federal lands in Florida that have not been set aside for conservation purposes or are not environmentally sensitive.  To have the maximum impact on Everglades restoration, the conferees intend that funds provided for in this legislation be used in priority areas. Prior to acceptance of the Everglades provisions, discussions among conferees focused on the importance of acquiring and restoring land in the Everglades Agricultural Area. The conferees expected that the Secretary of the Interior would give priority to acquiring and restoring lands within the Everglades Agricultural Area, including the Talisman tract, in order to make those lands available for water storage and delivery. Both the House and Senate bills used identical language to make this point as well:       The Secretary of the Interior * * * shall use the funds to      conduct restoration activities in the Everglades ecosystem      which may include acquiring private acreage in the Everglades      Agricultural Area including approximately 52,000 acres that      is commonly known as the Talisman tract.  At the meeting of conferees, I pointed out that the greatest need for restoration is in the over 130,000 acres of the Everglades Agricultural Area which includes much of the land that makes up the Talisman tract. I intend to monitor this issue closely to make certain that the funds are properly spent.  This small down payment will be insufficient for total restoration. It is only part of the Federal Government's share of this coordinated restoration effort. More important, it in no way relieves others--particularly the sugarcane industry that has benefited from the alteration of the system and continues to pollute it--of its obligation to contribute to restoration costs.  Senator Lugar and I have proposed that Florida sugar producers contribute for restoration purposes a 2-cent per pound assessment on sugar grown in the Everglades. The administration supports a 1-cent assessment. These proposals have widespread support in Florida.  On March 25, Mary Barley, chair of the citizens group, Save Our Everglades, announced the launching of a ballot initiative to protect and restore the Everglades. She said that ``we are facing a crisis and time is running out.'' In proposing a ``Penny for the Everglades,'' Mrs. Barley spoke eloquently about her late husband, George, who devoted the last years of his life to restoring this national treasure.  At that announcement, Mary quoted George who had said:       Long after we are gone, the Everglades ecosystem will be      our legacy--to our children and the rest of the nation.  George Barley was right then and Mary Barley is right today. Congress and the administration must follow their lead and require sugar growers in the region to pay their fair share to restore the Everglades.                          ____________________
