President, my understanding is that puts us in exactly the same position as we had with Senator Salazar. I would like to make the same offer to the distinguished chair of the committee, because I would very much like to respond positively to his request, if we can work with the staffs to propound a parliamentary request to deal with what the chairman, the Senator from New Mexico, has asked. I would very much like to do it. Perhaps we can get our staffs together and perhaps work it out.
