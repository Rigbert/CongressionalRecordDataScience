President, I recently returned from a short visit to Ireland, Northern Ireland, and London, England, where I met with government officials and representatives of the political parties in Northern Ireland, on developments in the peace process there. This is an exciting time in Northern Ireland, where a ceasefire is holding for the first time in a quarter century. I ask that the report of my trip be printed in the Record.  The report follows:   Codel Leahy--Trip Report, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland,                         England, February 17-21       From February 17-21, I traveled to the Republic of Ireland,      Northern Ireland, and London, England, to meet with leaders      of Irish and British Governments and representatives of the      political parties in Northern Ireland, and to observe the use      of funds administered by the International Fund for Ireland      (IFI). In London, in addition to meeting with British and      American officials on developments in Northern Ireland, I      also discussed efforts to limit the proliferation and use of      antipersonnel landmines. I was accompanied by Tim Rieser and      Kevin McDonald of my personal staff. Travel was by commercial      air and rental car.                              introduction       I have closely followed the situation in Northern Ireland      for many years. I was among those who last year urged      President Clinton to grant Gerry Adams, leader of Sinn Fein,      the political arm of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), a visa      to travel to the US. That decision is widely credited with      having led to the IRA ceasefire and the peace process that is      now unfolding.       The timing of this trip was important because of      developments in Northern Ireland since the December 1993      Joint Declaration between former Irish Prime Minister      Reynolds and British Prime Minister Majors. That Declaration      initiated the latest attempt to resolve the Northern Ireland      conflict which has claimed over 3,200 lives in the past 25      years. Most importantly, the two leaders agreed that any      change in the status of the North could only occur with the      consent of a majority of the people there.       In August 1994, shortly after Gerry Adams received a visa      to visit the US, the IRA announced a unilateral cease-fire      which led to October cease-fires by Protestant paramilitary      groups. Since then, informal talks have been conducted      between the Irish Government and Sinn Fein. I arrived in the      Republic just six days before the publication of a      controversial ``Framework Document,'' which contains      proposals put forth jointly by Irish and British Governments      aimed at bringing about a permanent settlement of the      conflict.                                 dublin       Meeting with Tainiste Dick Spring: I arrived in Dublin on      February 17. Senator George Mitchell, who last December was      appointed the President's Special Advisor on Economic      Initiatives in Ireland, was also in Dublin that day      accompanied by a delegation of officials from the White House      and Commerce Department, and our two delegations met over      lunch with Tainiste Dick Spring. Our discussions focused on      the Framework Document, which Tainiste Spring has had a      central role in negotiating, and plans for the May 1995 Trade      and Investment Conference.       Representatives of the Irish and American business      communities, and the political parties, will meet in      Washington over a three day period to discuss potential      American-Irish joint ventures and other investment      opportunities in the Republic and Northern Ireland.       There is universal agreement among all factions that      economic development, especially in areas of high      unemployment in the North, is key to any lasting peace since      there is a direct correlation between high levels of      unemployment and violence. There is also widespread      recognition of the crucial role that the United States can      play in promoting economic investment. Four areas with high      potential have already been identified: tourism, food      processing; pharmaceuticals; and telecommunications.       Senator Mitchell, after quoting President Franklin      Roosevelt that ``the best social program is a job,'' stressed      that this is to be an economic conference, not a political      conference, although it is inevitable that politics will play      a part. Ireland has much to recommend it, including its      highly trained, English-speaking workforce and location at      the gateway to 350 million European consumers. Setting up      follow-up mechanisms to assist potential investors will be      particularly important. Senator Mitchell and I stressed that      while the U.S. can help facilitate investment in Northern      Ireland, this is a long-term endeavor which depends on the      sustained efforts of all the people on the island.       There was also a general discussion about the important      role the International Fund for Ireland has played in      bringing economic development to disadvantaged areas during a      period when the Northern Ireland violence caused many      potential investors to go elsewhere.       Address to peace and Reconciliation Forum: Shortly after      the IRA cease-fire, the Irish Government initiated a ``Peace      and Reconciliation Forum'' as a way to quickly bring Sinn      Fein into informal discussions with the government and other      political parties. Although the Unionist parties complained      that the Forum was an Irish Government affair and declined to      participate, the Forum has provided a bridge between the      cease-fire and formal all-party talks which are anticipated      in the future.       Senator Mitchell and I were each invited to address the      Forum, which is held each Friday at Dublin Castle. Among the      audience of approximately two hundred were Tainiste Spring of      the Irish Government, Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein, and John      Alderdice of the Alliance Party. After introductions by Forum      Chair Judge Catherine McGinness and Ambassador Jean Kennedy      Smith, I explained that I had come at this pivotal time to      give encouragement to all the parties involved in the peace      process, and to emphasize that the United States would fully      support their efforts in an even-handed way. I stressed that      the Framework Document, portions of which had been leaked to      the press and were already the focus of much debate and      intense criticism from Unionists, should be treated as a      discussion document rather than a final blueprint. I said      that as long as it was based on the principle of consent, it      should threaten no one.       Senator Mitchell, who was in the final day of his visit,      described the strong desire he had sensed among the people      for a better life and the importance of moving quickly to      attract economic investment. He noted that the majority of      the 44 million Irish immigrants in the U.S. are non-     Catholics, and that economic hardship in Northern Ireland is      felt by both Catholics and Protestants. He mentioned several      items that will be on the May conference agenda, including:      establishment of U.S.-owned plants; support for community      banking; tax free regimes for U.S. investors; duty free      status for Irish imports; addressing the problem of under-     represented      [[Page S4744]] communities in the workforce; the problem of      dual currencies in North an South; and the MacBride      principles.       Our speeches were followed by a general discussion among      the participants, which included several appreciative      comments about the important role of the United States in      moving the peace process forward.       Meeting with Taoiseach John Bruton: Although there was some      initial speculation in the press that Taoiseach Bruton might      not be as seized with the peace process as his predecessor,      he has won praise for keeping the process moving steadily      forward. Senator Mitchell and I met privately with the      Taoiseach for approximately 45 minutes. We discussed the      Framework Document and events leading up to it, and how he      thought it would be received. We also emphasized President      Clinton's strong, personal interest in the peace process and      the importance of pressing ahead despite Unionist threats to      boycott the talks.       Dinner hosted by Ambassador Smith: A dinner hosted by the      Ambassador included Judge Catherine McGinness, Senator      Maurice Manning, Reverend Roy Magee, and Dr. Martin Mansergh,      all of whom have had a role in the peace process. I discussed      the British Government's demand that the IRA decommission      some of its weapons before Sinn Fein is rewarded with a seat      at the negotiating table. The general view was that Prime      Minister Major has backed away from this position somewhat,      recognizing that the IRA is unlikely to respond favorably at      this point and that it would be a mistake to link further      progress in the peace talks to this single issue. The point      was made that turning over weapons by one side has never      happened in Irish history, and that the aim should be to keep      the dialogue moving forward. The issue of disarmament by all      parties will be dealt with in the process of the talks.      (Since my return, Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, in response      to President Clinton's decision to permit him to raise      funds in the United States, agreed to discuss the issue of      disarmament with the British Government at the ministerial      level. Although the President's decision was criticized by      British officials, I am hopeful that it will lead to      further progress towards peace which would be to      everyone's advantage.)       The Northern Ireland conflict has been winding down since      about 1989. The IRA concluded that violence was accomplishing      very little, and that the political process might offer more.      On the other hand, the Unionists, lacking imaginative and      dynamic leadership, have lost touch with the people, who      desperately want peace. But while the war is over, the guns      are not going to be relinquished immediately. As the British      move their troops out, the IRA and Protestant paramilitary      groups will surrender their weapons incrementally as further      progress is made towards a final peace agreement. It was also      suggested that the British Government exaggerated the amount      of weapons possessed by the IRA to suit their own ends, and      it also coincidently benefitted the IRA. Now it is a problem      for both, and there is no way to prove how many weapons they      have. Giving up a small amount of semtex to a third party      such as the United Nations or the United States, as I and      others have suggested, would be a positive gesture that could      help build confidence.       Meeting with former Taoiseach Albert Reynolds: Without the      forceful leadership of former Taoiseach Reynolds it is      doubtful that there would be a cease-fire or peace process      today. Reynolds told me that the Unionists, who claim they      were not consulted on the text of the Framework Document, had      significant input into the 1993 Joint Declaration. Reynolds      said it was his idea to replace Article 3 of the Irish      Constitution, which contains Britain's claim of sovereignty      over Northern Ireland, with the principle of consent. The aim      was to shift responsibility for the status of the North to a      majority of the people there. This was a crucial initiative      that has become the cornerstone of the Framework Document.       Reynolds described the future as unpredictable. The      demographics of the North are changing. Today, 57 percent are      Protestant, down from 63 percent a decade ago. In another      generation the majority may be Catholic. But not all      Catholics want to be part of the Republic.       Reynolds said that both sides accept the reality that the      weapons will have to be surrendered, but it will take time.      As the process develops it will become less of an issue. He      said the IRA will never turn over their weapons to the      British, since it would imply surrender. It will have to be      to a third party. Reynolds said United States support for the      peace process has been critical. He said the decision to      grant Adams a visa was what led to the cease-fire, but that      there was no way Adams would or could renounce terrorism at      that time and that anyone who thought so was naive. He agreed      with the view that the Unionist leadership is out of touch.      They never thought a cease-fire would happen, and in the      unlikely event that it did they assumed it would be short-     lived. They have not thought about what they would do in the      absence of violence, and were unprepared for the situation      they now find themselves in.                                belfast       The trip from Dublin to Belfast was notable for the      dramatic change that has occurred at the border, where just      six months ago a British military checkpoint slowed traffic      to a crawl and subjected travelers to close scrutiny by armed      soldiers and searches of any suspicious vehicles. Today, the      checkpoint is unmanned and vehicles pass through without      delay. Although British military observation posts still      protrude from the tops of hills, the military presence      generally is far from what it was. In Belfast, where armored      troop carriers and helmeted troops regularly patrolled the      streets in large numbers, daytime patrols there have ended.      British troops now wear berets instead of helmets.       The reduced British military presence in Northern Ireland      has won wide acclaim from Catholics. However, the day before      I arrived in Northern Ireland heavily armed British troops      conducted a raid in the IRA-stronghold are of Crossmaglen      near the border, which drew strong criticism from Sinn Fein      as well as Irish Government officials, who felt that the eve      of publication of the Framework Document was a time for both      sides to show restraint.       Dairy Farm IFI Project: Shortly after arriving in Belfast I      toured the `Dairy Farm'' shopping center with International      Fund for Ireland Chairman Willie McCarter, and IFI Joint      Directors General Chris Todd and Brendan Scannell. The      center, located in a Catholic area of West Belfast, is a      community-owned project developed with $3.8 million from the      IFI. It includes a retail complex with a large supermarket,      multi-purpose civic center, library, retail units, and      service businesses that have brought life to a depressed      community that lacked any of these facilities.       In later meetings with IFI officials, I discussed past      management problems with the Fund and reports that the House      and Senate Budget Committees have proposed to eliminate      United States funding for the IFI in FY 1996. They assured me      that the IFI is no longer financing golf courses and other      kinds of projects that drew past criticism, including from      myself. It targets disadvantaged communities, Catholic and      Protestant, in the North and in border counties in the      Republic. Since its inception a decade ago, the IFI, with      total contributions of about $400 million from the US and the      European Community, has leveraged twice that amount in      private sector investment. These funds have      been used to support economic regeneration projects in some      300 communities.       I pointed out that whether or not there is an earmark for      the IFI in the foreign aid appropriation, the President has      said he will provide a $30 million contribution to it in each      of FY 1996 and FY 1997, a $10 million increase from FY 1995.      IFI officials, and indeed everyone I spoke to in Dublin,      Belfast and London concerned with the situation in Northern      Ireland, argued persuasively that continued United States      funding is an important measure of its support for the peace      process.       Comber Orange Lodge: In preparation for my visit to      Northern Ireland, I requested the opportunity to speak to a      Unionist audience. Arrangements were made for me to address      the Orange Order in Comber, a middle-class community near      Belfast. The Orange Order is the oldest and largest      Protestant organization in Northern Ireland, with over 80,000      active members, and some 4,000 members in the Republic. They      regard themselves as British subjects and are intensely pro-     Unionist.       My purpose in addressing the Orange Order was, as an Irish      American Catholic, to attempt to counter the impression that      the United States Government, and especially Irish American      Catholics like myself, seek a particular outcome in the      North. I stressed that the United States has one goal only,      peace, and that it will support the peace process even-     handedly. I expressed support for the principle that the      status of the North should not change without the consent of      a majority of its people. I also stressed the importance of      protecting the civil rights of all people, majority and      minority.       Several people in the audience vigorously criticized the      Framework Document. I responded that rather than reject a      document that has not yet been published, they should look      towards bringing their ideas and concerns to the negotiating      table and to treat the Framework for what it is, a discussion      paper rather than a final settlement.       Unionists fear that the British Government's real purpose      in seeking a resolution to the Northern Ireland conflict is      to abandon them, and they see the United States as part of a      pro-Nationalist plot. They fear being isolated--foresaken by      Britain and unwilling to become Irish. Lacking dynamic and      imaginative leadership, they are at risk of history passing      them by. Many long for a past that never was, dream of a      future that never would be, and they fear a present they do      not understand.       Members of the Comber Orange Lodge were impassioned, but      respectful. They claimed to support tolerance and jobs for      all people, and pointed out that many Protestants are as bad      off as Catholics. Several complained about not being able to      interest the US media in their cause, although they refuse      the press access to their own meetings.       Meeting with Gerry Adams: I spent about an hour with Gerry      Adams. I commended the efforts he, John Hume and Albert      Reynolds have made to seize this opportunity for peace. We      discussed Adams' request to raise funds in the United States,      which at the time was under consideration by the Clinton      Administration. He felt that British opposition to it was      nothing more than an effort to control the peace talks, since      it is even inconsistent with their own policy of letting him      raise funds there. He added that Sinn      [[Page S4745]] Fein can already raise funds in the United      States, only he and certain other leaders are banned from      doing so. I told him that the fundraising issue is an issue      primarily because the British have made it one.       Adams said the United States contribution to the IFI      enables the Administration and the Congress to speak with      credibility on the peace process. He added that the Catholics      were organized and ready to make proposals to the Fund,      unlike the Protestants, but that Protestant leaders have      since been impressed by the Fund's accomplishments.       Adams raised the case of an IRA prisoner in Tucson,      Arizona, who is charged with buying explosive detonators. He      expressed concern about the conditions of his imprisonment.       Meeting with West Belfast Catholics: On Sunday morning,      after meeting with Sister Mary Turley and Father Myles      Kavanaugh of the Flax Trust, which like the IFI funds      projects in disadvantaged neighborhoods in Belfast, I met      with a group of Catholic community workers in West Belfast.      Geraldine McAteer, the spokesperson for the group, explained      that they work in both Catholic and Protestant neighborhoods.      She said there was a great desire for peace, and that with      the ceasefire they were finally able to stop living in fear      of seeing their children beaten or killed. She said people of      both traditions want equal social and cultural rights. She      emphasized the importance of equal self-esteem. She said      Unionists should be able to act British if they choose, and      Nationalists should be able to act and feel Irish. She said      there is room on the island for both, and that both have much      in common.       We talked about why there was a sense that this time the      conflict might really be over. They said that working class      Protestants have come to recognize that although they always      thought being tied to Britain would make them better off, it      has not turned out that way. Their kids are doing worse in      school than Catholics. They said the Unionists need to learn      to fend for themselves, because the government is not going      to do it for them. Catholics realized that a long time ago.       They said the Unionists fear that a united Irish Catholic      majority would mistreat them as they have mistreated the      Catholic minority in the North. At the same time, when they      as Catholics imagine a united Ireland, they become concerned      about being part of a religious state. They favor separation      between church and state, and the right of all to worship as      they please.       Ms. McAteer mentioned the planned construction of a public      university on land within their community, funded in part      with K5 million from the IFI. She expressed support for the      project because of the economic benefits it will bring, but      concern that too little has been done to involve community      members in the planning of the project. She fears that many      of the high paying jobs will go to outsiders, and local      people will be left only the menial jobs. I later conveyed      her concern to IFI Chairman Willie McCarter.                                 london       Meeting with Ambassador William Crowe and Under Secretary      Peter Tarnoff: At an evening meeting with Ambassador Crowe      and Under Secretary Tarnoff, we discussed a wide range of      issues including Northern Ireland and the problem of the      proliferation of antipersonnel landmines. The issue of Gerry      Adams' request to raise funds in the United States came up,      and the Ambassador expressed concern that the IRA has done      nothing since the cease-fire to enhance confidence in its      commitment to peace. Ambassador Crowe also expressed concern      about the landmine problem and described some of his own      experiences with landmines in combat.       Meeting with Under Secretary Sir Timothy Daunt: I met for      approximately 90 minutes with Under Secretary Daunt and three      members of his staff on funding for UN peacekeeping      operations, international efforts to stop the proliferation      and use of antipersonnel landmines, and developments in      Northern Ireland.       Sir Timothy and his staff expressed alarm at proposals      under consideration in Congress which would have the effect      of drastically reducing United States funding for UN      peacekeeping operations. They specifically mentioned      legislation that would apply the cost of in-kind      contributions, such as transport costs and materiel, towards      UN assessments. They said the effect of this, if applied to      Britain, would be that the UN would owe Britain hundreds of      millions of dollars it does not have and UN peacekeeping      would quickly end. The logical results would be greater      direct United States military involvement in regional      peacekeeping activities. I told them that I agreed that these      proposals are misguided, and that what is needed is a      permanent UN logistical force that can respond to      humanitarian crises without unnecessary delay.       On the subject of landmines, Sir Timothy said that Britain      and the US are near agreement on a comprehensive agreement      (``control regime'') on the production, use and transfer of      antipersonnel landmines. He said Britain accepts elimination      of antipersonnel landmines as the final goal. They favor      restructuring landmine stockpiles in favor of mines that      self-destruct or deactivate within 48-72 hours, if they are      not in marked and guarded minefields.       I explained the problems posed by such an approach, namely,      that they do not always self-destruct and that it assures the      continued use of non-self-destruct mines by countries that      cannot afford the more expensive alternative. Sir Timothy      said that while Britain recognizes these arguments, which are      also put forward by certain Members of Parliament and      nongovernmental organizations, the government continues to      regard landmines as a legitimate and necessary weapon. He      said that in the future there may be alternatives and changes      in military strategy, but that elimination of these weapons      is not feasible in the short or medium term. He added that      the British military believes they can assure a failure rate      of self-destruct mines of not more than 1/1000. I said that      while the United States and British Governments can say they      will use only self-destruct mines, Third World governments      will be unmoved. They are not going to declare war against      either of our countries, but they are going to keep using      them against their own people and their neighbors.       The British officials expressed concern that insurgent      groups would not comply with a complete ban on antipersonnel      mines. I said that while there will always be some who ignore      a ban, if the use of landmines is treated as a war crime they      will be rarely used. This is what we have seen with chemical      weapons. Sir Timothy said they are afraid to take an ``all or      nothing approach'' that could jeopardize support in the Third      World for less drastic measures. I pointed out that the      approach being advanced involves an elaborate, largely      unenforceable scheme that will not solve the problem.       The subject of demining was discussed. I was told that      Britain has contributed K7 million towards this effort, and      that 67 British troops are involved in training deminers in      Cambodia. While this is important, all agreed it was a far      cry from what is needed.       Finally, we discussed the Northern Ireland situation. Sir      Timothy spoke of the strong sense of alienation felt by      Unionists in the North. He said the overwhelming majority of      people in Britain want to get out, but they also have a sense      of responsibility that is reflected in the K4.5 billion in      aid Britain sends to Northern Ireland annually.       Meeting with Member of Parliament Paul Murphy: Paul Murphy      is      the Labour Party's chief spokesman on Northern Ireland. He      began the meeting by describing his contacts with leaders      of Sinn Fein, who he said are skillful and well-informed,      if somewhat unsure of how to proceed. They clearly want to      get back into the political process, and are anxious to be      treated as politicians although they control only 8-12      percent of the vote. He said Sinn Fein is a growing      political threat to John Hume's Social Democratic and      Labour Party. He said he is encouraged that Protestant      gunmen have also spoken about the need to solve social      problems. The armed groups have become used to peace, to      being able to walk around without fear. He believes that      anyone who threatens that will be harshly criticized.       I told Murphy that I was very impressed with Prime Minister      Major's leadership on the Northern Ireland issue, and Murphy      confirmed that the British Labour Party fully supports the      British government's policy. He said both have strong      Unionists in their ranks, but agree on the principles in the      Framework Document. He added that there may be some      disagreement over the pace of moving ahead. He said the      Ulster Unionist Party is facing a successionist vote, and      that it's current head, James Molyneaux, may resign in favor      of David Trimble who has been a vocal opponent of the      Framework. He said no Unionist can embrace any kind of ``all      Ireland'' structures, although the obvious and intelligent      solution is to have one approach in such areas as energy,      tourism, trade, and agriculture. He said he understands the      Unionists' fear of being absorbed into a theocracy, but      questioned why they are so upset when they know the Framework      enshrines the principle of consent and they constitute a      majority. He said the Unionists will complain about the      Framework but they will be under considerable pressure from      their constituents, who want peace, to join the process.       We discussed the issue of Gerry Adams' request to raise      funds in the United States. Murphy said he has no objection      to this as long as the proceeds are not used to buy weapons.      We also discussed the need for reform of the Royal Ulster      Constabulary, the Protestant police force in Belfast which is      hated and feared by Catholics. Murphy said that any Catholic      who joined the RUC would be killed. Sinn Fein favors      disbanding the RUC and creating a new, united police force      for the whole island.       Meeting with Minister of State Tony Baldry: Minister      Baldry's portfolio includes North America, foreign      assistance, and international counternarcotics programs. We      discussed recent changes in the Congress, and the need for      more interaction between legislators from our two countries.      We also discussed Northern Ireland, and the use of the      British Virgin Islands as a transhipment point by narcotics      traffickers.                              conclusions       The single most compelling message I heard from the people      of the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland was that they are      done with violence, and that anyone who returns to violence      would be condemned by a majority of people of both      traditions. I could feel an intense desire on the island to      find a way for both Catholics and Protestants to coexist.      However, I also sensed that some Unionists, who have      willingly seen themselves as British subjects their whole      lives, are so      [[Page S4746]] fearful that their way of life is coming to an      end that they could ignite renewed violence if they are not      reassured otherwise.       Despite this danger, I was very impressed with the momentum      the peace process has gained. The visionary leadership of      John Hume coupled with the courageous decision of British      Prime Minister Major, former Irish Prime Minister Reynolds,      and Prime Minister Bruton, to seize this opportunity, have      constructed a process that I am optimistic will lead to      lasting peace.       The much-anticipated Framework Document was published the      day after I arrived back in Washington, where it was very      well received. Since then, President Clinton has agreed to      permit Gerry Adams to raise funds in the United States, and      Adams responded by declaring his readiness to discuss the      decommissioning of arms with the British Government. The      British Government reciprocated by withdrawing 400 of its      troops from Northern Ireland. Ministerial level talks between      Britain and Sinn Fein are expected soon. I believe this is      crucial to reassuring Unionists that they will not be left      defenseless to a renewed IRA threat.       The role of the United States in this effort cannot be      overstated. After a somewhat inauspicious beginning, the      International Fund for Ireland has served a vital role in      creating jobs--29,000 at last count, and bringing hope to      hundreds of the most depressed communities, both Catholic and      Protestant, in Northern Ireland and the border countries of      the Republic. The IFI is clearly a short-term solution. If      peace takes hold, private investment should replace the IFI      as the engine of economic development within two or three      years. Until then, the IFI is an important symbol of U.S.      support for the peace process and a tangible way to support      that process during this fragile period.       In addition, President Clinton's willingness to take      political risks that the Irish and British Governments were      either unwilling or unable to take themselves, has made an      enormous difference. My hope is that my reinforcing his      message in Dublin, Belfast and London I was able to give some      added impetus towards lasting peace in the land of my      father's father.                               ____________________
