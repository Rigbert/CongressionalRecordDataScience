Speaker, it is my sincerest pleasure to commend an outstanding leader of Indiana's First Congressional District, Monsignor Joseph F. Semancik. On Sunday, June 28, 1998, Monsignor Semancik will be honored by the Midwest Slovak Cultural Society during their annual Slovak Day Celebration. In honor of Monsignor Semancik's announced retirement, Sunday, June 28, 1998 has been designated as ``Monsignor Semancik Day.'' This highly anticipated event, in its twenty-fifth year, is a cultural celebration combining the best of religious, civic, and ethnic entertainment. Awarding this high honor to Monsignor Semancik clearly shows how valuable and indispensable he has been for the residents of Northwest Indiana, the Catholic Charities of the Gary Diocese, and all the people he has touched through the service of God.  On Thursday, October 1, 1998, Monsignor Semancik will officially retire as the Director of Catholic Charities. Since he finished his master's degree in social work from Loyola University, Monsignor Semancik has spent the last thirty-eight years serving the Northwest Indiana Catholic community as one of the region's most accessible, compassionate, and dedicated spiritual leaders and social advocates. In 1958, Monsignor Semancik was directed by Bishop Andrew G. Grutka to study social work. Though spending most of his time helping others, Monsignor Semancik advanced his own learning by earning a master's degree from Loyola University in 1960 and a doctorate from the University of Chicago in 1977. Driven by his compassion, desire to help people, and education, he spearheaded the efforts that led Catholic Charities to become the great helping organization that it is today. During his long tenure as Director of Catholic Charities, his service on the Lake County Economic Opportunity Council, and the Lake County Community Development Committee, as well as his successful efforts in establishing the Indiana Catholic Conference, Monsignor Semancik has truly earned the love, respect, and admiration of everyone in Indiana's First Congressional District.  Though Monsignor Semancik, at sixty-nine years of age, will soon retire from his position with Catholic Charities, he will maintain his position as Pastor of Sacred Heart Church in East Chicago, Indiana. As well, he will continue one of his lifelong passions: writing. Currently, Monsignor Semancik is planning to write a history of the Catholic Charities in the Diocese of Gary. He also plans to continue his long-standing tradition of researching and writing about Catholic Charities directors. These works, when completed, will go along with the work that he completed on the history of Slovaks in Indiana.  Mr. Speaker, America is made a better place because of the tireless and unselfish service of her citizens. Monsignor Joseph Semancik is a man who has dedicated his entire life to helping those around him, resolutely working to aid the unfortunate and needy, and serving as an upright pillar of morality and conscience. In so doing, he has strengthened his community, Northwest Indiana, and whole of our country and society. I ask you, and my other distinguished colleagues, to join me in commending Monsignor Semancik for his lifetime of remarkable accomplishments, enduring service, and the unforgettable effect he has had on the people of his community.                          ____________________
