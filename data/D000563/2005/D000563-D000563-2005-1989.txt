President, pursuant to unanimous consent, on the next amendment you should keep in mind Kenneth Lay who, on the road to bankruptcy, took $200 million out of Enron. Bernie Ebbers took $366 million in personal loans out of WorldCom, and John Rigas took $2.3 billion in loans for a golf course--driving the companies into bankruptcy at the expense of the stockholders, employees, and retirees. This amendment reaches back and brings that money to the people who need it. It also gives a claim in bankruptcy for the pension rights that are extinguished in bankruptcy. I ask for Members' support.
