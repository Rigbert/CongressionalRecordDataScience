 President, when I think of Iowa, I envision lush, rolling hills; wide, blue skies; and rich, black soil. Located in the heartland of America, Iowa's bounteous fields and streams feed the world. I'm sure most people across the country and throughout the world associate my State with its exceptional agricultural products and productive farmland.  But today, I am going to share with America a different chapter of the Iowa story. Perhaps one that many already have read about or seen on the Big Screen--and that is, Iowa's contributions to film making and the performing arts. A handful of our Iowa-born friends have risen to celebrity status on TV, on the silver screen, and on stage.  To name a few--singer Andy Williams was born in Wall Lake; the Everly Brothers, Don and Phil lived in Shenandoah; Cloris Leachman, who played Phyllis on ``The Mary Tyler Moore Show,'' hails from Des Moines, as did Harriett Nelson of the television series, ``The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriett.'' Marion Michael Morrison, better known as John Wayne, was born in Winterset. The famous musician/composer, Glenn Miller came from Clarinda. And who can ever forget the memorable sounds of the ``Music Man,'' Meridith Wilson is from Mason City. And, last but not least, Mr. President, internationally-acclaimed opera singer, Simon Estes, was born in Centerville, IA.  In addition to the talents of Iowa's hometown celebrities, my State has opened its doors to reveal our scenic countryside to Hollywood film makers. Box office hits filmed in Iowa include, ``Field of Dreams,'' ``The Bridges of Madison County,'' and ``Twister.'' The movie ``Bridges'' was adapted from the novel written by my fellow Iowan, Robert Waller. If asked, Mr. President, I would have to concur with a popular scene from the movie ``Field of Dreams,'' filmed in eastern Iowa near Dyersville. That scene included the lines--``Is this Heaven? No, it's Iowa.''  Mr. President, the list of Iowa-born celebrities includes a hometown girl who never forgot where she came from. The oldest of five children, Donna Belle Mullenger, attended a one room school house and helped with the family chores on a western Iowa farm near Denison. Growing up on a farm, Donna cherished the rare Saturday trips to town, when she would meet friends at the Candy Kitchen and catch a movie at the Ritz Theater.  This girl-next-door later became a household name and Hollywood star. Donna Reed starred in more than 40 films, including such classics as ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' ``Portrait of Dorian Gray,'' and her Oscar-winning performance in ``From Here to Eternity.'' And for 8 years, Donna Reed entertained families in their living rooms across America. ``The Donna Reed Show'' ran from 1958 to 1965.  As I stated earlier in one of my speeches describing the Iowa Spirit, the people of Iowa strive to excel in any and all endeavors, whether it be education, entertainment or enterprise. And the community of Denison, the county seat of Crawford County, is no exception. In memory of the Hollywood actress who was known to say, ``No matter what I do, I am still a farm girl from Denison,'' the community celebrated a 1-day festival in her honor after her death in 1986. At that time, her Oscar was presented to the city of Denison. One year later, Donna Reed's hometown community, friends and family members formed The Donna Reed Foundation for the Performing Arts to recognize youth and promote education.  The Foundation celebrates its 10th annual Donna Reed Festival this week, June 15-23. Building on its charter to provide affordable and high quality education to those who share a love for the arts, the Foundation offers performing arts workshops, and awards an annual college scholarship to applicants interested in studying acting, music, and dance. The first scholarship was awarded in 1987 for $500. Within 8 years, the award had grown to a $10,000 national scholarship. During this week's festival, performing arts instructors and professionals from New York, California, and the Midwest will conduct about 45 professional workshops. One of the highlights at the festival this year includes a tribute to the 50th anniversary of ``It's A Wonderful Life,'' featuring a reunion of cast and crew.  Mr. President, I proudly salute members of the Denison community and their vision for promoting the arts. Borne of hard work, countless volunteer hours, and unparalleled community spirit, The Donna Reed Foundation has achieved a center for cultural and performing arts in America's heartland.  Mr. President, life in Iowa truly is a wonderful life. And I'm sure the citizens of Denison would be the first to agree.                          ____________________
