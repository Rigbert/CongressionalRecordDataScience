Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to say I have watched these two gentlemen, Mr. Rush and Mr. Hudson, work together, something that our committee does a lot on lots of different issues, from oversight to energy, to healthcare, to telecommunications.  Mr. Rush has had an outstanding career. The gentleman's district is close to mine. He and I have been in each other's districts quite a bit over the last number of years. This bill is a legacy to Mr. Rush. The gentleman has cared with real passion about energy jobs and making sure that we have the expertise and the technical training knowing that we want to compete with the rest of the world. I commend the gentleman again for working with Mr. Hudson--a brilliant star on our side of the aisle--to get this bill done.  We look forward to the President's signing it into law, and we are lookingforward to having the Senate move similar bipartisan legislation so we can get the job done. That is what it is all about.  So I want to thank the gentleman for his tireless commitment to getting this issue done.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill again.  I yield back the balance of my time.
