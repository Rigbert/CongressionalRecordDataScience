I ask the Senator, is he aware of the fact that I was present for the questioning of Miguel Estrada? I came to the hearing room on several occasions and, unfortunately, because of the timing of the schedule, I was never called for questions and forced to go to other committee hearings and submitted written questions to Miguel Estrada?
