Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the bill (S. 2039) to allow a State or local government to construct levees on certain properties otherwise designated as open space lands.  The Clerk read the title of the bill.  The text of the bill is as follows:                                S. 2039       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. LEVEES.       (a) Definitions.--In this section--       (1) the term ``Administrator'' means the Administrator of      the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and       (2) the term ``covered hazard mitigation land'' means      land--       (A) acquired and deed restricted under section 404(b) of      the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency      Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170c(b)) before, on, or after the      date of enactment of this Act; and       (B) that is located--       (i) in North Dakota; and       (ii) in a community that--       (I) is participating in the National Flood Insurance      Program on the date on which a State, local, or tribal      government submits an application requesting to construct a      permanent flood risk reduction levee under subsection (b);      and       (II) certifies to the Administrator and the Chief of      Engineers that the community will continue to participate in      the National Flood Insurance Program.       (b) Authority.--Notwithstanding clause (i) or (ii) of      section 404(b)(2)(B) of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster      Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C.      5170c(b)(2)(B)), the Administrator shall approve the      construction of a permanent flood risk reduction levee by a      State, local, or tribal government on covered hazard      mitigation land if the Administrator and the Chief of      Engineers determine, through a process established by the      Administrator and Chief of Engineers and funded entirely by      the State, local, or tribal government seeking to construct      the proposed levee, that--       (1) construction of the proposed permanent flood risk      reduction levee would more effectively mitigate against      flooding risk than an open floodplain or other flood risk      reduction measures;       (2) the proposed permanent flood risk reduction levee      complies with Federal, State, and local requirements,      including mitigation of adverse impacts and implementation of      floodplain management requirements, which shall include an      evaluation of whether the construction, operation, and      maintenance of the proposed levee would continue to meet best      available industry standards and practices, would be the most      cost-effective measure to protect against the assessed flood      risk and minimizes future costs to the federal government;       (3) the State, local, or tribal government seeking to      construct the proposed levee has provided an adequate      maintenance plan that documents the procedures the State,      local, or tribal government will use to ensure that the      stability, height, and overall integrity of the proposed      levee and the structure and systems of the proposed levee are      maintained, including--       (A) specifying the maintenance activities to be performed;       (B) specifying the frequency with which maintenance      activities will be performed;       (C) specifying the person responsible for performing each      maintenance activity (by name or title);       (D) detailing the plan for financing the maintenance of the      levee; and       (E) documenting the ability of the State, local, or tribal      government to finance the maintenance of the levee.       (c) Maintenance Certification.--       (1) In general.--A State, local, or tribal government that      constructs a permanent flood risk reduction levee under      subsection (b) shall submit to the Administrator and the      Chief of Engineers an annual certification indicating whether      the State, local, or tribal government is in compliance with      the maintenance plan provided under subsection (b)(3).       (2) Review.--The Chief of Engineers shall review a      certification submitted under paragraph (1) and determine      whether the State, local, or tribal government has complied      with the maintenance plan.
