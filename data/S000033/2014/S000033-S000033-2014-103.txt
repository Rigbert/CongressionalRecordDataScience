 GRAHAM. Am I into the Senator's time? If the Senator is next, may I have 1 minute?  To be continued--I can't do this justice in 15 minutes, but this is what I am suggesting. If it is true that the Secretary of State could not go on television and talk about the consulate under her control and tell us about how four Americans died at that consulate--the first ambassador in 33 years--because she had a grueling week--if that is true--and I don't believe it is, but if it is--then we need to know because that will matter to the country as we go forth. If it is not true, why would Susan Rice say it?  To be continued--there is so much about this incident called ``Benghazi'' that we don't know and that makes no sense to me that I am not going to give up until I can tell the families what I believe to be the truth. And what I have been told is nowhere near the truth.  I yield the floor.
