 President, after much deliberation from both sides of the aisle, today we will complete our work on the Energy and Water appropriations bill. We know this bill is the result of a great deal of effort, research, and collaboration across the aisle. It passed out of the committee unanimously. It was subject to nearly two dozen amendments from both parties on the floor. As Senator Alexander pointed out yesterday, we have clearly had an open process from the start that benefited both sides.  The energy security and water infrastructure bill is important for our country. We know it will support commerce, public safety, waterway infrastructure, energy innovation, and our nuclear deterrence posture.  We know it is important for the way forward on appropriations as well. Remember, following regular order--especially on the appropriations process--allows both Democratic and Republican Members to better represent theirconstituents' views. It provides for more open debate and deliberation. It offers a path to reaching a kind of product both sides can support. Empowering Members to make more judicious decisions about how taxpayer dollars are spent is something we should all want. So we know the appropriations process is important.  I urge my colleagues to work together to keep moving these appropriations bills as both sides have expressed interest in doing.                          ____________________
