The same complaints are made throughout the country. The home health care agencies in my State--in fact, since January of about 2 years ago, 68 Medicare-certified agencies in Kansas have closed their doors, more than a 25-percent drop, more than a quarter drop.  These were not the ``fly-by-night'' agencies that some in the Federal Government and others in regards to various inspections--and you have talked about that we have heard about so much--many of these agencies had been in existence for 20 years.  The latest numbers from HCFA show that the total home health care visits are down by over 45 percent--almost half. The losers of this situation are not just numbers. It is just not accounting in regards to, say, HCFA. These are our Nation's seniors; in particular, those who are really sick. We are talking about the Medicare patients who are suffering through complex and chronic care needs who are already experiencing a lot of difficulty in the home care services they need.  So the same thing is true in Kansas as the Senator has pointed out in Maine. I, obviously, think it is true in every State.
