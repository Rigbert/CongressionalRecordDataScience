 President, I certainly agree with my friend from Nevada. The idea is to finish tonight. In order to facilitate that, we have a Senator on the floor ready to offer an amendment. I suggest the Senator from Colorado be allowed to send his amendment forward, say a few words on its behalf, and let's adopt it.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
