President, this approach met our needs for the last two Congresses, and I too would like to see it continue. In addition, last Congress, special reserves was restored to its historic purpose. We should continue to fund special reserves to the extent possible in order to be able to assist committees that face urgent, unanticipated, nonrecurring needs. Recognizing the tight budgets we will face for the foreseeable future, it is necessary to continue to bring funding authorizations more in line with our actual resources while ensuring that committees are able to fulfill their responsibilities. I look forward to continuing to work with the majority leader to accomplish this.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a joint leadership letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                         United States Senate,                                  Washington, DC, January 7, 2015.       We Mutually Commit to the Following for the 114th Congress:      The Rules Committee is to determine the budgets of the      committees of the Senate. The budgets of the committees,      including joint and special committees, and all other      subgroups, shall be apportioned to reflect the ratio of the      Senate as of this date, including an additional ten percent      (10%) from the majority and minority salary baseline to be      allocated to the chairman for administrative expenses.       Special Reserves has been restored to its historic purpose.      Requests for funding will only be considered when submitted      by a committee chairman and ranking member for unanticipated,      non-recurring needs. Such requests shall be granted only upon      the approval of the chairman and ranking member of the Rules      Committee.       Funds for committee expenses shall be available to each      chairman consistent with the Senate rules and practices of      the 113th Congress.       The division of committee office space shall be      commensurate with this funding agreement.       The chairman and ranking member of any committee may, by      mutual agreement, modify the apportionment of committee      funding and office space.     Mitch McConnell.     Harry Reid.                          ____________________
