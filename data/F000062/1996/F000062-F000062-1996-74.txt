 President, I had truly hoped that I could support legislation that could deliver meaningful and historic reform of our Nation's welfare system, but this bill forces California to bear far more than our fair share of the burden.  Last year I voted for the Senate bill and against the conference bill because California's concerns were not met. This year, I would hope that some of these items could be fixed in conference committee, so that we are able to vote for a bill at the end of this process.  Nearly one-third of the net reductions contained in this bill fall on just one State: California. California is being asked to shoulder $17 billion in cuts--one-third of the entire savings. The question is, what is the State able and willing to provide to fill in the gap? An examination of Governor Wilson's budget indicates that dollars budgeted for food stamps, AFDC, and benefits for legal immigrants drop from an estimated $1.9 billion in the current fiscal year to just over $1.5 billion in 1997--therefore, counties cannot expect a large bailout from the State.  Consequently, for those who deserve special help, whether they be aged, blind, developmentally disabled or mentally ill, an increased burden will most certainly fall on the counties.                       no safety net for children  S. 1795 ends the Federal guarantee of cash assistance for poor children and families, and provides no safety net for children whose parents reached the 5-year time limit on benefits. There are approximately 2.7 million AFDC recipients in California, of which 68 percent are children. Under the time limit, 3.3 million children nationwide and 514,000 children in California would lose all assistance after 5 years.  The Children's Defense Fund estimates that under this bill, 1.2 million more children would fall into poverty. California's child poverty rate was 27 percent for 1992-94, substantially above the national average of 21 percent. Under this bill, even more children in California would be living in poverty.                    food stamps drastically reduced  California will lose $4.2 billion in cuts to the Food Stamp Program, reducing benefits for 1.2 million households. Nearly 2 million children in California receive food stamp benefits. Children of legal immigrants would be eliminated from food stamp benefits immediately.                     child care funding inadequate  Currently in California, paid child care is not available to 80 percent of eligible AFDC children. The Senate welfare reform bill awards child care block grants to States based on their current utilization of Federal child care funds. But California's current utilization rate is low, so California would be institutionally disadvantaged under this bill.                    no health coverage for children  The Senate bill ends the Federal guarantee of health insurance or Medicaid for women on AFDC and their children. In California, 290,000 children and 750,000 parents would lose coverage, according to the Children's Defense Fund. California has the third highest uninsured rate in the Nation at 22 percent of the population.                 denial of benefits to legal immigrants  The Senate welfare reform bill would deny SSI and flood stamps to most legal immigrants, including those already residing in California. In 1994, 15.4 percent, or 390,000, of AFDC recipients in California were noncitizens.  Fifty-two percent of all legal immigrants in the United States who are on SSI and AFDC reside in California. Los Angeles County estimates that 234,000 aged, blind, and disabled legal immigrants would lose SSI benefits, 150,000 people would lose AFDC, and 93,000 SSI recipients would lose benefits under this bill. The county estimates that the loss of SSI funds could result in a cost shift to the county of more than $236 million annually. Loss of Medicaid coverage for legal immigrants would shift an additional $100 million per year.  With this in mind, I cannot support this bill, because I believe it unfairly disadvantages California. It would be my hope that as the conference process continues, this can be taken into consideration and the bill that emerges can be fair across the board and not single out any one State for one-third of the burden of the cuts.  It is especially important that individual counties in California take a close look at the impact this legislation will have on their jurisdiction. For example, Los Angeles County continues to be the most devastated county in the Nation under this bill with almost $500 million in added costs each year. California counties must help us press our case with the House-Senate conferees on the impact of this bill.
