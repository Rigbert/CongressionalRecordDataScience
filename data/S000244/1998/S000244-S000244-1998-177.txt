Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1273, the National Science Foundation Authorization Act of 1998 and 1999, authorizes the Foundation's programs for fiscal years 1998, 1999, and 2000. This is a noncontroversial bill that was favorably reported by voice vote by the Committee on Science on April 16, 1997, and later passed the full House under suspension of the rules on April 24, 1997. The present version of H.R. 1273 is the product of negotiations with the Senate, which passed the bill on a vote of 99-0 on May 12, 1998.  The National Science Foundation provides funding to over 19,000 research and education projects in science and engineering annually. It does this through competitive grants and cooperative agreements to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, K-12 schools, businesses, and other research institutions in all parts of the United States. Although the Foundation's budget represents only 4 percent of Federal research and development funding, the Foundation accounts for more than 25 percent of Federal support to academic institutions for basic research.  This 3-year authorization improves our investment in America by strengthening our commitment to basic research. It authorizes $3.5 billion for fiscal year 1998, $3.8 billion for fiscal year 1999, and nearly $3.9 billion for fiscal year 2000. The bill received bipartisan support in the Committee on Science and demonstrates the Committee's belief that the support of basic research will help America maintain its lead in cutting-edge science and engineering. It is the kinds of research that the NSF funds through which we will make the fundamental discoveries which will become the economic drivers of the 21st century.  The Research and Related Activities account is NSF's primary account and provides the resources for a broad portfolio of science and engineering activities. For fiscal year 1999, H.R. 1273 provides for $2.57 billion for this account, a 10-percent increase over 1998. For fiscal year 2000, the bill provides a further $2.9 billion.  This legislation also follows through on the Committee on Science's commitment to improve math and science education. H.R. 1273 authorizes $632 million for Fiscal Year 1998, $683 million for Fiscal Year 1999, and $703 million for Fiscal Year 2000 for NSF's Education and Human Resources Directorate, which funds education programs. To hold down administrative costs, the bill holds the salaries and expense account of NSF to approximately 2 percent growth in Fiscal Years 1998, 1999, and 2000.  I want to take a moment to thank the acting chairman of the Subcommittee on Basic Research, the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Pickering); the former ranking minority member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Barcia); and the current ranking minority member, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson); and the ranking minority member of the full committee, the gentleman from California (Mr. Brown), for their efforts and support in crafting a truly bipartisan bill.  Before closing, I would like to express my appreciation and respect for all the hard work performed on this bill by the late former chairman of the Subcommittee on Basic Research, Congressman Steve Schiff, who passed away earlier this year.  H.R. 1273 is the product of Mr. Schiff's dedication to improving America's scientific and technological prowess. Steve was a true patriot who served our country both as an elected official and as a member of the Armed Forces. As this bill demonstrates, Steve Schiff was also an excellent legislator. The Committee on Science and the whole Congress will miss his intelligence, wit, and his diligence.  I believe that H.R. 1237 is an outstanding bill and urge all Members on both sides of the aisle to support it.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
