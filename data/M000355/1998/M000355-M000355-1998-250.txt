 President, I want to thank Senator Coats and Senator Jeffords for their exemplary work on the Coats Act's reauthorization of Head Start, Community Services Block Grants. Low-Income Home Energy Assistance, and the new authorization for an Individual Development Account demonstration.  In particular, I appreciate their commitment to address a matter of serious concern to me regarding provisions that would unintentionally impact the Rural Development Loan Fund currently administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The Coats Act includes the repeal of section 407 of the Human Services Reauthorization Act of 1986 and the Community Economic Development Act. These statutory repeals were included to achieve a reasonable clarification of the statutory authority held by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Upon further examination of these provisions after the committee mark-up, we discovered that this house-keeping action for HHS would eliminate provisions essential to the USDA's administration of the Rural Development Loan Fund, a lending program that has provided vital economic support to several communities in Kentucky.  I understand that during conference, Senators Coats and Jeffords have agreed to recede to the House position and drop the Coats Act provisions that repeal section 407 and CEDA.
