 President, today I honor June Collier Fletcher, one of Alabama's most influential women, who died on September 9, 2006. She rose from a meager upbringing to become the president and CEO of National Industries, Inc. Once the largest private employer in Montgomery, June built National Industries from the ground up to become a major automotive supplier employing 5,000 Alabamians.  June's drive and ambition allowed her to become a leader in an industry dominated by men. Under her guidance and leadership, National Industries became a flourishing $130 million-a-year electrical connection business.  Over the years, June was recognized for her hard work, dedication, and expertise and received numerous awards and accolades. She served as a member of the Commerce Department's prestigious Industrial Policy Advisory Committee, testified before Congress on automotive issues, and was a sought-after speaker on the subject of international trade. June received the Industry Week Excellence in Management Award and was selected to the Committee of 200, an organization of the top 200 women business leaders in America.  In addition to her work in the automotive industry, she was also active in petroleum exploration and production, farming, and garment manufacturing. In the 1980s, June's company was awarded a government contract to produce chemical warfare protective clothing which was used during the first gulf war.  June was an inspiration to many and I am truly grateful for the endless contributions she made to Alabama and our Nation. She will be missed by her husband Tim Fletcher; her five children, Kara Davis, Ondi Cain, Roessler Collier, Arin Burroughs, Kohler Collier; her stepchildren, Tom Fletcher, Jr., Carrie Fletcher; her 12 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren. She will also be missed by her many friends and the numerous people she worked with whose lives she touched throughout her magnificent journey.                          ____________________
