President, we are trying to find out something specific that Howard Stern has said or promoted on his programs. The problem is, there is nothing I can say on the Senate floor because it is so basically lewd. It is the type of thing that if the Muslim world were to listen to, it would be something very bad. There is not a Senator on this floor who would want that type of language used, profanity. I said this in my opening remarks. There are some cases where programming could be so extreme, whether it is liberal or conservative, it would not be acceptable.  As far as Al Franken and Ed Schultz, the liberal programming, it was published on the Web site of American Forces that states which ones meet the two criteria. It was not on their Web site in 2004. It is on their Web site currently.  I can't spoon-feed them and go up and say: Are you aware? You need to read the Web site. They should have been aware of that.  I yield the floor.
