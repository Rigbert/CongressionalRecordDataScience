 Chairman, this amendment is an amendment of enormous consequence which is supported by people with very different political philosophies. This amendment is cosponsored by the gentleman from Oregon [Mr. DeFazio], by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Ney], by the gentleman from California [Mr. Dellums], by the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Stearns], by the gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Brown], and by the gentleman from California [Mr. Rohrabacher], by Republicans, Democrats and Independent, by conservatives and progressives, and what this amendment says is that we believe in democracy and we believe that legislation passed at the local level, at the State level, and here in the U.S. Congress should not be overridden by the World Trade Organization.  And while we may disagree about this piece of legislation or that piece of legislation, we think that there is something very wrong about our trade policy whereby this Government has abdicated enormous responsibility and whereby major environmental legislation, legislation dealing with human rights and other important issues, is now threatened and has been threatened by the World Trade Organization. We believe that there is something very wrong when important environmental legislation passed by this Congress is overridden by people in Geneva who meet behind closed doors. We think there is something wrong when legislation passed in the State of Vermont, State of Massachusetts designed to bring back democracy in Burma is threatened by the World Trade Organization.  Mr. Chairman, let me take a moment now to yield to my friend, the gentleman from Florida [Mr. Stearns] who has been very active in this issue.
