President, I ask to have printed in the Record, copies of two resolutions passed on May 31, 1996, by the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police dealing with the creation of a national clearinghouse for information on police performance and the police officer bill of rights.  I would like to thank them for sharing these resolutions with me.  The resolutions follow:     Resolution for the Support of National Officer Clearinghouse                               Legislation       Whereas the vast majority of police officers serve and      protect their communities professionally and successfully      with diligences, courage and integrity; and       Whereas it is essential that the public maintain confidence      in the professionalism and integrity of its police officers,      and the ability of police agencies to maintain those      standards; and       Whereas only a small percentage of police officers have      acted in a manner that does not meet the public's      expectations or the profession's standards of ethics and      conduct; and       Whereas it is in the best interest of the public and the      policing profession to assure that such officers are denied      further opportunities to serve as police officers; and       Whereas such officers who are terminated or who resign      because of misconduct can often secure subsequent police      service employment at other agencies, often by reason of not      fully disclosing the circumstances of a previous termination      or resignation; and       Whereas the ability of such officers to move from one      agency to another severely limits police agency's ability to      identify officers that should not be working police services;      and       Whereas the ability of a prospective employing agency to      identify such officers could be enhanced through a national      clearinghouse of information by which prior police service      employment is made known to prospective employing agencies;      and       Whereas, at the urging of the International Association of      Chiefs of Police, the Florida Police Chief's Association, and      the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, legislation was      introduced by Senator Bob Graham and Congressman Harry      Johnson to create a National Officer Clearinghouse, but the      legislation was not enacted by the 103rd Congress: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police      calls for Vermont's Congressional delegation to support S.      484--the ``Law Enforcement and Correctional Officers      Registration Act of 1995'' and companion House legislation      co-sponsoring this legislation, and be it further       Resolved, That the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police,      through its membership, actively participate in the      clearinghouse once it is established.       Passed this 31st day of May, 1996 in Vergennes, Vermont.                                                      Gary Watson,                                                        President.Resolution in Opposition of Police Officers' Bill of Rights Legislation       Whereas, the U.S. Congress is presently considering      legislation to establish a federal Police Officers' Bill of      Rights; and       Whereas, if adopted, this legislation would require every      local, county and state law enforcement agency to adopt a Law      Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, or lose substantial      amounts of federal grants; and       Whereas, the Vermont Association of Chiefs of Police      believes that due process rights for all police officers      subject to (1) investigation for violation of department      rules and regulations; and (2) subsequent disciplinary action      are well provided for in individual agency policy and      procedure in compliance with prevailing federal and state law      and court mandates; and       Whereas, this legislation violates the theory of states'      rights established under the 10th Amendment to the U.S.      Constitution, through which the states retain the right to      regulate those matters that the federal government had not      regulated; and       Whereas, specific provisions of the Police Officers' Bill      of Rights will deprive police administrators of vital and      necessary powers to conduct both informal and internal      investigations to resolve employee grievances, and to      maintain a civil service system free of politics;       Now therefore be it resolved that the Vermont Association      of Chiefs of Police hereby affirms its opposition to H.R.      2946, H.R. 2537 and all bills and amendments of a similar      nature that would establish a federal Police Officers' Bill      of Rights.       Be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be      delivered to Vermont's Congressional Delegation along with a      request that the resolution be entered into the Congressional      Record.       Passed this 31st day of May, 1996 in Vergennes, Vermont.                                                      Gary Watson,     President.                          ____________________
