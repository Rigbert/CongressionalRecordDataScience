President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, and still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation.  Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.  In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight.  Following are the names of just some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago on May 19, 20, and 21.  May 19, 1999:  Clarence Arnold, 32, Knoxville, TN  Troy Blando, 39, Houston, TX  Don T. Huey, 32, Houston, TX  David Johnson, 31, Houston, TX  Booker Miles, 27, Louisville, KY  James Nash, 40, Atlanta, GA  Leon Pickett, Detroit, MI  Mark Thompson, 31, Baltimore, MD  Willie D. Watts, 39, Gary, IN  Cedric White, 19, Atlanta, GA  May 20, 1999:  Eric Michael Allen, 30, Detroit, MI  Roderick R. Brown, 27, Memphis, TN  John Cosgrove, 71, Miami-Dade County, FL  Paul Davis, 28, Chicago, IL  Stephen Entsminger, 49, Davenport, IA  Maria Josefina Eslava, 23, Houston, TX  Curtis O. Green, 17, Chicago, IL  Travis Johnson, 20, Rockford, IL  Demarcus Kelly, 26, Atlanta, GA  Aaron Murphy, Jr., 40, Macon, GA  Kevin Stokes, 27, Atlanta, GA  Male, 56, Honolulu, HI  May 21, 1999:  James Alberts, 35, Bridgeport, CT  Quan Bell, 28, Detroit, MI  Edward Belton, 18, St. Louis, MO  Richard Daniels, 27, Fort Worth, TX  Anthony Houston, 21, Detroit, MI  Michelle Jackson, 21, St. Louis, MO  Steven Jupiter, 19, Baltimore MD  Werner Muense, 81, Minneapolis, MN  John Minaya, 19, Providence, RI  Karl Paul Pitts, 22, Detroit, MI  Michael Marion Raymond, 22, Washington, DC  Osualdo Rodriquez, 23, Houston, TX  Sheri Thielen, 40, Minneapolis, MN  May 19, 1999 (Houston, Texas):  Police Officer Troy Blando was fatally shot while attempting to arrest an auto theft suspect. Jeffery Demond Williams pulled into a parking lot in a stolen Lexus, and the 39-year-old Blando, working on the auto theft task force, was undercover in an unmarked vehicle. Blando approached Williams after he had run a check on the license plate and discovered the vehicle had been stolen.  A struggle ensued, and Blando put away his gun as he tried to handcuff the suspect's wrists. At that point, Williams pulled out a gun and shot the police officer, who was pronounced dead later that evening after doctors were unable to save him.  Police Officer Troy Blando is survived by his widow who suffers from multiple sclerosis, and his 14-year-old son. Williams has been convicted and sentenced to die.  May 20, 1999 (Conyers, Georgia):  As students mingled before class at Heritage High School in Conyers, Georgia, on May 20, 1999, fifteen-year-old Thomas Solomon pulled out a rifle and a handgun and began to open fire. Six students were injured and an assistant principal had to talk Solomon out of killing himself after he put a gun in his mouth. This incident took place exactly one month after Littleton, Colorado.  May 21, 1999 (Providence, Rhode Island):  Twenty-four-year-old John Minaya was accosted and fatally shot outside a busy Dairy Queen ice cream shop in Providence's West End early on the evening of May 21, 1999. Officers found Minaya lying on the pavement in the parking lot shortly after 7:00 p.m. He had been hit more than once, and people were ministering to him. He was taken to Rhode Island Hospital, but he died within minutes.  Though it was still springtime, Minaya was Providence's 13th homicide victim of 1999, a year in which there were ultimately 26 murders in the city, up from 15 in 1998 and 13 in 1997. The majority of these killings were committed with firearms, and most of these were handguns.  The children and families who witnessed the shooting of John Minaya in broad daylight at a Dairy Queen in Providence will carry the horrific memory of that day with them for as long as they live. We should do our part to ensure that fewer Americans experience gun violence by passing common sense gun legislation without further delay.                          ____________________
