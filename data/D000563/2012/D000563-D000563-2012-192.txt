President, it is difficult to come to the floor of the Senate on this anniversary of 9/11 and not reflect on your own experience. I was in the same room as the majority leader, Harry Reid, just a few steps from the Senate Chamber when we witnessed the second plane on television crashing into the World Trade Center and realized it was no accident, and then the black smoke billowing over the Mall from the Pentagon suggested we were under attack.  As we evacuated this building and rushed outside, standing, the crowd around, not knowing which way to turn, was looking for a safe place to go. No one knew. Some tourists came up to me and said: We are new here. Where are we supposed to go next?
