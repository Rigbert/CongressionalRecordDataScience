 President, 1 year ago today, a tragedy struck the campus of Virginia Tech, where the lives of 32 students and faculty members were tragically cut short in what was the worst campus shooting in U.S. history. We remember with sadness the terrible loss we all suffered that day while we all mourned with the Virginia Tech family. Our prayers go out to everyone in the Virginia Tech community who is remembering a loved one on this day.  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.
