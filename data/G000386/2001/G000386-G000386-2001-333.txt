 A trigger would substantially reduce the economic benefits of tax cuts, making it more likely that the debt reduction target would not be met.  Second, there is no reason that we need a trigger to raise taxes. The reality is, Congress is not shy about raising taxes. We have actually reduced taxes in 1981, and we raised taxes in 1982, 1984, 1987, 1989, 1990, and 1993 before we reduced taxes once again in 1997.  What is rare is for Congress, then, to actually give tax relief such as we are now.  The Senator from Virginia, Mr. Allen, has an amendment to the amendment, and I defer to him at this time.
