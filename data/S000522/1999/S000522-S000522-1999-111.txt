Mr. Chairman, on Line 17, where it says ``to secure the release of Lori Berenson,'' to strike ``the release of'' and put ``a fair trial for'' Lori Berenson, and also on Page 2, Line 6, just so it is internally consistent, ``to assist in providing a fair trial for.'' And then I hope we would be unanimous, because I do believe it was a sham trial, as I said to the gentlewoman. My subcommittee has looked into it. We think it is awful. Her due process rights were trashed. But if indeed we are talking about a situation where she may have been involved with this, that is something that a fair trial has to adjudicate.                         Parliamentary Inquiry
