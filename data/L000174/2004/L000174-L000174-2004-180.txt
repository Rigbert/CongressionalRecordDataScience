President, I memorialize the life of Edward ``Ed'' Miles, a decorated Vietnam veteran who heroically turned his war experience into a mission of compassion for victims of conflict around the world. Ed Miles died on January 26, 2004.  I first met Ed through his advocacy on behalf of war survivors--work that embodied the ideals of the Leahy War Victims Fund, which was established in 1989 to respond to the needs of innocent victims of conflict in developing countries. Despite painful injuries suffered during the war in Vietnam that left him a bilateral amputee, and the challenges of working in a country reeling from Pol Pot's genocidal Khmer Rouge regime, Ed persevered and set up a rehabilitation clinic for landmine survivors and other war victims that was the first of its kind in Cambodia. Today it is recognized as Cambodia's national rehabilitation center and a model for others around the world.  Ed is perhaps best remembered for this work through his involvement with Vietnam Veterans of America Foundation, VVAF, and the International Campaign to Ban Land Mines, which received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997 for its advocacy to eliminate the scourge of landmines.  As an associate director of VVAF, Ed traveled throughout the world raising funds, generating medical research and support, and, finally, building and staffing a prosthetics clinic for amputees at Kien Khleang, outside Phnom Penh, Cambodia in 1991. Since its inception, this project has produced 15,000 prosthetics, orthotics and wheelchairs for landmine survivors and other war victims. In addition, since Ed's initial pioneering and humanitarian efforts in Cambodia, VVAF has opened rehabilitation clinics in Vietnam, Angola, Ethiopia, Kosovo and elsewhere in Central America and Sub-Saharan Africa. Thousands of people with disabilities, many of whom had been treated as social outcasts, recovered their mobility and their dignity because of Ed Miles.  Ed's personal mission to help war survivors was undoubtedly the result of his own war experience. In April 1969, as a Captain and Military Advisor, Special Forces, United States Army, Ed was wounded in an ambush outside Cu Chi near the Cambodian border. He stepped on a landmine and lost both of his legs above the knee, suffered severe bone, nerve and muscle damage to his arm and later lost one of his eyes to infection.  As a result of his service in Vietnam, Ed received the United States Army Silver Star for Bravery, the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry, the Vietnamese Campaign Medal, the Air Medal, the Good Conduct and the Combat Infantryman's Badge.  After returning home, Ed became an active critic of the Vietnam War, co-founding Veterans Against the War. Yet despite the severity of his injuries, years of hospital treatment and his enduring disabilities, he also completed his education, receiving his Masters of Public Administration from New York University. Ed worked as an Outreach Counselor for Vietnam veterans with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. In 1989, he was one of the first Americans to return to Vietnam since the war ended. In fact, he was featured on ``Nightline'' visiting the site where he was wounded.  Ed continued his quest for peace and reconciliation with America's former enemy through VVAF, continuously lobbying the United States Congress and the White House to normalize diplomatic and trade relations with Vietnam, which ultimately occurred in 1995. He was a featured speaker throughout the United States, and a visiting guest speaker at local schools where he described his Vietnam experience and the historical significance and lessons of the Vietnam War.  For the 35 years since being wounded and up until his life's end, Ed exhibited a selflessness, determination and compassion beyond compare. Despite the daily struggles and pain from his injuries, I never once heard Ed complain about his own misfortunes. He was soft spoken and unassuming to a degree rarely seen, but he also harbored a fiery passion for ridding the world of injustice and senseless conflict. Ed was an inspiration to me in my efforts to ban landmines, and to everyone who knew him.  Family, friends and colleagues throughout the world responded with shock and deep sadness for the loss of this true humanitarian and hero. In his gentle but powerful way, Ed touched the world one person at a time, and I consider myself very fortunate to have been one of them.  Ed was born in Brooklyn, NY, and was buried there with his parents and Irish ancestors dating from 1860. He grew up in Manhasset, NY and throughout his free-spirited life, had homes in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, Augsburg, Germany, Kinsale, Ireland, Greenwich Village, Sag Harbor, Southhampton and Stamford, New York, Wyoming, Colorado, and Wilton, Connecticut. He is survived by sons Ed, of Boulder, Colorado, and Daniel of Southhampton, New York; a daughter, Sarah of New York City; sisters Mary Teresa Jackson of Raleigh, North Carolina, Michele Dunn of Wilton, Connecticut, and Christine Kuhl of Southhampton, New York.  The world is a better place because of Ed Miles, and his generous heart and many contributions will always be remembered.                          ____________________
