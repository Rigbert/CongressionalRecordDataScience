Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to an individual whose dedication and contributions to the community of Riverside, CA are exceptional. Riverside has been fortunate to have dynamic and dedicated community leaders who willingly and unselfishly give their time and talent and make their communities a better place to live and work. Brigadier General Stanford ``Stan'' E. Brown, USAF, (Ret) is one of these individuals. On March 27, 2014, Stan will be honored as the 2013 ``Citizen of the Year'' at the Riverside Chamber of Commerce Installation Dinner.  On December 25, 1928, Stan was born in the college town of Champaign, Illinois, to Rose Marie and Gilbert Brown. Stan grew up watching his father establish a successful career as a police officer, and listening to stories of his mother's family emigrating from Sicily. Times were tough and the Great Depression had hit the family living on one income hard. Stan's natural entrepreneurial spirit proved useful, and the family was able to survive on the income generated by the chicken coup he set up in their basement and the lush garden in their backyard. His athletic nature eventually earned him a baseball scholarship to serve as starting pitcher at the University of Illinois.  Though his passion for America's greatest pastime was strong and could have turned into a career, Stan felt a greater calling to serve his country in the United States Air Force during the Korean War. He left his sweetheart, Beverly, behind, but would come back shortly thereafter to marry her. Stan's natural leadership ability was noticed within the Air Force, and afforded him the opportunity to move up very quickly in the enlisted ranks. After earning an officer's commission, Beverly, Stan, and their three boys Stan Jr., Bradley, and Gilbert, took up military life as they moved frequently from base to base. A successful application for pilot's school would eventually send him all over the world and up the chain of command. He experienced many an adventure: from flying reconnaissance jet missions over the Soviet Union, to a combat tour doing classified missions in Vietnam.  In July 1973, Stan and his family would be transferred to a brand new terrain, sunny Southern California at March Air Force Base (March AFB). By August 1975, he had excelled in many positions, and eventually earned one of the top jobs on site, Wing Commander. Though he had lived all over the country, Stan had never quite experienced anything like the camaraderie at March AFB. During his time there, he was credited with starting the Airman's Picnic, the Riverside Trophy Dinner, leading the 22nd Bombardment Wing to become one of the most prestigious in the Strategic Air Command, and establishing the land space that would eventually become the Riverside National Cemetery. He had formed invaluable friendships with individuals who provided him counsel throughout his time at his next assignment serving at the Pentagon and over his many years with the Strategic Air Command.  Though he was transferred to the Pentagon 1977, Stan could never seem to get the Inland Empire off of his mind after leaving behind many friends and family members. With hard work and dedication, Stan achieved the rank of Brigadier General in a matter of two years. A multitude of assignments came his way, until four years later he finally retired from the service as commander of the Defense Nuclear Agency at Kirtland AFB, N.M. With his retirement from the service came a new opportunity to serve as Vice President of Northrop Corp, an experience that eventually gave him the skills necessary to start his own defense company in Southern California.  After quite a ride, Stan made the decision to officially retire in Riverside where his wife Beverly continued to fight cancer; sadly, a battle she would lose in 2002. Despite this, Stan had grown to love the community and became even more involved projects throughout the Inland Empire. He began planning of the Medal of Honor Memorial at Riverside National Cemetery, which led him to become the founder of the cemetery's Monuments and Memorial Committee established to make decisions regarding future memorials. Because of his clear leadership, Stan was appointed by the National Cemetery Administration to its Advisory Committee on Monuments and Memorials in 2004, which allowed him to assist other cemeteries throughout the nation in developing their programs and planning boards.  Stan's experience created a need for his involvement in development for the March Joint Powers Authority. He also earned appointment to the Riverside Planning Commission in 2003, where he served two terms, would keep him actively involved in the community. Currently, Stan chairs an advisory committee aimed at establishing a U.S. Veteran Initiative at March Air Reserve Base, which would provide job training to U.S. Veterans.  Stan is most known as an effective leader with a natural ability to organize the efforts and goodwill of others. He proudly served his country with the love and support of his family, and went on to contribute to the character of the Inland Empire as a keen businessman. Considering all that Stan has done for Riverside, the Riverside Chamber of Commerce named him their 2013 Citizen of the Year. Stan's tireless passion for service has contributed immensely to the betterment of our country and community. He has been an inspiration to many and I am proud to call him a fellow community member, American and friend. I know that many community members are grateful for his service and salute him as he receives this prestigious award.                          ____________________
