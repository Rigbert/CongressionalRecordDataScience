I thank him for his passion and for participating this evening and for all the effort he puts forward on our Great Lakes Task Force to try to elevate this region of the country as so vital to our future.                              {time}  1700  And when the gentlemen were talking about Great Lakes and the word ``lakes,'' there are some people who have said they should have been named the Great Seas.  I had an experience with schoolchildren a few years back. I loaded up a schoolbus with children who came from a region that wasn't close to the lake, and I took them out to Lake Erie. Their first reaction was actually fear when they saw how big it was. They said: Oh, the ocean.  So, it isn't like a little puddle jumper. These lakes are vast. You have described them well. Most Americans have not visited them, so they don't have a complete understanding of how massive these lakes really are. There is nothing else like them on the face of the Earth.
