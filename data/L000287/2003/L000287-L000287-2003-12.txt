Mr. Speaker, continuing to yield to my friend from Virginia with regard to the process for floor debate next week, we were told that an open rule is anticipated. However, as the gentleman knows, that does not guarantee that we will have the full debate this serious matter demands. The American people deserve to have a full, serious, open and candid discussion. Therefore, we expect that the rule would grant whatever waivers are necessary so that Members would be allowed to have a full debate and the ability to offer substantial amendments.  What assurance, what guarantee can the gentleman provide in this regard?
