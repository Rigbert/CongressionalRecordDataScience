 Now, if I may clarify a few more points.  Section 2 of the bill exempts four categories from the definition of ``information assisting in the placing of a bet or wager.'' My next few questions relate to the applicability of these provisions.  First, Senator Kyl, as to the first category of exempt information, found in subsection (8)(C)(i), am I correct in assuming that ``common pool parimutuel pooling'' and ``commingling of parimutuel pools'' are two names for the same process--the merging of parimutuel pools from two or more locations for purposes of calculating the odds and payoffs?
