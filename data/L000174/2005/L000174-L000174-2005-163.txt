President, methamphetamine abuse has increased exponentially in recent years, expanding geographically to reach all corners of the United States. In recent years, the problem has made its way to Vermont. I am concerned about escalating methamphetamine abuse and have worked with other interested Senators to find ways to combat this growing problem.  With Senator Feinstein taking the lead, on July 28, 2005, the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously reported out the Combat Meth Act, S. 103, with a committee amendment. I worked with Senator Feinstein and the other members of the committee to reach this result.  In September, I worked with Chairman Shelby and Senator Mikulski to take the unusual action of including the Combat Meth Act as an amendment to the Commerce Justice Science appropriations bill. I did this to accommodate Senator Feinstein's request and to try to make progress on this measure. By that action the Senate approved the Combat Meth Act, S. 103, as reported by the Judiciary Committee, as an amendment and then in passage of the bill. House conferees would not agree to the Senate bill. Without agreement on such an authorization, it was not retained in the appropriations conference report.  Last Thursday, I honored the request of Senator Feinstein and worked to clear the Combat Meth Act, S. 103, as reported by the Judiciary Committee, for passage by the Senate as a freestanding bill. It is clear on the Democratic side. It has been clear for days. All Senate Democrats are ready to pass that measure. It is being prevented from passage by an anonymous objection from the Republican side of the aisle.  The Senate's bipartisan bill focuses directly on providing law enforcement and prosecutors the tools they told us they needed. These include putting precursor chemicals behind the pharmacy counters, monitoring and regulating the quantities that can be bought in a 30-day period, and making it harder to smuggle such ingredients into the United States. The Senate bill focuses on prevention, regulation, monitoring, and treatment. Our bill would make it harder for people to enter the nightmarish world of methamphetamine use and abuse, harder for other countries and companies to profit from methamphetamine misery, and easier for law enforcement to combat this problem on the ground.  I know that Senator Feinstein has been working tirelessly for years to do something about this important issue. She has been tenacious and dedicated, and I respect her leadership in this area. She and Senator Talent know that I have tried to accommodate them and to facilitate passage of this legislation.                          ____________________[Page S12520]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                          THE COMBAT METH ACT
