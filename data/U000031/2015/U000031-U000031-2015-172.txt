We need to act earlier than that.  With the Senate now passing a bill, in all likelihood next week, likely with an amendment addressing this situation, we can deal with it as part of that conference report, and I look forward to supporting that and the inclusion of such in the final package.  I would again urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the procedural motion to recommit so that we can get to final passage.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
