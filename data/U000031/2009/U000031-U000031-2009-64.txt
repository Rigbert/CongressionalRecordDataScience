David Foster of Grand Haven, Michigan. After 34 years of service, Mr. Foster is set to retire as the Chief Engineer of the Army Corps of exemplary Engineers Lake Michigan Area Office in Grand Haven.  Mr. Foster is an accomplished engineer who has spent most of his career near Lake Michigan. He was born in Muskegon, graduated from Whitehall High School, and received his bachelor's degree in civil engineering from Michigan State University. Dave began his work with the Army Corps of Engineers in 1975 and has served with distinction and honor in Muskegon, Fort Wayne, and Grand Haven.  Throughout his career Dave has played a vital role in supporting Great Lakes shipping, flood control, and clean up through his work with the Army Corps. In Southwest Michigan, residents and businesses have benefited from Dave Foster's effective ability to solve problems and find solutions to difficult situations. On many occasions, residents have praised the work of the Army Corps in beach nourishment and flood control projects, both which are essential for our area. Just last year, commercial shipping in my district ground to a halt as silt clogged the federal shipping channel. Itwas through the efforts of Dave Foster and the Lake Michigan Area Office that we were able to open up the St. Joseph Harbor and save hundreds of jobs in our region.  Southwest Michigan is very fortunate Dave Foster stayed close to home. Thousands of people have been impacted by his hard work and commitment to the Army Corps of Engineers. I salute his efforts and thank him for his service as a career federal employee. I wish Dave all the best in his retirement.                          ____________________
