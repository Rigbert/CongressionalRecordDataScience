Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Packard) for yielding me this time for the purpose of a colloquy.  Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman knows, I am very eager to see design funding for the P-208 aircraft platform interface, the API laboratory consolidation project, move forward this year at Lakehurst Naval Air Engineering Station. I would ask the gentleman, is it accurate to say that this bill, H.R. 4059, provides the necessary funding for the design of the API lab and will keep the Navy on track for construction in fiscal Year 2000?
