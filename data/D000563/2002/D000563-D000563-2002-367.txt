There are critical and important environmental issues, the Senator knows well because he studied it as much if not more than any other Senator. But really what I am trying to focus on is what the Senator has heard at home and what I have heard at home, that when the price of one of these energy suppliers goes out of control, we get calls from consumers and their families, as well as small businesses, who say: Senator, what is going on? Why does this happen every spring in the Midwest?  So I ask the Senator from Alaska to take a look at it and join me in focusing on these price spikes and the consumer side of it, and I will gladly join him on any environmental aspect of another amendment. In this amendment, if we could try to confine ourselves to the economics of this issue, I think that was the reason I offered the amendment, and I hope the Senator will support it.
