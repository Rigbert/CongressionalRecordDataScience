 President, I offer congratulations to one of our Presiding Officers, Senator Richard Burr. At 5:20 p.m. today, Senator Burr broke the longstanding record for the quickest completion of 200 hours of presiding over the Senate. He has now earned his second Golden Gavel Award in this, his first Congress in the Senate. If he keeps this up, we may need to establish a special Platinum Gavel Award in his honor.  We all owe Senator Burr a special thank-you for his unprecedented service to the Senate as an institution.  I am sure he has heard many interesting and stimulating speeches in the Senate during those 200 hours.                          ____________________
