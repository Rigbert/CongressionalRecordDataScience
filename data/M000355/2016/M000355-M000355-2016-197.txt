 President, we have had a regularly scheduled election in this country every 2 years since 1788. This year's campaign was long and it was tough, and I think everyone is glad it is over. I think Americans are ready to come together and move the country forward.  As President Obama reminded us, we are all on one team. This is an intramural scrimmage. We are not Democrats first. We are not Republicans first. We are Americans first. We are patriots first. Now, as he put it, we are all rooting for the success of the President-elect for uniting and leading the country.  I want to congratulate President-Elect Trump on his victory. I want to thank the American people for placing their trust in this Senate majority and the House majority as well. Speaker Ryan and I had productive discussions with the President-elect last week. We are both looking forward to working with him, but first there is work to be done in the current session of the Senate.  We will welcome some new Members, beginning with orientation this week. We will bid farewell to some dear colleagues. We will finish the work that remains before us.  So welcome back, everyone. We still have some work to do, and with some cooperation from both sides, we will get it done.                          ____________________
