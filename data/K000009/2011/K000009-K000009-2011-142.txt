 People go, well, but you don't live in California. I said, no, but I historically represent the glass industry, which advanced into the photovoltaic industry. So the hottest act on Wall Street a couple of years ago was First Solar. Acompany called Xunlight is about to send out its first shipment to Italy this spring. We have other companies, like Kelsey-Hayes, that are in the process of bringing up their factory floors. There is Nextronics, one of the solar inverter companies that is hiring and looking for financing to expand their operation. There are many companies that didn't exist 25 years ago when we started. So I actually have seen what is happening.  But my fear, my fear is that the intellectual property will be stolen; that it will be no different than the automotive industry; that you can't staple it down; that we have to have a balanced trade policy and very tough intellectual property protections. I see your intellectual property proposal up there. I completely agree with that, because if they take our property, our intellectual property, we lose our ability to continue to manufacture and be suppliers globally.  So I wanted to say, Congressman Garamendi, you referenced oil. People say, well, why should we incentivize solar and hydrogen and biofuels and all these sectors, as if we weren't subsidizing the petroleum industry by allowing them to book their royalties or not book their royalties and be charged taxes, as though our entire military establishment wasn't deployed around the globe in order to protect those sea lanes so that petroleum can get in here for refining.  We have to realize we are already subsidizing a sector that is going to be more diminished as this 21st century moves forward. So either you live in the shell of the past, or you break out of it and create a whole new independent America, again, from an energy standpoint; and that is why we need to move.
