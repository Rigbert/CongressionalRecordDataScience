Chairman, I would simply say again we are talking about a standard that was adopted under law in 2007. We ought to try to achieve that standard to save energy in this country.  I remain opposed to the gentleman's amendment. I would ask my colleagues to vote ``no.''  I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes appeared to have it.
