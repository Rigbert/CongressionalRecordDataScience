Mr. Speaker, Ted Turner has done it again. Turn on your TV. Turn on almost any channel. You can't miss it. The Atlanta Braves are back--back in the World Series--to claim what is theirs.  Not since the Yankees of old has a baseball team stood so tall for so long. Bobby Cox has built a team for the ages--a team for destiny. Maddux. Glavine. Smoltz. Avery. Wohlers. The Murderer's Row of the 1990's--the pitchers no team wants to face.  The defense of Belliard, Lemke, and Grissom--the power of Justice, Klesko, Jones, and McGriff--they inspired Atlanta to forget the strike, to believe.  So I say to my friends from Ohio--get ready to rock and roll.  It's two and ``Oh'' and two to go. The Braves will not be denied. They cannot go back, they must not go back, they will not go back. Go Braves, Go Braves, Go Braves.                          ____________________
