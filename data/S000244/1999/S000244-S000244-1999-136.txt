Chairman, I am afraid the gentleman is kind of confusing apples with oranges because the earlier figure was the construction cost. The later figure that the gentleman from Oklahoma is using is the construction cost plus the operations cost over the full 15 to 20-year life cycle of the station.  I will be the first to concede that as a result of the Russian failures to do what they agreed to the construction costs to the U.S. taxpayers have gone up, but the 1994 figures that the gentleman from Oklahoma gave did not include any operations cost whatsoever.  So there has not been a fourfold increase.
