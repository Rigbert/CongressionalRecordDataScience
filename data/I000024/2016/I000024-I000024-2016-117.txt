It has been a long fight for a long time. Of course, I understand that Bonnie Lautenberg--who has been a very significant part of the discussion as we have gone along--is here today, and she is living this historic day with us. I say ``historic day'' because the Senate can take the final steps necessary to send the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act to be signed into law. That can happen today. Today the Senate can pass a bill with a tremendous amount of support. I think the Senator from Louisiana articulated it very well. We had individuals from the far right and the far left all in agreement.  I would add to that that we have an impressive list of groups that are supporting this: the Obama administration, American Chemistry Council, Environmental Defense Fund, U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Humane Society, National Association of Manufacturers, March of Dimes, American Petroleum Institute, National Wildlife Federation, Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, Americans for Tax Reform, National Association of Chemical Distributors, and American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturing. Everybody. We are talking about labor unions and manufacturers. It is very rare.  I agree with the Senator from Louisiana. I don't recall, in my experience here, ever having the array of support from organizations and people that we have with this. I have been working along with that group since 2012, and then Senator Lautenberg approached me and asked for my help. I think that was the time Republicans became a majority--no, we were still a minority at that time. But he wanted to have everyone involved in this from the different parties and different philosophical realms, and that is exactly what happened.  I know my friend Bonnie Lautenberg, as I mentioned, is here today. I have never seen a bill in process that has garnered the support of someone like, in this case, the widow of Frank Lautenberg. She is there all the time, making sure this proper tribute we are going to make today becomes reality.  I think the key provisions have been covered by my friend from Louisiana. Let me join him in thanking all our friends from the left and friends from the right for joining together on something that is really good for America.  One thing that hasn't been talked about very much is the number of jobs. I talked to a large group of manufacturers yesterday, and they said we never talk about jobs. There are jobs overseas today because of the uncertainty here in terms of how we are treating chemicals in this country. They can't put forth the money and resources necessary unless they know there is certainty that they are going to be able to use whatever chemicals they have to use to produce whatever they are producing. Where are they now? They are in China, India, Mexico--places where they don't have to deal with this problem. So that is a major thing that is happening.                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 2576  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at a time to be determined by the majority leader, in consultation with the Democratic leader, the Chair lay before the Senate the message to accompany H.R. 2576; further, that the majority leader or his designee be recognized to make a motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment; that there be no other motions in order and there be up to 3 hours of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees on the motion; finally, that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment with no intervening action or debate.
