Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in the Senate concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 137) calling for the suspension of Sudan's membership on the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.  The Clerk read as follows:                            S. Con. Res. 137       Whereas in Darfur, Sudan, more than 30,000 innocent      civilians have been murdered, more than 400 villages have      been destroyed, more than 130,000 men, women, and children      have been forced from their villages into neighboring      countries, and more than 1,000,000 people have been      internally displaced;       Whereas the United States Government has been, and remains      as of September 2004, the largest contributor of assistance      to the people of Darfur, having provided over $200,000,000 in      assistance, which constitutes more than 70 percent of the      total assistance provided to that region;       Whereas the United States has pledged $299,000,000 in      humanitarian aid to Darfur through fiscal year 2005, as well      as $11,800,000 in support of the African Union mission in      that region, and is likely to provide support in excess of      those pledges;       Whereas United States citizens and private organizations,      as well as the United States Government, have admirably      worked, at great risk and through great effort, to ease      suffering in Darfur, Sudan, and in eastern Chad;       Whereas based on credible reports, Congress determined in      late July 2004 that acts of genocide were occurring in      Darfur, Sudan, and that the Government of Sudan bears direct      responsibility for many of those acts of genocide;       Whereas expressing its grave concern at the ongoing      humanitarian crisis and widespread human rights violations in      Darfur, including continued attacks on civilians that place      thousands of lives at risk, the United Nations Security      Council on July 30, 2004, unanimously adopted Security      Council Resolution 1556, which called upon the Government of      Sudan to fulfill immediately its obligations to facilitate      humanitarian relief efforts, to take steps to disarm      immediately the Janjaweed militias responsible for attacks on      civilians and bring the perpetrators of such attacks to      justice, and to cooperate with independent United Nations-     sponsored investigations of human rights violations;       Whereas the Government of Sudan has failed to take credible      steps to comply with the demands of the international      community as expressed through the United Nations Security      Council;       Whereas according to press reports, reports from      nongovernmental organizations, first-hand accounts from      refugees, and other sources, the Janjaweed attacks on the      civilians of Darfur continue unabated as of September 2004;       Whereas there are credible reports from some of these same      sources that the Government of Sudan is providing assistance      to the Janjaweed militias and, in some cases, that Government      of Sudan forces have participated directly in attacks on      civilians;       Whereas the United States Government, after conducting more      than 1,000 interviews with survivors and refugees, has      determined that genocide has occurred in Darfur, that it may      still be occurring, and that both the Janjaweed and the      Government of Sudan bear responsibility for these acts;       Whereas the Secretary of State has determined that the      attacks by the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed on the      non-Arab people of Darfur and their villages are based on      race, not religion;       Whereas the United States has recently introduced a new      resolution in the United Nations Security Council that calls      for the Government of Sudan to cooperate fully with an      expanded African Union force and for a cessation of Sudanese      military flights over Darfur;       Whereas the introduced resolution also provides for      international overflights of the Darfur region to monitor the      situation on the ground and requires the United Nations      Security Council to review the record of compliance of the      Government of Sudan to determine whether the United Nations      should impose sanctions on Sudan, including sanctions      affecting the petroleum sector in that country;       Whereas the resolution also urges the Government of Sudan      and the Sudanese People's Liberation Movement to conclude      negotiations on a comprehensive peace accord and, most      important, calls for a United Nations investigation into all      violations of international humanitarian law and human rights      law that have occurred in Darfur in order to ensure      accountability;       Whereas the United Nations Security Council, in United      Nations Security Council Resolution 1556, emphasized that the      Government of Sudan bears primary responsibility for      respecting human rights and protecting the people of Sudan;       Whereas United Nations Security Council Resolution 1556      calls upon the Government of Sudan to cooperate with the      United Nations;       Whereas the United Nations Human Rights Commission,      established in 1946 and given the responsibility of drafting      the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is responsible for      promoting respect for and observance of, human rights and      fundamental freedoms for all;       Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares      that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and      rights, that everyone is entitled to all the rights and      freedoms set forth in the Declaration regardless of race,      color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion,      or national or social origin, property, birth, or other      status, that everyone has the right to life, liberty and      security of person, that no one shall be held in slavery or      servitude, and that no one shall be subjected to torture or      to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment;       Whereas the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of      Genocide, done at Paris on December 9, 1948 (hereafter in      this resolution referred to as the ``Genocide Convention''),      delineates the criteria that constitute genocide and requires      parties to prevent and punish genocide;       Whereas Sudan is a state party to the Genocide Convention      and remains a member of the United Nations Commission on      Human Rights;       Whereas the Secretary of State determined that, according      to United States law, the Government of Sudan is a state      sponsor of terrorism and has been since 1993 and therefore      remains ineligible for United States foreign assistance;       Whereas due to the human rights situation in Darfur, it      would be consistent with United States obligations under the      Genocide Convention for the Secretary of State and the United      States Permanent Representative to the United Nations to seek      the immediate suspension of Sudan from the United Nations      Commission on Human Rights and, in the event a formal      investigation results in a determination by the United      Nations that genocide has occurred in Darfur, the ultimate      removal of Sudan from such Commission; and       Whereas it is a mockery of human rights as a universal      principle, a challenge to the United Nations as an      institution, and an affront to all responsible countries that      embrace and promote human rights that a government under      investigation by the United Nations for committing genocide      against, and violating the human rights of, its own citizens      sits in judgment of others as a member in good standing of      the United Nations Commission on Human Rights: Now,      therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives      concurring), That Congress--       (1) recognizes and approves of the findings of the      Secretary of State that genocide has occurred and may still      be occurring in Darfur, Sudan, and that the Government of      Sudan bears responsibility for such acts;       (2) supports the Secretary of State's call for a full and      unfettered investigation by the United Nations into all      violations of international humanitarian law and human rights      law that have occurred in Darfur, with a view to ensuring      accountability;       (3) supports the resolution introduced by the United States      Government in the United Nations Security Council on      September 9, 2004, with regard to the situation in Darfur;       (4) calls upon the Secretary of State and the United States      Permanent Representative to the United Nations to take      immediate steps to pursue the establishment of a formal      United Nations investigation, under Article VIII of the      Genocide Convention, to determine whether the actions of the      Government of Sudan in Darfur constitute acts of genocide;       (5) calls upon the Secretary of State and the United States      Permanent Representative to the United Nations to take      immediate steps to pursue the immediate suspension of Sudan      from the United Nations Commission on Human Rights;       (6) calls upon the Secretary of State and the United States      Permanent Representative to the United Nations to take      further steps to ensure that the suspension of Sudan from the      United Nations Commission on Human Rights remains in effect      unless and until the Government of Sudan meets all of its      obligations, as determined by the United Nations Security      Council, under United Nations Security Council Resolution      1556 of July 30, 2004, and any subsequent United Nations      Security Council resolutions regarding this matter;       (7) calls upon the Secretary of State and the United States      Permanent Representative to the United Nations to take steps      to ensure that, in the event that the formal investigation of      acts of genocide in Sudan results in a determination by the      United Nations that genocide has occurred or is occurring in      Darfur, the United States Government takes appropriate      actions to ensure that Sudan is removed from the United      Nations Human Rights Commission;       (8) calls upon the member states of the United Nations      Commission on Human Rights to convene an immediate special      session to consider the urgent and acute human rights      situation in Sudan for the purpose of considering whether      Sudan should be suspended from membership in such Commission;      and       (9) expects the Secretary of State to report to Congress on      progress made toward taking the actions and accomplishing the      objectives     outlined in this resolution not later than 60 days after the      date on which Congress agrees to the resolution.
