President, today I am submitting a Senate Resolution commending the contributions and record of a most unique and deserving man, the retiring football coach of Kansas State University Wildcats, Bill Snyder.  I suppose some, especially non sports fans, might raise an eyebrow or question a Senate Resolution congratulating a football coach, no matter how successful in wins and losses--after all, as some have said, ``it's only a game.'' But in the case of Coach Bill Snyder his contributions transcend his outstanding record of wins and losses; they represent being a mentor and teacher of leadership and values to young men during a time when collegiate athletics and sports in general face challenge after challenge involving unbecoming conduct and worse. Coach Snyder's contribution--football is a game of course but in the case of Bill Snyder one of his greatest contributions has been to enable young men to win in the game of life by being responsible citizens.  And, this unique ability on the athletic field became a catalyst for alumni interest and a renewal of financial support throughout the university enabling all students in all academic fields to benefit.  Much has been said in Kansas and throughout the football sports world about the amazing turnaround Coach Snyder achieved at K-State; directing and orchestrating a football program success story that is now considered by many to be the greatest in the history of collegiate athletics.  The record in the resolution I have introduced speaks for itself; three time national coach of the year, 11 post season bowl games, only the second program in college football history to win 11 games, 6 times in a 7-year time span, 42 NFL draft picks, 45 All America selections, and 68 first team all conference players. That is quite a record.  The coaches that first started their careers at K-State under Coach Snyder now read like a ``Who's Who'' in college football.  But great as those and the rest of the records are, that does not really tell the Bill Snyder story. Simply put, this is a man who restored and instilled a new sense of pride in a university and throughout our State. This is a man and his family who have given of themselves and contributed countless hours and resources to charitable causes throughout Kansas.  With all of his successes and attributes, this is a man who is humble, self effacing, soft spoken, and who knows you can get a lot more done if you don't care who gets the credit.  In many ways, Bill Snyder is a private man who has God given ability to inspire others in the public arena. He has taught his players that in the games of football and life, success is never final, failure is never fatal and that in the end its courage that counts. By his example, he showed them the attributes of honesty, character and reputation are not old fashioned. On the playing field and in life he instilled the truism that if you don't drop the ball you won't have to complain about the way the ball bounces. The same is true regarding his individual player marching orders, never say bad things about your opponent win or lose, take care of your self, conduct yourself in your best interests and that of your university and teammates. A coach on the field and a coach in life.  I want to get back and emphasize this restoring pride achievement on a more personal basis. I know my example is replete with similar experiences with the thousands of families who make up what is now referred to in the sports pages as the ``Wildcat Nation.''  My Dad was a proud graduate of Kansas State as I was and my son attended Kansas State--three generations. Sports fans and devoted K-State alumni all, we went through what many loyal K-Stater's call the decades of Death Valley Days, seasons of defeat, seasons of eternal optimism always tempered, if not shattered by the reality of yet another loss. There were some average seasons, a few good seasons, but ``depths of despair'' would not be an understatement for many of the faithful who endured and endured and endured. And, the defeats somehow became interwoven with the fabric of our alma mater and apologies for psychological exaggeration but even into the psyche of being a K-State graduate and our self worth.  And then came President Jon Wefald and then came Bill Snyder and both men grabbed K-State by the collar and said: Enough, we're going to win both academically and on the athletic field. And, wonder of wonders, they did just that.  Sports writers have called it a miracle. To many diehard K-State fans that was not an understatement. Winning season followed winning season and generations of alumni witnessed this success story took it to heart, loved it and lived it. It has been a grand experience. When K-State goes to a bowl game, 25,000 to 30,000 diehard fans are in attendance, win or lose.  Bill Snyder and his wife Sharon and their family gave K-State their all and Coach Snyder has given us all pride, self esteem, and confidence. It has been one heck of a trail ride for me and my family as I know it has been for countless others.  I just don't know of anyone in their chosen profession who has made more of a difference in so many people's lives than Coach Snyder. Simply put, Bill Snyder has been a class act and then some and collegiate sports, Kansas State University, the State of Kansas and his players and fans have been the beneficiaries.  Thanks Coach. ``Every Man A Wildcat!''                          ____________________[Pages S13400-S13401]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]    SENATE RESOLUTION 329--CONGRATULATING COACH BILL SNYDER FOR HIS  ACHIEVEMENTS DURING 17 YEARS AS THE HEAD FOOTBALL COACH OF THE KANSAS                        STATE UNIVERSITY WILDCATS
