 Speaker, for the benefit of my colleagues I would like to have printed in the Record this statement by high school students from Champlain Valley High School in Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people.       Mr. Gay. We are here today to discuss the benefit of school      choice. We believe it is essential in a competitive world to      have thoughtful, intelligent people. Granted, there are      always winners and losers when competition is at hand, but      that isn't to say that everyone cannot come out on top.       The world is competitive; that we have established, and      that is why school choice is absolutely necessary in an ever-     changing democracy. Would not a true democracy embrace the      true individual's right to determining their own future?       If a student excels and finds joy in the vastness of      literature, then the student shouldn't be restrained. If the      student wishes and dreams in the analytical field of      mathematics, the student shouldn't be shackled with other      burdens.       This is not to say that all liberal arts obligations should      be ignored. Students should still be held to the absolute      highest standards. A well-rounded education should remain      required as it contributes to the student's overall learning.      What it boils down to is the intrinsic need to better      ourselves.       If that student who loves literature sees that her school      has no advanced placement English class, why cannot she take      it somewhere else?       See, we do not propose that students should be allowed to      puddle jump between schools. We ask that the student find the      school that best suits their needs and take all of the      classes within that school's walls. We propose that a federal      grant be issued to the State of Vermont allowing schools to      bask in the freedom of school choice. Schools need to produce      the absolute highest quality caliber of students for the      betterment of our society as a whole.       See, here is where it gets kind of tricky because we think      that a lottery could be instilled making it fair to all      students who feel that their school can suit their needs      and to get to this lottery a lot of kids could say I do      not like my school, I want to go somewhere else, but that      is where an application process would be brought forth      because the student would have to have a need. Like I go      to CVU and to graduate from CVU you have to do a      graduation challenge. So the sole reason for a student to      want BHS instead of CVU shouldn't be because I just do not      want to take the challenge.       Mr. Burke. The grant would be used to support a study and      to make changes based on the study's outcome. We cannot      stress the point enough that we live in a competitive place.      Competition doesn't mean that there are winners and losers;      it gives a chance for everyone to do better.       Mr. Gay. We aren't proposing that the parents get a check      for $6,000; that is what the other group proposed, something      along the lines of that. We are proposing the student picks      the school that best suits their need that is a public school      because as they said, there is a separation between church      and state. The federal grant comes into play because the      federal grant would be given to the schools that have the      highest caliber of classes and the highest amount of students      leaving the loser schools is the easy way to phrase that and      the loser schools would get the grant to become winner      schools. That is why no one comes out on top. Poor schools      would take the money to become the best schools.       I take pretty much anywhere from mild to hard classes, I      excel more in literature and not all that much in math, and I      think I would be better educated at a different school that      would offer more perhaps history courses. We have essentially      four history courses at my school and we never discuss, we      never seem to discuss other parts of the world; essentially,      it is all western philosophy courses, and I think I could do      better somewhere else.       But I think overall in a public system there has to be the      best and the worse have to come together so where we are it      is pretty good, but I have heard concerns from other students      here today and it sounds like may-be we are pampered where I      go to school. CVU is a pretty rich school; we have resources      and a lot of them.       I think it could be better. I think when it comes to      education you always have to strive to do better because the      future of this entire country and the future of preserving      democracy depends on a group of intelligent people and you      have to maintain that.       Mr. Burke. I am the opposite of Neal, I excel in math and      not so well in literature. I feel I could do better because      we do not really have any type of like accelerated program at      CVU. Most of the mathematics department, if you do really      well in one class you still have to be there for the full      time you take the course even if you might be accelerated      enough that you could take it in less time or maybe a school      that offers more courses in math, not just the basic      languages.       Mr. Gay. We are not a part of the educational process at      CVU. To do that you have to be either--I think it is you have      to be an elected official and at CVU the elected officials      are essentially the same people that are on HS and all those      higher track programs. I vent my frustrations toward my own      school, I write for the ed section of the Burlington Free      Press. I use that as my own stomping grounds to perhaps lock      my opinions because I am not that well heard as a member of      the student government. Seeing that it is our education and I      think a lot of the time parents do not always know best, so I      think the students should play a more active role in the      hiring of teachers and perhaps the firing of teachers.       Mr. Burke. I feel the same way as far as if the students      had a say. I believe right now     there are one or two students involved with the actual      planning of curriculum and stuff and the way courses are, but      they do not have much say because they are students.       Mr. Gay. Thank you for hearing our concerns, Congressman      Sanders.                               ____________________
