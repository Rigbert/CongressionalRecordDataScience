Chairman, I certainly appreciate the gentleman's amendment. I have experience firsthand with Mrs. Kirkpatrick, as a matter of fact, and with Ms. McCollum. We were at the Navajo reservation about a year ago, and my back is still hurting from the road that we were on. It was quite an experience.  So they need help. I think this is a very modest amount of money. I appreciate the support that our colleagues give to Indian Country. They certainly deserve it.  I would encourage adoption of this amendment.
