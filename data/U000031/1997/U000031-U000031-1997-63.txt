Speaker, I rise today to introduce H.R. 2208--the Consumers' Nutrition and Health Information Act. I am pleased that my colleagues Representatives Ed Towns, Martin Frost, and Bobby Rush are joining me in supporting this legislation as original cosponsors.  The Consumers Nutrition and Health Information Act is designed to increase consumers' access to timely, accurate information about the health benefits of foods and nutrients. It is very similar to the language on health claims contained in the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] reform bill reported with bipartisan support by the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee last month.  The bill would permit manufacturers to make health claims on food labels without having to go through the long, complex FDA preapproval process when claims were based on authoritative statements published by the National Institutes of Health, the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention, and other Federal scientific organizations with official responsibility for public health protection or research relating directly to human nutrition. The manufacturer would be required to notify the FDA of the proposed claim 120 days before its introduction to the market and would have to provide the FDA with an explanation of the basis for the claim.  The need for this legislation is perhaps best demonstrated by history of the health claim for the nutrient folic acid. In 1992, the Public Health Service reported that about half the 2,500 neural tube birth defects such as those that result in spina bifida that occur in the United States each year are preventable with sufficient folic acid consumption among women of childbearing age. One of the most effective means of getting this information out to women would have been on food labels. But the FDA did not approve this claim for food labels until 1996, a 4-year lag.  By giving a presumption of approvability to health claims for foods based on official, authoritative statements by Federal agencies such as the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, this legislation will better ensure the public's timely access to this important information. And by retaining the FDA's right to review such claims for 120 days before they are made, the legislation protects against false or misleading claims going to market.  I encourage my colleagues to join Representatives Towns, Frost, Rush and me in cosponsoring this bill. Your support will highlight the importance of this reform and ensure that it is a key element of any broader FDA reform effort that may be undertaken in this Congress.                          ____________________
