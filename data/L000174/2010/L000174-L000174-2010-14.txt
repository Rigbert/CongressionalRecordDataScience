President, today the Senate will pass a measure to help State sentencing commissions make responsible decisions. The legislation we pass today will give State sentencing commissions, like that in Vermont, access to criminal history data in the possession of the Attorney General. This will facilitate the study of recidivism rates and other important factors affecting public safety.  We all want to reduce crime and keep our neighborhoods safe, and, in these hard fiscal times, we must do so effectively and efficiently. It is important for State sentencing commissions to have access to data so they can properly study aggravating and mitigating factors in criminal cases and in return, better inform policy makers. This bill will help ensure that sentencing decisions are data-driven, using the best possible universe of information.
