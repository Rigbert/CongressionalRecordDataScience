Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to Mylo ``Mike'' Johnsen, who passed away in California on Thursday, April 26, 2018. Mike, a devoted family man, served his nation in World War II, and volunteered with senior and youth organizations in his community. He will be deeply missed.  According to his family, Mike was the last known living soldier of his World War II Army Battalion. He spent four years in the Army and was part of the 535th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Automatic Weapons Battalion. The unit was based and trained at Camp Hahn, California, which is now the location of the Riverside National Cemetery. The 535th landed on the beach during the invasion at Normandy on D-Day, June 6,1944, fought throughout France and Belgium, including at the Battle of the Bulge and were eventually part of the Victory in Europe on May 8, 1945. We are forever indebted to Mike, who helped liberate Europe from tyranny.  Survived by his wife of 69 years, Mike cherished spending time with his family, which included five children, 12 grandchildren, 25 great grandchildren, and 13 great-great grandchildren. Mike worked 32 years for Rockwell/Boeing as a Quality Assurance Inspector and Engineer, contributing to many projects including Apollo Missions 3 through 17, B1 Bomber, MX missiles, three space shuttles and Navstar, the first satellite navigation system. Mike was a member of the Free Masons for over 50 years and an active adult leader with his children's various organizations, sports and activities. When Mike retired in Las Vegas, he taught western line-dancing at senior centers for 25 years and supported community events for children with intellectual disabilities at the Professional Bull Riders Finals until he was 91 years old.  I extend my heartfelt condolences to the Johnsen family, his friends, and everyone fortunate enough to know Mike. Although Mike may be gone, the many contributions he made to his country, community and family will have a lasting impact.                          ____________________
