 President, I rise today to pay tribute to Ralph Boling for his service to the state of Kentucky and the people of Hancock County. Ralph recently completed a special five-year term as Hancock County's Judge/Executive, during which he led the county through a remarkable period of growth and progress.  Before beginning his political career, Ralph was a farmer and businessman in Hancock County, working as an oil field driller, farmer, Hancock County Road Foreman and as the Hawesville Water Superintendent. His work outside of public service gave him the advantage of having first-hand knowledge of the struggles of working families, and shaped his desire to make a difference in the Hawesville community.  Following in his father's footsteps, Ralph's first endeavor in politics was a run for Hancock County Sheriff. He ran successfully in 1969, and again in 1977, serving two terms as Sheriff. In the final months of his second term, President Ronald Reagan appointed Ralph as a United States Marshal for the Western district of Kentucky. He excelled as a U.S. Marshal and received a second appointment under President Reagan and a third appointment under President George Bush. During his 12 years of service, Ralph received two of the highly distinguished ``Awards for Excellent Performance.''  While Ralph was honored to work in the Marshal's service, and loved his work under both President Reagan and President Bush's administrations, after his third term he decided it was time to exclusively serve the people of Hancock County. Ralph ran for Hancock County Judge/Executive and was elected to serve a special five-year term. Ralph always had the best interest of the county at heart, and encouraged the fiscal court to work together as a team despite political differences.  During his term as Judge/Executive, Ralph made great strides for Hancock County. He successfully led the effort to close the county landfill and was instrumental in assuring the construction of a new Emergency Services Building. The county also built a new fire station, and purchased additional fire trucks and police cruisers for increased public safety.  One of Ralph's achievements as Judge/Executive was his successful effort to build and repair many county roads. During Ralph's last two years as Judge, the fiscal court spent $2 million on Hancock roads, and obtained state funding to pave roads to Commonwealth Aluminum and Willamette and build bridges on Indian Hill and Goernig Road. He also helped establish the Hancock County Career Center. Ralph envisioned a bright future for Hancock County's workers and businesses, and he believed this center would be to the long-term benefit of the county.  Ralph's term as Judge/Executive has ended, but Hancock County will feel the effects of his accomplishments for years to come. His motto was ``Together we can make a difference,'' and he has certainly proven this to be true. Ralph worked together with local law enforcement, state government, the U.S. Marshal's service and the Fiscal Court to make tremendous differences in people's lives. My colleagues and I thank you, Ralph, for your many years of service to Hancock County, the State of Kentucky and the United States.                          ____________________
