 This is ``let's pretend'' time. Let's pretend this is a fair process when a meaningful amendment that lost only by two votes in committee to screen 100 percent of the containers coming to America is not allowed. Are we afraid of the democratic process here on the floor?  Let's pretend that the unverified paperwork certification of shippers, C-TPAT and CIS, are meaningful and provide real security despite the numerous reports we have about their extraordinary failures, including the most recent one where a C-TPAT, CIS-based company and port provided 15 Chinese in a container delivered to the United States of America. That could have been 15 tactical nuclear weapons in that container instead of people attempting to sneak into the United States.  Here is how it works: you are a foreign company. You want to ship to the U.S. You go online on your computer. You fill out a form online. You immediately get the score of your products and your shipping reduced to the United States of America. It no longer is as much of a threat because you filled out a form online, whoever you might be; you might be Osama bin Laden in a cave, we don't know.  Okay. Well, then we are going to send someone around to certify you are who you said you are and you really have the paperwork plan you told us you have. Unfortunately, we do not have enough people to do that. It will be 1 to 3 years before either a U.S. inspector or a contractor comes by for one day, one time, to make sure you are not a bad guy and you might not ship bad things here.  That is quite a system. That is C-TPAT. It is a faith-based honor system. Here it is: they will send us a manifest. Now a manifest says 100 concrete bird baths, but what if it is 99 concrete bird baths and one tactical nuclear weapon? Well, they are in the C-TPAT program; they would not phony up a manifest. Of course, again, you have 6 months to adjust your manifest after your product arrives in the United States because you know everybody says manifests are not accurate.  We do not know who the people are, and the manifests are not accurate, but that's the security we have today.  The Deputy Secretary of TSA, Mr. Jackson, admits there is a risk. He says, well, they do not want to screen all the containers on the other side of the ocean, even though the technology exists. Despite what the gentlewoman from Florida said, it exists, it works and it does not unduly delay. You can drive by it at 10 miles per hour.  He says the vision of the Bush administration is, they are going to screen ultimately, with technology, 100 percent of the containers before they leave United States ports for the interior of the U.S., but they might contain threats. Now, wait a minute. We are going to put them in our ports, but we think they might have threats, but we will inspect them before they go inland? I guess the ports are sacrifice zones. I guess most of our ports are inblue States. No, Florida was a red State. I am not sure why they want to sacrifice those ports in those States.  This is extraordinary to me that we are not being allowed this one simple amendment, and let us pretend that they are not under unbelievable pressure from Wal-Mart and other shippers of goods to the United States to not do anything meaningful because it will cost a couple of bucks more per container.                              {time}  1845
