President, for the information of my colleagues, I just wanted to list the cosponsors of the amendment that I described having to do with critical infrastructure. I listed the cosponsors of the amendment that deals with protecting civilian agencies but neglected to do so on the other. It is a bipartisan amendment. It is cosponsored by three other members of the Intelligence Committee: Senator Warner, Senator Coats, and Senator Hirono.  I just wanted that to be clear. I think it is significant that those members of the Intelligence Community do believe we need to go further in this arena.  I yield the floor.
