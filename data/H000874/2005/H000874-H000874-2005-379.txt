Speaker, I thank the gentleman for that information. Realizing that next week is a busy week and there are a number of very important items on the agenda, how likely, Mr. Leader, do you think it is that we will be in on Friday?  I yield to the distinguished gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding. There is no way that we can tell what hour of the day on Friday that we might be finished with our work. As the gentleman knows, next week is going to be a typical pre-district work period week. We have several bills to consider, as well as multiple potential conference reports. Because of the unpredictability of conference reports, I would hesitate to even make firm commitments for any of the week.  For now, I would note that our plan is to consider both postal reform and small business health plans on Tuesday, and after that we will have to see where various components are and how they come together.
