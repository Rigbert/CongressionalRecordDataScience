Chairman, I move to strike the requisite number of words.  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the substitute.  Mr. Chairman, this is a ``while I'' speech. While I share the concern and admire the leadership of Messrs. Boehlert and Shays and formerly Mr. Saxton, I must rise in opposition to this amendment.  Let the record show that I am for a clean Chesapeake Bay. Let the record show I hope the gentleman from New Jersey is able to swim as long as he wants in the Susquehanna, or whatever. But I must say that agriculture has a stake in this. I think there has been debate here, and as chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture, I feel compelled to inform Members that most of those interested in agriculture are very concerned about this substitute.  Now, you are going to say ``Who is that,'' and I am going to tell you. The Agricultural Retailers, American Association of Nurserymen, American Crop Protection Association, American Farm Bureau, American Feed Industry, American Sheep Industry, American Soybean Association, CF Industries, Inc., Agriculture Association, Farmland Industries, the dairymen, and National Association of State Departments of Agriculture. They are extremely important as you work on the environment. You have got to work with the state departments of agriculture as well as the state departments of environmental protection.  We have the wheat growers, the cattlemen, the corn growers, the cotton council. I can go on and on and on. But basically all of agriculture says while they understand the concern and the apprehension of those who have offered this substitute, that we need this bill. We need the other bill.  Now, why? Let me also add, if you are from rural and small town America, the National Federation of Independent Business, one of the many outfits here that rates Members of Congress. Some Members of Congress that are about, wake up in the offices, wake up here. The NFIB rating, two times, one on the substitute and one on final passage. They are opposed to the substitute; they are for the final passage.  Why would the NFIB and agriculture indicate their opposition to the substitute? Well, the substitute allows the 1987 Core Delineation Manual to be used for making wetlands determinations. That is the manual that has caused all the problems. That has been the problem.  This bill sets out a better determination, a much better definition. This 1987 manual would let the regulators decide wetland hydrology by looking at watermarks on trees, even though there is no water on the land. A parcel of land could be damp a foot below the surface and still meet their requirement. That has been part of the problem. We do require 21 consecutive days where a wetland would be wet. I think that makes a little sense. If more than 50 percent of the vegetation on the land is made up of plants that also thrive in other areas, well, there you are, that requirement of qualification is met.  This bill, the chairman's bill, the bill that we also support on the House Committee on Agriculture, requires some water-loving wetland plant to be present. I think that makes common sense.  I will tell you, I know the gentleman from New York, [Mr. Boehlert] and the gentleman from Michigan, [Mr. Dingell] and I have the utmost respect for him, has said it does not harm agriculture. I know the gentleman has made a very honest effort in that regard. But the chairman's bill allows State and local cooperation to restore a wetland ecosystem.  You know what? We have debated this and debated this. No one here knows exactly what an ecosystem is, a wetlands ecosystem, and that is the problem. Because when these matters end up in a Federal District Court, the judge then turns to the EPA and the Fish and Wildlife Service to tell him what a wetlands ecosystem is, and we are right back to the regulator and we are right back to the problem that has caused all of the problem in regards to farm country.  We have heard a lot about the Chesapeake and the Susquehanna. We have got a river in Kansas, one of the few rivers in Kansas. It is called the Arkansas. There is a community there called Great Bend, Kansas. And we heard a lot about nutrients and the different standards.  That community is now going to spend $12 million for a new waterworks system. You know why? There is too much chlorine in the water. It could endanger an endangered species fish called the shiner in the local river. One basic problem, there is no water in the river and there is no fish. Now, other than that, it makes a great deal of common sense.  That is an extreme example, but that is the kind of thing we are facing in agriculture. Low spots in the field where, as I said before, no self-respecting duck would ever land.  I urge you, if you come from rural and small town America, if you care about the NFIB rating, and if you serve on the Committee on Agriculture, vote against this substitute and support the bill.  amendment offered by mr. minge to the amendment in the nature of a                     substitute offered by mr. saxton
