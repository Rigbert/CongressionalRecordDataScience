Since independent expenditures and so-called legislativeadvocacy ads, which have been so widely condemned by the reformers, are constitutionally protected speech, doesn't the Senator think it is entirely possible that the Congress, given the power to control that speech by those outside groups, might decide to shut it off entirely, conclude there is nothing reasonable about any of those kinds of expressions, if this amendment were to be passed?
