Speaker, it is with great honor and admiration that I offer my congratulations to many of Northwest Indiana's most talented, dedicated, and hardworking individuals. On Friday, July 29, 2005, the Lake County Electricians Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee IBEW & NECA will honor the Completion Class of 2005 at the 50th Annual Apprentice Completion Banquet, which will be held at the Avalon Manor Banquet Hall in Hobart, IN.  They will be recognizing and honoring the 2005 apprentice graduates. Those individuals who have completed the apprentice training are: Joseph Anderson, Randall Bard, Jacques Berbesque, Robert Brannon, Feliciano Bucio, Jonathan Buczek, Christopher Buitron, Jeff Campbell, Larry Chandler, Eric Cisneros, Keenan Collier, Cameron Collins, Steve Cruise, Lester Daniel, Brian Derolf, J. Matt Dees, Todd Dodd, Lou Donaldson, Phil Dorin, Jeremy Drenth, Ryan Ferry, H. Tom Floyd, Julianne Guidotti, Tom Guined, Eddie Jackson, David McCarty, Scott Morgan, Steve Petri, Nate Plants, Derek Popovich, Timothy Ramsey, Ryan Rentschler, R. Chad Robinson, Nick Roper, Nick Santostefano, Robert Severa, Aaron Shelton, Ivan Simmons, Tom Stidham, and Jonathan Vicari.  Northwest Indiana has a rich history of excellence in its craftsmanship and loyalty by its tradesmen. These graduates are all outstanding examples of each. They have mastered their trade and have demonstrated their loyalty to both the union and the community through their hard work and self-sacrifice.  Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in congratulating these hardworking individuals. Along with all the other men and women of Northwest Indiana's unions, these individuals have contributed to the growth and development of the economy of the First Congressional District, and I am very proud to honor them in Washington, DC.                          ____________________
