President, my friend the Senator from Nevada has given me more credit than I deserve, but I do strongly support the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, as just that, a matter of fairness, as something we should do. Whether we have a large immigrant population in our States or not, this is something where Senators are going to reflect the conscience of the Nation, as this body should.  My question is this. I was over at one of our latest investigation committee meetings. We tend to investigate rather than legislate in this body. I was at a meeting where the Senate decided to go ahead and investigate the Wen Ho Lee investigation and, thus, hold up the FBI, who were supposed to be debriefing Dr. Wen Ho Lee today under the court agreement. Instead, in the Senate we jumped in, feet first, to interfere with that. I had to be off the floor to serve as Ranking Democrat of Judiciary at that hearing. So I wonder if the Senator from Nevada could explain the parliamentary procedure in which we find ourselves. It seems somewhat of a strange one.
