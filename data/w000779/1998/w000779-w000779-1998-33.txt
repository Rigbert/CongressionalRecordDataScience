 I think it would be helpful, and perhaps the chairman would lay it out, to know that through this discussion there has been an effort to link the grandfather provision effort to make sure that States and localities that already have laws on the books are protected and to link that to the moratorium so that there would be an effort to be fair to both sides. I think the Senator has been very fair, and perhaps the Senator could elaborate a little bit on some of the challenges with respect to that grandfather debate.  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator repeat his question?
