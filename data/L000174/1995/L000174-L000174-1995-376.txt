President, this is indeed a well thought out amendment. It is an issue we have spent years working on. There have been debates here. There have been debates at the United Nations. The President of the United States has called for the eventual elimination of antipersonnel landmines. The United States has joined with other nations, virtually all other nations, in calling for that.  We cannot pass laws and tell other countries what to do, but we can say that we will start to limit our use of antipersonnel landmines, to challenge other countries to do the same.  It is not a question of putting our young people at risk in war. It is a question of trying to protect our young people today. Today we have far more of our people in danger of being killed or maimed by the proliferation of landmines in parts of the world where we send peacekeepers, where we send medical personnel, where we send USAID people. Can anybody imagine what it is going to be like in the former Yugoslavia, if the fighting ever stops and we have to go in and help clean up well over a million landmines?  Even with the millions that were strewn in the Persian Gulf war, that was not what won that war. Most were Iraqi mines. But in the aftermath we saw Kuwait, a wealthy country, spend $1 billion to try to clear a portion of the landmines there, and 85 people died doing it--after the fighting. Not during it, but after the fighting, from clearing landmines.  As one who testified before the Senate, a relief worker from Colorado, said, when a landmine went off under his Jeep he sat there with his foot in his hand, trying to put it back on.  Those are the people damaged. This amendment permits 3 years, as we told the Pentagon to do, to develop alternatives to landmines.
