Speaker, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to my good friend Randy Record. At the end of the year, Randy will be stepping down after serving four years as Chairman of the Board of Directors for the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California. Metropolitan is a regional wholesaler and the largest distributor of treated drinking water in the United States.  As a Riverside County native, Randy has been active in the San Jacinto farming community for over three decades. In addition, Randy currently owns and operates a wine grape vineyard in the Central Coast with his wife and two daughters. Randy is currently an executive committee member of the Southern California Leadership Council, as well as a member of the Riverside County Farm Bureau, the California Association of Winegrape Growers, the Monday Morning Group of Western Riverside County, and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association.  In 2001, Randy was elected to serve on the Eastern Municipal Water District's Board of Directors. Just two years later, Randy was chosen to represent Eastern on Metropolitan's Board. Randy's path followed in the footsteps of his father, Clayton A. Record, Jr., who served as Eastern's representative to Metropolitan's Board from June 1999 to January 2001. As both a past president of the Association of California Water Agencies and, more recently, as Chairman of Metropolitan's Board, Randy has demonstrated tremendous leadership in addressing California's unending list of water challenges. The proposed California WaterFix project is one of the most ambitious water infrastructure projects in the history of our state, if not the nation. The project's goal of providing a reliable and affordable source of water to tens of millions of California families and businesses will play a major role in shaping the future of our state. Randy's leadership on this project has been instrumental in moving the project forward.  Without Randy's tireless advocacy and the strong relationships he's developed over the years throughout the state, projects like the WaterFix and Metropolitan's other policy objectives simply would not be possible. As Randy's friend and as his colleague in the water policy arena, I am incredibly proud of the many accomplishments he's achieved during his tenure as Metropolitan's Chairman. Randy will continue to serve on the Board for both Eastern and Metropolitan, and I look forward to our continued work together to provide California with water solutions.                          ____________________
