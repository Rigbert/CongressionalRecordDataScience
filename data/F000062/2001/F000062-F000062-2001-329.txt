 President, I would like to take the opportunity to recognize and honor two exceptional research scientists from one of the world's finest oceanographic research facilities who lost their lives in recent weeks. Both were two of the brightest stars at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, in La Jolla, California.  Michael Mullin, a research biologist at Scripps, and undergraduate professor at the University of California, San Diego, died December 19th of complications following surgery. He was 63 years old.  His research over the past 36 years at Scripps has included the study of phytoplankton, zooplankton and larval fish in the marine food web.  He was the author of more than 70 scientific publications, including his own book ``Webs and Scales.'' He also served as chief editor of the scientific journal ``Fisheries Oceanography.''  Dr. Mullin's personal sense of the social and moral obligations of science made him a true leader in undergraduate programs at UCSD and at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He was as committed to the education of young students as he was to the practice of science and he will be greatly missed.  Mia Jean Tegner, a research marine biologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography since 1969, died Sunday, January 7th in a scuba diving accident off the San Diego coast. She was 53 years old.  An experienced scuba diver, Dr. Tegner made more than 4,000 dives throughout the world during her 31 years at Scripps. Her research focused on the ecology of kelp forest communities and near shore marine resources. Her most recent research included studies of the effects of El Nino and La Nina events on the coastal ecosystem.  Also socially active and committed to the marine environment, Mia Tegner helped to guide the City of San Diego in developing public policy based on science as it related to ocean pollution. Her work led the way in focusing the nation's attention to the true impacts of human development on the health of our marine environment.  As we take the time to honor the work of Dr. Michael Mullin and Dr. Mia Tegner we must also reflect on their commitment to providing us with a better understanding of our world and our relationship with it.  I am pleased to recognize and salute these great scientists as two of our nation's outstanding citizens and noble public servants.                          ____________________
