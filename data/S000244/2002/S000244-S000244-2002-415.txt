Chairman, I believe this amendment is also a very constructive amendment. Before we figure out how to deal with new immigrants, we have to figure out what to do with the 5 million case backlog we already have, and I think having innovative pilot programs, shuffling paperwork, seeing what works and seeing what does not but, more importantly, getting us automated and having a lot of the paperwork being changed from paper to electronic paper is going to mean that these adjudications take place in a timely manner and we will not have to have people getting fingerprinted 4 times before they can get a green card.  So I would hope that this amendment would be speedily adopted.
