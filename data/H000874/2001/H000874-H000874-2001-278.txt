Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to a fallen member of the congressional community whose sudden passing reminds us how precious and fragile life is. On Monday, May 14, 2001, Officer Adam T. Popielarcheck, a 17-year veteran of the Library of Congress Police, lost his life in a traffic accident near his home in Mechanicsville, Maryland. Officer Popielarcheck's death saddens not only his own family, but also his fellow Library Police officers and numerous other employees of the Library, where he had embarked upon a second career after retiring as a lieutenant from the Washington, D.C., Metropolitan Police Department in 1983.  Millions of people visit the Capitol complex each year, and hundreds of thousands of them visit America's national treasure, the Library of Congress, whose buildings also grace Capitol Hill directly across the street. Although most Library visitors, and perhaps some employees, may never have known Adam Popielarcheck's name, they and indeed we all, owe him a debt of gratitude. It was Mr. Popielarcheck's job to help assure the safety and security of Library visitors, staff and collections, and he did it superbly every day. His colleagues have amply demonstrated since his death that they held Adam Popielarcheck in the highest esteem, both personally and professionally, and that he is sorely missed.  Officer Popielarcheck is also sorely missed by his widow, Maryellen, and by his sons, Thomas and Adam W.; his daughters, Tina and Tammy; his mother, Angelene; five brothers; two sisters; and by the many nieces, nephews, other relatives, and countless friends he leaves behind across the Washington, D.C., area, in Southern Maryland, in Pennsylvania, where he was born 60 years ago, and elsewhere.  Mr. Speaker, in this time of sorrow for the Popielarcheck family and the entire congressional community, let us pause and reflect on the life of a valued and wonderful man, Adam T. Popielarcheck, who toiled among us here, gave us his best and left us far too soon.                          ____________________
