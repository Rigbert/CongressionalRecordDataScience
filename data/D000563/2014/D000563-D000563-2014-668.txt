 There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                Congress of the United States,                                 Washington, DC, January 15, 2014.     Hon. Chuck Hagel,     Secretary of Defense, U.S. Department of Defense, The          Pentagon, Washington, DC.       Dear Secretary Hagel: We are writing to clarify the intent      of Section 8102 of the Department of Defense Appropriations      Act contained in the Consolidated Appropriations Bill, 2014.      This language should not be interpreted in any way to      supersede Section 2822 of the National Defense Authorization      Act for Fiscal Year 2014 (Public Law 113-66).       We concur with the direction contained in the National      Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 and fully      expect that funds will only be obligated for projects in Guam      once the Department complies with Section 2822.       Thank you for your attention to this matter.           Sincerely,     Thad Cochran,       Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations,      Subcommittee on Defense.     Richard J. Durbin,       Chairman, Senate Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee      on Defense.     Pete Visclosky,       Ranking Member, House Committee on Appropriations,      Subcommittee on Defense.     Rodney Frelinghuysen,       Chairman, House Committee on Appropriations, Subcommittee      on Defense.
