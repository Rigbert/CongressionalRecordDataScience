Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the gentleman's motion to instruct.  H.R. 889, which was passed unanimously by this House, includes a provision that would increase liability limits by approximately 50 percent for double-hull tank vessels and would, for the first time, establish higher liability limits for single-hull tank vessels.  This legislation was developed through the regular committee process on a completely bipartisan basis.  Further, this bill is supported by the oil and shipping industries as a commonsense measure that both increases the industries' responsibilities and maintains the protections of the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund to deal with any other major oil spills in the future.  Mr. Speaker, this motion to instruct is one I agree with and, therefore, I urge that we accept it.  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.
