 President, GAO's argument about targeting applies to decreases in Medicaid due to the recession. This isn't about targeting. This is seven times more than is needed for Medicaid. I will agree to targeting for that $10.8 billion. The rest should be more fairly targeted.  This amendment should be a simple vote. The complex funding formula for spending the $87 billion in Medicare in this bill is not fair. It should be a flat increase to all States.  That is what my amendment does. Thirty-four States do better with the formula under my amendment. So you can vote to give your State its fair share or, if you vote against it, you are voting not to give them that fair share.  I yield the floor. As long as the other side's time is used up, I yield back the remainder of my time.
