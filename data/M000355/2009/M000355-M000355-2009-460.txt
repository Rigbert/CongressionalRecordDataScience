 President, the majority leader said it well. No one has done more for his country than John McCain. We are all privileged to be able to serve with him in the Senate.  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank both leaders. I thank my friend from Nevada. He and I came to the House of Representatives together many years ago. I thank him for his leadership. Ashe mentioned, we have strong disagreements from time to time, but we have always made a strong effort--and I think successfully--to remain respectful of each other's views. I appreciate his kind words today and that of the Republican leader. I thank them.                          ____________________
