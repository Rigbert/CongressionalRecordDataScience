 We hope to have those resolutions considered and adopted in a short while. The two resolutions will make majority and minority committee appointments for the 109th Congress, as well as officially appoint the chairmen and ranking members for each of those committees.  In addition to that business, today at 1 p.m. we will have a joint meeting with the House to count electoral votes. Members should begin gathering in the Senate Chamber at 12:40 this afternoon so we may depart as a body at 12:50.  Senators have been asking about the possibility of rollcall votes during today's session. At this point we have to say, unfortunately, that rollcall votes are still possible during today's session. As always, we will alert Members as the voting schedule becomes more clear. Once we have adopted our committee resolutions and the electoral vote count is completed, it is my intention the Senate will adjourn until January 20, Inauguration Day.  I will have more to say on the schedule today before the Senate closes.                          ____________________[Page S35]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]                                SCHEDULE  Mr. McCONNELL.
