 Representative Carolyn McCarthy has been the leader in the House. I thank her for her leadership in enacting the Civil Rights History Project Act into law.  This is an amendment that would direct $250,000 in salaries and expenses at the Smithsonian Institution to be used for the Civil Rights History Project. This is a project that was authorized by law in May of this year. It will give us a permanent historical record of the firsthand stories of the individuals who risked and sacrificed in the civil rights movement.
