 President, today I wish to recognize U.S. Army CPT Lewis Larkin O'Hern III for his extraordinary dedication to duty andhonorable service to our Nation. During his exemplary career with the Army from May 2008 to January 2017, Captain O'Hern made an immense impact on those he worked with both in the Army and here in Congress.  Captain O'Hern was born at Madigan Army Medical Center at Fort Lewis, WA, and grew up in a military family before graduating from Belton High School in Belton, Texas, in 2004. He received his commission from the U.S. Military Academy at West Point in 2008. After completing the infantry office basic course, airborne school, and Ranger school at Fort Benning, GA, he was assigned to the 101st Airborne Division, Air Assault, at Fort Campbell, KY, where he served as a rifle platoon leader. He deployed to Kandahar in June 2010 and, after 7 months in Afghanistan was severely wounded, suffering the loss of both legs and a hand. In the course of his 2 and a half year recovery, Captain O'Hern completed the Defense Strategy Course and worked as a future operations planner at U.S. Army North. In 2013, Captain O'Hern was accepted into the Army's prestigious Congressional Fellowship Program. He earned a master's degree in legislative affairs from George Washington University and in 2014 served as my defense legislative fellow. Following his fellowship, Captain O'Hern continued to serve as an Army legislative liaison in the Office of the Chief Legislative Liaison.  Captain O'Hern has performed at the top of his profession throughout his career, providing motivation and serving as a role model for his fellow servicemembers and colleagues. Captain O'Hern demonstrated his impressive intellect in all duties, questioning assumptions and pushing team members to achieve their highest potential. He easily grasped the complexities of policymaking and the appropriations processes, greatly contributing to both while in my office.  Part of what makes Captain O'Hern such a remarkable leader is that his great intellect is coupled with incredible humanity and compassion. I witnessed his inexhaustible drive to provide assistance to fellow servicemembers and veterans, which is in the image of some of the Army's greatest leaders. I was privileged to have Captain O'Hern as an enormously important member of my legislative team. His contributions continue to resonate today.  Captain O'Hern models resilience and determination. His story is a testament to the power of a positive can-do attitude and a shining of example of the refusal to let obstacles stand in his way. Captain O'Hern's inspirational journey would not have been possible without the unfailing support from his exceptional wife. Mrs. Rachel Brooks O'Hern was an integral partner in Captain O'Hern's recovery. In addition to undertaking her substantial caregiver role, Rachel also built an impressive career of her own, serving the wider veteran community.  It is my honor to recognize this remarkable couple and congratulate Captain O'Hern on his military retirement as he proceeds to the next chapter of his life. I ask the entire country to thank him for his service and dedication.                          ____________________
