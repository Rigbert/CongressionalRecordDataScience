President, today I am introducing the Veterans' Survivor Education Enhancement Act. This legislation would expand education benefits for the survivors and dependents of fallen servicemembers.  Specifically, the legislation would adjust the Survivors' and Dependents' Educational Assistance Program by increasing the dependent benefit to $80,000 which the dependent can draw against for any period between the ages of 17 and 30. This benefit may be used for any expenses incurred while pursuing an education, including: tuition, fees, books, room, and board. Education benefits may be used for degree and certificate programs, apprenticeship, and on-the-job training. The surviving spouse benefit also will rise to $80,000 and may be used by the spouse for 20 years after the death of the servicemember.  Of the 24.3 million veterans currently alive, nearly three-quarters served during a war or an official period of conflict. About a quarter of the Nation's population, approximately 63 million people, are potentially eligible for veterans' benefits and services because they are veterans, family members or survivors of veterans. Since the dependents program was enacted in 1956, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) also has assisted in the education of more than 700,000 dependents of veterans whose deaths or total disabilities were service-connected. In 2005, VA helped pay for the education or training of 336,347 veterans and active-duty personnel, 87,589 reservists and National Guardsmen and 74,360 survivors.  Surviving families of veterans have already given so much to our Nation. We need to give the widowed spouses and children a helping hand. Therefore, in honor of these families and our brave fallen servicemembers, I encourage my colleagues to support the Veterans' Survivor Education Enhancement Act and cosponsor this important legislation.  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                 S. 698       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans' Survivors      Education Enhancement Act of 2007''.     SEC. 2.
