President, I introduce private relief legislation for Ms. Rose-Marie Barbeau-Quinn. Senator Hatfield championed Ms. Barbeau-Quinn's cause in the 104th Congress, and at his request and the request of many in the Portland area, I and Senator Smith are now picking up the legislation to make Ms. Barbeau-Quinn a citizen of this country.  Ms. Barbeau-Quinn, a native of Canada, is a long time member of the Portland community and resident of Oregon. She lived in Portland with her now deceased husband, Mr. Michael Quinn since 1976, and together they ran the Vat and Tonsure Tavern, a unique and respected restaurant in the Portland area. While Ms. Barbeau-Quinn and her husband lived together for over 16 years, they did not actually marry until shortly before Michael Quinn's death in 1991.  Since Oregon does not recognize common law marriage, and Ms. Barbeau-Quinn was not married the 2 years required by immigration law, she has not been able to file for permanent residency in this country. While I do not intend to introduce many private relief bills, because of Senator Hatfield's involvement in this matter and Ms. Barbeau-Quinn's compelling case, I think it is appropriate that the Senate pass legislation to ensure that Ms. Barbeau-Quinn remains a member of the Portland community for many years to come.                                 ______                                       By
