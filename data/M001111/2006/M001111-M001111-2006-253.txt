 President, the Senator from Alaska just made a point that I think is critical that we understand. During the debate prior to the Senator coming to the floor, the point was made by the Senator from Oklahoma that there are a number of other backup systems that are available to users of the system in the coastal waters off Alaska and other States.  From what I just heard from the Senator from Alaska--and I want to clarify this--because of the mountainous regions, because of the inaccessibility and a lot of the difficult geographic locations that exist within his State, we are not positive that many of those backup systems work; is that correct?
