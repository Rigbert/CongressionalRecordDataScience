 President, hearings on the Environmental Protection Agency's regulatory agenda will be held in Kentucky this week. One hearing will be held today in Frankfort and another later this week in Pikeville. Since Congress is in session this week, I will not be able to attend these important hearings in person, but I will have a representative on hand at each hearing, and I wish to express my thoughts on the matter on the Senate floor.  Similar to most of the country, Kentucky is suffering from very difficult economic times. Far too many Kentuckians are unemployed, and the prospect for future employment remains daunting. That is why it is especially irritating that this administration has blindly followed ideological policies that eliminate jobs in our communities.
