 President, today I am pleased to join Senator Dodd in submitting a common-sense Senate resolution to raise public awareness of the need for all Americans to plan ahead for their long-term care needs.  Earlier this year, the Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, held a hearing to explore the challenges of providing long-term care for the baby boomer generation. A key message from that hearing was that policy makers need to encourage personal responsibility for financing long-term care.  It is difficult to pay for long-term care even when one has worked hard and saved for retirement. It's impossible when a family is not prepared. Unfortunately, many seniors and their families find out too late that they have not saved enough. Today's average cost of nursing home care is about $40,000 a year. When individuals are faced with a chronic or disabling condition in retirement, they often quickly exhaust their resources. As a result, these individuals turn to Medicaid for help. In fact, the care for nearly 2 out of every 3 nursing home residents is paid for by Medicaid.  As policy makers, our job is to develop policies for public programs that can deliver efficient and cost-effective services. Yet, equally important is the role of private long-term care financing. We must inform everyone about the importance of planning for potential long-term care needs. And, we must provide incentives now for the baby boomer generation to prepare financially for their retirement.  As Congress works to prepare for a growing demand for long-term care services, the role of private long-term care insurance must not be ignored. Over the past ten years, the long-term care insurance market has grown significantly. The products that are available today are affordable and of high quality.  This common-sense proposal has also been introduced in the House of Representatives by Congress Shays where it has received strong bi-partisan support. I encourage my colleagues in theSenate to so-sponsor this worthwhile proposal. And, I look forward to the passage of this resolution this year.                          ____________________
