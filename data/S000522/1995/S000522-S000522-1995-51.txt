Mr. Chairman, in 1993, my amendment was passed on the floor of this House that encouraged greater cooperation between NASA and USDA.  The amendment directed NASA and the Department of Agriculture to work together to make better use of NASA's remote-sensing data for agriculture. Our space program has resulted in development of remote technology that could greatly improve agriculture. Using remote sensing, we will be better able to, one, anticipate potential food, feed, and fiber shortages or gluts; two, predict impending famines and forest infestations and try to prevent or mitigate them; three, provide information on condition of crops and croplands; four, assist farmers in the application of pesticides, nutrients, water to maximize crop yields and protect the environment; and, five, to provide farmers with better information to decide what kind of crops to plant to meet market demands.                              {time}  1845  The amendment supporting that effort was part of the NASA authorizing bill in both 1993 and 1994 and had the support of the gentleman from California [Mr. Brown] and the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Walker] of the Committee on Science, as well as the gentleman from Texas [Mr. de la Garza] and the gentleman from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] of the Committee on Agriculture.  As we reduce funding for agricultural programs by $13 billion and move towards a free market, it makes sense to use all available information and technologies for farmers and ranchers.  Mr. Chairman, I applaud the effort of the Committee on Appropriations in the report language on commercial technology programs. This program makes available dollars for allowing NASA-developed technologies for commercial use. I hope in some small way that we can also allow American agriculture to expand exports to world markets by assuring that American farmers and ranchers have the information available through NASA technology to predict supply and demand more accurately, and we are more able to do that, and I compliment the technology we have achieved, and I am hoping that the chair of the subcommittee supports that effort.
