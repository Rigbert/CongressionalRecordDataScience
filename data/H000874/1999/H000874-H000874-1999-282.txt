Speaker, on Monday, this Nation and baseball lovers around the world mourned the passing of the Yankee Clipper. Joe DiMaggio's career was certainly brilliant and worthy of the praise and the eulogies we have heard these past few days. As a testament to his career, many people who never saw him swing a bat or steal a base felt a sense of loss, a loss felt not only for the man but for the institution that he so nobly represented, the game of baseball.  Baseball, Mr. Speaker, transcends generations. The names of Ruth, Gehrig, Mantle and Aaron are as familiar to baseball fans of today as they were during their playing days.  Baseball also transcends borders, Mr. Speaker. The passion we Americans have for the game of baseball is not confined to this nation. That same passion can be found in many parts of the globe, including the nation of Cuba.  On March 28, the Baltimore Orioles will travel to Havana, Cuba, in pursuit of that passion.  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Baltimore, MD (Mr. Cummings).
