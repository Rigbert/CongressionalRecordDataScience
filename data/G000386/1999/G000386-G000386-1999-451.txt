 President, since 1963, May has traditionally been designated Older Americans Month. I would like to take this opportunity to thank these valuable citizens and share an article that was recently printed in the Des Moines Register. The author reminds us of the many contributions older Americans make to our communities.  As we prepare for one of the largest demographic shifts in the history of our nation, we as policy makers often focus on the challenges presented by a graying nation. However, as suggested by Francis Keith in his article, ``Celebrate the Old Folks, Iowa's Assets,'' it would be a shame not to take the time to recognize and appreciate the vital role that seniors play in our communities.  Today more than ever, seniors are continuing to play active roles in their communities. In my home state of Iowa, I know many seniors who perform both paid and volunteer work well into their later years. Their wisdom and experience are a valuable resource that we should not allow to go to waste.  Mr. Marion Tierney, of Des Moines, Iowa recently spoke at an Aging Committee event. He is a perfect example of an older American who continues to be an active participant in his community. He made a career change half a lifetime ago because he was looking for a new challenge in sales and increased earning potential. Today, at the age of eighty, he serves nearly 100 customers of Iowa Machinery and Supply.  In a highly competitive business, Mr. Tierney says hard work is the key to success. He brings know-how, experience, relationships, and trust to customers as he assists them in developing solutions to improve their productivity through the use of his company's industrial products. He stays on top of new technology and products and retrains frequently to effectively meet customer needs. In turn, his field experience helps the company decide which new product lines to acquire.  His employer cites Mr. Tierney's willingness to share knowledge and experience with younger salesmen as a major contribution to the business.  Mr. Tierney is just one example of the many contributions older Americans make to their communities. I hope you will join me in honoring Mr. Tierney and all Older Americans for their many contributions. Not just during the month of May, but all year long.  I ask an article regarding Older Americans be printed in the Record.  The article follows:             [From the Des Moines Register, Apr. 27, 1999]                Celebrate the `Old Folks,' Iowa's Assets                           (By Francis Keith)       In recent months there have been numerous stories about the      aging of Iowa. The news reporters say our older population is      a burden. They say that the increasing numbers of older      people will be a liability for all the younger people who      still work and pay taxes in Iowa. The graying of Iowa it's      called.       There are predictions that as this trend continues, the      problem of so many old people will become acute and drag the      state into some economic quagmire that will have a negative      effect on everyone living here.       I take a different and more positive view. I am retired,      over 65; I was born in Iowa, I worked my whole life in Iowa      and I retired in Iowa. Most of my peers and close friends are      over 65. Many are over 70 and some over 80. For the most      part, we ``old Iowans'' remain very active in our community      and church and we know we are an asset to the state. We pay      our own way and we make a contribution. We old people are a      renewable resource.       We pay property taxes and help pay for the public schools,      yet none of us has children still in school. We don't drive      as much as when we worked and chauffeured our children to      school and activities. Still, we pay our share of the street      budget and we don't wear out the roads.       We pay income taxes, like everyone else, on our pensions,      on interest earned on our savings, even on part of our Social      Security.       We don't go to jail very often. As a group, we have a very      low crime rate. Few of us are druggies, abuse children,      speed, rob banks or use excess alcohol. We don't tie up the      courts or fill the jails.       We pay our share of sales tax. We still buy things locally      and support the stores and shops of Iowa. We eat out more      often. while we may not have as much income as when we      worked, we have more disposable income.       Most of our income is fixed, which has its limitations. But      on the other hand, we aren't caught in economic downturns,      layoffs, unemployment, labor strikes and other crises of the      work years. Our income is limited, but dependable.       We know how to work. While it's true we don't run as fast      as we used to, we are steady and dependable and we're not      afraid to work. Some of us still have business interests and      work every day. When we do have a business, we employ Iowans      and contribute to the economic well-being of our state.       We work for free. We volunteer. We serve on boards and      committees of many community activities and at hospitals and      care centers, libraries, churches and schools. We give our      time; some of us almost as much as a full-time job. We baby-     sit our grandchildren.       We're a stable population. We don't move around much. Not      that we don't travel for fun. We do that whenever we can, but      we aren't job-hopping. We don't have to prove ourselves      anymore by buying a bigger house or a bigger car, just to      impress our peers. Been there, done that. We've been in the      rat race--we know sometimes the rat wins. We've learned to      rest a little, to see the world up close and far away. We      look at sunsets and flowers and people in a little different      way now. We have learned patience and tolerance and we are      more thankful and appreciative of little things.       We even contribute when we are sick, which some doomsayers      point out derisively as a negative of being old. Even our      being in the hospital more than our younger friends      contributes to the economy of Iowa. We keep people working as      nurses, therapists, lab technicians and so on. We all die      sometime, and for us it's likely to be sooner. Even that      gives a job to someone.       Wouldn't any state like to have a group of honest,      reliable, stable, sociable, tax-paying citizens who are      willing to work without pay, who support our local businesses      and who never go on strike?       Well, look around, Iowa, we're already here. We're your      retired citizens. And we're working hard to keep Iowa the      great state we choose to retire in.       We're nice people to have around. We know we're pretty      darned good citizens and we have our pride. We have beaten      the system. We have reached retirement with all its promises,      most of which are true. Let's celebrate all the ``old folks''      in Iowa, not put them down as a liability.                          ____________________
