President, what happens when you decide to write a tax bill that changes the economy of the United States of America, you don't have adequate hearings to gauge what is going to happen, you don't bring in the experts to try to tell you what the impact will be on individual families and businesses, and you stick around until 5 o'clock on a Friday night and you hand out the work product for all of the Members of the Senate to take a look at before they vote on changes in the Tax Code that will affect the people they represent?  This is what happens: 479 pages were handed to us.
