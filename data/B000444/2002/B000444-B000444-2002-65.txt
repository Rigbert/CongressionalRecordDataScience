 As the former Director of the Violence Against Women Office said: ``There is a world of difference between full participation in the highest levels of decision-making and being buried in a satellite grant office in the Department.'' When the director is out of the leadership circle and placed in a satellite office, the Violence Against Women Office's involvement in activities decrease; for example, it is no longer involved in educating U.S. Attorneys about their role in local communities' efforts to stop violence or it is no longer involved in deciding whether to bring or appeal specific cases. The new Violence Against Women Office Act will be ensure that the Director has the access he or she needs to fully participate--the fight to end violence against women deserves no less.  I thank the Senator for his efforts as our Judiciary Committee Chairman and as a conferee to the Justice Reauthorization Act in moving this important act forward.
