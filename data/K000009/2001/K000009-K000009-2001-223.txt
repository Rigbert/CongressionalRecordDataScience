Speaker, I rise today to commemorate the passing of an Ohioan and American of note. Ruth Quackenbush Dodge died of heart failure earlier this year at her Maumee River Estate in Wood County's Middleton Township. Mrs. Dodge was 90 years old.  Ruth Quackenbush Dodge was born into one of New York State's founding Dutch dynasties, and spent her childhood in New York City, Vermont and Connecticut, where she was graduated from Miss Porter's school in Farmington. After then attending classes at the New York School of Social Work, Ruth joined the Junior League of New York City at age 18, thus beginning her long history of volunteerism.  A few years later, Miss Quackenbush met Henry Martin Dodge of Toledo. They were married shortly thereafter, and made their home at Elmbrook Farm in Perrysburg, making the new Mrs. Dodge, at age 22, the first member of her family to reside west of the Hudson River. In her new home, Mrs. Dodge continued her volunteer work, transferring to the Junior League of Toledo--for which she served as president from 1936 to 1938-- and organizing, in 1948, the Volunteer Bureau of the Toledo Council of Social Agencies. This organization was the forerunner of today's Volunteer Action Center of the United Way of Greater Toledo, which dedicated the Ruth Q. Dodge Volunteer Garden on the grounds of One Stranahan Square in 1994. It was my honor at that time as well to praise Mrs. Dodge's accomplishments before this body.  Mrs. Dodge also pursued her passion for the environment, raising milk cows and soybeans in an environmentally responsible manner before the issue became mainstream, and helped further the exploration of Maumee River Valley history by opening her property for several archeological digs undertaken by the University of Toledo. A strong supporter of both the education and the arts, especially the Toledo Opera Association and the Toledo Museum of Art, Mrs. Dodge sat on the board of trustees of Miss Porter's school and served as president of the Country Garden Club from 1945 to 1946.  These few words cannot truly do justice to the outstanding life of this woman who was so dedicated to the ideals of civic service andvolunteerism. Remembered by her friend Mr. Lewis Heldt for ``all of her accomplishments over her long, active lifetime,'' as well as for her efforts in her role as Honorary Chairperson for the last Fallen Timbers Battlefield fund drive, Ruth Quackenbush Dodge and her good works will truly be missed. We extend to her son David, her five grandchildren, and her six great-grandchildren our deepest condolences. At the same time, we celebrate her remarkable accomplishments and honor her memory by trying to live by her exemplary pioneering and socially responsible spirit.                          ____________________
