 President, today I am reintroducing, with nine of our colleagues, the Gifted and Talented Students Education Act. It is vitalthat we recognize the nearly three million students in the United States who are talented and gifted and provide them with a challenging education.  Our nation depends on students who will become the next generation of leaders in business, economics, the sciences, medicine, and education. Our lives will be enriched by the next generation of performing and fine artists. However, many of our gifted and talented students are not being challenged to their fullest ability at school and, as a result, are not performing at world-class levels. Worse, many of our top students lose interest in school and abandon their education altogether. If these gifted students are not adequately challenged, they will direct their energy and gifts toward destructive and wasteful activities and become a burden to society, instead of the most productive contributors.  The Gifted and Talented Students Education Act will help to ensure that gifted and talented students have the opportunity to achieve their highest potential by providing block grants, based on a state's student population, to state education agencies. These grants will be used to identify and provide educational services to gifted and talented students from all economic, ethnic, and racial backgrounds, including students with limited English proficiency and students with disabilities. The bill outlines four broad spending areas but leaves decisions on how best to serve these students to states and local school districts. The legislation ensures that the federal money benefits students by requiring the state education agency to distribute not less than 88 percent of the funds to schools and that the funds must supplement, not supplant, funds currently being spent. Additionally, rather than simply accepting federal funds for a new program, states must make their own commitment to these students by matching 20 percent of the federal funds. The matching requirements will help ensure that programs and services for gifted education develop a strong foothold in the state.  Currently, the only support talented and gifted students receive from the federal government is through the successful research based Javits Gifted and Talented Students Education Program. One well-known effort is Project CUE, a collaborative effort that included the College of New Rochelle and School District 9 in the South Bronx, which serves approximately 32,000 mostly poor and minority students. The program was designed to institute high-level challenging content for elementary school students, and to identify and nurture those students whose interests and talents could be developed in mathematics and science. Evaluation of the project indicated a significant improvement in the overall academic achievement of those students identified as potentially gifted, as well as increases in school attendance rates. Furthermore, the project resulted in a twenty percent improvement school-wide in science and math achievement, as measured in both local and statewide standardized tests. Just imagine how ALL talented and gifted students could benefit from consistent funding and support to implement programs like the one in the South Bronx.  Mr. President, our nation's gifted and talented students are among our great untapped resources. We must help states and local school districts provide a challenging education for these students so their particular gifts can flourish and be fully realized. It is my sincere hope that you and the rest of our colleagues will make this commitment to talented and gifted students this year.                                 ______                                       By
