President, over the past years I have spoken often on the subject of population growth and the many problems it poses. Even in my own State of Vermont, one of the most rural states, it is impossible to escape the fact that human population can leave a heavy footprint.  In the past 50 years the world's population has doubled in size. The implications of this exponential growth are impossible to fully grasp or predict. We do know however, that over 95 percent of new births are occurring in developing countries, many of which are unable to feed or care for their people today. From sub-Saharan Africa to much of Asia, hundreds of thousands of children are born each day without adequate food, medical care or shelter. In fact, of the 4.8 billion people living in developing countries, it is estimated that nearly 60 percent lack basic sanitation. Almost a third do not have access to clean water. A quarter do not have adequate housing, and a fifth, over 1 billion people, have no access to modern health services.  In addition, we have all seen the burden the Earth's swelling population places on the environment. The world's rapidly growing population has resulted in severe water shortages, shrinking forests, soil degradation, air and water pollution and the daily loss of animal and plant life.  However, there has been progress. Because of the availability of education and modern contraceptives, the average number of births per woman has declined from 6 to 3. Due in large part to the work of organizations like the US Agency for International Development, the UN Population Fund, and the International Planned Parenthood Foundation, many women across the globe are receiving the help they need. These organizations provide essential advice, counseling and information in many countries where it otherwise would not exist. The reduction in family size that results has helped millions escape from poverty and, for many women, enhanced the prospects for education and a better life.  Even with these steps forward, much more needs to be done. The world's population is many hundreds of millions higher than it was seven years ago, yet the developing countries are still receiving US family planning assistance at 1995 levels. The inextricable link between world population growth and poverty, political instability, and environmental degradation is widely known. Over 600,000 women die from pregnancy related causes. These programs are about modern contraceptives, about reproductive health, about saving women's lives. Not one dime of US Government funds can be used for abortions, yet the White House and some Members of Congress continue to object to many of these programs.  For the United States to be a leader in support of international family planning it is vital for the American people to be aware of the problems posed by unchecked population growth. That is why I am pleased that Governor Howard Dean has proclaimed the week of October 20-26 as World Population Awareness Week in Vermont. I want to support the Governor in this effort, and I ask unanimous consent that his proclamation be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                 State of Vermont Executive Department                             A Proclamation     Whereas, more than one billion people--one sixth of the          world's population--are between the ages of 15 and 24,          the largest generation ever in this age bracket, and     Whereas, nearly half the world's population, and 63 percent          in the least developed countries, is under age 25; and     Whereas, 17 million young women between the ages of 15-19          give birth every year, including some 13 million who live          in less developed countries; and     Whereas, early pregnancy and childbearing is associated with          serious health risks, as well as less education and lower          future income potential for young mothers; and     Whereas, risks of dying from complications of pregnancy or          childbirth are 25 times higher for girls under 15, and          two times higher for women between 15-19; and     Whereas, approximately half of the 5 million people infected          with HIV last year were young people aged 15-24; and     Whereas, almost 12 million young people now live with HIV,          and about 6,000 more become infected every day; and     Whereas, the choices young people make today regarding their          sexual and reproductive lives, including responsible male          behavior, will determine whether world population          stabilizes at 8 billion or less or 9 billion or more; and     Now, therefore, I, Howard Dean, Governor of the State of          Vermont, do hereby proclaim October 20-26, 2002 as World          Population Awareness Week in Vermont.           Given under my hand and the Great Seal of the State of      Vermont this 25 day of August, A.D. 2002.                                                Howard Dean, M.D.,     Governor.                          ____________________
