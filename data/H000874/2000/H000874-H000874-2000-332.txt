Speaker, today, with my fellow House Administration Committee Democrats, Chaka Fattah, and Jim Davis, I am introducing a new bill to accomplish FEC reform.  Let me be clear--this bill is not and does not pretend to be campaign finance reform. Instead it is about making the Federal Election Commission more efficient, effective and responsive, and providing the agency with full funding so it can properly carry out its congressional mandate. It is about FEC reform.  The bill consists of provisions sought by the bipartisan FEC Commissioners, including six legislative changes the Republican and Democratic Commissioners agreed were of the highest priority in a letter they sent to the President and the Congress earlier this month. Thisis a consensus measure that also incorporates many of the excellent ideas put forth by House Administration Committee Chairman Bill Thomas in his bill that was unanimously voted out of the House Administration Committee last summer.  In a letter I sent to the Speaker last September, I urged him to take up and pass the similarly bipartisan measure then before the Congress. I urge him again to quickly take up this matter. This bill is an opportunity for us to work together to achieve a type of reform we all agree is both necessary and important, by providing the FEC with the tools and funding to do its job.                          ____________________
