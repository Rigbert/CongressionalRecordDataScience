Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York, the chairman of the committee. As the Members of this House know, I, along with the gentleman from New York [Mr. Gilman] and others, offered an amendment last year that dealt with lifting the arms embargo to allow the Bosnians to defend themselves. This situation has gone on now for almost 3 years. The largest number of refugees since the Second World War have been created as a result of this confrontation and over 100,000 deaths. Genocide is occurring.  I regret that it appears, based upon the schedule that is going forward now, that I will be precluded from offering this amendment, which I believe is critically timely today and will be critically timely tomorrow.  I would hope that we could configure the schedule tomorrow so that I would have a half an hour to offer this amendment at the end of the other amendments so that this House can address this issue. It is critical. It is on the front page of every newspaper in Europe and the United States. It is in the councils of the armed forces of every NATO nation. And it seems to me it is timely now for this Congress to speak.                          ____________________
