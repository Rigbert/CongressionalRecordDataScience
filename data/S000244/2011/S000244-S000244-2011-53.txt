 Mr. Speaker, as each of us have traveled back to our districts over the past several months, we've heard from our constituents--from seniors to families to small businesses--speaking out convincingly. They demanded that this new Congress focus on legislation that encourages job growth, cuts spending, and shrinks the size of government. What better way to start than by repealing the President's trillion-dollar health care law, a massive new government intrusion into Americans' health care which promises to skyrocket costs even further. Our immediate action today demonstrates that we are listening.  This is not to say that reforms aren't necessary. We must improve our health care system. We must enact sensible reforms that address the core problem--the rising cost of health care--without increasing the size of government. We must enact real medical liability reform, allow Americans to purchase health coverage across State lines, empower small businesses with greater purchasing power, ensure access for those with preexisting conditions, and create new incentives to save for the future health needs. Republicans want health care reform; however, we must reform it the right way.  Today, we take a much-needed first step. America deserves legislation that addresses our health care problems and helps our economy prosper. This bill is the first step to do that, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of it.
