President, as the Congress grapples with the problem of maintaining the solvency of the Medicare program and with proposals to expand Medicare coverage, we must not overlook a critical problem that threatens the financial integrity of this vital social program, which provides health care services to 38 million older and disabled Americans. I am talking, Mr. President, about the problem of waste, fraud and abuse in this program.  The Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair, has undertaken an extensive investigation into Medicare fraud.  At our first hearing last summer, we learned from the inspector general of the Department of Health and Human Services that an astounding $23 billion a year is lost to waste, fraud, abuse and other improper payments.  In more recent hearings, Mr. President, we discovered that career criminals, with absolutely no background in health care, were able to be certified as Medicare providers and enter the system for the sole purpose of ripping it off.  For example, one case that the subcommittee investigated involved a totally fictitious durable medical equipment company that was located in the middle of the runway of the Miami International Airport, if it had in fact existed.  I am not talking here, Mr. President, about legitimate providers or innocent mistakes or honest billing errors. I am talking about outright fraud. We need to do a better job of screening providers and controlling their entry into the Medicare system.  Mr. President, the vast majority of health care professionals are dedicated and caring individuals who deliver vital services to millions of Americans across the country. They are as appalled by this kind of fraud as any of us.  Recently, I met with the members of the Home Care Alliance of Maine concerning the issue of fraud in the health care industry. The Home Care Alliance of Maine has a longstanding commitment to ensuring the highest quality home health care in the State of Maine. It has adopted a policy of zero tolerance on fraud and abuse in the home health industry. Its members recognize that unscrupulous home health providers not only tarnish the reputation of legitimate health care professionals, but that these unscrupulous individuals jeopardize the very availability of Medicare.  I ask unanimous consent the position statement of the Home Care Alliance of Maine be printed in the Record so my colleagues and organizations representing home health care agencies across the United States can have the benefit of the very fine work this organization has done.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                        Medicare Fraud and Abuse                           position statement       The Home Care Alliance of Maine membership has a long-     standing commitment to provide the highest quality of care to      the elderly and infirm of our state. Even one unscrupulous      home health provider that fails to maintain the values and      ethics that are at the core of home care jeopardizes the      viability of ongoing access to appropriate home health      services.       We recognize that the responsibility for resolving concerns      of fraud and abuse lies with the government, the home health      industry, and individual providers. We further believe that      different strategies are needed to clearly distinguish      deliberately fraudulent practice from unintentional errors      that can occur in the interpretation of the complex and often      vague rules and regulations in the Medicare home health care      benefit.       The Home Care Alliance of Maine firmly believes that fraud      and abuse can be eliminated and errors corrected when      addressed by comprehensive and concerted efforts among the      industry, government, individual providers, and consumers.      This partnership is critical to achieve the mutually      beneficial goal of assuring integrity in administration of      the Medicare home health care benefit.       We further believe that education of consumers and advocacy      groups is central to ensuring trust in legitimate providers      of home health services. It is only through open and public      discussion about the basic structure of changes in the      Medicare home health care benefit that consumers and others      can confidently distinguish blatant fraud and abuse from      innocent errors in interpretation and provision of services.      Informed consumers and their advocates can then be reassured      by their choice of licensed and certified home health      agencies.       The Home Care Alliance of Maine supports:       1. Zero tolerance for fraud and abuse of the Medicare home      health care benefit.       2. Total cooperation with prompt and responsible      investigation and resolution of any errors in interpretation      and application of the Medicare home health care benefit.       3. Medicare coverage and reimbursement standards in      language that is understandable and readily accessible to      providers and consumers through various means, e.g. federal      depository libraries, state regulatory agencies, trade      associations, fiscal intermediaries, and the Internet.       4. Enhancement of education and training of home health      agencies through joint efforts with regulators.       5. Credentialing and competency testing standards for      government contractors and federal regulators responsible for      issuing Medicare determinations.       6. Mandatory screening and background checks on all      applicants for Medicare certification as a home health      agency.       7. Development and provision of a summary of program      coverage requirements for consumers and prospective consumers      of Medicare home health care benefits.       8. Enhancement and increased accessibility of the consumer      reporting hotline for suspected fraud and abuse.       The Home Care Alliance of Maine is committed to working      with its membership, state and federal regulatory bodies, and      consumer advocacy groups to ensure the integrity of the      Medicare home health care benefit in Maine.
