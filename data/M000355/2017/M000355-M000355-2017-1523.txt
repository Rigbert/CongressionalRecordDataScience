 President, I ask unanimous consent that following leader remarks on Monday, April 24, the Senate proceed to executive session for consideration of Calendar No. 31, the nomination of Sonny Perdue to be Secretary of Agriculture. I further ask that the time until 5:30 p.m. be equally divided in the usual form and that at 5:30 p.m., the Senate vote on confirmation with no intervening action or debate, and that if confirmed, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action.
