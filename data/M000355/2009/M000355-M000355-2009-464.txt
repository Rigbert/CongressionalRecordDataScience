 President, the significance of the U.S. auto industry as the symbol of American creativity, industriousness, and prosperity is hard to overstate. So is the importance of its continued survival to millions of American workers who design, build or sell our cars here and around the world.

Unfortunately, many of these tough decisions have been put off time and again, and the day of reckoning has come for two of the big three automakers. Yesterday, the administration announced that GM and Chrysler had failed to come up with viable plans for survival, despite tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts aimed at avoiding this very situation.
