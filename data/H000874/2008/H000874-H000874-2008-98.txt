BLUNT. Let me say one other thing, and then I will yield.  The other thing I would say about a full and fair debate, these bills that come under suspension obviously narrow the debate. I guess I understand that. We have had some discussion on the floor, well, let's have all these ideas out there and just see who a majority is for, but 20 minutes of debate on a side of an issue really isn't the kind of full and fair debate we need.  I would like to see a bill come with plenty of debate, with plenty of opportunities for every Democrat that wants to make an amendment to make an amendment, for every Republican, it could be prefiled, it could be anything, and the will of the House would determine which direction the country goes in this real desire for energy, more American energy, American energy created by and producing American jobs. I hope we can get there. There is a real demand in the country for that.  A Member just has to go home to know what is the number one economic issue in a country where people are concerned right now about what to do about the economy.  I would yield.
