Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2370.  I want to compliment the gentleman from Guam (Mr. Underwood). This bill is the amendment to the Organic Act of 1998, which authorizes increased self-government for the U.S. citizens of the American territory of Guam. These changes have been the subject of hearings conducted by the Committee on Resources.  A consensus of support of the proposed changes to Guam's Organic Act emerged from testimony by various people from Guam. Furthermore, the Guam legislature petitioned Congress for the changes now before the House. One provision would amend Guam's Organic Act to allow local law to provide for the election rather than the appointment of Guam's Attorney General. Another provision permits the quorum size requirement of the legislature be changed from the specific number of 11 out of 21 to a simple majority.  While the proposed changes to the Guam local government are justified and appropriate, these kinds of changes can and should be done by Guam by the development and adoption of a local constitution. Congress authorized a formulation of a local constitutional government by Guam in Public Laws 94-584 and 96-597 in 1976 and 1980 respectively.  The U.S. citizens of Guam can absolutely be certain that with the adoption of a local constitution, they will retain an inherent right to seek substantial changes in their political status.  However, until Guam enacts a local Constitution, any changes to the basic laws governing Guam can only be done by Congress. Thus, the need for this House to provide authority for specific amendments to the Guam Organic Act to enhance the government of Guam. This is a good piece of legislation. I urge the passage of the legislation.  When Congress acted years ago to permit Guam to change the size of its legislature, thequorum requirement was inadvertently not changed as well. That oversight is corrected with the necessary conforming amendment in the bill. These changes including the technical clarification of local legislative power all received bipartisan support in the congressional hearings.  Before H.R. 2370 was approved by the Committee on Resources, the committee of jurisdiction, the legislation contained a section regarding ``Judicial Authority; Supreme Court of Guam.'' That proposed provision would have overridden the local Guam Public Law 24-139, enacted February 22, 1998. Guam's local law is clear decisive legislation, reflecting the desire of Guam's legislators for a specific type of administrative organization for the Judicial Branch of Guam which they believed would be best for the Guam community. While there were individuals who supported the judicial change proposed in H.R. 2370, which was also suggested to be consistent with results of an unscientific survey of public opinion regarding the judiciary on Guam, such a fundamental change to Guam's local self-governance should be done with the support of the Government of Guam; or, in a locally developed Constitution, not by a unilateral change in the Federal statute.  Congress has considered changes affecting local self-government in the territories primarily based on a consensus by the people and their leaders. That consensus has been usually reflected in resolutions by the local legislature. During the past couple of years, the Government of Guam has informed Congress a number of times of requested changes to the Guam Organic Act or federal law. The provisions in H.R. 2370 as approved and reported by the Committee on Resources for full consideration by the full House have the general support of the leaders of Guam.  Rather than continuing to petition Congress to make changes to the Organic Act regarding functions and powers of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Government of Guam, a constitution can be adopted to address those areas. Furthermore, any future changes to the local constitutional government would be through the local amendment process for the constitution, as exists today for Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands. The federal courts and if necessary, the Congress remain the safeguards to insure that the local constitutional government as amended is consistent with the federal Constitution and the intent of Congress.  The Guam Legislature passed Resolution No. 85 on September 15, 1997, asking the U.S. 105th Congress to amend the federal law authorizing constitutional government for Guam. Congress is asked to explicitly state that the adoption of a constitution would not preclude or prejudice the right of self-determination by the people of Guam.  Indeed, Congressional assurance is important so that the people of Guam know that the adoption of a constitution by Guam as authorized in federal law would not preclude their further right to self-determination. Guam would in fact enjoy a major degree of increased local self-government with constitutional government, which could be as the ``Commonwealth of Guam'' if that is what the people of Guam choose to call their finally-implemented constitution. The U.S. citizens of Guam can be absolutely certain that with the adoption of a local constitution they will retain an inherent right to seek a subsequent change in their political status.  The right of continued self-determination after the adoption of a constitution in a U.S. territory is validated by the fact that the adoption of a local constitution in 1952 by the U.S. citizens of Puerto Rico, as similarly preauthorized by Congress, has not precluded or prejudiced the people's further right of self-determination. Also relevant to Guam is the adoption by the Puerto Rico Constitutional Convention of Resolution 22 which called the new constitutional government structure, the ``Commonwealth of Puerto Rico''. Now, over four decades later, Puerto Rico's territorial legislature has asked the 105th Congress to define a process for further self-determination. Both the U.S. House and the Senate have passed measures this year explicitly supporting Puerto Rico's right to self-determination and a change of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to full self-government status when desired by a majority of the people of Puerto Rico. Clearly the adoption of a local constitution has not precluded the further exercise by the people of Puerto Rico of the right of self-determination and the adoption of a Guam constitution would not limit a future change in Guam's status.  Out of respect to the Guam Legislature who petitioned the 105th Congress for clarification on this matter on behalf of the people of Guam, the entire text of Guam Resolution No. 85 follows. However, until Guam enacts a local constitution, any change to the basic laws governing Guam can only be done by Congress, and thus the need for this House to provide authority for specific amendments to the Guam Organic Act to enhance self-government for Guam.                  Guam Legislature Resolution No. 85:       Relative to requesting the 105th Congress to amend the      Organic Act by adding a new Section 6, to confirm that the      adoption of a Constitution establishing local government      shall not preclude or prejudice the further exercise in the      future by the people of Guam of the right of self-     determination regarding the ultimate political status of      Guam.       Be It Resolved by the Legislature of the Territory of Guam:       Whereas, in 1976 the United States Congress enabled the      people of Guam, pursuant to P.L. No. 95-584, to organize a      government under a constitution of our own adoption, which      upon approval by Congress and the people of Guam, would      provide for local government over the internal affairs of our      Island; and       Whereas, when the current government of Guam structure for      territorial government was established under the 1950 Organic      Act, it was welcomed by the people of Guam as progress toward      greater local government, but it was instituted without the      consent of the people of Guam through a democratic act of      self-determination or participation in the Federal lawmaking      process on the basis of equal citizenship or equal      representation; and       Whereas, the 1977 Constitution of Guam, drafted pursuant to      Federal and local statutes, was approved by Congress but was      not approved by the people of Guam in the 1979 referendum;      and       Whereas, the process of establishment of internal local      government under a local constitution was suspended after      linkage was created between the draft constitution and the      political status process; and       Whereas, in light of representation and speculations      inconsistent with the foregoing from 1979 to the present, it      is essential for Congress to confirm its original and      continued intention and expectation that authorization and      approval of local constitutional government in Guam would not      preclude or be prejudicial to the exercise of the right to      self-determination, as part of the process through which      ultimate political status of the territory of Guam is to be      determined: Now therefore, be it       Resolved, by the Guam Legislature, on behalf of the people      of Guam, request the One Hundred and Fifth Congress of the      United States to amend Public Law No. 94-585, Oct. 21, 1976,      90 Stat. 2899, as amended by Public Law No. 96-597, Title V,      Sec. 501, Dec. 24, 1980, 94 Stat. 3479, by adding a new      Section 6 to read as follows:       ``Section 6. Establishment of local constitutional local      government pursuant to this Act shall not preclude or      prejudice the further exercise in the future by the people of      Guam or the Virgin Islands of the right of self-determination      regarding the ultimate political status of either territory;      and be it further       Resolved, that the Speaker certifies to, and the      Legislative Secretary attests, the adoption hereof and that      copies thereafter be transmitted to the President of the      United States of America; to the President Pro Tempore,      United States Senate; to the Majority Leader, United States      Senate; to the Minority Leader, United States Senate; to the      Chairman of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,      United States Senate; to the Speaker, U.S. House of      Representatives; to the Majority Leader, U.S. House of      Representatives; to the Minority Leader, U.S. House of      Representatives; to the Chairman of the Committee on      Resources, U.S. House of Representatives; to the Resident      Commissioner of Puerto Rico, U.S. House of Representatives;      to the Virgin Islands Delegate to Washington, U.S. House of      Representatives; to the Guam Delegate to Washington, U.S.      House of Representatives; to the President of the Mayor's      Council; and to the Honorable Carl T.C. Gutierrez, Governor      of Guam.       Duly and Regularly Adopted on the 25th Day of September,      1997.     Anthony C. Blaz.     Joanie M.S. Brown.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.  (
