Speaker, we continue to resist a Republican budget with deep cuts in Medicare and Medicaid, a Republican budget which has already been repudiated by a broad cross-section of the American public.  And, as we continue to debate the Federal budget, I would like to remind my Republican colleagues that they should not lose sight of the budgets of thousands of senior citizens in their districts.  Today the elderly pay more out-of-pocket than ever before for Medicare coverage and supplemental insurance. In Rhode Island, they pay this with an average income of approximately $16,000.  Yesterday the New York Times reported that MediGap premiums for over 3 million seniors will increase an average of 30 percent next year. MediGap is the supplemental insurance which is necessary to cover nonhospital medical expenses. In Rhode Island, the average premium increase will be 35 percent.  These higher premiums would come on top of the proposed increases to beneficiaries in the Republicans budget.  The Republican budget will raise annual Medicare premiums by $264 for an elderly couple in 1996 and nearly double premiums by 2002.  And on top of these significant increases, the Republicans also propose to eliminate the Medicaid entitlement which serves as a critical safety net for thousands of seniors in Rhode Island.  I urge we repudiate these massive cuts in Medicare and Medicaid.                          ____________________
