 What I suspect is going to happen come Wednesday is it will be closed down, and we will not have an opportunity to offer an amendment. One of these amendments I have made to the bankruptcy bill. The Senator from Iowa knows I have been a supporter of this bill. He is supportive of this amendment. If there is an opportunity, I believe it will pass. Senator Jeffords and I are cosponsors of the amendment. I, again, would like an opportunity to offer it before there is a cloture motion or something and there will be no more amendments on the bill.
