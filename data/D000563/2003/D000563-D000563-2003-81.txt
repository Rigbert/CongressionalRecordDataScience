I say to the Senator from Nevada that there are some among those 168 about whom I have had misgivings. Many of them I voted for anyway, understanding this is the President's prerogative to nominate people for the Federal courts.  Going back to the point I made earlier, the President does not have a constitutional right to appoint Federal judges. He has the right to nominate them. Only with the advice and consent can they be appointed to the Federal judicial vacancies. Therein lies the real difference in the argument we brought forward this evening.  I yield the floor.
