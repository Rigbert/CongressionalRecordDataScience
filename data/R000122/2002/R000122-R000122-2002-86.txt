President, I rise in strong support of the Johnson-Hagel-Reed-Enzi Safe and Fair Deposit Insurance Act of 2002, SFDIA, and I urge my colleagues to support it. I am proud to be one of the authors of this legislation, as I believe it will continue to ensure a strong and safe insurance system for our banks, and most importantly for the consumers that put their trust in that system. The legislation before us also seeks to end the pro-cyclical method now in force, which tends to burden institutions in bad economic times, and not prepare for the future during good economic times. We need to change that, and I think this bill begins to finally address this important issue in a very thoughtful manner.  The bill that my colleagues and I have introduced has five major components. The first element addresses the most non-controversial aspect of this issue, and that is merging of the two insurance funds. This will obviously strengthen the reserve fund for all banks and savings institutions, rather than diffusing that strength between two funds. The second component is that of coverage limits. Although this issue has attracted quite a bit of discussion and controversy over the past few years, this is nonetheless an important issue for many banks and consumers alike. In this section, the legislation authorizes the level of general coverage to rise to $130,000, by indexing for inflation from 1974, when the level of coverage was at $40,000. Going forward, the bill proposes to index coverage for inflation every five years in increments of $10,000. The bill also suggests that coverage for retirement accounts be set at $250,000 now, and that those accounts also be subject to indexing in the future. Lastly, on coverage issues, the legislation would allow for additional coverage for municipal deposits beyond the $130,000 level.  The SFDI Act would also allow for greater flexibility for the FDIC to charge insurance premiums. Since 1996, the FDIC has been prohibited from charging premiums to banks that have the highest rating, as long as the reserve ratio was above the ``hard target'' of 1.25 percent. Our legislation would remove that prohibition, as well as effectively eliminating the hard target, and would instead substitute a range for the fund. Again, these actions will lend the FDIC the necessary flexibility to manage the funds in a much more institution-friendly manner, particularly by relieving pressure on them during the worst business cycles.  In addition, the FDIC will be able to give a one-time assessment credit to institutions, as well as allow for ongoing credits to manage the fund. These credits will in all likelihood give most institutions, if they are well-managed and well-capitalized, the ability to avoid premiums for several years down the road. The FDIC will also be authorized to provide cash rebates to institutions should the fund ever exceed 1.50 percent.  Although I would prefer to address the issue of coverage for municipal deposits in another context, I am confident that during the upcoming legislative process there will be a good debate on the issue, and the Senate will be able to work its will on the issue. I think it is important to note that the introduction of this bill will mark the beginning of a strong, vigorous and positive discussion on the vital issue of deposit insurance. This has become the cornerstone of our banking system's integrity, and it is imperative that the U.S. Congress insure that it remain strong, healthy, and workable for many years to come for both financial institutions and consumers alike.                          ____________________
