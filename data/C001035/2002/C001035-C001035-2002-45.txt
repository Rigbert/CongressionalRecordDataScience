President, I rise today to introduce the ``United States Postal Service Commission Act of 2002.'' This legislation will establish a Commission to examine the challenges facing the Postal Service and developsolutions to ensure its long term viability and increased efficiency.  The Postal Service's problems have reached a near crisis level. In 2000, the Postal Service lost nearly $200 million, while in 2001, this loss ballooned to $1.68 billion. Losses are projected to be $1.35 billion this year, despite the $675 million in appropriations from Congress to cover the unanticipated costs associated with the September 11 attacks and the anthrax incidents. The Postal Service is mandated by law to break even on its operating expenses and its capital needs, both of which continue to grow.  The Postal Service is also fast approaching its $15 billion statutory borrowing limit. Given its recent history of increasing rather than paying down its debt, increasing the Postal Service's debt ceiling is not the answer. In addition, the Postal Service's long term liabilities are enormous, to the tune of nearly $6 billion for Workers Compensation claims, a staggering $32 billion in retirement costs and perhaps as much as $45 billion to cover retiree health care costs. Meanwhile, on June 30, consumers experienced a third postal rate increase in just 18 months.  How could the Postal Service have landed in such dire straits? The Postal Service's problems stem from many causes. For example, the overall growth rate of mail has been declining since 1997, and first class mail volumes actually have declined over the past four years. This is particularly significant, as first class mail accounts for 48 percent of total mail volume. In addition, revenues from first class mail cover more than two-thirds of institutional costs, such as post offices. Shortfalls must be made up by decreasing costs, increasing volumes in other categories of mail or by increasing postal rates.  Some of this declining volume can be attributed to the increasing forms of electronic communication, particularly the Internet, which has revolutionized the way we communicate and transact business. For example, while financial statements, bills and bill payments constitute about half of first class mail revenue, or about $17 billion annually, electronic bill payment is quickly becoming a major means of doing business. It is estimated that 75 percent of banks will provide online banking services by 2003. This is in addition to other competing methods of communication such as faxes and telephones. In addition, filing tax returns, receiving Social Security payments, and many other transactions are also available electronically.  The Postal Service also faces significant labor-related costs. Indeed nearly 80 percent of its expenses are related to compensation and benefits. By comparison, 56 percent of FedEx's expenses and 42 percent of UPS's expenses are related to compensation and benefits.  The need to preserve a viable Postal Service is clear. Americans rely on affordable, reliable and universal mail delivery as their primary means of communication. The Postal Service delivers more than 200 billion pieces of mail each year to nearly 140 million addresses, which accounts for more than 40 percent of the world's mail. Moreover, 1.7 million new delivery points are added each year--roughly the equivalent of adding the number of addresses in Chicago. More than seven million Americans visit post offices each day.  In States with large rural areas, such as Maine, it is vital that postal services remain in place. If the Postal Service were no longer obligated to provide universal service and deliver mail to every customer, six days a week, the affordable communication link upon which many Americans rely would be jeopardized. Most commercial enterprises would find it uneconomical, if not impossible, to deliver mail and packages to these areas at rates that the Postal Service has been offering.  In addition to providing a critical service to consumers, the Postal Service is the eleventh largest enterprise in the Nation with $66 billion in annual revenues. This is more than Microsoft, McDonald's and Coca Cola combined. While the Postal Service itself employs more than 700,000 career employees, it is also the linchpin of a $900 billion mailing industry that employs nine million Americans in fields as diverse as direct mailing, printing and paper production.  Affordable postal rates are vital to the economic health of many companies, especially magazines, catalog houses and the service providers they use. The June 2002 rate hike alone represents a ten percent increase for periodicals, and a nine percent increase for catalogs. It is estimated that the combined effect of the past three rate increases, totaling 22 percent over just 18 months, have cost the magazine industry about $400 million.  In May I met with a group of about twenty Maine businessmen and women involved in the mailing industry, who described for me the impact that rising postal rates have on their businesses. One magazine publisher told me that postage represents ten percent of her costs. I was amazed to hear that one of the catalog busineses pays more for postage a year than it pays to any one of the companies that supply the raw materials for its products. It was also startling to hear from one printer that his postage costs have doubled over the last ten years.  Most of the people I met with are small business owners, and there are millions more across the country, all grappling with the same effects of rapidly rising postage costs.  At the request of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee and House Committee on Government Reform, the Postal Service produced a comprehensive Transformation Plan, which it presented to Congress in April. The Plan addresses general measures that the Postal Service believes it needs to take to ensure its survival, but it fails to lay out specific steps the Postal Service will take and a timeline for action. It is also unclear whether these measures will result in the cost savings necessary to ensure the long-term survival of the Postal Service.  Many attempts have been made to reform the Postal Service over the years. My colleagues in the House of Representatives have tried for nearly eight years to pass postal reform legislation, but to no avail. Stakeholders have widely diverging views on what shape postal reform should take, if any. This lack of consensus on how or whether to deal with divisive issues has led only to stalemates in Congress.  To take a fresh look at these difficult issues, I rise today to introduce legislation establishing a Presidential Postal Commission charged with examining the problems that the Postal Service faces, and developing specific recommendations and legislative proposals that Congress and the Postal Service can implement. Precedent exists for such a commission. In the late 1960s, the Kappel Commission was formed to resolve the crisis situation that the former Postal Department then found itself in, train cars of undelivered mail, strikes, and a host of other problems. The Kappel Commission's efforts laid the groundwork for the Postal Service we have today, which has functioned admirably for many years but is now in serious trouble.  Mindful of the body of work that has been done in this area by my colleagues in the House and Senate, by the General Accounting Office, by the Postal Service itself and by others, I intend that this commission have a short life of one year, during which it will carry out its study and produce legislative proposals for consideration by the Administration and the Congress.  Finally, I intend that the commission consider all relevant aspects of the Postal Service. Everything should be put on the table and evaluated. We need to ensure that the Postal Service will stand up to the challenges it is facing today and will face tomorrow.  These and many more issues must be examined in depth, if we are to preserve this vital service upon which so many Americans rely for communication and for their livelihood. The Postal Service has successfully overcome numerous difficulties over its 226-year history, and has continued to deliver the mail faithfully. Yet it has reached a critical juncture and once again, it is time for a thorough evaluation of the Postal Service's operations and requirements.                                 ______                                       By
