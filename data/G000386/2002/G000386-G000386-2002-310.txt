 President, I have a second-degree amendment on the farm bill. I offered this second-degree amendment to the Craig amendment to clear up any concerns raised by the opposition regarding the word ``control'' in the original Johnson-Grassley amendment banning packer ownership of livestock.  The new language reads that a packer may not own or feed hogs or cattle ``through a subsidiary, or through an arrangement that gives the packer operational, managerial, or supervisory control over the livestock, or over the farming operation that produces the livestock, to such an extent that the producer is no longer materially participating in the management of the operation with respect to the production of livestock.''  What we are trying to do is clear up a little blue smoke that has been raised about the amendment that Senator Johnson and I offered prior to the holidays. It was adopted 51 to 46. So we want to clear up what the word ``control'' means. We do that through the phrase ``materially participating.''  A farmer who materially participates in the farming operation must pay self-employment taxes. Those who do not materially participate do not have to pay self-employment taxes. The phrase has appeared in the IRS Code, section 1402(a), since 1956, and there is a full hopper of case law clarifying the definition. So the words we use to explain what we mean or do not mean by the word ``control'' have a lot of case law behind them.  For those who were worried about excessive lawsuits and the actual enforcement of the provision being tied up inthe courts, rest assured that the perceived problem has been fixed.  I know that the lobbyists for the American Meat Institute will dream up some red herring argument that might attack me, as they have on this amendment, but that is OK. They do not represent the independent producers; they represent just the packers, bottom line.  For those producers who manage their risk through forward contracts and marketing agreements, the new language will not affect contractual relationships. Almost all producers who sell hogs or cattle under marketing agreements or forward contracts materially participate in the management of the operation and, thus, pay self-employment taxes. These independent producers will not have to change their business practices at all.  The revised amendment I have offered will inject greater competition, access, transparency, and fairness into the livestock marketplace. Small and medium-sized livestock operations will gain greater access to markets that will have greater volume and be subject to less manipulation. The revised bill clarifies that arrangements that do not impose control over the producer can still provide all the benefits of coordination and product specification.  I have worked on the second-degree amendment with the distinguished chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, Senator Harkin, and also with Senator Johnson, the original cosponsor with me of the original language before the holidays, and the Iowa Farm Bureau and the American Farm Bureau Federation. We are all confident this amendment does exactly what we claim, which is to limit packer ownership but avoid impacting risk-management tools available for independent producers.  I will read, for my Senate colleagues, a letter from the American Farm Bureau Federation that states, with confidence, we have accomplished our goal and have overcome the blue smoke that the American Meat Institute and the packers have raised against the original Johnson-Grassley amendment:       The American Farm Bureau Federation supports Senator      Grassley's amendment to clarify the issue of ``control''      under the packer ownership prohibition. This would allow      producers to forward contract, pursue marketing arrangements,      develop branded products, schedule animals to their plants,      and to receive value-based premiums. We urge you to support      the Grassley amendment to clarify ``control.''       Packer ownership has resulted in an increase in packer      market power by allowing the packers the opportunity to stay      out of the cash market for extended periods of time, often      reducing farm gate demand and driving down prices paid to      producers. This has resulted in the inability of independent      producers to access the market. These transactions concerning      packer-owned livestock are not part of the publicly-reported      daily cash market. Narrowing the volume in the market makes      it more subject to manipulation and often results in lower      prices paid to producers.       We urge you to oppose the Craig amendment and support the      Grassley amendment calling for clarification to the      prohibition of packer ownership included in the Senate farm      bill.  I can't lay it out much more clearly than the statement I just read from the American Farm Bureau. I should also state that in addition to the Farm Bureau, over 135 other organizations have also signed a letter in support of my second degree amendment. Just a few of those groups are the Livestock Marketing Association, National Farmers Union, National Farmers Organization, National Family Farm Coalition, R-CALF USA, Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Fund, United Stockgrowers of America, United Methodist Church, General Board of Church and Society, National Catholic Rural Life Conference, and the Organization for Competitive Markets.  The packers are an important piece in the rural economy, but only a piece, not the whole pie. The question we need to ask ourselves is whether packers should be packers or packers should also be products. Is it our intent to let packers compete with producers on an even playing field? Is there any question who will lose?  I yield the floor.  The reason we keep sows in farrowing stalls is to protect the piglets. Sows are extremely important for the health and well-being of the piglets, but if we let the sow out of the crate we stand the chance of getting the piglets crushed by the sheer weight of the sow, or worse, and watch the sow grow fatter. Let us build a strong farrowing stall for the packers and facilitate the health and well being of our independent producers.  Support the Grassley second-degree tomorrow.                           amendment no. 2542
