 Why do I ask that question? I ask that question because, when the Republicans were in the minority, they used to rail regularly about the arbitrariness of the Committee on Rules controlled by the Democratic Party. That pushed them to the position that they could not reflect or debate on issues confronting the Congress.  So what do we see? We see for some reason an incredible motivation to get out of town. This is January. We are beginning the session, the second session of the 104th Congress, the historic 104th Congress, as our Speaker, a historian himself, tells us regularly.  So how do we begin this Congress? With one of the most arbitrary rules that we have. Is there precedent for such rules? Yes, there is. Did we utilize them? Yes, we did. When did we utilize them? At the end of sessions, either because we were going on summer break in August or we were going out of session in October or November or December so that we could accelerate the process at the end of sessions. But now we have a rule that says, at the very beginning, in the first instance, before we really do any substantive business, we are going to have a rule that says we will not take the time.  Apparently, we are going to go on 30 days break, as I understand it. We are not in control, and I am not sure about that, but that is what I understand. What is the reason for this rule? I cannot figure it out.  Let me say in addition, my friend said something about management. That is an interesting concept over the last 40 years as to how long the Republicans have been in management. Under the Constitution of the United States, article II of the Constitution of the United States, article II of the Constitution gives executive authority, that is management authority, to the President of the United States. The Presidency of the United States in the last 17 or 15 years has been in the hands of Republicans 12 out of those 15 years. In fact, we hear the Republicans railing about how the President will not cooperate. That is why they cannot do their agenda.  To some degree, they are correct. But my, my, my, I never hear the Republicans say why Ronald Reagan or George Bush did not stop the irresponsibility of which they accuse the Democratic Congress. I never hear them say that for 6 of those 12 years there was a Republican leadership in U.S. Senate.  My colleagues, the fact of the matter is, we do have a serious problem. It is a budget deficit on a regular basis that this country nor its children can afford. That is why this Member of the Congress has voted three times to pass a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. That is why this Member of Congress right here voted for a budget which cut deficits faster and further than the Republican alternative and is, frankly, in my opinion, the budget that we ought to pass. I think the President would sign. And it would reduce deficits further and faster than the Republican alternative.  My colleagues, this martial law rule is proposed because we need to come to grips with this year's fiscal policies, which we have not yet adopted. The fiscal policies in my opinion of the Republican leadership during the past year are worthy of careful consideration by the American public and then deserving of the American public's contempt.  The Republican shutdown of Government and the Gingrich premeditated tactics of forcing America to default prospectively on its debts, both, my colleagues, are arguably historically the most irresponsible fiscal policies proposed by any leadership of the House of Representatives in its history.  We ought to have a rule on this floor which says that we will pass a clean debt limit extension. Secretary Donald Reagan wrote me a letter and said that is what we ought to do, not on this one but when the Republicans had the Presidency. Secretary of the Treasury Jim Baker asked me to do the same. Secretary Brady asked me to do the same.  All three of those Secretaries of the Treasury said it would be the height of irresponsibility not to accommodate past policies and pay America's bills. Moody's has just yesterday made an observation that they may change the cost of borrowing in America by changing our rating. If they do that, every homeowner, every person who goes into the Hecht Co. in this area or Woodward and Lothrop or K-Mart and uses a credit card will pay more.                              {time}  1100  Every foreign government will up its price of money to the U.S. taxpayer. The fact of the matter is I do not know of a responsible financial person that I have talked to in my district or in this country that thinks that putting the American Government into default is anything other than insanity. Yet, it was a proposed policy by Speaker Gingrich earlier this year. That is why I called it a premeditated policy of placing America at risk of defaulting on its debts.  Mr. Speaker, this rule is not inherently evil. It is a rule that will accommodate action. I understand that. I do not allege that it is, in and of itself, a rule that is particularly pernicious. But its timing is historic because we never found the need to do this before, in my opinion, in the history of the House of Representatives, because we were always prepared in January, February, March, April, and May to consider matters in a timely fashion. It was only at the end that we needed to accelerate.  Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States said we ought to come together. We ought to jettison confrontation and adopt cooperation and put this country on a sound fiscal footing, make a commitment that we are not going to shut down government, not just for Federal employees, but for Americans who rely on government on a daily basis, that they will not be at risk, and that we ought to commit ourselves to quickly passing a clean debt limit extension, so we can tell all the world America, America can be relied on.  Mr. McINNIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman that just spoke is an eloquent speaker, and not exactly on point, but he is an eloquent speaker. I guess the gentleman brings up that we finished talking about the word management. Now let us talk about the word participation. The gentleman acts as if there was no opportunity to participate last night. The Committee on Rules had an open meeting.  By the way, the meetings under the Republican management of this Congress have been open, sunshine. They are open to the press. By the way, we do not have proxy voting anymore. Under the old management team, the Democratic management team, you could go home to your district and you could have a proxy vote cast on your behalf. You did not even have to be at a committee hearing.  What did we do? We said, ``Wait a minute, we are going to change the management around here. We expect you to be at your meetings. If you are going to cast a vote, you are expected to be there and cast a vote in person.'' The gentleman does not bring up the point that last night his colleagues on the Democratic side of the aisle did not carry this kind of debate in the Committee on Rules. In fact, they voted for this rule. In fact, they voted for it unanimously. We did not even do a rollcall vote on it. We did a voice vote on it. I think it is important to remember those kinds of things.  I think it is important to take a look. I think the gentleman is credible when he starts talking about his personal efforts at balancing the budget. I think he is terrific in that area. But my big question is, Why did his party not follow him? The party had 26 years since the last time this country balanced their budget, and I do not know how many years the gentleman has served over there. I know it is many, and I know he has served with distinction. But my question that I would like at some point to be answered is, Why did the gentleman not convince his own party during the period of time that he served to balance the budget? That is all we are trying to do.  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman brings up the point about the interest rates. Do Members want to lower interest rates for the working Joe and working Jane in this country? Then balance this budget. Quit spending more money than you bring in.  There is not a family in America that gets to operate under these fiscal rules. There is not a special district, there is not a city, there is not a county, there is not a State in this country that gets to operate under such crazy fiscal rules. Constantly, for a period of 24 years, you spend more than you bring in.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon], chairman of the Committee on Rules.
