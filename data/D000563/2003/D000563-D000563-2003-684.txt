President, I thank the majority leader for yielding 1 minute.  Mr. President, I think this is a historic piece of legislation. I think the United States is making a commitment to a world problem that is going to haunt us for decades to come.  I salute President Bush for his leadership. I am glad this has been bipartisan. My only regret is that it comes to the floor in a very tight procedural situation. I hope we will have time to have an honest discussion about a few issues and still deal with this bill on a timely and dispatched basis.  I salute the Senator from Tennessee, the majority leader, for his commitment, as well as the Senator from Massachusetts, and my good friend and neighbor from Indiana, Senator Lugar.  I am going to withhold any further statements for a little later on in the bill. As we get into the dialog, I will offer a few ideas.
