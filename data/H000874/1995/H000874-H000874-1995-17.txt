Speaker, I will not object. Because of the selective irresponsibility, there are some Members, apparently, who get their objectives accomplished and, therefore, want the rest of us to keep quiet about other objectives. I understand that. I am not going to object But this is selective irresponsibility. It is selective favoritism for very important objectives. But there is no excuse, not one, for not having a CR between now and when everybody in this body expects to come back to this town, January 2. Nobody expects to come back before that, and the gentleman and I know it.  Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.
