For Judge Chappell in particular, this day is long overdue. She was nominated almost a year ago, and was one of the 11 nominees who Senate Republicans refused to vote on before the end of the last Congress. They delayed her confirmation even though she had the support of every single Republican on the Judiciary Committee, and the bipartisan support of her home state Senators, Senator Nelson and Senator Rubio. They delayed her confirmation even though she is nominated to fill a judicial emergency vacancy that has been vacant for over 400 days. When I say that President Obama's qualified, consensus nominees have faced unprecedented levels of delay and obstruction, this is precisely what I have been talking about.  Even the Wall Street Journal has taken notice. In an article last week, Gerald Seib wrote that the obstruction even of consensus district court nominees is an example of ``the Senate's inability to pull out of partisan ruts and get beyond an epidemic of filibusters.'' While only a few years ago Senate Republicans insisted that filibusters of judicial nominees were unconstitutional, or that they should be reserved for ``extraordinary circumstances,'' this article notes that they ``decided in recent years that it is acceptable to mount filibusters not only in exceptional cases but to stop even the most routine business.'' I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement.  Senate Republicans claim that they have blocked only two of President Obama's nominees, but they are not being fair in that characterization. They blocked nominees like Robert Chatigny and Louis Butler by refusing to allow the Senate to vote on them. They blocked nominees like Victoria Nourse, Arvo Mikkanen, and Elissa Cadish by refusing to return blue slips. They even blocked Steve Six by rescinding the blue slips after the nominee had already had a hearing. This reminds me of the way they pocket filibustered dozens of President Clinton's nominees. While as Chairman I have protected the rights of home State Senators, that right does not extend to allowing them to shirk responsibility for it. In all, President Obama has had a significantly lower percentage of his circuit and district nominees confirmed at this point in his time in office than President Bush did at the same point in his presidency.  Senate Republicans who take such pride in the number of nominees being confirmed this year ignore how many, like Judge Chappell, were needlessly delayed from confirmation last year and what they have done during the last 4 years. That is why even after the 17 confirmations this year, we remain nearly 20 confirmations behind the pace we set for President Bush's circuit and district nominees, and vacancies remain nearly twice as high as they were at this point during President Bush's second term. For all their self-congratulatory statements they cannot refute the following: We are not even keeping up with attrition. Vacancies have increased, not decreased, since the start of this year. President Obama's judicial nominees have faced unprecedented delays and obstruction by Senate Republicans. We have yet to finish the work that could and should have been completed last year. There are still a dozen judicial nominees being denied confirmation.  A recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service compares the whole of President Obama's first term to the whole of President Bush's first term, and the contrast could not be more clear. The median Senate floor wait time for President Obama's district nominees was 5 times longer than for President Bush's. President Obama's circuit nominees faced even longer delays, and their median wait time was 7.3 times longer than for President Bush's circuit nominees. The comparison is even worse if we look just at nominees who were reported and confirmed unanimously. President Bush's unanimously confirmed circuit nominees had a median wait time of just 14 days. Compare that to the 130.5 days for President Obama's unanimous nominees. That is more than 9 times longer. Even the nonpartisan CRS calls this a ``notable change.'' There is no good reason for such unprecedented delays, but those are the facts.  The confirmations in the last few months do not change the reality of what has happened over the last four years. If a baseball player goes 0-for-9, and then gets a hit, we do not say he is an all-star because he is batting 1.000 in his last at bat. We recognize that he is just 1-for-10, and not a very good hitter.  So while I welcome the confirmations this year, I note both that 13 of the 17 could and should have been confirmed last year and that there are another dozen nominees pending before the Senate, including two who also could have been confirmed last year. We can and must do more for Americans who look to our courts for justice. They deserve better than long delays and empty courtrooms. With 10 percent of our Federal bench vacant, and a backlog of nominees on the Senate Executive Calendar, it is clear that the Senate is not doing what it should on nominations.  It is also ridiculous to complain that the Senate does not have nominees when Mark Barnett, Claire Kelly, Sheri Chappell, Michael McShane, Nitza Quinones Alejandro, Luis Restrepo, Jeffrey Schmehl, Kenneth Gonzales, Gregory Phillips, Sri Srinivasan, Ray Chen, and Jennifer Dorsey are awaiting confirmation.  In addition, Senate Republicans need to take responsibility for not workingwith the President to fill vacancies. It is disingenuous of Republican Senators not to work with President Obama to pick nominees and then blame the President for the lack of nominees. I was interested to hear one Senate Republican argue that if Senators do not get recommendations in ``expeditiously enough,'' the President ``has the prerogative to nominate someone and then we have the responsibility to act on it.'' Before President Obama had made a single judicial nomination, all Senate Republicans sent him a letter threatening to filibuster his nominees if he did not consult Republican home state Senators. So the recent statement was either a complete reversal in position, or baiting a trap to then block any nominees the President sends to us.  Some Republican Senators have been willing to work with the President to find nominees in their States. We recently received nominations for district court vacancies in Alabama and Tennessee, and I hope to schedule those nominees for hearings soon. In Pennsylvania, the Republican Senator is now working with Senator Casey to find nominees that they both support. In fact, three such nominees are pending before the Senate now, and they would fill three of the six current vacancies in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. The nominees have been pending before the Senate for over 2 months after being reported unanimously, and I hope Senate Republicans will allow us to complete action on them before the Memorial Day recess.  I remain deeply concerned about the impact of sequestration on our Federal courts and our legal system. After 4 years in which Senate Republicans have forced our courts to operate shorthanded, with 10 percent or more of judgeships vacant, these harsh spending cuts are the last thing we should be doing. I continue to hear from judges and other members of the legal community about the damage of sequestration.  The Judicial Conference, whose presiding officer is Chief Justice Roberts, wrote last week to request emergency funding for fiscal 2013 in order to ``address critical needs resulting from sequestration cuts.'' These indiscriminate cuts have left our Federal judiciary ``confronting an unprecedented fiscal crisis that could seriously compromise the Constitutional mission of the United States courts.'' Members of the bar have written in support of this request, stating that ``budget cuts have forced diminished court staffing, court closures, compromised security, and lengthy trial delays.'' They rightly note that ``it is people's lives that are adversely changed'' by these unnecessary cuts. I ask unanimous consent that both letters be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my statement. I hope Senators read these letters and take these concerns seriously, and that we can come together to meet our responsibilities to our coequal branch and to the 310 million Americans we all serve.  Judge Sheri Polster Chappell is nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, where she has been serving since 2003 as a Federal Magistrate Judge. Prior to her appointment to the Federal bench, she worked as a Lee County Court Judge, as an Assistant State Attorney in the Twentieth Judicial Circuit of Florida, where she was the first female county office head, and as an instructor at the Southwest Florida Criminal Justice Academy. Judge Chappell was reported unanimously last year and again 2 months ago. The Middle District of Florida has a second judicial emergency vacancy, and it is unfortunate that the Senate is not being allowed to consider the nominee to that seat, as well. Judge Brian Davis received unanimously the ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary's highest rating of ``well qualified,'' and was reported favorably almost 1 year ago.  Judge Michael McShane is nominated to a judicial emergency vacancy on the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon. Currently a Circuit Court Judge on the Multnomah County Circuit Court, Judge McShane has served as a State court judge for over 15 years. He previously served as a Circuit Judge Pro Tem on the Multnomah County Circuit Court. Prior to becoming a judge, Judge McShane spent his entire 9-year legal career as a trial attorney in the Metropolitan Public Defender's Office in Portland, OR. Judge McShane has the support of his home State Senators, Senator Wyden and Senator Merkley, and was reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee over 2 months ago.  Senate Republicans have a long way to go to match the record of cooperation on consensus nominees that Senate Democrats established during the Bush administration. After today's votes, 10 more judicial nominees remain pending, and all but one were reported unanimously. All Senate Democrats are ready to vote on each of them to allow them to get to work for the American people. We can make real progress for our Federal courts and the American people if Senate Republicans are willing to join us.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 14, 2013]                 Open Judgeships Show D.C. Dysfunction                          (By Gerald F. Seib)       Jill Pryor of Georgia and Rosemary Marquez of Arizona      aren't exactly household names, but they share a distinction      with national importance: Both have been waiting exactly 689      days for the Senate to act on their nominations to become      federal judges.       Yet they aren't even the most extreme examples of      Washington's inability to perform one of its most basic      functions, filling the federal judiciary across the land. All      told, 85 federal judgeships sit vacant, meaning some 10% of      the federal judiciary is empty--and this at a time when those      who run the court system think there actually should be new      judicial posts created because of an escalating workload.       Openings on two of the nation's most important federal      appeals courts--the Ninth Circuit in the West and the D.C.      Circuit in Washington--have been unfilled since 2005.       There is no current nominee for either seat, not since      President Barack Obama's choice for the D.C. slot gave up in      frustration after Republican filibusters put her nomination      in limbo for 2\1/2\ years.       The Obama administration must shoulder some blame for this      predicament. It has been slower than its predecessors to vet      and nominate judicial candidates.       But the lion's share of the blame lies with the Senate, a      body that's becoming an embarrassment to itself and that      increasingly infects the rest of government with its      paralysis.       Traditionally, the first step in the process of picking      federal judicial nominees is for senators to recommend to the      White House candidates to fill vacancies in their home      states; the process slows when home-state senators of      different parties can't agree.       Senators then can quietly decline to endorse a nominee, or      put an unpublicized ``hold'' on nominees they disapprove of,      or can stop a nomination by simply threatening a filibuster.       In today's partisan environment, all those tactics are at      work.       ``There always was a bit of back and forth between the      parties on nominations generally, and judicial nominations      specifically,'' says Caroline Fredrickson, a former Senate      aide and now president of the American Constitution Society,      a left-leaning organization that tracks judicial nominations.      ``But it's become so extreme that I think we are in a      completely different situation now.''       This problem persists even though the Senate has confirmed      more than a dozen judges in the past couple of months. That      progress has served mostly to keep the number of vacancies      below 100; judges still aren't being confirmed fast enough to      keep up with the rate of attrition as older judges retire.       In recent days, more attention has been devoted to the      Senate's unwillingness to confirm Obama administration      nominations for senior executive-branch positions, including      Thomas Perez as labor secretary and Gina McCarthy as      Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Republican      senators have buried the nominees with written questions and      refused to show up for committee votes on them.       Yet the backlog of judicial vacancies is a more long-     standing problem and a better illustration of the Senate's      inability to pull out of partisan ruts and get beyond an      epidemic of filibusters.       Both parties know that, while cabinet secretaries come and      go, federal judges stay on the scene for years, even decades.      So the party out of power is reluctant to let a president      fill the judiciary with nominees of his political persuasion,      if leaving the positions unfilled creates at least the chance      that the opposition party will be able to put a judge of its      liking into place a few years hence.       This political temptation wouldn't matter so much if      senators hadn't also decided in recent years that it is      acceptable to mount filibusters not only in exceptional cases      but to stop even the most routine business.       Thus, the country now is in the bizarre position of having      a chief justice, John Roberts, on the Supreme Court for      almost eight years--while his previous position on the D.C.      Circuit Court of Appeals has sat empty for the entire time.       This problem has been building for years. A recent study by      the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service shows that      even     noncontroversial judicial appointments--those that ultimately      got bipartisan support and easily passed the Senate--are      having to wait longer for confirmation across the past four      presidencies of both parties.       As Republicans note, Democrats set the stage for today's      problems by filibustering George W. Bush's judicial nominees.      Now the problem has grown worse in the Obama years, as      Republicans turn the tables and bottle up Democratic      nominations.       The study found that 35.7% of George W. Bush's      noncontroversial circuit-court nominees had to wait more than      200 days for confirmation--up from 22.2% for Bill Clinton.      During the Obama presidency, that percentage has soared to      63.6%. No Obama circuit-court nominee has been confirmed in      less than 100 days.       What's more, previously only more-sensitive appeals-court      nominations were filibustered; now it's also less-sensitive      district-court nominations.       It has been clear for a while that Washington has trouble      getting big things done. Judicial vacancies show it doesn't      do the smaller ones so well either.                                  ____                                                          dri,                                        Chicago, IL, May 16, 2013.     Senator Patrick Leahy,     Chairman Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office          Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Chairman Leahy: The operations of the federal      judiciary are essential to maintaining the rule of law in      this country, the foundation for much of our economic life.      This lies in peril now as budget cuts have forced diminished      court staffing, court closures, compromised security, and      lengthy trial delays. This, of course, means that justice is      delayed. Since criminal trials must take priority, already      lengthy delays in civil trials become even longer. Perhaps      thousands of businesses will not survive the abeyance of      lengthy uncertainty over the outcome of litigation. We talk      of the effect on justice, we talk of the effect on businesses      but, at bottom, it is people's lives that are adversely      changed.       The U.S. Judicial Conference and the Administrative Office      of the U.S. Courts have petitioned for emergency funding of      $73 million that would replace only a small portion of the      $350 million in cuts forced upon them by sequestration. The      22,000 members of DRI--The Voice of the Defense Bar with one      voice wholeheartedly support their petition and urge that you      take whatever action is necessary to realize its fulfillment.       DRI will remain at the disposal of Congressional and White      House leaders to provide any expertise or support needed to      move funding forward.           Sincerely,                                               Mary Massaron Ross,     DRI President.                                  ____                                               Judicial Conference                                         of the United States,                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2013.     Hon. Sylvia Mathews Burwell,     Director, Office of Management and Budget, 17th Street NW,          Washington, DC.       Dear Director Burwell: We write on behalf of the Judicial      Conference of the United States to inform the Administration      of the Judiciary's decision to seek $72.9 million in fiscal      year 2013 emergency supplemental appropriations to address      critical needs resulting from sequestration cuts. The      supplemental request includes $31.5 million for the Courts      Salaries and Expenses account, and $41.4 million for the      Defender Services account. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 1107,      we respectfully request that the President transmit the      Judiciary's supplemental requirements to Congress promptly      and without change. A detailed summary of this supplemental      request is included in Enclosure 1. A funding table and the      proposed legislative language are included in Enclosure 2.       Final enacted appropriations for fiscal year 2013, after      sequestration cuts are applied, reduce Judiciary funding      overall by nearly $350 million below fiscal year 2012      discretionary appropriations. Emergency measures have been      implemented throughout the federal court system to address      the drastically reduced funding levels under sequestration,      but the federal courts do not have the flexibility to absorb      such a large cut. The impacts of sequestration are compounded      by the fact that 100 percent of the cuts must be absorbed      with only six months remaining in the fiscal year. Unlike      some Executive Branch entities, the Judiciary has little      flexibility to move funds between appropriation accounts to      lessen the effects of sequestration. There are no lower-     priority programs to reduce in order to transfer funds to      other Judiciary accounts.       Section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency      Deficit Control Act of 1985 allows for statutory spending      caps to be exceeded under certain conditions, including if      Congress and the President designate funding as an emergency      requirement. The Judiciary is confronting an unprecedented      fiscal crisis that could seriously compromise the      Constitutional mission of the United States courts. We      believe our supplemental request meets the threshold for      receiving an emergency designation.       The Judiciary's emergency actions to date do not constitute      a solution to the budget crisis facing the federal courts as      a result of sequestration. Instead, these actions represent a      conscientious effort to mitigate the adverse impact of      sequestration on court operations in an attempt to ensure      continued access to justice for the citizens of this country.      However, sequestration cuts have created an unprecedented      financial crisis that is impacting all facets of federal      court operations.       Finally, we note that Executive Branch agencies with      criminal justice responsibilities have had the flexibility      and resources to address their fiscal year 2013 sequestration      cuts. As a result, these agencies--which directly impact the      workload of the Judiciary--have been able to avoid furloughs.      While the Judiciary has the authority to transfer funds      between appropriation accounts, it does not have the      available funding flexibility needed to do so. Instead, we      must ask Congress to approve a supplemental appropriation.       Please feel free to contact us if you have any questions      regarding this supplemental appropriations request.           Sincerely,     Julia S. Gibbons,       Chair, Judicial Conference, Committee on the Budget.     Thomas F. Hogan,       Secretary, Judicial Conference of the U.S.                                  ____  Summary of Judiciary Fiscal Year 2013 Emergency Supplemental Request                      COURTS SALARIES AND EXPENSES       The Courts Salaries and Expenses account funds the bulk of      federal court operations including the operations of the      appellate, district, and bankruptcy courts, and probation and      pretrial services offices. This account was cut $239 million      below fiscal year 2012 levels under sequestration. Given the      decentralized nature of the federal court system, individual      courts will decide how to absorb the majority of cuts      required by sequestration. To mitigate the impact of      sequestration on employees, the courts have slashed non-     salary budgets but even with these reductions, on a national      level, up to 1,000 court employees could be laid off over the      remainder of the fiscal year and thousands of employees face      furloughs. These staffing losses will come on top of the      nearly 2,200 probation and pretrial services officers and      clerks' office staff the courts have already lost since the      end of July 2011, a 10 percent loss of staff. Cuts to clerks'      office staffing will result in the slower processing of civil      and bankruptcy cases which will impact individuals, small      businesses, and corporations seeking to resolve disputes in      the federal courts.       Sequestration cuts will also impact public safety. Our      probation and pretrial services officers are federal law      enforcement officers that supervise defendants awaiting trial      and offenders on post-conviction release. Cuts to officer      staffing levels mean less deterrence, detection, and response      to possible resumed criminal activity by federal defendants      and offenders in the community. In addition, funding to      support GPS and other electronic monitoring of potentially      dangerous defendants and offenders has been cut 20 percent.      Equivalent cuts to funding for drug testing, substance abuse      and mental health treatment of federal defendants and      offenders have also been made, increasing further the risk to      public safety.       Of the $31.5 million in fiscal year 2013 supplemental      funding requested for Courts Salaries and Expenses, $18.5      million will be used to avoid further staffing cuts and      furloughs in clerks of court and probation and pretrial      services offices during the fourth quarter of fiscal year      2013. This funding will save the jobs of approximately 500      court employees and avoid 14,400 planned furlough days for      3,300 court employees. The remaining $13.0 million will      restore half of the sequestration cuts to drug testing,      substance abuse, and mental health treatment services for      defendants awaiting trial and offenders released from prison.      Timely diagnosis and treatment of drug and mental health      conditions is critical to defendants/offenders successfully      completing their terms of release and ensuring community      safety.                           DEFENDER SERVICES       The Judiciary's Defender Services program provides      financially eligible federal defendants with defense counsel      and related services that, under the Sixth Amendment and the      Criminal Justice Act, the government must fund in order to      prosecute cases. Program costs are essentially comprised of      compensation to federal defender organization (FDO) staff,      payments to private ``panel'' attorneys, case related      expenses (expert witnesses, interpreters, investigations,      etc.), space rent, and other fixed costs. Consequently, the      primary options for absorbing the $52 million sequestration      cut are reducing FDO staffing levels and/or deferring      payments to private panel attorneys. Reducing FDO staff      results in appointments being shifted to panel attorneys thus      increasing those costs, and deferring panel attorney payments      into fiscal year 2014 only adds to fiscal year 2014      appropriations requirements. Absent supplemental funding, the      Judiciary will need to suspend payments to private panel      attorneys for the last 15 business days (3 weeks) of the      fiscal year, and FDOs will need to further reduce costs      through staffing cuts and by furloughing employees for a      national average of approximately 15 days for the remainder      of the fiscal year.       We are aware that the U.S. Department of Justice is not      furloughing staff so we anticipate the pace at which criminal      cases requiring appointment of defense counsel will continue      unabated, while resources in the Defender Services program      are diminishing. Between October 2012 and April 2013, FDOs      downsized by 113 employees and other employees were      furloughed. Further FDO cuts and the anticipated suspension      of panel attorney payments will create the real possibility      that panel attorneys may decline to accept Criminal Justice      Act appointments in cases that otherwise would have been      represented by FDOs. Delays in the cases moving forward may      result in violations of constitutional and statutory speedy      trial mandates resulting in criminal cases being dismissed.       Of the $41.4 million in supplemental funding requested for      Defender Services, $27.7 million is required to avoid      deferring payments to private attorneys for the last 15      business days (3 weeks) of the fiscal year. To address      staffing losses, $8.7 million is needed to avoid further      staffing cuts and furloughs in FDOs during the fourth quarter      of fiscal year 2013. This funding will save the jobs of      approximately 50 employees and avoid 9,600 planned furlough      days for 1,700 FDO employees. The remaining $5.0 million is      for projected defense representation and related expert costs      for high-threat trials, including high-threat cases in New      York and Boston that, absent sequestration, the Defender      Services program would have been able to absorb without the      need for supplemental funding.                                  ____                                             FEDERAL JUDICIARY--FY 2013 SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS REQUEST                                                                         [$000]--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              FY 2012                                         FY 2013                                                         -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                  Appropriation Account                       FY 2012      FY 2013 Full       FY 2013         FY 2013         FY 2013         FY 2013                                                              Enacted      Year CR (P.L.

Federal Judiciary FY 2013 Supplemental Appropriations Request    COURTS OF APPEALS, DISTRICT COURTS, AND OTHER JUDICIAL SERVICES                         SALARIES AND EXPENSES     Bill Language       For an additional amount for `Courts of Appeals, District      Courts, and Other Judicial Services, Salaries and Expenses,'      $31,500,000, for emergency expenses of the courts for the      fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, including amounts      necessary to minimize staffing reductions and furloughs, and      for drug testing, drug treatment, and mental health treatment      services of offenders and defendants in the probation and      pretrial services program. Provided, That the amount provided      herein is designated by the Congress as an emergency      requirement pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced      Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.     Justification       $18.5 million will be used to avoid further staffing cuts      and furloughs in clerks of court and probation and pretrial      services offices during the fourth quarter of fiscal year      2013. This funding will save the jobs of approximately 500      court employees and avoid 14,400 planned furlough days for      3,300 court employees.       $13.0 million will restore half of the sequestration cuts      to drug testing, substance abuse, and mental health treatment      services for defendants awaiting trial and offenders released      from prison. Timely diagnosis and treatment of drug and      mental health conditions is critical to defendants/offenders      successfully completing their terms of release and ensuring      community safety.                           DEFENDER SERVICES     Bill Language       For an additional amount for `Courts of Appeals, District      Courts, and Other Judicial Services, Defender Services,'      $41,400,000, for emergency expenses related to the      representation of defendants under the Criminal Justice Act      for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2013, including      amounts necessary to minimize staffing reductions and      furloughs in federal defender organizations, for the      compensation and reimbursement of panel attorneys and      experts, and for representation costs associated with high-     threat trials. Provided, That the amount provided herein is      designated by the Congress as an emergency requirement      pursuant to section 251(b)(2)(A) of the Balanced Budget and      Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985, as amended.     Justification       $27.7 million is required to avoid deferring payments to      private attorneys representing indigent defendants under the      Criminal Justice Act for the last 15 business days (3 weeks)      of the fiscal year. Without additional funding, sequestration      cuts will necessitate that these expenses shift to fiscal      year 2014. These costs were not included in the Judiciary's      fiscal year 2014 budget request to Congress.       $8.7 million will avoid further staffing cuts through      layoffs, buyouts and early outs, and furloughs in federal      defender organizations during the fourth quarter of fiscal      year 2013. This funding will save the jobs of approximately      50 employees and avoid 9,600 planned furlough days for 1,700      federal defender organization employees.       The remaining $5.0 million is for projected defense      representation and related expert costs for high-threat      trials, including high-threat cases in New York and Boston      that, absent sequestration, the Defender Services program      would have been able to absorb without the need for      supplemental funding.
