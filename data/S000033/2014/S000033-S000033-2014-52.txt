 President, way back in 1968 as a young man, I got a job at the Department of Taxation in a small building on State Street across the street from the statehouse, working for the administration, then-Governor Hoff, and that was a very important experience for me and helped me shape some of my views which I carry today.  Phil Hoff's career of public service began during World War II when he put his studies on hold and joined the Navy, eventually joining the submarine service. He served on the USS Sea Dog in the Pacific theater, going on a number of combat tours in the dangerous waters near the main islands of Japan.  While in naval training in New London, CT, a friend of his set up a blind date with a Connecticut college student. Her name was Joan Brower, and she and Phil would be married after the war--a marriage that was to last for six rich decades.  I know Senator Leahy and his wife, as well as myself and my wife Jane, know the Hoffs very well. We know Joan and know of her years of dedication to the people of the State of Vermont, especially in the area of education. So she in her own right has been a very important figure in our State.  After Phil Hoff's graduation from Cornell Law School, he and Joan moved to Burlington, VT, in 1951. Deeply committed to social justice, he became involved in Democratic Party politics and did that despite the fact that he grew up in a Republican family.  Senator Leahy will remember that way back then, there was a group of what they called the Young Turks--younger Democrats who came into a very conservative Republican legislature. Most of them were under 40. Many of them were veterans of World War II. They moved forward to try to bring about some long needed change in the State.  Their experience in the legislature motivated Phil Hoff to run for Governor in 1962. As Senator Leahy indicated, if my memory is correct, he was the first Democrat elected Governor since the Civil War; is that right?
