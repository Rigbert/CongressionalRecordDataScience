 Speaker, I want to take the opportunity today to recognize the remarkable story of Bill Carris and the company he formerly owned, Carris Reels.  Carris Reels, Inc. had been a family owned company. It has been supplying wood, metal and plastic reels to the wire and cable industry for over 45 years, and it provides the most comprehensive product line of any reel manufacturer. Carris Reels has 710 employees, in 15 plants, in eight states.  I said that Carris Reels was formerly owned by Bill Carris. In 1995, at a time when the company had sales of $83 million, Bill Carris decided that in the future the company should be owned by its employees. So the company began an employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) by contributing about 10 percent of its stock to an ESOP. Since then, employee share of ownership has increased--and increased.  This past December an issue of new shares of stock to the ESOP meant that employees owned half--50 percent--of Carris Reels. Also in December, a loan to the ESOP enabled it to buy almost a third of Bill Carris' remaining shares. That meant that, by the turn of the year 2006, 65 percent of Carris Reels was owned and controlled by the company's employees. The intention is for it to be 100 percent employee-owned within 10 years.  Bill Carris strongly believes in community building and in the major role employees should play in running the business in which they work. That's why he decided on a long term plan to move his company from family to employee ownership. He hoped, and his hopes are being borne out, that in doing so he could remake the whole work situation at Carris Reels: employees would be--in fact, they are--owners responsible for charting the course of the corporation, keeping it a profitable business, and securing its long term future. Those who work at Carris Reels have moved from employees to owners, from hired workers to stewards of the company and its future. They share in the company's profits.  Today, in Vermont, the Vermont Employee Ownership Center is recognizing Bill Carris and Carris Reels for taking the enormous step to majority ownership by the corporation's employees through their employee stock ownership plan. The recognition is well-deserved. I believe Bill Carris and his employees, and Carris Reels as well, can serve as a model for our Nation.                          ____________________
