 President, I ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of H.R. 3762, the Chair lay before the Senate the conference report to accompany H.R. 22; further, that it be in order for the majority leader or his designee to offer a cloture motion on the conference report; and that notwithstanding the provisions of rule XXII, that there be 30 minutes of debate equally divided between the two leaders or their designees on the cloture motion; I further ask that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate vote on the motion to invoke cloture; finally, if cloture is invoked, all postcloture time be yielded back and the Senate vote on adoption of the conference report to accompany H.R. 22.
