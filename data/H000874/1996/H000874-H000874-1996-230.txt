Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his contribution and his support of this amendment.  In closing, I would hope and I believe that this amendment will receive broad bipartisan support. I do not know whether there will be a rollcall vote, but if there is, I hope that there is an overwhelming show of support, not against Turkey, not against any other country, but for the critically important principle that we will expect our allies and our friends, as well as those who may not count themselves in that category, to facilitate the relieving of human misery and suffering.  I trust that this amendment will receive the strongest support possible.
