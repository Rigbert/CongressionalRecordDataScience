  Mr. President, how I wish I could vote for this bill. I voted for the last Senate bill and then voted against the conference committee report because I did not think the conference committee report was an improvement on the Senate bill.  Today I, and I believe my colleague from California, will vote against this bill in hopes that when the bill comes out of conference it is a bill that does not so severely disadvantage one State in this Union, and that State is California.  Mr. President, as I look at the savings of this bill, a net of about $55 billion, $17 billion of those savings come from the largest State in the Union and the State I believe most impacted by poor people. We know $9 billion comes from the cutoff of legal immigrants, including refugees and asylees who have no sponsor--the aged, the halt and the blind--$3.5 billion of AFDC, and $4.2 billion of food stamps, totaling about a $17 billion impact on the State of California.  Now, I ask the State legislature, the State of California, look at the budget. Are they prepared to pick up some of the difference? I ask the counties to let Senator Boxer and I know how this bill impacts your county, because Isuspect it is going to be a major transfer, particularly on counties like Los Angeles. I suspect Los Angeles County will be the county most impacted by the passage of this bill in the United States of America.  A fair bill, OK, I vote for; but a bill that says, OK, we will take from the biggest State in the Union as much as we possibly can--and that is what this bill has done to date. I do not believe it is a fair-share bill. I do not believe we see communities across the Nation doing their share. Perhaps because we have the two largest metropolitan areas in the Nation is one of the reasons why this bill will fall very hard on poor people and cities, and particularly on cities that have large numbers of dispossessed.
