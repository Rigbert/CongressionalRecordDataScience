 President, with respect to some of the previous consents, Americans are frustrated with the amount of spending and borrowing we are doing here. We have an opportunity to show the American people that we can be fully responsible and cut spending elsewhere. Earlier today, we voted for a bill that would have cut the deficit by almost $70 billion. Let's not wave on through legislation that is going to worsen the deficit and dig an even deeper hole than we are currently in.  Americans want us to show that we are serious about lowering the debt. Therefore, I have a consent to extend all of these expired provisions, including unemployment insurance and the doc fix. I will propose that now.  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 411, S. 3421; further, that the bill be read the third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.  Before the Chair rules, for clarity, this is a paid-for 30-day extension of the extenders bill, which includes unemployment insurance, the doc fix, COBRA, flood insurance, and the extension of the small business loan guarantee program, and the 2009 Federal poverty guidelines.
