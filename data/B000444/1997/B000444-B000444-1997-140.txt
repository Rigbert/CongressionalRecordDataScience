 President, let me conclude by saying that I know there are thousands of other families who made the same kind of sacrifices. When we talk about family values, this is what I mean by family values, family values that reflect a common consensus about sacrifice to make things better for everyone else in the family.  Mr. President, I am proud to know the entire Kimmel family, and I am proud that one of the young children in that family--not quite so young anymore, she is still very young by our standards--is down here making her contribution to her Nation by working on the staff of one of our colleagues from Florida.  Mr. President, with the Chair's permission, I would like to move onto a different subject, the subject spoken to by my friend from Alabama. If my friend, Senator Durbin, is ready to move on his, I will withhold that until the next lull we have and respond to my friend from Alabama on the issue he raised regarding youth violence.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.
