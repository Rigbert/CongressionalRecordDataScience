Chairman, I thank the gentleman from California (Mr. Baca) for his leadership in bringing this issue to the attention of our subcommittee. The gentleman from California is particularly well suited to sensitizing the Congress for the extra attention that needs to be put to identify those institutions serving higher numbers of Hispanic populations, and to help to place those in a more competitive position with larger and more established institutions that tend to have first call at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, even in their research protocols.  Mr. Chairman, I assure the gentleman that he will have my full support in identifying ways to move funding to those institutions to reach a broader array of the American public, and, as with some of the other institutions we were talking about a little bit earlier, particularly those serving African American populations, to look also toward a global role for those institutions because of their inherent bilingual capabilities and the historic tiesthat exist, certainly with Latin America and other places.  So we do not have a narrow view of only one State or even our own country, but we have this tremendous resource in our own country if we but see it and enhance it.  Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for coming to us and for being the leader in this Congress and for bringing this issue to our attention. California could not have sent a more capable representative here, and the gentleman certainly has my pledge to work with him as we move toward conference to see if we cannot do it better in this new millennium than perhaps some of those who served here in the past.
