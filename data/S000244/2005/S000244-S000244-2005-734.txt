Chairman, I make a point of order against the amendment because it is in violation of section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. This amendment would provide new budget authority in excess of the allocation made under section 302(a) of the Committee on the Judiciary and thus is not permitted under section 302(f) of the Act.  I ask for a ruling of the Chair.  The Acting CHAIRMAN. Is there anyone else who wishes to be heard on the point of order?  If not, the Chair is prepared to rule on the point of order.  The gentleman from Wisconsin raises a point of order that the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington violates section 302(f) of the Budget Act.  Section 302(f) of the Budget Act provides a point of order against any amendment providing new budget authority that would cause a breach of the relevant allocation of budget authority under section 302(a) of the Budget Act.  The Chair is authoritatively guided under section 312 of the Budget Act by an estimate of the Committee on the Budget that the new mandatory budget authority provided by this amendment would cause a breach of the allocation of the Committee on the Judiciary.  The amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington would increase the level of new mandatory budget authority in the bill above the allocation made under section 302(a). As such, the amendment violates section 302(f) of the Budget Act. The point of order is sustained.                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Nadler
