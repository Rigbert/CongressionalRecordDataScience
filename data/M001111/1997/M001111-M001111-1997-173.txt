 President, 4 years ago today, thanks to the hard work of Senator Dodd, we passed the Family and Medical Leave Act. It was one of the first things I did as a newly elected Senator. And I am proud of its success. In fact, it is probably the single most effective law passed by Congress this decade.  Now I want to expand the scope of FMLA to apply to participation in our schools. The Time for Schools Act of 1997 will allow parents 24 hours per year to participate in activities in their child's school.  As the mother of two children--one a teenager in high school--I know how difficult and how important it is to participate in their education. I have been lucky to have had the opportunity to be involved in their lives. But many parents do not have the time it takes to do those little things that will assure their child's success in school.  By expanding the uses of one of the most successful laws in years, I want to give parents something they don't have enough of--time.  When I tour schools in my home State of Washington, I often hear young people say, ``Adults don't seem to care about me.'' We know that's not true, but we need to show them that adults do care. And one of the best places to start is to reaffirm the importance of their education by taking steps to help their families get more involved in schools.  These days we have many dual-income families and single parents struggling to work to make ends meet. All of these families know how important it is to be involved in their children's learning.  However, a recent study, Parents as School Partners research initiative, sponsored by the National Council of Jewish Women's Center for the Child, found that a basic lack of time was one of the main barriers to more parental involvement at schools.  Educational studies have shown that family involvement is more important to student success than family income or education. In fact, things parents control, such as limiting excess television watching and providing a variety of reading materials in the home, account for almost all the differences --nearly 90 percent--in average student achievement across States.  All sectors of our communities want more time for young people. Students, teachers, parents and businesses feel something must be done to improve family involvement. In fact, 89 percent of company executives identified the biggest obstacle to school reform as the lack of parental involvement.  And, a 1996 postelection poll commissioned by the national PTA and other organizations found that 86 percent of people favor legislation that would allow workers unpaid leave to attend parent-teacher conferences, or to take other actions to improve learning for their children.  A commitment to our children is a commitment to the future. I want to make sure all young people receive the attention they need to succeed.  My legislation will allow parents time to: First, attend a parent/teacher conference; second, interview a new school for their child; and third, participate in family literacy training.  Just last week, I talked to a woman from Bellevue who has an 11-year-old special needs daughter in school. Both she and her husband work during the day, but he cannot get away for school activities. She told me my legislation would allow her husband to attend school conferences and participate in their child's education for the first time.  I look at the Family and Medical Leave Act--which has helped one in six American employees take time to deal with serious family health problems, and which 90 percent of businesses had little or no cost implementing--and I see success. People in my State have been able to deal with urgent family needs, without having to give up their jobs.  My bill expands the uses of Family and Medical Leave to another urgent need families face--the need to help their children learn.  Now we need to grant employees the same peace of mind about preventing problems in school that can lead to bigger problems for their children later on. The time is right for the Time for Schools Act.                          ____________________
