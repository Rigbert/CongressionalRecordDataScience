Mr. Speaker, many of those on the other side of this debate that are against this tax relief keep talking about a $50 billion cost to the government. It is going to cost the government.  My question is, whose money is this? It is the farmer down in Kentucky and the States across the country that get up every morning before the sun comes up, and that never get in from the fields many times until way after the sun has gone down, that put in 40, 50, 60 years of their life of hard work in the fields to provide something for the next generation, for their sons and for their daughters.  It is their money. They are the ones who are working to earn it, to provide something for their heritage, something that will allow the farm produce in this country to continue.  As my friend, the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Weller) mentioned a little while ago, urban sprawl is eating up the farmland because the hard work of farmers is going back into taxes. That is totally unfair.
