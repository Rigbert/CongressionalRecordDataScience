Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.  I want to say to the gentleman, the items that he mentioned--some of which we may agree on, some of which we may not agree on--frankly, could have been included in the bill that the House could have reported out of committee and brought to the floor. That didn't happen. What we did was, with the inability to pass a bill that came out of your committee on the floor of the House, we then repaired to what was essentially a shell of a bill to go to conference.  The problem that I have with the gentleman's statement is I hope that the statement that ``we may be getting there'' is correct.
