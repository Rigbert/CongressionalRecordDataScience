Speaker, let us make no mistake on what we are about here today; the cuts we are about to adopt today, with precious little debate, are to finance the tax cuts of tomorrow. There is a direct and irrefutable relationship. So the cuts in Medicare, the cuts in veterans' benefits, the cuts in Social Security Administration costs, are to finance tax cuts tomorrow. Tomorrow perhaps we will get the debate on the merits of the tax cut.  The point is, earlier the esteemed chairman of the Committee on Rules responded to my earlier statement saying, well, so the gentleman has not had time to read the bill. So there is only one copy. Now it is on the Internet. That is great. But he said earlier, he said, he should just rely on the judgment of some of his colleagues. Can he not follow them?                              {time}  1300  First off, I doubt that they have had an opportunity to read the entire bill. And secondly, no, I did not check my brain at the door when I got elected to Congress. I do not hand my voting card to anybody else. And to say that, well, the Democrats were abusive so we should not give them adequate time to read and review the bill, so we are going to do the same thing, I voted against those reconciliation bills when we had a Republican President and a Democratic Congress, and they kept shoving them through here and we did not have to read them.  I even signed a pledge never to vote for another one unless we were given a minimum of 24 hours to read it. No one has been given 24 hours to read however many thousand pages there are, and I do not know, because there is no index and it is not numbered. But it is probably a couple of thousand pages. Makes amazing changes.  I would ask the gentleman if he is particularly familiar with the cuts in veterans. We have an aging veterans population, and by the year 2002 we are going to see a reduction of $4.1 billion in veterans benefits in the year 2002 to achieve this theoretically balanced budget or, if one wanted to be more cynical, to finance tax cuts for the wealthy, a 19-percent cut.  How is it we are going to reduce veterans benefits with a dramatically aging veterans population, not just the World War II people and the Korean war vets, my own generation, the Vietnam generation, is beginning to develop aging problems. We cannot do it. It will not work.  We are not going to debate those veterans provisions here on the floor. We are not going to debate the merits of them. We are not going to be given time to even examine them. It took me a while to find them in this pile.  Let us talk about the Social Security administrative costs. Social Security is underfunded for administration, and it is paid for out of the trust fund. It is paid for out of the trust fund, yet we are going to cut Social Security administrative costs by 25 percent. So the next time that your mom or dad or your grandparents or the gentleman from New York [Mr. Solomon] in a few years tries to find out what has happened to their Social Security check, they are going to be put on indefinite hold. Right now it takes 3 months on the average to process a claim.  Under this legislation, it is going to take 6 months or 9 months, and with an aging population, who knows how bad it will get?  These are not the places to cut the budget. They are not fair cuts. In fact, I do not believe these cuts will ever be made. In fact, under this bill the deficit gets larger next year for the first time in 5 years. Is that not ironic? We are going to balance the Federal budget, but the deficit has been going down since 1992. Under this for the first time since 1992, the deficit goes on.
