Speaker, let me say, so the Members understand where we are going to be I think at the end game, if we had continued our discussions about how to resolve this, and so the public understands as well, our constituents understand, I believe we can agree, I believe the White House can agree, on a number for this bill that will still be more than one-half billion dollars under the President's request.                              {time}  1530  I hope my colleagues heard that. I believe the White House is prepared to sign a bill that is half a billion, almost $600 million under what they submitted to this Congress. So it is not that they are asking, gee, we ought to include all of these additional dollars.  It was, and I want to repeat, in the committee report issued by the majority in the Congress, the Republican majority. It says that their allocation was $1.3 billion too little to meet the priorities. Now, that was still, we understand, $800 million less than the President asked for, which was 2.2. They are adding 1.2 back. So there is still $100 million under what the committee report said they thought, the Republicans thought, was necessary to adequately fund this bill.  I repeat again to the chairman, for whom I have great respect, as everyone on this floor knows, we work together closely, I think we can work this thing out; and I know he is frustrated that we have been at it for 8 or 9 days and have not been able to work it out. There are a lot of interests here. The tax provision that was added to this bill, totally extraneous to our bill, has caused us a problem. That is not of the making of the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Kolbe) or my making or the making of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Obey) or the making of the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young); but it is causing us a problem, and that needs to be worked out. But we ought not to go up the hill just to be shot down and have to go back up it again.  Mr. Speaker, I think we can reach an agreement that is almost $600 million under the President's request, and I would urge us to do that. Reject this conference report and approve the motion to recommit to conference. Let us sit down at the table, reason together and come up with a reasonable, positive, productive bill.
