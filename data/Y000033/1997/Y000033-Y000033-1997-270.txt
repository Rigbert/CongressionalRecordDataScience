Mr. Speaker, today I am introducing the King Cove Health and Safety Act of 1997. This legislation will for the first time provide residents of King Cove, AK, with a safe form of access to and from their community. Specifically, the legislation grants a right-of-way across certain Federal land in exchange for acquisition by the United States of land containing prime habitat owned by a Native corporation. Surface transportation made possible through the right-of-way will connect the city of King Cove, which has an ill-equipped airport, with Cold Bay, which has a modern, 24-hour all-weather airport and the State's third-largest runway.  King Cove, AK, is a remote community on the western end of the Alaska Peninsula, with a population of about 900. Most residents are of Aleut descent and have lived in the community long before Federal ownership of the surrounding area. Unfortunately, the only modes of transportation to and from this fishing community are by air and sea through some of the most extreme--and deadly--weather and topographic conditions in the world.  Weather conditions permitting, travel is done by small aircraft from King Cove's tiny dirt landing strip with no navigational aids to Cold Bay's modern facility, just 20 miles away. Because King Cove's landing strip is surrounded by mountains and experiences some of the harshest wind, snow, and dense fog found anywhere, residents do not have safely reliable transportation linking them with the modern airport facility in Cold Bay, from which access to the rest of the State and lower 48 States is available. People in King Cove are literally trapped in their community for days at a time during poor weather, and the risk of adverse conditions is present year round.  There have been several fatal accidents in the corridor between King Cove and Cold Bay. Even an attempted medivac during a life-and-death situation resulted in an accident, killing all aboard the aircraft. These accidents alone point to a need for a road between the cities.  In carrying out the land exchange, the bill specifically directs that the Secretary of Interior and the Aleutians East Borough, the municipal government representing King Cove and Cold Bay, to develop terms and conditions on use of the right-of-way to protect the lands and resources affected. This will assure that public and private interests in the lands surrounding the area are protected. In addition, the land acquired by the United States under the exchange is very high quality and maintains the quality of the public's resources.  In summary, this bill opens the way to safe, cost-effective access to King Cove and benefits the public, and it is my intent to move this legislation.                          ____________________
