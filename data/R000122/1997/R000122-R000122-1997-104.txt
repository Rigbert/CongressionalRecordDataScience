President, our democracy is dependent upon participation, stimulated by a belief that the system works for everyone. Just as scandals led to reform in 1907 and 1974, Congress must now rise to the task once again to address a threat to our democratic process. Polls continue to demonstrate that a majority of Americans believe the political process is controlled by wealthy interests. The most dangerous aspect of the current situation is that polls also show that voters have no faith in the ability of their representatives to implement reform. If we do not address the influence of money in our electoral system, the health of our democracy will endure increasing risk. It is time to begin true, comprehensive reform. I would like to thank Senators Bryan, Hollings, and Johnson for joining me in this endeavor. Their leadership on this issue in the past has proven invaluable, and I am proud that they have chosen to join me in this important effort. It is my hope that the Senate will now move to address the problem of our campaign system at its root. Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1057       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.

The purposes of this Act are to--       (1) restore the public confidence in and the integrity of      our democratic system;       (2) strengthen and promote full and free discussion and      debate during election campaigns;       (3) relieve Federal officeholders from limitations on their      attention to the affairs of the Federal government that can      arise from excessive attention to fundraising;       (4) relieve elective office-seekers and officeholders from      the limitations on purposeful political conduct and discourse      that can arise from excessive attention to fundraising;       (5) reduce corruption and undue influence, or the      appearance thereof, in the financing of Federal election      campaigns; and       (6) provide non-preferential terms of access to elected      Federal officeholders by all interested members of the public      in order to uphold the constitutionally guaranteed right to      petition the Government for redress of grievances.     SEC. 3. FINDINGS OF FACT.       Congress finds the following:       (1) The current Federal campaign finance system, with its      perceived preferential access to lawmakers for interest      groups capable of contributing sizable sums of money to      lawmakers' campaigns, has caused a widespread loss of public      confidence in the fairness and responsiveness of elective      government and undermined the belief, necessary to a      functioning democracy, that the Government exists to serve      the needs of all people.       (2) The United States Supreme Court, in Buckley v. Valeo,      424 U.S. 1 (1976), disapproved the use of mandatory spending      limits as a remedy for such effects, while approving the use      of campaign contribution limits.       (3) Since that time, campaign expenditures have risen      steeply in Federal elections with spending by successful      candidates for the United States Senate between 1976 and 1996      rising from $609,100 to $3,775,000, an increase that is twice      the rate of inflation.       (4) As campaign spending has escalated, voter turnout has      steadily declined and in 1996 voter turnout fell to its      lowest point since 1924, and stands now at the lowest level      of any democracy in the world.       (5) Coupled with out-of-control campaign spending has come      the constant necessity of fundraising, arising, to a large      extent, from candidates adopting a defensive ``arms race''      posture of constant readiness against the risk of massively      financed attacks against whatever the candidate may say or      do.       (6) The current campaign finance system has had a      deleterious effect on those who hold public office as endless      fundraising pressures intrude upon the performance of      constitutionally required duties. Capable and dedicated      officials have left office in dismay over these distractions      and the negative public perceptions that the fundraising      process engenders and numerous qualified citizens have      declined to seek office because of the prospect of having to      raise the extraordinary amounts of money needed in today's      elections.       (7) The requirement for candidates to fundraise, the      average 1996 expenditure level required a successful Senate      candidate to raise more than $12,099 a week for 6 years,      significantly impedes on the ability of Senators and other      officeholders to tend to their official duties, and limits      the ability of candidates to interact with the electorate      while also tending to professional responsibilities.       (8) As talented incumbent and potential public servants are      deterred from seeking office in Congress because of such      fundraising pressures, the quality of representation suffers      and those who do serve are impeded in their effort to devote      full attention to matters of the Government by the campaign      financing system.       (9) Contribution limits are inadequate to control all of      these trends and as long as campaign spending is effectively      unrestrained, supporters can find ways to protect their      favored candidates from being outspent. Since 1976 major      techniques have been found and exploited to get around and      evade contribution limits.       (10) Techniques to evade contribution limits include      personal spending by wealthy candidates, independent      expenditures that assist or attack an identified candidate,      media campaigns by corporations, labor unions, and nonprofit      organizations to advocate the election or defeat of      candidates, and the use of national, State, or local      political parties as a conduit for money that assists or      attacks such candidates.       (11) Wealthy candidates may, under the present Federal      campaign financing system, spend any amount they want out of      their own resources and while such spending may not be self-     corrupting, it introduces the very defects the Supreme Court      wants to avoid. The effectively limitless character of such      resources obliges a wealthy candidate's opponent to reach for      larger amounts of outside support, causing the deleterious      effects previously described.       (12) Experience shows that there is an identity of interest      between candidates and political parties because the parties      exist to support candidates, not the other way around. Party      expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, an      identifiable candidate are, therefore, effectively spending      on behalf of a candidate.       (13) Political experience shows that so-called      ``independent'' support, whether by individuals, committees,      or other entities, can be and often is coordinated with a      candidate's campaign by means of tacit understandings without      losing its nominally independent character and, similarly,      contributions to a political party, ostensibly for ``party-     building'' purposes, can be and often are routed, by      undeclared design, to the support of identified candidates.       (14) The actual, case-by-case detection of coordination      between candidate, party, and independent contributor is, as      a practical matter, impossible in a fast-moving campaign      environment.       (15) So-called ``issue advocacy'' communications, by or      through political parties or independent contributors, need      not, as a practical matter, advocate expressly for the      election or defeat of a named candidate in order to cross the      line into election campaign advocacy; any clear, objective      indication of purpose, such that voters may readily observe      where their electoral support is invited, can suffice as      evidence of intent to impact a Federal election campaign.       (16) When State political parties or other entities      operating under State law receive funds, often called ``soft      money'', for use in Federal elections, they become de facto      agents of the national political party and the inclusion of      these funds under applicable Federal limitations is necessary      and proper for the effective regulation of Federal election      campaigns.       (17) The exorbitant level of money in the political system      has served to distort our democracy by giving some      contributors, who constitute less than 3 percent of the      citizenry, the appearance of favored access to elected      officials, thus undermining the ability of ordinary citizens      to petition their Government. Concerns over the potential for      corruption and undue influence, and the appearances thereof,      has left citizens cynical, the reputation of elected      officials tarnished, and the moral authority of Government      weakened.       (18) The 2 decades of experience since the Supreme Court's      Buckley v. Valeo ruling in 1976 have made it evident that      reasonable limits on election campaign expenditures are now      necessary and these limits must comprehensively address all      types of expenditures to prevent circumvention of such      limits.       (19) The Supreme Court based its Buckley v. Valeo decision      on a concern that spending limits could narrow political      speech ``by restricting the number of issues discussed, the      depth of their exploration, and the size of the audience      reached''. The experience of the past 20 years has been      otherwise as experience shows that unlimited expenditures can      drown out or distort political discourse in a flood of      distractive repetition. Reasonable spending limits will      increase the opportunity for previously muted voices to be      heard and thereby increase the number, depth, and diversity      of ideas presented to the public.       (20) Issue advocacy communications that do not promote or      oppose an identified candidate should remain unregulated, as      should the traditional freedom of the press to report and      editorialize about candidates and campaigns.       (21) In establishing reasonable limits on campaign      spending, it is necessary that the limits reflect the      realities of modern campaigning in a large, diverse      population with sophisticated and expensive modes of      communication. The limits must allow citizens to benefit from      a full and free debate of issues and permit candidates to      garner the resources necessary to engage in that debate.       (22) The expenditure limits established in this Act for      election to the United States Senate were determined after      careful review of historical spending patterns in Senate      campaigns as well as the particular spending level of the 3      most recent elections as evidenced by the following:       (A) The limit formula allows candidates a level of spending      which guarantees an ability to disseminate their message by      accounting for the size of the population in each State as      well as historical spending trends including the demonstrated      trend of lower campaign spending per voter in larger States      as compared to voter spending in smaller States.       (B) The candidate expenditure limits included in this      legislation would have restricted 80 percent of the incumbent      candidates in the last 3 elections, while only impeding 18      percent of the challengers.       (C) It is clear from recent experience that expenditure      limits as set by the formula in this Act will be high enough      to allow an effective level of competition, encourage      candidate dialogue with constituents, and circumscribe the      most egregiously high spending levels, so as to be a bulwark      against future campaign finance excesses and the resulting      voter disenfranchisement.

If any provision of this Act or amendment made by this Act,      or the application of a provision or amendment to any person      or circumstance, is held to be unconstitutional, the      remainder of this Act and amendments made by this Act, and      the application of the provisions and amendment to any person      or circumstance, shall not be affected by the holding.

Exhibit 1         [From the Secretary of State, State of West Virginia]       On May 20, officials of 33 states, including secretaries of      state, attorneys general and state regulators of campaign      finance (in those states where the secretary of state does      not have that responsibility) registered their support of a      court challenge to the 1976 U.S. Supreme Court decision in      the case of Buckley v. Valeo. The officials in these 33      states made known their support as amicus curiae in a pending      appeal in the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in a case entitled      Kruse v. City of Cincinnati, which concerns a Cincinnati      ordinance limiting candidates for the city council to      spending no more than three times their annual salary. The      ordinance was declared unconstitutional by a Federal district      court, based on the Buckley v. Valeo decision, which ruled      that such limits violated First Amendment freedom of speech      protection. Whichever way the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals      rules, it is almost certain to be appealed to the U.S.      Supreme Court, thus paving the way for a re-argument of      Buckley v. Valeo.

The attorneys general statement comes amidst a growing      national debate about the validity of that court ruling,      Buckley v. Valeo.       Former U.S. Senator Bill Bradley has denounced the decision      and has helped lead the recent push in the U.S. Congress for      a constitutional amendment to allow for mandatory spending      limits in federal elections. The City of Cincinnati is      litigating the first direct court challenge to the ruling,      defending an ordinance passed in 1995 by the City Council      which sets limits in city council races. And, in late October      1996, a group of prominent constitutional scholars from      around the nation signed a statement calling for the reversal      of Buckley.       The attorneys general statement reads as follows:       ``Over two decades ago, the United States Supreme Court, in      Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), declared mandatory      campaign expenditure limits unconstitutional on First      Amendment grounds. We, the undersigned state attorneys      general, believe the time has come for that holding to be      revisited and reversed.       ``U.S. Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis once wrote      `[I]n cases involving the Federal Constitution, where      correction through legislative action is practically      impossible, this court has often overruled its earlier      decision. The court bows to the lessons of experience and the      force of better reasoning . . .' Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas      Co., 285 U.S. 393, 406-408 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).       ``As state attorneys general--many of us elected--we      believe the experience of campaigns teaches the lesson that      unlimited campaign spending threatens the integrity of the      election process. As the chief legal officers of our      respective states, we believe that the force of better      reasoning compels the conclusion that it is the absence of      limits on campaign expenditures--not the restrictions--which      strike `at the core of our electoral process and of the First      Amendment freedoms.' Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 39 (1976)      (quoting Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S. 23, 32 (1968).''       The United States has witnessed a more than a 700% increase      in the cost of federal elections since the Buckley ruling.      The presidential and congressional campaigns combined spent      more than $2 billion this past election cycle, making the      1996 elections the costliest ever in U.S. history.       Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller, Nevada Attorney General      Frankie Sue Del Papa, Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods,      and the National Voting Rights Institute of Boston initiated      Tuesday's statement. The Institute is a non-profit      organization engaged in constitutional challenges across the      country to the current campaign finance system. The Institute      serves as special counsel for the City of Cincinnati in its      challenge to Buckley, now in federal district court in      Cincinnati and due for its first court hearing on January 31,       ``Buckley stands today as a barrier to American      democracy,'' says Attorney General Del Papa. ``As state      attorneys general, we are committed to helping remove that      barrier.'' Del Papa says the twenty-four state attorneys      general will seek to play an active role in efforts to      reverse the Buckley decision, including the submission of      friend-of-the-court briefs in emerging court cases which      address the ruling.       ``Maybe it wasn't clear in 1976, but it is clear today that      financing of campaigns has gotten totally out of control,''      says Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller. ``The state has a      compelling interest in bringing campaign finances back under      control and protecting the integrity of the electoral      process.''       Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods adds, ``I believe that      it is a major stretch to say that the First Amendment      requires that no restrictions be placed on individual      campaign spending. The practical results, where millionaires      dominate the process to the detriment of nearly everyone who      cannot compete financially, have perverted the electoral      process in America.''
