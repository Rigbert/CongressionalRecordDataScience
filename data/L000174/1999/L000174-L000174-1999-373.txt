The Senator from Vermont was long ago clear on that point. My wife, my children--my family--are far more important to me than any votes, any office, any lobbyist, any pressure, any favors, any campaign contributions, or anything else. I think most families in this country feel the same way--that the family is the most precious thing possible to them.  In this body we passed legislation that might protect those families. We see the response on the other side of the Capitol of symbolism instead of substance, of speeches or feel-good solutions. We cast the tough votes here. The Senator from New Jersey made sure that we did.  On this issue especially, can we not stand up and say our families are more important, our children are more important, our grandchildren are more important, and all of that is more important than a powerful lobby?
