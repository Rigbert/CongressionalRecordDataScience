I am upset. Talking about global warming, I have a little global warming underneath the collar. Two minutes and one hour of debate for such a terribly, terribly serious question.  I rise in support of Senate Concurrent Resolution 98, and that is a fancy word that puts the Senate on record against any U.N.-sponsored, legally binding greenhouse treaty. I come to this issue as the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, where we spent years trying to address our emission policies with sound science, reasonable cost-benefit considerations, and I want to wake up farm country because that is not what is going to happen.  A U.N. scientific panel now blames agriculture, under the auspices of this plan, for 20 percent of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions. They propose the following things, Mr. and Mrs. Farmer, so get your pencil out, get your yellow tablet out. We don't have time to really discuss this--Senators want to leap on their airplanes at 12 o'clock--in terms of an issue that will affect every life and every pocketbook in America. But we are here talking about it, and I probably have 30 seconds.  Wake up. Mandatory increased fuel economy requirements. Phaseout of diesel fuel. How are our tractors going to run? I don't know. Limitations on production. Been there, done that. We passed a new farm bill. Mandate for no-till; no-till farming, forcing farmers to buy all sorts of new equipment. Here's a good one: Restrictions on livestock production to reduce methane emission for the United Nations. We are going to control what goes into the cow and now, evidently, we are going to have a U.N. observer trying to control what comes out of the cow. And restrictions on processing and transportation of food products.  This is uncalled for. Many of my colleagues joined to send a letter to the administration to say, how on Earth are we going to do this and still feed America in a troubled and hungry world? That answer has not been forthcoming. We recommended five considerations, and then we follow with the letter that was sent to the President last November by every major agriculture group.  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                 November 8, 1996.     The President,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: Last summer, participants in the second      Conference of Parties of the United Nations' Framework      Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) agreed to negotiations      for legally binding numeric limits on greenhouse gas      emissions. This dramatic shift from voluntary to enforceable      caps on greenhouse gases was led by the U.S. According to      your spokespeople, there is now a consensus in the world      scientific community which demands urgent action to reduce      greenhouse gas emissions.       There is less than agreement outside the United Nation's      scientific body. Furthermore, there is still a lively debate      among respected scientists about the human versus natural      sources of greenhouse gases and their effect on climate.      Controversy notwithstanding, the climate change treaty is      moving full-speed ahead with the Administration's      enthusiastic support. A final agreement is scheduled to be      completed in December of 1997, with ratification by      individual countries beginning in 1998. If ratified by the      U.S. Senate, the treaty will be binding on the U.S. and other      developed countries and may be incorporated into U.S. law.      However, developing countries will not have to comply.       Of great concern to agriculture are reports under      consideration by the U.N. scientific panel which blame      agriculture for more than 20 percent of human-caused      greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, we are concerned      about proposals for the following: fuel economy requirements,      reduction or phaseout of the use of diesel fuel, limitations      on production per acre for some crops, requirements for      ``plowless'' soil preparation, mandatory fallowing of crop      land, limits and restrictions on livestock production to      reduce methane emissions, restrictions on use of fertilizer,      restrictions on timber harvesting, restrictions on      processing, manufacturing and transportation of food      products.       Unfortunately, these proposals ignore agriculture's      positive role in reducing greenhouse gases by removing carbon      dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis. Most      importantly, they cavalierly disregard the most valuable      function of modern agriculture--feeding a hungry world.      Ironically,     rice production has been singled out as the number one      culprit in human-caused methane emissions.       We are very concerned that these recommendations or similar      ones will be incorporated in the final climate change      agreement, ratified and imposed on U.S. farmers and ranchers      through U.S. laws. Binding and enforceable controls would      apply only to developed countries and would severely      disadvantage U.S. farmers and ranchers in today's global      markets.       Moreover, we are deeply concerned and surprised that the      Administration has not actively consulted with agriculture as      the agreement has been developed. We respectfully request      that the Administration take the following actions:       (1) The Administration must fully and actively consult with      agriculture. Agricultural interests have not been considered      by the Department of State and other U.S. agencies which are      closely involved with the development of the climate change      agreement. The agreement must include an open and extensive      public debate which involves agricultural producers and      members of Congress, USDA and other agencies.       (2) The Administration should withdraw its support for      legally binding and enforceable caps on emissions until here      is a stronger consensus from the scientific community that      they are justified. If it is determined that controls are      justified, they should be accomplished voluntarily or in ways      which minimize disruption of U.S. agricultural producers.       (3) The final climate change agreement, scheduled for      completion in December of 1997, must be delayed to provide      sufficient time for consultation with agriculture and for      adequate risk, cost and benefit assessment.       Without proper scientific and economic analyses and      assessment, U.S. farmers and ranchers may be placed at a      serious disadvantage with agricultural producers in countries      which do not plan to reduce greenhouse gases.       If the Administration does not adequately address the above      concerns, we may raise them with Congress during the      ratification process.           Sincerely,         American Farm Bureau Federation, American Crop Protection            Association, American Sheep Industries Association,            American Soybean Association, CENEX, National            Association of Wheat Growers, National Cattlemen's Beef            Association, National Corn Growers Association,            National Cotton Council, National Food Processors            Association, National Grange, National Milk Producers            Federation, National Pork Producers Council, The            Fertilizer Institute, United Agribusiness League,            United Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Association, USA Rice,            Western Growers Association.
