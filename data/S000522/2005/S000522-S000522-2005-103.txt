Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the Senate joint resolution (S.J. Res. 19) calling upon the President to issue a proclamation recognizing the 30th anniversary of the Helsinki Final Act, as amended.  The Clerk read as follows:                              S.J. Res. 19       Whereas August 1, 2005, is the 30th anniversary of the      Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in      Europe (CSCE), renamed the Organization for Security and      Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in January 1995 (hereafter in      this resolution referred to as the ``Helsinki Final Act'');       Whereas the Helsinki Final Act established a new framework      for relations among countries in Europe and the North      Atlantic region that recognized that respect for human rights      is a fundamental principle in regulating international      relations;       Whereas, during the Communist era, members of      nongovernmental organizations, such as the Helsinki      Monitoring Groups in Russia, Ukraine, Lithuania, Georgia, and      Armenia and similar groups in Czechoslovakia and Poland,      sacrificed their personal freedom and even their lives in      their courageous and vocal support for the principles      enshrined in the Helsinki Final Act;       Whereas Congress contributed to advancing the aims of the      Helsinki Final Act by creating the Commission on Security and      Cooperation in Europe to monitor and encourage compliance      with provisions of the Helsinki Final Act;       Whereas, in the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, the      participating States in the OSCE (hereafter in this      resolution referred to as the ``participating States'')      declared that ``[h]uman rights and fundamental freedoms are      the birthright of all human beings, are inalienable and are      guaranteed by law'' and that ``[t]heir protection and      promotion is the first responsibility of government'';       Whereas, in the 1991 Document of the Moscow Meeting of the      Conference on the Human Dimension of the CSCE, the      participating States ``categorically and irrevocably      declare[d] that the commitments undertaken in the field of      the human dimension of the CSCE are matters of direct and      legitimate concern to all participating States and do not      belong exclusively to the internal affairs of the State      concerned'';       Whereas, in the 1990 Charter of Paris for a New Europe, the      participating States committed themselves ``to build,      consolidate and strengthen democracy as the only system of      government of our nations'';       Whereas the pro-democracy revolution in Serbia in 2000, the      Rose Revolution in Georgia in 2003, the Orange Revolution in      Ukraine in 2004, and the popular revolution in Kyrgyzstan in      2005 demonstrate the primacy of popular sovereignty and the      importance of OSCE commitments on free and fair elections;       Whereas the OSCE and the participating States have      undertaken a series of measures aimed at combating anti-     Semitism, racism, xenophobia, and discrimination and should      report on related progress during the OSCE Conference on      anti-Semitism and on Other Forms of Intolerance in Cordoba,      Spain, in June 2005;       Whereas the 1999 Istanbul OSCE Charter for European      Security and the November 19, 1999, Istanbul Summit      Declaration note the particular challenges of ending violence      against women and children as well as sexual exploitation and      all forms of trafficking in human beings, and commit the      participating States to strengthen efforts to combat      corruption, eradicate torture, and end discrimination against      Roma;       Whereas the main challenge facing the participating States      remains the implementation of the principles and commitments      contained in the Helsinki Final Act and other OSCE documents      adopted on the basis of consensus;       Whereas the participating States have recognized that      economic liberty, social justice, and environmental      responsibility are indispensable to prosperity;       Whereas the participating States have committed themselves      to promoting economic reforms through enhanced transparency      for economic activity, with the aim of advancing the      principles of market economies;       Whereas the participating States have stressed the      importance of respect for the rule of law and vigorous      efforts to fight organized crime and corruption, which      constitute a great threat to economic reform and prosperity;       Whereas OSCE has expanded the scope and substance of its      efforts, undertaking a variety of preventive diplomacy      initiatives designed to prevent, manage, and resolve conflict      within and among the participating States;       Whereas the politico-military aspects of security remain      vital to the interests of the participating States and      constitute a core element of OSCE's concept of comprehensive      security;       Whereas the OSCE has played an increasingly active role in      civilian police-related activities, including training, as an      integral part of OSCE's efforts in conflict prevention,      crisis management, and post-conflict rehabilitation; and       Whereas the participating States bear primary      responsibility for raising awareness of violations of      commitments contained in the Helsinki Final Act and other      OSCE documents: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the      United States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress      calls upon the President--       (1) to issue a proclamation--       (A) recognizing the 30th anniversary of the signing of the      Final Act of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in      Europe;       (B) reasserting the commitment of the United States to full      implementation of the Helsinki Final Act;       (C) urging all participating States to abide by their      obligations under the Helsinki Final Act; and       (D) encouraging the people of the United States to join the      President and Congress in observance of this anniversary with      appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities; and       (2) to convey to all signatories of the Helsinki Final Act      that respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms,      democratic principles, economic liberty, and the      implementation of related commitments continue to be vital      elements in promoting a new era of democracy, peace, and      unity in the region covered by the Organization for Security      and Cooperation in Europe.
