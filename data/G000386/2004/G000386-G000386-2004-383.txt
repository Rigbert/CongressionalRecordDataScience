 President, the Senator from Nevada is entirely right, 100 percent right. He may have not heard me say this, but I keep referring during this debate to a statement made by the Washington Post describing a Democratic tax aide as saying there was not a whole lot of incentive for the other side to move this bill along because as sanctions come on and people get laid off, that is going to benefit them in the next election. I said to my colleagues and I say to the Senator from Nevada that is politics getting in the way of good policy. I hope the other side realizes that the best politics is good policy.
