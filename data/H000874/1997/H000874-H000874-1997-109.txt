Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Chair for that ruling. Mr. Speaker, on May 24, 1993, a 10-year-old little boy, Stanley Burdynski, Junior, was abducted in suburban Prince Georges County, just a few miles from where we stand. Four and one-half years later he is still missing. We must never forget little Stanley. I am sure that every one of the Members has a Stanley or a Mary in their district, a child who has been abducted by a demented criminal person in their districts and in mine.  What this motion to instruct says is that we need to make sure that the fourth year of the program directed at the operation of the Exploited Child Unit of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children is fully funded.  Mr. Speaker, we need to do everything in our power to ensure the fact that we, to the greatest extent possible, can protect our children from exploitation, from being taken from their families, from their neighborhoods, from their playgrounds, from their schools, by those demented souls of which I spoke, subjecting those children to abuse and, yes, even to death. That is what we will vote on in this motion.  I would hope that the House would stand united and unanimous in its commitment to speaking out and acting out and putting our money where our mouth is in the fight against the abusers of children in America.  In 1996 I worked with other concerned Congress men and women to gain funding to create the Exploited Child Unit at the Center for Missing and Exploited Children in the Treasury-Postal bill. John Walsh of America's Most Wanted spoke out and came to Capitol Hill, and had a press conference on this very issue, and said he needed to have every one of us, as he was doing on television every week, committed to the fight against abusers of our children.  This unit creates a greater awareness and generates leaders for law enforcement to combat child sexual exploitation. There are many efforts underway at the Federal level to combat child sexual exploitation that I want to tell the Members about.                              {time}  1515  Under the leadership of the FBI, each of the seven major law enforcement agencies are coordinating efforts with the National Center to bring a priority approach to such child exploitation cases.  Through the 1994 crime bill, the Secret Service is working closely with the National Center, using unique forensic technology to track abductors. The Customs Service has established the International Pornography Investigation and Coordination Center. The U.S. Postal Service continues its aggressive efforts to crack down on child pornography. The FBI has also established a child abduction and serial killers unit.  Mr. Speaker, I hope that through these efforts we can create a new awareness throughout the land and make America's children safer and more secure. I urge my colleagues to support this very important effort to protect our children against exploitation, sexual abuse, and yes, even murder.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
