 President, I want to discuss an issue I have with the Armed Services Committee.  On May 15, 1995, I wrote a letter to the chairman of the Committee, my friend from South Carolina, Senator Thurmond.  This was a very important letter.  It concerned the nomination for promotion of Navy Capt. Jeffrey A. Cook.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the letter was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                  U.S. Senate,                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 1995.     Hon. Strom Thurmond,     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. Senate,          Washington, DC.       Dear Strom: I am writing to raise questions about the      pending promotion of Navy Captain Jeffrey A. Cook to the rank      of rear admiral (lower half).       My questions about Captain Cook's fitness for promotion      pertain to his service as the A-12 class desk officer during      the period 1987 to 1990. In that capacity, he was the chief      engineer for the A-12 stealth bomber program and the      principal adviser for engineering matters to the A-12 program      manager, Captain Lawrence G. Elberfeld.                      a-12 criminal investigation       The main source of my concern about Captain Cook's      qualification for promotion are the results of a criminal      investigation. The investigation was conducted by the Chicago      Field Office of the Defense Criminal Investigation Service,      Department of Defense Inspector General (IG). The report on      the investigation is dated April 20, 1994, and carries the      designation 9011045M-20-SEP-90-40SL-E5A/D.       The purpose of the criminal investigation was to examine      allegations that ``U.S. Navy and DOD [Department of Defense]      officials may have concealed or conspired to conceal, or      otherwise thwart, the dissemination of adverse A-12 program      information to the DOD and to Congress.''       The investigation found several specific instances in which      former Secretary of the Navy H. Lawrence Garrett and other      Navy A-12 program officials ``withheld, concealed, and/or      suppressed adverse A-12 program information'' from cognizant      DOD and Navy oversight personnel and from Congress. Both Mr.      Garrett and Captain Elberfeld are accused of withholding      relevant documents and material during an official inquiry      and subsequent congressional oversight hearings. Worse still,      the report suggests that Mr. Garrett may have in fact      destroyed important evidence during the criminal phase of the      investigation.       Based on the results of the investigation, the Inspector      General concluded there were reasonable grounds to believe      that Federal criminal law had been violated. Therefore, all      the detailed information related to the actions of Secretary      Garrett were referred to the Department of Justice for      possible prosecution. Similarly, the case against Captain      Elberfeld was referred to the Office of the Judge Advocate      General of the Navy for possible court-martial. Captain      Elberfeld was suspected of violating various articles of the      Uniform Code of Military Justice, including article 907--     pertaining to false official statements. In both cases, a      decision was made not to prosecute.             captain cook's possible role in a-12 cover-up       Now, this is the issue that must be addressed on the      pending nomination: Did Captain Cook allow himself to be      drawn into the web of deceit spun out by former Secretary      Garrett and Captain Elberfeld? Was Captain Cook a willing or      unwilling participant in     the scheme to withhold and conceal adverse information on the      A-12 program?       On the surface, Captain Cook's performance appears to have      been exceptional. He is the only Navy official I know of who      was critical of the program, and the investigators say he is      the only person who was ``open and cooperative'' during the      probe. His criticism came in the form of several briefings in      which he ``identified severe technical problems with the A-12      program.'' These briefings are discussed in the IG's      investigative report. His criticism was very much to his      credit.       While his critical technical assessments were commendable,      I fear they may have been nothing more than a clever      bureaucratic ``cover-your-fanny'' operation. This is the      scenario I visualize. Captain Cook would present a briefing      identifying ``severe technical problems,'' but in the face of      opposition and pressure from Captain Elberfeld and more      senior officers, Cook would quickly back down. Without      further protest, Captain Cook would then join Captain      Elberfeld in pumping out false and misleading status reports      on the A-12. In the end, I think, Captain Cook acquiesced in      the scheme to conceal adverse information on the program.       The incidents described on pages C29 to C31 of the      investigative report seem to lend credence to idea that      Captain Cook went along with the coverup.       On April 16, 1990, Captain Cook provided one of his      briefings to a group of senior officers, including Vice      Admiral Richard C. Gentz, Commander of the Naval Air Systems      Command. In the briefing, he identified ``severe technical      problems'' that could ``slip'' the program for at least one      year. After hearing that piece of bad news, Admiral Gentz      told Captain Elberfeld to ``re-assess'' the A-12 program and      report back to him with solutions within 24 hours. As I      understand it, Captain Cook helped Captain Elberfeld      prepare a ``revised'' technical update briefing for      Admiral Gentz. This is where Captain Cook seems to have      taken a 180 degree turn in his thinking. He did an about-     face and worked with Elberfeld late into the night,      twisting and distorting the facts, turning his own      assessment upside down, helping Elberfeld put a favorable      spin on the status of the program. After their night of      handy work, Admiral Gentz felt the one-year ``slip'' was      unnecessary, leaving the money spigot wide open. That      particular piece of work came at a very critical point in      the program. (Refer to page C-31)       Captain Cook also participated in the confiscation and      suppression of a devastating report on the A-12 program. This      incident occurred in February 1990 and is described on pages      C-29 to C-30 of the investigative report.       The highly critical evaluation was prepared by Mr. Ed      Carroll, a civilian production analyst assigned to the Office      of the Secretary of Defense. His report predicted a one-year      ``slip'' in the program. The Carroll report was      ``confiscated''--allegedly for a security violation--and      ``relinquished'' to Captain Cook. He subsequently turned it      over to one of his subordinates, Mr. John J. Dicks. When      investigators discovered the Carroll report buried in A-12      program office files, attached to it was a handwritten note      by Dicks. The note stated in part: ``Keep this package quiet      and close controlled.'' As a result of Cook's actions, the      highly critical Carroll report never saw the light of day.      The handling of the Carroll report suggests to me that      Captain Cook could have played a role in concealing adverse      information on the A-12 stealth bomber.               holding captain cook to a higher standard       Strom, as I said, compared to other A-12 program officials,      Captain Cook's performance was exceptional. It makes him look      like a hero. But in making that comparison, we are holding      him to a negative standard. A candidate for promotion to rear      admiral must be held to a much higher standard--a standard of      excellence. When that is done, I don't think Captain Cook      measures up.       There is a fundamental principle of leadership: ``Seek      Responsibility and Take Responsibility for your Actions.''       At the time, the A-12 was a top priority Navy program. As      chief engineer on the project, he had identified a major      technical problem that posed a very real threat to the      viability of the whole program. It was a ``show stopper''--a      problem that had to be fixed. He was responsible for      developing a sound and timely solution to the problem. He had      a responsibility to follow through. He was fully accountable      for that problem. A man in his position should not wait for      his superiors to tell him what to do. He needed to take the      initiative and solve it--with the approval, of course, of his      superiors. However, when those over him balked at his      solutions but at the same time refused to even address ``show      stopper'' problems, then he had a responsibility to confront      them and push it up the chain of command. For example, he      would have sent a written report up the chain of command to      the top DOD acquisition ``czar''--if necessary, laying out      his view of the problem.       Unfortunately, Captain Cook's protests ended where they      began--in his briefings. Had he pushed them further up the      chain of command, he would have run the risk of ruining his      career. Doing the right thing almost always involves risks      and even danger. Doing what must be done takes courage,      commitment and integrity. Had Captain Cook pursued the more      risky solution, he would have set an example of excellence.      No aspect of leadership is more powerful that setting a good      example. Had he done it, Cook would have been a role model      for all to respect. Strom, we must judge Captain Cook against      such a standard of excellence.       A candidate for promotion to rear admiral should      demonstrate certain outstanding leadership qualities      including courage, competence, candor, commitment, and      integrity. In my mind, Captain Cook failed to demonstrate      those skills as chief engineer on the A-12 project. His      superior officers told him to do the wrong thing, and he did      it. He failed to stick to his beliefs. He failed to act on      the information he had. He failed to demonstrate a solid      commitment to solving the engineering problems that he had      identified and for which he was accountable.                  overall impact of a-12 mismanagement       The failure of former Secretary Garrett, Captain Elberfeld,      Captain Cook and others to confront major technical problems      on the A-12 in an open, honest, and timely way has had a      profound, long-term negative impact on the Navy.       The A-12 was supposed to begin replacing the Navy's aging      fleet the A-6 bombers in 1994. That was last year. Well,      there are no A-12 bombers in the fleet and never will be. All      the money spent on the A-12--nearly $3.0 billion--was wasted.      We have absolutely nothing to show for it.       The A-12 program was terminated for default in January      1991. Former Secretary of Defense Cheney killed the program      because it was way over cost and way behind schedule, and no      one could tell him how much money it would take to finish it.      To make matters worse, the two A-12 contractors--McDonnell      Douglas and General Dynamics--are suing the Government for      billions. And the Government's case is weak. It's very      difficult to blame the contractors for what happened when top      Navy officials like Garrett, Elberfeld, and Cook all knew the      program was in deep trouble but did nothing about it. They      just kept shoveling more money at the contractors in the form      of fraudulent progress payments--payments made for work      that was not performed. In all probability, we are going      to end up spending even more money on a dead horse--mainly      because people like Garrett, Elberfeld and Cook didn't do      their jobs. Had any one of them done the right thing, the      A-12 might be in the fleet today.       Strom, I only ask that you review the IG's investigative      report and determine what role, if any, Captain Cook played      in the scheme to withhold and conceal adverse information on      the A-12 program.       I also ask that Captain Cook's performance not be evaluated      against the performance of the other A-12 program officers. I      respectfully request that he be judged against a much higher      standard of excellence. Please let me know what you decide.       Your consideration in this matter is greatly appreciated.           Sincerely,                                              Charles E. Grassley,                                                     U.S. Senator.
