 President, I rise today, along with Senators Biden, Specter, Kyl, Hollings and Allen, to introduce the Reducing Crime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act of 2004--legislation designed to deter, prevent and punish a terrorist attack at or through one of our Nation's seaports.  I would like to thank Senator Kyl for joining me in sponsoring this bill, as well as Senators Biden, Specter, Hollings and Allen for their leadership and hard work on this critical matter.  Last year, Senator Kyl and I introduced the Anti-Terrorism and Port Security Act of 2003. That bill contained a set of comprehensive measures to enhance the security of our ports. At the same time, Senators Biden and Specter were working on legislation largely focused on the criminal law aspect of Port Security.  Since that time we have joined together to craft the bill now before us. The legislation is narrow in focus, limited primarily to criminal law provisions. It is my hope that it will enjoy strong bipartisan support.  I also hope we can continue to work towards a more comprehensive approach to seaport security in the coming months.  Our nation's seaports represent the soft underbelly of our Nation's homeland security. Our adversaries, including al-Qaida and other terrorist groups, have the plans and capabilities to launch a maritime attack. In fact, just last week six al-Qaida associates were charged with planning the 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole. in Yemen that left 19 American sailors dead.  Millions of shipping containers pass through our ports each month. A single container has room for as much as 60,000 pounds of explosives--10 to 15 times the amount in the Ryder truck used to blow up the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City. When you consider that a single ship can carry as many as 8,000 containers at one time, the vulnerability of our seaports is alarming.  Worse, a suitcase-sized nuclear device or radiological ``dirty bomb'' could also be placed in a container and shipped into the country. With the current monitoring system, the odds are that the container would never be inspected. And, even if the container was inspected, it would be too late.  In addition to the danger such attacks present to human lives, an attack on or through a seaport could have devastating economic consequences. Excluding trade with Mexico and Canada, America's ports handle 95 percent of goods imported and exported from the U.S. That means 800 million tons of cargo valued at approximately $600 billion. A terrorist attack would bring our port operationsto a complete standstill. To give you even a small glimpse of what such a disruption could mean, last year's West Coast labor dispute cost the U.S. economy somewhere between $1 and $2 billion per day--a total of $10 to $20 billion.  In its December 2002 report, the Hart-Rudman Terrorism Task Force described what a terrorist attack at or through one of our ports might mean in economic terms: ``If an explosive device were loaded in a container and set off in a port, it would almost automatically raise concern about the integrity of the 21,000 containers that arrive in U.S. ports each day and the many thousands more that arrive by truck and rail across U.S. land borders. A three-to-four-week closure of U.S. ports would bring the global container industry to its knees. Megaports such as Rotterdam and Singapore would have to close their gates to prevent boxes from piling up on their limited pier space. Trucks, trains, and barges would be stranded outside the terminals with no way to unload their boxes. Boxes bound for the United States would have to be unloaded from their outbound ships. Service contracts would need to be renegotiated. As the system became gridlocked, so would much of global commerce.''  This is a national issue, but one of particular concern to my home state because more than half of all goods imported into the U.S. pass through my home State of California.  Last year, 6.5 million imported containers--52 percent of the containers entering the United States--traveled through California. Six million of these came through two ports alone: the Port of Los Angeles and the Port of Long Beach.  That means that, if terrorists succeeded in putting a weapon of mass destruction into a container undetected, there is a one in two chance that this weapon would arrive and/or be detonated in Southern California.  And the problem is not just with containers. Nearly one-quarter of California's imported crude oil is offloaded in one area. A suicide attack on a tanker at an offloading facility could leave Southern California without refined fuels within a few days.  Since September 11, we have made significant steps in enhancing port security, but clearly, there is more to be done. This bill addresses some of those needed enhancements, particularly in the area of criminal law.  The Reducing Crime and Terrorism at America's Seaports Act of 2004 does the following: Clarifies existing law to make clear that those who would try to access our ports under false pretenses are committing a crime; makes it a crime to refuse to stop when the Coast Guard orders a ship to standby for inspection; sets clear criminal penalties for the use of a dangerous weapon or explosive on a passenger vessel such as a cruise ship; imposes criminal penalties for those who tamper with navigational aids, such as buoys and transponders, intentionally place destructive devices in navigable waters, or intentionally dump hazardous materials in waterways; establishes a specific crime for knowingly and willfully transporting aboard any vessel an explosive, biological agent, chemical weapon, or radioactive or nuclear materials intended to be used to commit a terrorist act; the bill also makes it a crime to knowingly and willfully transport a person aboard any vessel who intends to commit, or has committed, a terrorist act; makes it a crime to damage or destroy a vessel or a maritime facility, to commit an act of violence against any individual on a vessel or near a port facility, or to knowingly communicate false information that endangers the safety of a vessel; provides sanctions to deter criminal or civil violations related to a range of offenses, including theft of interstate or foreign shipments; amends existing law to increase penalties for noncompliance with certain reporting and recordkeeping requirements for incoming ships, including information regarding the content of cargo containers and the country from which the shipments originated; and finally, the bill toughens anti-stowaway laws and laws governing bribery of port security officials.  Strengthening criminal penalties is one way we can make our Nation's ports less vulnerable. The Coast Guard, the FBI, Customs and Immigration authorities--all need the appropriate crime-fighting tools to prevent a terrorist attack. Today, we are introducing legislation to provide the crime-fighting tools that will do just that.  I ask unanimous consent that an analysis of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the analysis was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:     SEC. 2. ENTRY BY FALSE PRETENSES TO ANY PORT.       Section 2 would clarify that section 1036 of title 18      (fraudulent access to transport facilities) includes seaports      and waterfronts within its scope, as well as increase the      maximum term of imprisonment for a violation from 5 years to      10 years. This provision was included in the originally      introduced Biden-Specter Bill, but not in the Feinstein-Kyl      Bill.     SEC. 3. CRIMINAL SANCTIONS FOR FAILURE TO ``HEAVE TO,''                    OBSTRUCTION OF BOARDING, OR PROVIDING FALSE                    INFORMATION.       Section 3 would amend the U.S. Code to make it a crime (1)      for a vessel operator knowingly to fail to slow or stop a      ship once ordered to do so by a federal law enforcement      officer; (2) for any person on board a vessel to impede      boarding or other law enforcement action authorized by      federal law; or (3) for any person on board a vessel to      provide false information to a federal law enforcement      officer (punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment for a      maximum term of 5 years). This provision was included in both      the Biden-Specter and Feinstein-Kyl Bills, but the Feinstein-     Kyl Bill included a lower penalty of 1-year maximum      imprisonment.     SEC. 4. USE OF A DANGEROUS WEAPON OR EXPLOSIVE ON A PASSENGER                    VESSEL.       Section 4 would amend section 1993 of title 18 (terrorist      attacks and other acts of violence against mass      transportation systems) to make it a crime to willfully use a      dangerous weapon (including chemical, biological,      radiological or nuclear materials) or explosive, with the      intent to cause death or serious bodily injury to any person      on board a passenger vessel (punishable by a fine and/or      imprisonment for a maximum term of 20 years; and, if death      results, for a term of imprisonment up to life). Both the      Biden-Specter and Feinstein-Kyl Bills, employing different      language, included a provision that would achieve this aim.      The substitute incorporates the Biden-Specter approach.     SEC. 5. CRIMINAL SANCTIONS FOR VIOLENCE AGAINST MARITIME                    NAVIGATION, PLACEMENT OF DESTRUCTIVE DEVICES,                    AND MALICIOUS DUMPING.       Section 5 would amend the criminal code to make it a crime      to intentionally damage or tamper with any maritime      navigational aid maintained by the Coast Guard or under its      authority, if such act endangers the safe navigation of a      ship; or knowingly place in waters any device or substance      which is likely to damage a vessel or its cargo, interfere      with a vessel's safe navigation, or interfere with maritime      commerce (punishable by a fine and/or a term of imprisonment      up to life; if death results, by a sentence of death). This      section would also make it a crime to willfully and      maliciously discharge a hazardous substance into U.S. waters,      with the intent to cause death, serious bodily harm, or      catastrophic economic injury (punishable by a fine and/or a      term of imprisonment up to life; and, where an individual      engages in the prohibited conduct with an intent to cause      harm to the marine environment, by a fine and/or imprisonment      for a maximum term of 30 years). Both the Biden-Specter and      Feinstein-Kyl Bills included this provision, but, unlike the      originally-introduced bills, the substitute measure excludes      the death penalty for violations of the malicious dumping      provision.     SEC. 6. TRANSPORTATION OF DANGEROUS MATERIALS AND TERRORISTS.       This section would make it a crime to knowingly and      willfully transport aboard any vessel an explosive,      biological agent, chemical weapon, or radioactive or nuclear      materials, knowing that the item is intended to be used to      commit a terrorist act (punishable by a fine and/or a term of      imprisonment up to life; and, if death results, by a sentence      of death). This section would also make it a crime to      knowingly and willfully transport aboard any vessel any      person who intends to commit, or is avoiding apprehension      after having committed, a terrorist act (punishable by a fine      and/or a term of imprisonment up to life). This provision was      included in the originally introduced Biden-Specter Bill, but      not in the Feinstein-Kyl Bill.     SEC. 7. DESTRUCTION OR INTERFERENCE WITH VESSELS OR MARITIME                    FACILITIES.       This section would make it a crime to (1) damage or destroy      a vessel or its parts, a maritime facility, or any apparatus      used to store, load or unload cargo and passengers; (2)      perform an act of violence against or incapacitate any      individual on a vessel or at or near a facility; or (3)      knowingly communicate false information that endangers the      safety of a vessel (punishable by a fine and/or imprisonment      for a maximum term of 20 years; if the act involves a vessel      carrying high-level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel,      by a fine and/or a term of imprisonment up to life; and, if      death results, by a sentence of death). This provision was      included in both the Biden-Specter and Feinstein-Kyl Bills.      The Biden-Specter Bill also included an exception     for otherwise lawful activities (e.g., normal repair, salvage      activities, authorized transportation of hazardous materials)      and a bar to federal prosecution if the conduct is de minimus      (e.g., blown-out tire) or occurred during legitimate labor      activity. The substitute measure incorporates these elements      of the Biden-Specter Bill.     SEC. 8. THEFT OF INTERSTATE OR FOREIGN SHIPMENTS OR VESSELS.       Section 8 would expand the scope of section 659 of title 18      (theft of interstate or foreign shipments) to include theft      of goods from additional transportation facilities or      instruments, including trailers, cargo containers, and      warehouses; and would increase the maximum term of      imprisonment for low-level thefts from 1 year to 3 years.      This provision was included in the originally introduced      Biden-Specter Bill, but not in the Feinstein-Kyl Bill.     SEC. 9. INCREASED PENALTIES FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WITH MANIFEST                    REQUIREMENTS.       Section 509 would amend section 1436 of title 19 to      increase the penalties for noncompliance with certain      manifest reporting and record-keeping requirements, including      information regarding the content of cargo containers and the      country from which the shipments originated. This provision      was included in both the Biden-Specter and Feinstein-Kyl      Bills, but the Biden-Specter Bill included lesser penalties.      The substitute measure reflects the penalty structure set out      in the Biden-Specter Bill.     SEC. 10. STOWAWAYS ON VESSELS OR AIRCRAFT.       This section would increase the maximum penalty for a      violation of section 2199 (stowaways on vessels or aircraft)      of title 18 from 1 year to 5 years. If the act is committed      with the intent to commit serious bodily injury and serious      bodily injury does in fact occur, it would be punishable by a      fine and/or a term of imprisonment up to 20 years. If the act      is committed with the intent to cause death, it would be      punishable by a fine and/or a term of imprisonment up to      life. This provision was not included in either the Biden-     Specter or Feinstein-Kyl Bills, but is included in the      substitute measure on Senator Hatch's request.     SEC. 11. BRIBERY AFFECTING PORT SECURITY.       This section would make it a crime to knowingly bribe a      public official, with the intent to commit international or      domestic terrorism; or for anyone to receive a bribe in      return for being influenced in his or her public duties,      knowing that such influence will be used to commit, or plan      to commit, an act of terrorism (punishable by a term of      imprisonment up to 15 years). This provision was not included      in either the Biden-Specter or Feinstein-Kyl Bills, but is      included in the substitute measure on Senator Hatch's      request.                                 ______                                       By
