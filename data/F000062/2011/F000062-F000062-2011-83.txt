 President. I rise to introduce legislation which would provide clarification to schools and school districts that wish to donate excess food to food banks and charitable organizations.  In 1996, Congress passed the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act to encourage the donation of food and grocery products to nonprofit organizations such as homeless shelters, soup kitchens and churches for distribution to needy individuals. The law limits the liability of donors to instances of gross negligence or intentional misconduct. However, because the law does not explicitly include schools as having limited liability, many schools and school districts have been hesitant to donate excess food.  This legislation would amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to clarify that schools and local education agencies participating in the school lunch program under the act are authorized to donate excess food to local food banks or charitable organizations. It would clarify that schools and local education agencies making donations would be exempt from civil and criminal liability to the extent provided under the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Act.  Schools interested in donating excess food would be encouraged and better informed with the passage of this legislation. The Secretary of Education would provide schools with guidance to assist schools with food donations.  Given the current economy and high unemployment rate, more and more individuals are becoming dependent on food banks and charities. This legislation would help to address the needs of those living in poverty by increasing support for food donations.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1719       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``School Food Recovery Act''.     SEC. 2. FOOD DONATION PROGRAM.       Section 9 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch      Act (42 U.S.C. 1758) is amended by adding at the end the      following:       ``(l) Food Donation Program.--       ``(1) In general.--Each school and local educational agency      participating in the school lunch program under this Act may      donate any food not consumed under such program to eligible      local food banks or charitable organizations.       ``(2) Guidance.--       ``(A) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date      of the enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall      develop and publish guidance to schools and local educational      agencies participating in the school lunch program under this      Act to assist such schools and local educational agencies in      donating food under this subsection.       ``(B) Updates.--The Secretary shall update such guidance as      necessary.       ``(3) Liability.--Any school or local educational agency      making donations pursuant to this subsection shall be exempt      from civil and criminal liability to the extent provided      under the Bill Emerson Good Samaritan Food Donation Act (42      U.S.C. 1791).       ``(4) Definition.--In this subsection, the term `eligible      local food banks or charitable organizations' means any food      bank or charitable organization which is exempt from tax      under section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986      (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)).''.                                 ______                                       By
