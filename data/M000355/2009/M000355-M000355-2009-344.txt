 President, I understand the majority leader was asking about clearing some military promotions earlier today. I wanted to indicate--and I see the assistant majority leader is here--we are clear with those and never had an issue with these particular promotions. Therefore, I suggest that we call them up and confirm them immediately.  Unless there is an objection from the other side, and having notified the other side, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following military promotions: Calendar Nos. 192, 193, and 194. I further ask unanimous consent that these nominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that the Senate then resume legislative session.
