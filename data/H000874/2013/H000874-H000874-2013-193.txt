The gentleman from New York who just spoke did not do so, but simply articulated three reasons he was opposed to this bill.  It seems to me that that is certainly within the contemplation of the unanimous-consent request. If we start parsing that people can only articulate one reason, I would suggest to our friends, the Parliamentarians, and to the Speaker, that that will establish a precedent which will be very difficultand subjective for implementation by the Speaker.  I ask the Speaker to perhaps further explain why Mr. Meeks' objection was charged to Mr. McGovern's time.
