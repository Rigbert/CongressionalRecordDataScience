 I expect it to be a continuing resolution as opposed to an omnibus, an omnibus, of course, being the cumulative bills put into a very large bill. I don't expect that to be the case. I expect it to be a CR, but I do expect to have additional items on that continuing resolution. The extent of that has not yet been determined. There's a lot of discussion, as I'm sure you're well awareof discussion on your side as well, about things that people would like to have on the bill.  In addition, there are discussions between the White House and the Appropriations Committee, Mr. Obey and Mr. Nussle, the OMB director. I have had discussions with the White House about items, some are called anomalies, that is, things that otherwise would have been done if we had done the regular bills, that the White House believes need to be done. There are a number of things that are being discussed of that kind.  In addition, we're going to have discussions about anything that we may need to do in the short term with reference to the extraordinary calamity that has confronted our economy. Whether anything addressing that will be in the CR or not is unclear at this point in time, but that's a possibility.  So I tell the gentleman, it will not be an omnibus in the sense that you and I understand an omnibus and the body understands an omnibus. For the most part, we will probably be looking at spending being at last year's levels for most of the items that we're talking about.
