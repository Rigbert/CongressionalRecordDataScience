Speaker, I want to thank my good friend and most able colleague, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), for arranging for this special order. I wanted to publicly acknowledge the incredibly important role he is playing in helping to build bridges to nations that were our former enemies. I think as history iswritten, as surely it will be, and we look back at the challenge to building the peace as opposed to only fighting either hot or cold wars, the role of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) will be absolutely essential and recognized, and I hope the American people as they listen to this special order today will understand that it is in America's interest to build functioning democracies in that part of the world; that we cannot afford to ignore the millions and millions of people that live there and still need to learn about the institutions of freedom, certainly in the management of their own instruments of governance. The gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon) has been the leader in establishing the Congressional Duma exchange in Russia.  For the last 8 years, sometimes I am sure it was a lonely task trying to make friendships with people who had just recently been some of our most harsh critics and bitter enemies, and yet the gentleman has pursued this year after year after year. To me, that is the test of true leadership, and I wanted to say that.  I hope the gentleman's constituents are listening to this. I hope the American people are listening because truly we have to figure out how to build a peace that will last, and it can only come through communication with the leaders of those countries and with the people institution of those countries.  In the brief time I have to say something tonight, I also wanted to acknowledge, in terms of Ukraine, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Schaffer), who is our partner in this effort, Republican and Democrat working together on behalf of the interests of freedom, in signing the agreement that we would like to submit to the Record this evening for the new Congressional Rada exchange for Ukraine.  It is modeled on the impressive work that the gentleman has done, along with the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), in Russia for these past several years. We have a lot of work to do in Ukraine and we arrived at a most delicate moment, and I will say a word about that in a second. But I wanted to say to my colleagues here this evening, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Crenshaw), what a great thrill it was for me to be able to travel with him, with his wife; the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Hoeffel); the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Kucinich), who was with us a little earlier this evening; and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer); and certainly the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts), who has a major responsibility on the Moldovan Parliamentary Exchange.  To be there particularly at this time and to experience the ambassadors' wisdom really, the ambassador of the United States to Russia, Mr. James Collins, the ambassador from the United States to Ukraine, Ambassador Carlos Pascual. Honestly, they are among the most able citizens that we could send into that most complex part of the world.                              {time}  1545  As an American, I was just very proud to be there and to be able to listen to them and to learn from them, and to have their help in meeting the people that we needed to in those countries.  At the urging of the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Weldon), several of us attempted to put the beginnings of an agreement on housing, helping Russia to begin, begin the first mortgage system. It will not be easy. It is a vast country with 13 time zones, no sense of free enterprise, no institutions in place, either financial or in terms of the substantive work that needs to be done to create a mortgage system based on collateral, including land. There is no system of collateralizing land to borrow against.  But America must help in this endeavor. We cannot be like ostriches with our heads in the ground. We have to use the instruments of freedom, all the institutions we have available to us, to try at this moment in history to make a difference.  I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for leading us down that path, recognizing that community development is an equal partner, along with a strong defense, in order to help nations remain at peace.  In terms of Ukraine, I just wanted to say that we arrived at a time when the President of the country obviously is under extreme duress. There are charges and countercharges, and the institutions of that country are not strong enough to conduct a full and thorough investigation of the actual criminal acts that were involved in the beheading of a very well known journalist in that country who had been a critic of many aspects of the current government.  I wish to submit to the Record also this evening the press statement that all of us created in Ukraine and released to the international press encouraging that there be a full investigation, and in fact, even engaging other partners from the West, from Europe, from the United States, in trying to get at the true facts in this case.  The press statement referred to is as follows:   U.S. Delegation Conducts Whirlwind Fact-Finding Visit of Russia,                           Moldova and Ukraine  delegation urges peaceful, democratic resolution to current crisis;      delegation establishes historic u.s. congress-verkhovena rada                          parliamentary exchange       A Congressional delegation of seven members of the U.S.      Congress led by the Honorable Curt Weldon (R-PA) is      completing a three-nation visit including Russia, Moldova,      and Ukraine. The purpose of this visit was to continue the      relationships established seven years ago between the United      States House of Representatives and the Russian Duma, and to      establish similar relationships with the parliaments of      Moldova and Ukraine. The other members of the delegation      include: Representative Steny Hoyer (D-MD), Representative      Marcy Kaptur (D-OH), Representative Bob Schaffer, (R-CO),      Representative Dennis Kucinich (D-OH), Representative Joe      Hoeffel, (D-PA), and Representative Ander Crenshaw, (R-FL).       The Congressional delegation participated in over 40      scheduled meetings in the three countries that included      meeting with the Presidents of Moldova and Ukraine, as well      as the leadership of the parliaments, senior civilian cabinet      level officials and military leaders in all three countries.      In Russia and Ukraine, the delegation met with prominent      media figures concerned with press freedoms in their      respective countries.       While meeting with President Leonid Kuchma and other      officials in Kyiv, the delegation expressed its serious      concerns with the Heorhiy Gongadze incident, and believes the      subsequent investigation must be pursued irrespective of      where it may lead. That pursuit must be compatible with the      following principals: The freedom of speech, press, and      assembly; the rule of law; and nonviolence.       The delegation believes that any settlement of the Gongadze      crisis not taking the above points into account would      adversely affect future Ukrainian/American relations.       The delegation also: Extends its sincere sympathy to the      families and associates of Mr. Gongadze; reiterates the offer      of technical support from the Federal Bureau of      Investigation; expresses its strong belief and insistence      that a credible and independent investigation is essential in      order to earn the confidence of Ukraine and the rest of the      world community; affirms the principle that those accused      must be considered innocent until proven guilty; and intends      to introduce a resolution in the House of Representatives to      express the sense of Congress that this incident should be      resolved peacefully.       During the over two hour meeting with President Kuchma, the      delegation was gratified to receive the commitment of the      President to follow the rule of law, maintain the freedom of      the press and assembly, and to use restraint in the use of      force.               U.S. Congress-Rada Parliamentary Exchange       We, the undersigned members of the United States House of      Representatives and members of the Parliament of Ukraine, do      hereby establish the U.S. Congress-Rada Parliamentary      Exchange (further referred to as CRPE), for the purpose of      facilitating expanded strategic relations between the United      States and Ukraine.       The purpose of CRPE is to foster closer relations between      our two legislatures to address key bilateral issues. It is      the goal of the CRPE Parliament to examine issues of mutual      understanding and continue a constructive dialogue toward      permanent peace and prosperity.       Having reviewed the work of the initial congressional      delegation to Ukraine in November 1999, which participated in      discussions of mutual interest in trade, economic well-being,      energy reformation, agriculture, and military relations, CRPE      will promote closer relationships between the lawmakers of      both countries.       Building upon the strategic partnership between the Untied      States and Ukraine first established in 1996, the CRPE shall      serve as a conduit in further developing and continuing      economic and political cooperation between the two countries.       Now, be it resolved by affirmation of the undersigned      Members of the House of Representatives, with the support of      the Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, and the Parliamentarians      of the Ukrainian Verkhovna     Rada there is hereby established, the U.S. Congress-Rada      Parliamentary Exchange. Be it further resolved, the Exchange      shall:       (1) Constitute a working group to help resolve any issues      hampering an expansion of economic and political cooperation      between the United States and Ukraine; and,       (2) Establish items of discussion by the CRPE which      encompass economic relations, trade, space exploration,      health-care, the environment, agriculture, natural sources,      and any other matter important to the promotion of close ties      between the United States and Ukraine; and,       (3) Convene bi-annually in the United States and Ukraine to      formally exchange viewpoints brought about by current events.      The CRPE will from time to time issue recommendations to be      pursued in each legislature.       The founders of the CRPE hereby acknowledge the leaders of      the Congress of the United States, in coordination with the      Congressional Ukrainian Caucus, and the Parliament of      Ukraine, for their dedication to establishing the Exchange.       Signed at Washington, D.C. November 18, 1999 by: Hon.      Dennis Hastert, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives,      Signed at Kyiv, on November 30, 1999 by: Hon. Oleksander      Tkachenko, Speaker of the Ukrainian Parliament.
