 President, I introduce legislation which will abolish the 12th seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit. This is the right thing to do. I have studied the D.C. circuit in depth for over a year now, and I can confidently conclude that the D.C. circuit does not need 12 judges.  Last year, I chaired a hearing before the Judiciary Subcommittee on administrative oversight and the courts. At the hearing, Judge Lawrence Silberman--who sits on that court--testified that 12 judges were just too many. According to Judge Silberman, when the D.C. circuit has 12 judges, there isn't enough work to go around. In fact, the main courtroom in the D.C. courthouse does not fit 12 judges. When there are 12 judges, special arrangements have to be made when the court sits in a en banc capacity.  Judge Silberman's testimony is supported by the steady decrease in new cases filed in the D.C. circuit. Since 1985, the number of new case filings in the D.C. circuit has declined precipitously. Even those who support filling the 12th seat admit this. And the D.C. circuit is only entitled to a maximum of 10 judges under the judicial conference's formula for determining how many judges should be allotted to each court.  So the case against filling the 12th seat is compelling. Now that Judge Buckley on the D.C. circuit has taken senior status, we, in Congress, have a unique opportunity. Let's abolish the 12th seat.  Abolishing the 12th seat is completely nonpartisan. If the 12th seat is abolished, no President--Democrat or Republican--could fill it. As long as the 12th seat is open, the temptation to nominate someone to fill the seat will be overwhelming--even with the outrageous cost to the American taxpayer.  According to the Federal judges themselves, the total cost to the American taxpayer for a single article 3 judge is about $18 million. That's not chump change. That's something to look at. That's real money we can save.  Here in Congress, we have downsized committees and eliminated entirely important support agencies like the Office of Technology Assessment. The same is true of the executive branch. Right now, Congress is considering the elimination of whole Cabinet posts. It is against this backdrop that, as chairman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the courts, I have been looking for ways to make sure that precious taxpayer dollars are spent wisely. Eliminating the 12th seat is an important step in the right direction.  While some may incorrectly question Congress' authority to look into these matters, this legislation is, in fact, on firm constitutional ground. Article 3 of the Constitution gives Congress broad authority over the lower Federal courts. Also, the Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse.  Throughout my career, I have taken this responsibility very seriously. I, too, am a taxpayer, and I want to make sure that taxpayer funds aren't wasted.  Some may say that Congress should let judges decide how many judgeships should exist and how they should be allocated. I agree that we should defer tothe Judicial Conference to some degree. However, there have been numerous occasions in the past where Congress has added judgeships without the approval of the Judicial Conference. In 1990, the last time we created judgeships, the Congress created judgeships in Delaware, the District of Columbia, and Washington State without the approval of the Judicial Conference. In 1984, when the 12th judgeship at issue in this hearing was created--Congress created 10 judgeships without the prior approval of the Judicial Conference. It is clear that if Congress can create judgeships without judicial approval, then Congress can leave existing judgeships vacant or abolish judgeships without judicial approval. It would be illogical for the Constitution to give Congress broad authority over the lower Federal courts and yet constrain Congress from acting unless the lower Federal courts first gave prior approval.  In conclusion, Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and pass it quickly. I hope that the President will support and sign this bill.                          ____________________
