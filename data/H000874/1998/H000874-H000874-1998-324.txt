Chairman, I rise today to state my disappointment that this legislation contains no legislative language authorizing Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality Program (CMAQ) funds to be utilized for the operation and construction of telecommuting centers.  In 1991 ISTEA broke new ground by allowing CMAQ funding to be used to study the benefits of telecommuting centers. These centers are presently funded by the General Services Administration and allow federal employees to use an alternative workplace in lieu of traveling to their main offices several times a month. This concept, which has been tested in Calvert, Charles, and St. Mary's counties, has been very successful.  I remember vividly speaking to a young woman about the impact of telecommuting about a year ago. She was the mother of two small children who lived about an hour and a half outside of Washington. Every morning she got up before 5 a.m. in order to get her children to daycare and still be at work by 8 a.m. On a good day, her morning commute was about 90 minutes. However, if there was an accident or bad weather it could take her two or more hours to get to work. After getting two sleepy children ready for the day and fighting traffic she told me that she often felt exhausted before she even started her job as a computer programmer.  Mr. Speaker, there is a telecommuting center located not far from her home in Lexington Park. A few times a month she works out of the telecommuting center instead of driving up to Washington. What is the impact? For starters there is one less car on the highway. One less car equals less congestion on the crowded Washington metropolitan corridor and a decrease in air pollution. She is also more productive at her job as a programmer because she is better rested and less stressed, she gets to spend more time with her children, and she saves money, gas, and wear and tear on her car with a shorter commute.  Mr. Speaker, telecommuting makes a real difference in the lives of constituents in my district. There is a need for additional centers in Maryland and the rest of the country and I hope that H.R. 2400 will be amended in Conference to allow CMAQ funds to be used for the design, construction, and operation of telecommuting centers.                          ____________________
