Mr. Speaker, it seems we keep hearing the word ``extreme'' and ``mean-spirited'' and that we are ``gutting'' the welfare program, but I just want to address that just for a minute.  Mr. Speaker, I am holding an editorial by one of the fine newspapers in Kentucky, the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer. In a Tuesday editorial they say, ``The Republicans have a sensible idea in moving decision-making authority closer to the frontlines,'' but then they make the mistake so many on the left do when describing our plan, just as the previous speaker, they suggest that it will fail because it spends less money than the current system. Wrong, wrong, wrong.  The Republican welfare reform will increase spending by one-third over the next 7 years from $83 billion to more than $111 billion. So, I say to my friends on the left, and to the Messenger-Inquirer for whom I have a great deal of respect: If you like moving power back home and want more welfare spending, you have got it. True, we may not be spending as much on welfare as you would like but $5 trillion over the last 30 years shows just throwing money at the problem is not the answer .
