President, 7 years ago I visited Tibet, a land of striking beauty whose people are among the most inspiring and interesting I have ever had the privilege to meet. Most of the photographs of Tibet, I had seen before my visit, were of the jagged Himalayan Mountains, Buddhist monks, and a sleepy, poor country of subsistence farmers and their herds of yaks. There is another Tibet, which many people may not be aware of.  It was with great sadness that I and my wife Marcelle saw first hand the effects of China's ruthless, systematic campaign to obliterate Tibetan culture and Tibetan life. We met some of the Tibetans who had suffered under Chinese occupation, and saw the empty palace of the His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who lives in exile in India and who I have had the honor of meeting several times. Since our visit, and despite international condemnation, China's campaign of cultural annihilation has steadily progressed.  A recent article in Newsweek magazine describes the genocide. Tibet is being overrun by the Chinese. According to the article, Lhasa, Tibet's capital, is now at least 50-percent non-Tibetan. Buddhist monasteries have been destroyed, the Tibetan language is suppressed, and Tibet's natural resources have been plundered.  There are 60,000 Chinese troops in Tibet, whose job is to instill fear and quell any dissent. Public gatherings are monitored with video cameras, and protesters are quickly arrested before they attract attention.  Mr. President, Tibet is perhaps the most vivid example of why the Chinese Government is widely regarded as among the world's most flagrant violators of human rights. A decade from now, if current trends continue, the only thing left of Tibetan culture may be a memory. Even today it may be too late to prevent that result, since it would take a major, international campaign to turn back the Chinese tide. I, for one, would welcome such a campaign, because I believe we have a responsibility to try to protect endangered peoples whose existence is threatened with cultural genocide.  I ask unanimous consent that the Newsweek article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the article was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                     [From Newsweek, Apr. 3, 1995]                       China Invades Tibet--Again                            (By Melinda Liu)       Chip * * * chip. That's the sound of Tibetan civilization      being hacked away. Below Lhasa's imposing Potala Palace, home      of the exiled Dalai Lama, Chinese stonemasons chisel granite      that will pave a vast new plaza with government monuments.      The ancient downtown, some of it dating from the seventh      century, has already suffered a terminal face-lift. The      1,000-room Potala is now surrounded by hair-dressing salons,      chain-smoking prostitutes and karaoke bars blaring Madonna      music. Streets that once housed traditional Tibetan tea shops      have given way to rows of greasy Chinese eateries run by      recent arrivals from China's interior. Just outside the      capital, young Tibetan boys scavenge at a new open dump piled      high with trash. ``The Chinese keep coming,'' complains one      Lhasa resident, ``especially those who can't find jobs      anywhere else.''       The Chinese are invading Tibet--again. Four decades after      the People's Liberation Army seized the kingdom and crushed      an uprising by the followers of the Dalai Lama, Beijing has      found a more effective method of conquest: money. In 1992 the      government lifted controls on Chinese migration to Tibet,      then made it worthwhile by offering jobs that paid two or      three times the rate of the same work in China's interior.      Last year alone Beijing invested some $270 million in 62      projects--including the plaza near the Potala and a solar-     powered radio and TV station that will broadcast Communist      Party propaganda in Tibetan. As a result of these      inducements, Lhasa's population is now at least 50 percent      non-Tibetan, according to Western analysts.       Locals might not mind so much if they thought they were      getting more of the economic benefits. Tibet--which means      ``Western treasure house'' in Mandarin--has long been      plundered for its gold, timber and other resources and      remains unremittingly poor. Many Tibetans still live a      nomadic hand-to-mouth existence. Working herds of shaggy yaks      in the summer and retreating to the capital in the winter to      seek alms until the winter snows subside, they earn less than      $100 per year. But now maroon-robed monks compete with      Chinese beggars for spare change. Lhasans also grumble that      most new entrepreneurial opportunities go to outsiders.      Government funds are ``inextricably linking Tibet's economy      with the rest of China,'' argues Prof. Melvyn Goldstein, a      Tibet scholar at Case Western Reserve University. ``This has      also resulted in non-Tibetans controlling a large segment of      the local economy at all levels, from street-corner bicycle      repairmen to electronic-goods-store owners and firms trading      with the rest of China.''       Gawking nomads: Newcomers have a significant advantage over      locals--connections in the Chinese interior. In landlocked      Tibet, the best consumer goods were smuggled in from Nepal      only a decade ago. Now Chinese Muslim (Hui) peddlers in the      vegetable market hawk chicken eggs trucked in from Gansu      province, bananas from coastal Guangdong and Lux soap made in      Shanghai. Chinese shopkeepers prefer to sell to other Chinese      and seem openly disdainful of Tibetans, sometimes grabbing a      broom to shoo out gawking nomads who spend too much time      fiddling with the merchandise.       The tension inevitably erupts. Recently a local sat down in      a Hui restaurant to a meal--and pulled from his plate of      dumplings what Xinhua news agency called ``a long      fingernail.'' The disgusted diner shouted to his friends,      ``They're serving human flesh!'' After the enraged      restaurateur attacked       [[Page S6459]] them with a metal bar, some Khampas from      eastern Tibet joined the brawl. The fighting spilled into the      street for a while, and resumed the next day. When it was      over, several Hui shops had been vandalized; a dozen Tibetans      were arrested. The provocations continue. On Lhasa's streets,      Chinese vendors sometimes prepare dog meat in plain view of      passersby--an outrageous affront to Tibetans, who believe      that dogs are reincarnated as people. ``The potential for      overreaction,'' says a Western diplomat in Beijing, ``is      great.''       Government officials dismiss the idea that China is      obliterating Tibetan culture. ``That's sheer fabrication,''      snaps Raidi, deputy Communist Party secretary of Tibet, who      is Tibetan. He claims that Chinese people constitute less      than 3 percent of Tibet's population of 2.2 million--     neglecting to mention the 60,000 PLA troops and 50,000 or      more migrants in the region. The official press blames      Tibet's troubles on a ``psychology of idleness.'' There are      now more monks and nuns than high-school students, the Tibet      Daily, a Communist Party mouthpiece, recently pointed out.      ``Such a huge number of young, strong people are not engaged      in production. * * * The negative influence on economic and      ethnic cultural development is self-evident.''       But Beijing continues to undermine Tibet's self-     sufficiency. Designated as an ``autonomous region,'' Tibet is      anything but. Its religious life, as well as its economic and      political fate, depends entirely on Beijing. Chinese      authorities recently dropped a commitment to mandate the use      of the Tibetan language in government offices. ``Tibetans can      speak Tibetan at home and at work,'' says a Lhasa      intellectual who has a government job. ``But in order to get      ahead, you must speak Chinese.''       The influx of Chinese people has a political purpose, too--     to muffle calls for independence. Many Lhasa residents blame      Hui shopkeepers for harboring police during separatist      demonstrations back in 1989, and for supporting the brutal      crackdown that followed. Today, closed-circuit video cameras      monitor activities at major intersections in the Tibetan      quarter, around the markets near the fabled Jokhang temple,      even in the altar rooms of the Potala Palace. Police pounce      on protesters before they can attract crowds. The      intimidation seems to be working. ``The Chinese are more      clever than we Tibetans,'' says an educated Lhasan. ``So they      get all the good jobs. They work very hard, even moving      mountains when they want to.'' Beijing's most potent weapon      is to make Tibetan culture seem worthless--even in a Lhasan's      eyes.                               ____________________
