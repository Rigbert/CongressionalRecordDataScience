There will be a managers' amendment offered tomorrow, and it will be considerably smaller than this. It will have specifics in it that have been reviewed by the Congressional Budget Office. That is underway. It will be introduced, I hope, tomorrow morning, and it will be up for consideration for a procedural vote early Monday morning, and then the remainder of the week, as long as the Republicans want us to stay.  It is your decision whether we will be here for Christmas, and we are prepared to stay, if necessary, to get it done, if that is what it takes.  But it is true there is a managers' amendment coming. It is also true the Congressional Budget Office--maybe one of the most powerful agencies of the Federal Government--can literally stop the Congress in its tracks while the people who work there pour through these bills and try to make some estimate as to whether they are going to add to the deficit; whether they will, in fact, reduce health care costs.
