Marcella Stefanac Anderson on a momentous milestone, her 85th birthday, which took place on March 4, 2007. Marcella will be celebrating this milestone with family and friends on Saturday, March 10, 2007. Throughout the years, Marcella's presence in northwest Indiana has allowed her the opportunity to touch the lives of countless people.  Marcella Stefanac was born on March 4, 1912, in Powhatan Point, Ohio. She was an only child, born to Ivan and Albina Stefanac. An accomplished student, Marcella completed her bachelor of science degree at Washington University in Saint Louis, Missouri, and her master of science and doctorate degrees in education from Temple University in Pennsylvania. From there, she decided to go into the teaching profession. As a professor at Valparaiso University in Indiana for 22 years, Marcella was able to enhance the lives of many young people throughout the community. For her dedication to the students of Northwest Indiana, she is worthy of the highest admiration.  Equally as impressive, Marcella has always been seen as the foundation of her family. She and her husband, Jim Anderson, live in Hobart with their cat, Mickey. Jim and Marcella have one son, Bryn, who currently resides in Orange County, California. Marcella's family, as well as those whose lives she has touched, respect her for devoting unselfish love, time, commitment, guidance, and spirit to her family, her students, and her friends.  In addition to being greatly loved and admired by her family, her students, and her community, Marcella is also well known for her affiliations to several organizations, including the Alfred Adler Institute, where she provides private counseling services for those in need. From the ages of 66 to 83, Marcella also taught aerobics to senior citizens at the Pruzin Senior Center in Merrillville, Indiana. Marcella has always been known as a generous woman who is willing to help the people in her community. For her selflessness, she is to be commended.  Madam Speaker, Marcella Stefanac Anderson has always given her time and efforts selflessly to the community of northwest Indiana throughout her illustrious life. She has taught every member of her family and extended family the true meaning of service to others. I respectfully ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join me in wishing Marcella a very happy 85th birthday.                          ____________________
