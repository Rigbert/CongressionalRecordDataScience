Dale Engquist. Having known Dale for many years, I can truly say that he is one of the most committed, knowledgeable, and honorable citizens in Northwest Indiana. Nowhere has his knowledge and commitment been more evident than in his faithful service to the National Park Service (NPS), and more specifically, to the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore. Dale has served the Northwest Indiana community for the past 28 years, and his service to the NPS has spanned an astonishing 42 years. For many years, Dale has been a constant fixture at the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore, and for his efforts, he will be honored at a retirement party on Tuesday, January 9, 2007, at the Lubeznik Center for the Arts in Michigan City, Indiana.  Following a summer position at Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota, Dale Engquist began his professional career with the NPS in 1964 at the National Capital Parks in Washington, DC. From there, Dale went on to serve as Chief Park Naturalist at Hot Springs National Park in Arkansas and then Assistant Chief Park Naturalist at Everglades National Park in Florida. Following his departure from Everglades National Park in 1971, Dale accepted his first Superintendent position at the Biscayne National Monument in Florida. After moving on to other managerial positions in New Jersey and Washington, DC, Dale settled in Northwest Indiana in 1978, where he served as Assistant Superintendent of the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore until January 1983. At that time, Dale was named to the distinguished position of Superintendent of the National Lakeshore, a position he has held for the past 24 years. Over the years, Dale has maintained this post, and he has done so with a selfless commitment to nature and to the community. Dale's education, knowledge, and experience with the NPS have made him successful and respected in all of the positions he has held.  Indisputably, Dale Engquist has been extremely successful throughout his career with the NPS. To attest to this fact, Dale has been the recipient of numerous accolades and awards for merit and dedication. In 1987, he was awarded the Park Planning and Design Award for excellence in park design, as well as the Richard G. Lugar Award for recognition as an outstanding federal employee in the state of Indiana. In addition, Dale has also been honored with the 1991 Superintendent of the Year & Resource Stewardship Award, the National Park Service's 75th Anniversary Director's Award, the Sagamore of the Wabash, the Meritorious Service Award by then-Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt, the Polish Cavalry Cross of Merit, and the Chicago Wilderness Excellence in Conservation Award.  Though it may be difficult to imagine where he finds the time, Dale has always been involved in several associations and organizations, including: the Association of National Park Rangers, the Eastern National Parks & Monument Association, the National Park & Recreation Association, the Indiana Park & Recreation Association, the Indiana Historical Society, the National Audubon Society, and Rotary International.  Madam Speaker, Dale Engquist has devoted himself to improving and preserving the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and serving the people of Northwest Indiana throughout his many years of service. At this time, I ask that you and all of my distinguished colleagues join me in commending him for his lifetime of service and dedication.                          ____________________
