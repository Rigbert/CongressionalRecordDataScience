S. agriculture support the CAFTA. I realize one--sugar--is a commodity we did not have their support. I respect the sugar industry. They are very important. Outside of that group, we have agriculture represented behind this group.  An economic study by the American Farm Bureau Federation confirms that CAFTA will not harm the U.S. sugar program or other agricultural commodities.  While CAFTA is important in itself for U.S. agriculture, the implementation of this agreement would boost U.S. efforts to liberalize agricultural trade around the world. The implementation of CAFTA would give further momentum toward the completion of agricultural negotiations in the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization, negotiations in which the United States is seeking to cut tariffs, harmonize levels of domestic support, and eliminate export subsidies.  Mr. President, CAFTA is a straightforward win for the bulk of U.S. agricultural producers. A current one-way trading relationship will end. The CAFTA countries will dismantle their tariffs to U.S. agricultural products while the United States will provide little additional access for CAFTA commodities. This will result in increased sales for U.S. agricultural exporters, sales of up to $1.5 billion a year by the end of the agreement's full implementation. Not surprisingly, CAFTA is widely supported in the U.S. agricultural community.  The CAFTA is good agricultural policy and good trade policy. I urge my colleagues to support it.  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator whatever time he needs.
