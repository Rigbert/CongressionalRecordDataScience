Speaker, what I hear is that the majority leader's plan is that we give up. Ninety-nine percent of the Homeland Security bill, I presume and believe, is directed at securing our borders. We have agreed with 99 percent of it, probably 99.9 percent of it. That is probably not true in dollar value.  But the plan is for us to give up because 99 percent is not good enough for us to agree with. It has got to be 100 percent. If that is the plan, it is not going to work.  The bill has not been brought to this floor, ever, this year. It is worthy of debate as to how we keep our borders most secure. As I have said, many Republicans, including, very frankly, the second ranking member of the Senate on the Republican side, have questions about the wall. He is from Texas. A lot of Texans think the wall doesn't make sense, Republicans and Democrats. Maybe not all, but some. But if the plan is we just give up after agreeing to 99 percent, that is no plan at all.  Unless the gentleman wants to say more, I am going to yield back.  Mr. McCARTHY. Will the gentleman yield?
