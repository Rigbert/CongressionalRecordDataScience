m. on Friday, the Senate will immediately resume debate on the bankruptcy reform legislation. As under the agreement, first-degree amendments to the bill must be relevant and filed by 5 p.m. tomorrow. Senators who have amendments are encouraged to work with the bill managers on a time to come to the floor to offer and debate those amendments. The leader has announced that votes could occur tomorrow on amendments or any appropriations bills that become available.  The leader also announces that votes will occur on Monday at 5:30 p.m. and on Tuesday morning at 10:30. The votes on Tuesday will be on the minimum wage issue and the business cost amendment.  As a reminder, the Senate passed the continuing resolution to continue Government funding until November 10. It is hoped that all Senators will give their full cooperation as the final days of the first session of the 106th Congress come to a close.                          ____________________
