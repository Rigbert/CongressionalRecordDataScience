Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his answer.  Next Friday is the beginning of the new fiscal year, as the majority leader knows; and we only passed, as he knows, one fiscal year 2005 appropriation which has been signed by the President, and that, of course, is the Defense bill. Assuming we will have a CR, can the leader give us an idea for what time period that CR may be?  I further yield to the gentleman.  Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman yielding to me.  There are ongoing discussions. There will be more discussions about that. Our tentative plan is to move a short-term continuing resolution that would fund government programs through October 8. This would give us an additional week to complete appropriations conference reports before we make decisions about how to best complete all the fiscal 2005 bills.  Appropriations, both in the House and the Senate, are having many discussions. Generally, both Democrats and Republicans are wishing to get the appropriations process done before we leave for the elections. How we do that is speculative; and, frankly, the date of the CR is speculative. It could be October 8. It could be October 15. It could be November 20. All of this is tied together with the understanding that we are trying to get the appropriations bills all finalized and done before we leave here for the elections.
