President, I am pleased that the Judiciary Committeehas reported another group of executive branch nominees and that the Senate will be acting on the President's nominations to head the Civil Rights Division and the Tax Division of the Department of Justice so promptly.  Just as the committee proceeded promptly with the consideration of the President's nomination of John Ashcroft to be Attorney General, when I temporarily chaired the committee in January, we are continuing to move promptly on other nominations this month. In January, the Senate did not receive the nomination of John Ashcroft until January 19 and reported it to the Senate the very next day. In deference to the President, the committee had moved ahead with hearings on the nomination the week of January 16 in advance of receiving the nomination by the President.  The Senate has confirmed the President's nominations of the Attorney General, the Deputy Attorney General and a controversial nomination to serve as Solicitor General. The President has yet to nominate anyone to be Associate Attorney General, the third highest ranking position at the Department of Justice. We have confirmed nominees to serve as Deputy Attorneys General to head the Criminal Division, the Antitrust Division, the Office of Legislative Affairs, and the Office of Legal Policy.  In late May, Chairman Hatch conducted a hearing on the nomination of Ralph F. Boyd, Jr., to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division. I had included Mr. Boyd's nomination on the agenda for a business meeting of the Judiciary Committee last week, our first week in session after the adoption of a Senate organizing resolution and the assignment of committee membership. But less than half of the Republican members of the committee showed up for the business meeting on July 12. We were unable to reach a quorum last week to report out the President's nominations to the Justice Department. Yesterday, at our next business meeting of the Judiciary Committee, we reported that nomination to the Senate.  It took the Senate the entire month of June to pass S. Res. 120, a simple resolution reorganizing the committees. It was only last Tuesday that assignments to committees were completed. Last Wednesday, the first day after the committee membership was set, we proceeded to hold a confirmation hearing including additional an executive branch nominee, Eileen O'Connor to be Assistant Attorney General for the Tax Division of the Department of Justice. Today the Senate has that nomination before it because we were able to expedite its consideration by the committee at our business meeting yesterday. I expect the Senate will confirm Ms. O'Connor, another of the President's nominations to a key post at the Department of Justice. I am glad to be able to accommodate the request of the Attorney General to expedite her consideration.  This week the Judiciary Committee proceeded with back-to-back days of hearing on the important nominations of Asa Hutchinson to head the Drug Enforcement Administration and James Ziglar to head the Immigration and Naturalization Service. I have noticed another hearing for next Tuesday for judicial and executive branch nominees, including the President's nominees to be Assistant Attorney General to head the Office of Justice Programs and to be the Director of the National Institute of Justice.  The Senate received the President's nomination of a new FBI Director on Wednesday of this week and I proceeded that same day to notice hearings on that important nomination to begin a week from Monday. It is my hope that with the cooperation of all Members and the administration we should be able to make progress and work toward Senate consideration of the nomination of Robert Mueller to be Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation before the August recess, if possible. I have asked for the cooperation of all members of the committee, on both sides of the aisle. I noticed the hearings on Robert Mueller's nomination to begin on July 30. We will see if it is possible for the committee act on that nomination before the August recess, which would be my preference.  I regret that Senators and their staffs will have not have more time to prepare for so important a hearing as that on the nominee to be the next Director of the FBI. It is my hope that the series of oversight hearings regarding the FBI in which we have been engaged, including our hearing this week, have helped and that Senators will be able to adhere to an expedited schedule for the hearing, a very brief turnaround time for written follow up questions and immediate Committee consideration.  We have set an ambitious schedule of five confirmation hearings this month on the President's nominees. We have completed three of those confirmation hearings and have another scheduled for each of the next two weeks. We have also reported a number of nominees, including the three Judicial Branch and two Executive Branch nominees before the Senate for consideration today.  The nomination of Ralph Boyd, Jr., to head the Civil Rights Division was reported unanimously and without objection by the Judiciary Committee. Senator Kennedy, in particular, has been a strong and consistent advocate for this nomination and I thank him for his efforts. This will be one of the least contentious paths for a nominee to head the Civil Rights Division in some time. Indeed, the Judiciary Committee refused for the last three years of the Clinton administration even to report to the Senate President Clinton's nomination to head the Civil Rights Division. The handling of this nomination and the treatment of the nominee by Members not from the President's party stand in sharp contrast to the treatment of Bill Lann Lee.  I join with Senator Kennedy in urging the Senate to act favorably on the nomination of Ralph Boyd, Jr.                          ____________________
