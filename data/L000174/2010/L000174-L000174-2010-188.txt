President, our Nation recently celebrated Memorial Day, honoring the sacrifice and the service of our brave men and women in uniform. Yesterday was Flag Day, and before too long we will celebrate the Fourth of July.  I wish to speak about Solicitor General Elena Kagan's nomination to the Supreme Court. I thought it might be good to set the record straight about some of the charges being leveled at President Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General Elena Kagan. Those intent on opposing this nomination--just as they seem to undercut the President no matter what he does--have searched high and low to find a basis to oppose this intelligent and accomplished nominee.  I understand the partisanship, but I disagree with it. A Supreme Court nominee is there for all the country, not for one political party or the other, and most nominees will serve long after the Senators who voted for the nominee are gone.  I do not think it is good for the country to make it this partisan. After the American people elected President Obama, leaders of the Republicans urged massive resistance from the outset. They have talked about wanting him to fail and have done everything they could to undermine his efforts to rescue our economy from the worst downturn since the Great Depression, to reform health care for all Americans, to lower taxes for Americans making less than $250,000 a year and to reform Wall Street so that we never again suffer the kind of greed and profiteering that put our economy at risk.  When the Senator from Alabama became the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee last year, he lamented the way nominees were treated. He said:       What I found was that charges come flying in from right and      left that are unsupported and false. It's very, very      difficult for a nominee to push back. So I think we have a      high responsibility to base any criticisms that we have on a      fair and honest statement of the facts and that nominees      should not be subjected to distortions of their record.  I agree with that statement and very much regret the distortion of Dean Elena Kagan's record as dean of the Harvard Law School. No one should have attacked her unfairly for following the law while seeking to honor Harvard's nondiscrimination policy. No one should be misrepresenting her views and smearing her character or questioning her commitment to our men and women in uniform. Yet that is what has been happening repeatedly since her nomination.  In fact, some of these same smears were considered last year in connection with her nomination to be Solicitor General. She received a bipartisan vote of approval then. I was hoping that would put it to rest. Instead, some continue to accuse her of an anti-military bias and violating the law. They say that she ``barred the U.S. military from coming on the Harvard Law School campus,'' that she ``kicked the military off Harvard's campus,'' that she ``disregard[ed] the law . . . in order to obstruct military recruitment during a time of war,'' that she was punishing and taking actions against our military men and women, that she condemned the U.S. military, that she acted in a way that was ``not lawful,'' and that she ``violated the law.'' That is incorrect. I would have thought, and certainly had hoped, that since the facts are known, these misstatements would not be repeated. Regrettably, this has not been the case.  The unfair attacks that have been leveled at this nominee are all the more reason for her to have a chance to respond. Anyone who has a sense of fairness would not be raising questions and contending they still have concerns while at the same time seeking to delay her an opportunity to respond. Those who have been all too willing to attack this nominee during the last four weeks, and who purport to know her thoughts and her heart, should not be seeking to delay her opportunity to set the record straight and defend her character and good name. Those who unfairly characterize her as anti-military and, in effect, anti-American and unpatriotic, owe her the opportunity to respond. And she will this month when we have our hearings.  Let's be clear on the facts. Dean Kagan did not ban the military from Harvard's campus. Harvard's students always had access to military recruiters. The facts are that military recruitment remained steady throughout Dean Kagan's tenure, it even increased during the brief time that the military was restricted from using Harvard's Office of Career Services, OCS. Unfortunately, these facts will not prevent some critics from claiming that she kicked military recruiters off campus when she did no such thing. This is not debatable.  What is debatable is the wisdom of the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy. In my opinion, the ``Don't Ask Don't Tell'' policy forces good and capable people to choose between compromising their integrity and being barred from military service. At a time when we need a strong and skilled military more than ever, our existing policymakes the Armed Forces less effective. As Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently said, ``allowing gays and lesbians to serve openly would be the right thing to do.'' I agree. The current policy needlessly robs our Armed Services of the talents and commitment of countless people, and it should be changed. Every member of our military should be judged solely on his or her contribution to the mission, without regard to sexual orientation. Rejecting the discrimination that results from the ``Don't Ask Don't Tell'' policy is long overdue.  Does this statement here on the floor of the Senate make me anti-military? Of course not. Does Admiral Mullen's position on the policy make him anti-military? Of course not. He is a distinguished four-star admiral. Did Dean Kagan's comments on the policy render her anti-military? Not on your life. Anyone at all familiar with her record knows better. Veterans from Harvard Law School have come to her defense. They know and recall her support of them and their service to the country. They know of the dinners and meetings she held with veterans.  I am confident that a fair reading of her record will show she was supportive of our military, our veterans, and Harvard law students who wished to serve in the military. So let's stop the misstatements and the overheated rhetoric. Let's show her the respect she deserves.  In her speech at West Point 3 years ago, Dean Kagan spoke of being in awe of the courage and the dedication of those who were preparing for the military. She went on to speak directly to the issue, saying:       I have been grieved in recent years to find your world and      mine, the U.S. military and U.S. law schools at odds, indeed,      facing each other in court on one issue. That issue is the      military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. Law schools,      including mine, believe that employment opportunities should      extend to all their students, regardless of their race or sex      or sexual orientation. And I personally believe that the      exclusion of gays and lesbians from the military is both      unjust and unwise. I wish devoutly that these Americans could      join this noblest of all professions and serve their country      in this most important of all ways. But I would regret very      much if anyone thought that the disagreement between American      law schools and the U.S. military extended beyond this single      issue. It does not. And I would regret still more if that      disagreement created any broader chasm between law schools      and the military. It must not because of what we, like all      Americans, owe to you.  Hers were not the words of someone who is anti-military. There should be no place in America for discrimination. We ask our troops to protect freedom in places around the globe. It is time to protect the basic freedoms and equal rights at home.  I commend the House of Representatives for passing legislation just last month to end this discriminatory policy, and the Senate Armed Services Committee for doing so, as well. Congress is moving forward to adopt the policy of nondiscrimination that Harvard Law School had adopted and that Dean Kagan supported. I have long supported similar legislation in the Senate. I believe this is an important issue worthy of an up-or-down vote by the Senate. Regrettably, like so many steps forward in legislation to protect equality throughout our history, the repeal of this discriminatory policy will likely be filibustered by a recalcitrant minority.  I also find it ironic that those Republican Senators most critical of the nominee have filibustered and voted against funding for our troops and against services for our veterans. When the American people hear a Republican Senator criticizing Elena Kagan's respect and support for the military, they might ask whether that Senator filibustered the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2010. Led by the Republican leadership, more than 30 Republican Senators did. Even after their filibuster was defeated, most Republican Senators proceeded to vote against the bill and the authorities it provided our military. Likewise, when the Senate considered the consolidated appropriations bill to provide funding for veterans and military construction, again led by the Senate Republican leadership, more than 30 Republican Senators sought to filibuster and stall that funding. Even when their filibuster was broken, more than 30 Republican Senators voted against that bill to provide the necessary funding for services to our veterans.  Also obscured by the blinders worn by her critics are the following facts: Harvard Law School adopted its nondiscrimination policy in 1979, long before Elena Kagan ever attended Harvard Law School as a student let alone before she became an acting professor and ultimately its Dean. Like almost every other law school in America, Harvard requires employers to sign a statement that they do not discriminate. Only after an employer confirms its nondiscrimination employment policy and hiring practice can the employer use the logistical assistance of the Harvard Law School's Office of Career Services. This office merely facilitates recruitment by scheduling interviews and distributing student resumes to employers. It does not provide physical space on campus for employers to conduct interviews. In fact, private law firms typically conduct interviews off campus.  In 1994, Congress adopted the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. This law prohibited gays and lesbians from serving openly in our military. Two years later, in 1996, Congress passed the so-called ``Solomon Amendment'' as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. This statute allows Federal funds to be denied to universities that have ``a policy or practice'' that ``prohibits, or in effect prevents'' the military's access to students on campuses for purposes of military recruiting. In order to deny Federal funds under the Solomon amendment, the Secretary of Defense must determine that a university has such a policy or practice, ``transmit a notice [of such determination] . . . to Congress'' and ``publish in the Federal Register a notice of the determination and the effect of the determination on the eligibility of the [university] for contracts and grants.''  The Solomon amendment did not directly prohibit a law school from applying its nondiscrimination policy to military recruiters. It did not make such an action a crime. The Solomon amendment gave institutions a choice between satisfying the Secretary of Defense's requirements on military recruitment or risk foregoing certain Federal funds. Senator Sessions acknowledged this very point when he said last year, ``well, let me say, that amendment didn't order any university to admit anybody or to allow anybody to come on campus.'' In fact, it is not a criminal statute but an attempt to use the threat of a Federal funding cutoff as leverage.  In 1998, the Air Force determined that Harvard's alternative arrangement for military recruitment facilitated by the HLS Veterans association, in lieu of OCS, complied with the Solomon amendment. In 2002, under the Bush administration, the Air Force reversed course and enter into a new and contradictory determination that the arrangement no longer satisfied the Solomon amendment. It threatened Dean Robert Clark, a Republican and Dean Kagan's predecessor, with a cutoff of millions of dollars. In response, Dean Clark ``regrettably'' allowed military recruiters to use OCS while continuing to emphasize his strong opposition to ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.''  In 2003, Solicitor General Kagan became the first woman to serve as dean of the Harvard Law School when she succeeded Dean Clark. For the first few years in this position she maintained the law school's nondiscrimination policy that all employers, with the sole exception of the military, had to follow to use the Office of Career Services. She continued to allow the military access to OCS, despite the fact that it could not sign a nondiscrimination statement. However, she also repeatedly voiced her opposition to the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy, as Dean Clark had, calling it ``a moral injustice of the first order.''  Also in 2003, the Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., FAIR, an association of law schools, began a lawsuit challenging the Solomon amendment and seeking a preliminary injunction enjoining its enforcement. On November 5, 2003, the district court denied the injunction and FAIR appealed to the court of appeals for the Third Circuit. On January 12, 2004, in her capacity as a law professor, Dean Kagan joined more than 50 other Harvard law professors to support an amicus brief backing FAIR's appeal to theThird Circuit. Unlike FAIR, which argued that the Solomon amendment violated the first amendment, the brief she joined made the more modest argument that the Department of Defense had misinterpreted the law. The amicus brief argued: (1) that the Solomon amendment did not apply to generally applicable nondiscrimination policies, like Harvard's, that did not specifically target the military; and (2) it only required that schools give military recruiters ``entry'' and ``access,'' not necessarily equal access.  Noting the confusion surrounding the legal requirements of eligibility for Federal funding under the Solomon amendment, Congress amended the statute in October, 2004. The effect of those changes was not settled until the Supreme Court decided the case in 2006.  On November 29, 2004, the Third Circuit concluded, 2-1, in an opinion joined by Reagan appointee Judge Walter Stapleton, that the ``Solomon Amendment violates the First Amendment by impeding the law schools' rights of expressive association and by compelling them to assist in the expressive act of recruiting.'' The Third Circuit's opinion did not address the Harvard law professors' amicus brief.  From the beginning of her tenure until November 30, 2004, Dean Kagan had allowed the military to use OCS. Only after the Third Circuit concluded that the Solomon amendment was unconstitutional did Dean Kagan return to Harvard's prior policy of excluding the military from OCS. However, like her predecessors, Dean Kagan continued to allow military recruiters entry to the campus and facilitated interviews on campus through the HLS Veterans Association. This special arrangement was in place only for a few months in 2005.  In May 2005, the Supreme Court agreed to review the Third Circuit's decision. During that summer, while the government appeal was pending, the Pentagon informed Harvard University that its Federal funds were in jeopardy if it continued to restrict military recruiters from OCS services. The Pentagon never notified Congress nor published in the Federal Register that Harvard was not compliant with the Solomon amendment.  On September 20, 2005, Dean Kagan reinstated the military's exception from Harvard's nondiscrimination policy and again granted it access to OCS. Dean Kagan's decision to lift the military's restriction from OCS was long before the Supreme Court held oral argument on December 6, 2005, or decided the case.  The day after reinstating the military's use of OCS, Dean Kagan was one of 40 Harvard law professors to sign onto an amicus brief to the Supreme Court. As they did before the Third Circuit, the Harvard law professors argued that the Pentagon had misinterpreted the Solomon amendment and that properly read, the amendment ``rules out policies that target military recruiters for disfavored treatment, but it does not touch evenhanded anti-discrimination rules that incidentally affect the military.'' The Supreme Court rejected their argument. On March 6, 2006, the Supreme Court also reversed the Third Circuit and upheld the constitutionality of the Solomon amendment.  Let's be clear. She did not break the law. She did not violate the law. She did her best to follow the law, even a law that led to discriminatory consequences with which she strongly disagreed. She engaged in legal action and participated in a legal challenge to the interpretation and application of the law by the Bush administration and reversed an earlier interpretation by the Air Force. Yet this legal action is what some now claim amounted to illegal conduct. That is incorrect.  Recently there was an op-ed in the Washington Post by Walter Dellinger dated May 14, 2010, that discusses this issue. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Washington Post, May 14, 2010]                  How I Know Kagan Isn't Anti-Military                         (By Walter Dellinger)       The nomination of an anti-military leftist to the Supreme      Court would make for a riveting story. But in the case of      Elena Kagan, it's just not true.       When Kagan became dean of Harvard Law School in 2003,      Harvard, like virtually every other law school, had a long-     standing policy that the assistance of its placement office      was available only to employers that would interview and      consider hiring any student. Employers that insisted on      ``pre-screening'' students for high grades or other criteria      were not eligible for the school's placement assistance, nor      were recruiters who declined to hire students on the basis of      race, sex, religion or sexual orientation. The placement      office, in other words, is there to serve the career      aspirations of all students.       Under Kagan's predecessor at Harvard, the highly respected      corporate scholar Robert C. Clark, military recruiters      acknowledged that they were not able to comply with the      school's generally applicable anti-discrimination policy and      could not use the placement office's services. In 2002, the      Bush administration asserted that a federal provision called      the Solomon Amendment required the law school to grant      military recruiters an exemption from its anti-discrimination      policy. Faced with a threatened cutoff of federal funds to      the whole university, Clark announced that the placement      office would begin assisting military recruiters. When Kagan      became dean in 2003, she continued this practice.       In November 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd      Circuit held that the Solomon Amendment was unconstitutional,      which meant there was no longer an enforceable, federally      mandated exception to the law school's anti-discrimination      policy. Kagan announced that military recruiters were once      again ineligible for assistance from the school's placement      office. In the fall of 2004, after the Justice Department      challenged the 3rd Circuit decision and the Supreme Court      agreed to review the lower court's ruling, Kagan announced      that the school would once again comply with the government's      demand for placement-office support for military recruiters.       On the basis of this unremarkable application of an      established anti-discrimination policy, Kagan has been      accused of harboring an ``anti-military'' animus. Some      critics have falsely equated Harvard's anti-discrimination      policy with the anti-military and anti-ROTC policies favored      by some campus leftists in the 1970s. Those policies,      however, were categorically different: They were directed at      the military. In contrast, the anti-discrimination policies      applied before, during and after Kagan's tenure as dean were      in no way intended to single out the military but were      applied in an evenhanded way to all prospective employers.       It was also far from clear that Harvard even violated the      Solomon Amendment. That law withheld federal funding from any      school that has a policy of denying military recruiters      access to the campus ``in a manner equal in quality and      scope'' to other recruiters. Neither the text of the law nor      its history (targeting anti-ROTC and anti-military rules)      compelled the conclusion that the law was violated by an      anti-discrimination policy applicable to all recruiters.       When some groups challenged the constitutionality of the      Solomon Amendment, Kagan joined a majority of her faculty      colleagues in a friend-of-the-court brief that I drafted as      their counsel, urging the court to exercise judicial      restraint and avoid ruling on the constitutional issue by      simply holding that it was not clear that Congress intended      to preclude the evenhanded application of anti-discrimination      policies. There were no dissents from the chief justice's      opinion dismissing this statutory argument. We knew that it      would be a difficult sell for the court because the actual      party to the case wanted to seek a constitutional ruling, a      course we thought imprudent and unwise. As the oral argument      showed, a number of justices thought the Harvard brief raised      a very serious question. For today's debate, the key point      about the brief that Kagan joined is that it urged a prudent      course, arguing that ``sound principles of judicial restraint      counsel that this Court should resolve the question of      statutory coverage before turning, only if necessary, to      constitutionality.''       No action Kagan took as dean remotely suggests anything but      the greatest respect for the military. Even when the law      school's anti-discrimination policy effectively precluded      placement-office assistance to military recruiters, she      permitted student veteran groups to use law-school premises      to facilitate military recruitment of Harvard students. At no      point were military recruiters ever barred from the campus or      banned from recruiting Harvard law students. And military      veterans who entered Harvard Law School when Kagan was dean      have praised her efforts to ensure they were welcomed and      respected for their service.       Separately, it is true that as dean, Kagan expressed strong      personal opposition to the ``don't ask, don't tell''      restrictions on service by gays and lesbians in the military.      But that is not an anti-military position. Rather, it is the      position now shared by many senior military leaders and the      commander in chief.
