 President, the amendment, which is the second-degree amendment that I have offered, would basically say that all new construction projects under the General Services Administration, the Federal buildings fund, construction and repair projects, where no earth has been turned, no overt things have been done as far as repairs on the building as yet--in other words, nothing done--this would basically total 1.84 billion dollars' worth of projects in not every State but a lot of States in the Union, including my State of Alabama where we have a Federal courthouse ready to go with a $46 million projected cost--we have the list--would be knocked out of the appropriations bill. They would be gone.  I will just list them basically.  Montgomery, AL, courthouse, $46 million. That is the first one. Little Rock, AR, courthouse, $13 million; Bullhead City, AZ, FAA grant, $2,200,000; Nogales, AZ, Border Patrol headquarters, $2,998,000; Phoenix, AZ, courthouse, $121,890,000; Sierra Vista, AZ, magistrates office, $1 million; the Tucson, AZ, courthouse, $121.8 million; Sacramento, CA, courthouse, $142.9 million; San Francisco, CA, lease-purchase $9 million; San Francisco, CA, courthouse, $4 million; the Washington, DC, U.S. Secret Service headquarters, $113 million; and the list goes on and on.  We have included in there Prince Georges/Montgomery County, MD, FDA consolidation, $284 million.  It says that we are going to save this money, at least temporarily, until GSA says we are ready to go. As I said, it is $1.842 billion.  I think the Senator from Nebraska will join me in this amendment. But I will leave that up to him.
