President, people wonder as they watch the Senate how bills get started. One of the bills that I have worked on probably the hardest in my career got started 11 years ago when there was a phone call to my Senate office in Chicago. It was a phone call from a friend of ours, Duffie Adleson, who was managing a program called the Merit Music Program.  It is a wonderful program in Chicago that offers opportunities for free musical instruments and free music lessons for kids from some of the poorest schools in town. The net result of it is a life-changing experience. One hundred of the Merit Music Program graduates go on to college. It is transformative.  Well, she had a story to tell me. It was about a young lady named Tereza Lee, Korean, who was a child prodigy when it came to the piano. She played it so well she had been offered many scholarships, including to the Manhattan Conservatory of Music. When she went to fill out her application, one of the questions was, What is your citizenship or nationality?  She turned to her mother and said: What is it, Mom? Her mom said: I do not know. You see, they brought Tereza to America when she was 2 years old on a visitor's visa. Her mom said: We never filed anything after that.  Mom and dad became citizens. Brother and sister born here automatically became citizens, but Tereza was a question mark. What am I? So she called Duffie. Duffie called the office, and we checked the law.  The law said Tereza Lee, who had lived in the United States for 16 years, had to leave for 10 years and after 10 years could apply to come back into the United States. She did not know where she would go. Her family had come to Chicago from Brazil, originally from Korea. There was no place to go, no other language that she spoke. This was the only country she ever knew.  So I wrote a bill and called it the DREAM Act. The DREAM Act said young people like her should be given a chance to become legal in America, to earn their way into legal status. The bill basically laid out some conditions: First, that they came to the United States as a child; second, they completed high school; third, they have no significant problems of moral character or a criminal record to speak of, and beyond that they had to do one of two things: finish at least 2 years of college or enlist in the American military.  Well, when I introduced this bill it was bipartisan. In fact, as many as 13 Republican Senators would vote with me. But we never quite got to that magic number of 60 votes in the Senate. We would get a majority but never quite get 60 votes. Then over the years this political issue started changing. Unfortunately, we started losing support on the Republican side of the aisle. Even those who were the original cosponsors of the bill started voting against it. They heard the talk about amnesty and all the criticism. They were swept into the belief that this should not pass.  But the bill is still very much alive, and it is the most important thing I have pending in the Senate, and has been for a long time. What it does, of course, is offer this opportunity.  I want to salute Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. He is a new Republican Senator, conservative, who took a look at this issue and said this is not an immigration issue; this is a humanitarian issue. We should offer these young people a chance, a chance to earn their way into legal status.  He is right. He remembered when 600,000 Cubans left to come to America to escape Castro's regime it was not the immigration system that welcomed them; it was the humanitarian effort by the United States to allow them to find a home. What a difference they have made, a positive difference in this country, not just in Florida but all over the country.  Look at Marco Rubio, a man who now represents Florida in the Senate. It was his father and grandfather who made it here because of that humanitarian gesture. He and I and many others are working now to try to find a bipartisan way to put this together again.  I have come to the floor countless times--dozens of times--to ask my colleagues to think about this issue in real human terms. Almost every week I come and tell the story of one of the students who would be affected by the DREAM Act. When I started on this issue, the DREAM Act students would hide in the shadows. They would wait in the darkness by my car to tell me: I am one of those undocumented immigrants. I am one of those students who has no place to go.  Well, times have changed. They are now stepping up and saying: Look at me. Know who I am. Realize, as Senator Menendez has said on the floor many times, these are young people who spent their entire lives with their hands over their hearts pledging allegiance to the only country they ever knew. They only know one national anthem, and it is ours. They think it is theirs. But technically, legally, they have no legal standing.  Let me introduce you to a young man who has a great story. His name is Novi Roy. He grew up in Illinois. He was brought to the United States from India as a child. He was an especially good student. Novi attended Evanston Township High School just north of Chicago, graduated with a 3.9 grade point average.  During high school he volunteered working in the soup kitchen in Rogers Park and continues to do that even today. He went to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, which we are pretty proud of, and he graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics. Just last month he had two master's degrees awarded to him, one in business administration and one in human resources. He is 24 years old now.  His dream is to work in the health care field to try to provide health care protection to people who don't have it today. He said this in a letter he wrote me:       I love America for all its opportunities and, like any      other aspiring student, I want     a chance to realize the American dream. I owe the State of      Illinois, its taxpayers, and America a huge debt of gratitude      for the level of education I have attained thus far. I am      confident that my education will serve me well enough to make      a difference in people's lives [and] there is nothing I      [would] like more than to give back to the community that has      been so good to me.  For the record, Novi, because he is DREAM Act eligible, is not eligible for Federal assistance for education. These young people, DREAM Act students, have to work harder, borrow a lot more money, if they can, or save it, and it will take longer to get through. But they do it anyway because they are so determined to have a good life.  Novi has been offered jobs with Fortune 100 companies, but he cannot work legally in America because he is undocumented. Novi came to the United States legally, and his family applied for legal permanent resident status. When their application was denied, Novi was placed in deportation proceedings.  He never committed a crime. He grew up in this country. We have already invested in Novi, obviously, with an outstanding education from a great university. He has a potential to make America a better place. Despite these facts, even at this moment, Novi could be deported from the United States.  In his letter to me, he said this about that possibility:       I have never entered the U.S. illegally, nor broken any of      its laws at any time. Unfortunately, my immigration case has      simply fallen through the cracks. I have lived here in      Illinois for the last 10 years, and my entire identity is      exclusively based on my life in the U.S. I have nothing to go      back to--no friends, no family, nothing. America is my home.  My office contacted Immigration and Customs Enforcement and asked them to consider Novi's request that his deportation be placed on hold. We just learned yesterday this request had been granted. But the decision to put Novi's deportation on hold is temporary. It doesn't give Novi permanent legal status, and he still is at risk of deportation in the future. The only way for Novi to become a citizen is for the DREAM Act to become law.  Would America be stronger and better if Novi Roy was deported? Of course not. He has all these years of education and his graduation from Evanston Township High School with a high GPA, two degrees from the University of Illinois, and we would let him leave and go to some other country and use his talents to make their country better? That makes no sense.  He has overcome great odds to achieve the great success he has so far. He doesn't have any criminal background problems or pose any threats to this country. He would make America a better place.  Novi is not an isolated example. There are literally thousands of others just like him around the country.  The DREAM Act would give Novi and other bright, accomplished, and ambitious young people like him the chance to become America's future entrepreneurs, doctors, engineers, teachers, and soldiers.  Today, I again ask my colleagues to support the DREAM Act. Let's give Novi Roy and so many other young people like him a chance to contribute more completely to the country they call home. It is the right thing to do, and it will make America stronger.                             Overseas Visit
