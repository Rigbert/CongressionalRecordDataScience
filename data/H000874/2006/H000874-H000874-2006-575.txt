Speaker, I want to offer my congratulations today to my good friend and Fifth District constituent, Betty Buck of Upper Marlboro, Maryland, who was recently elected as the Chairman of the National Beer Wholesalers Association. Betty is well known for her leadership in the State of Maryland, and this week she made history by being elected the first woman to lead this important national business trade association.  Betty is the President of Buck Distributing, a beer wholesaler in my District, where she oversees a business with annual sales of more than $40 million and employs more than 100 workers. This is not the first time that Betty's professional vision and competence have elevated her to a leadership position. She has been recognized for her business acumen by serving on the Committee of America's Women Business Leaders and as a past Director of the Greater Washington Board of Trade. In addition, she was named one of the Most Powerful Women in Washington in 1997, and was selected to be a member of the Top 500 Women Owned Business Group and the Top 25 Women Who Mean Business by the Washington Business Journal.  Betty is also a dedicated public servant who is deeply concerned about our community. She has served on numerous boards and foundations in the greater Washington, D.C., area, including the Prince George's Hospital Foundation, the University of Maryland's Foundation Board of Directors, and United Cerebral Palsy.  In addition to her charity work, Betty has also given her time and expertise to her community by serving as a member of the Maryland Judicial Compensation Committee, the Anne Arundel Planning Advisory Board, and the University of Maryland Commission for School Cooperation.  It is a testament to Betty's talents that she has accomplished so much in the professional world while also raising a wonderful family, including her children Kelly, Erin, Tim and Dan.  Mr. Speaker, Betty Buck is an inspiration to all those who desire a career in business and who also want to raise a family and be engaged in their community. I salute her efforts, as she rises to the position of Chairman of the National Beer Wholesalers Association.                          ____________________
