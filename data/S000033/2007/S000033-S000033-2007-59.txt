 President, I wish to acknowledge the recent passing of Grace Paley. Grace, who called Vermont her home, was a renowned and award-winning short story writer, a political activist, a wife and mother.  Although she spent much of each year in Thetford, VT, and we considered her an adopted Vermonter, her fiction was set in the apartments, streets and neighborhoods of New York City. Grace Paley was not attracted to the bright lights or famous personalities or glitter of New York; however, she was attracted to the quotidian lives and the interpersonal and ethical problems faced by people very like ourselves. As Grace once said, ``I'm not writing a history of famous people, I am interested in a history of everyday life.'' She wrote about them in her two most noted collections of stories, ``The Little Disturbances of Man'' and ``Enormous Changes at the Last Minute.'' And she wrote beautifully, and with great sensitivity to both the spoken language and to human relationships. Her work gathered enormous critical acclaim. She was one of the great short fiction writers of our age.  Her home in Thetford, VT, was not some weekend getaway, some means of unwinding from the hectic pace of life in the big city. For Grace, Thetford--and the State of Vermont--was a place where she could carry on her long-standing struggle for peace and for social justice. She was an active, a very active, presence in the local community. Whether it was through her long-standing commitment to bringing peace to the world or her many local readings of her fiction, Grace Paley was a presence in our lives--and a beloved local figure. She never sought the spotlight, but she did not shy away from it when she felt her cause was just. She lived her convictions and served as a model for generations of women, of Vermonters, of activists.  In recognition of her contributions to Vermont, Grace Paley was awarded the title of ``Vermont State Poet'' in 2003, a position that had been held previously by Robert Frost, among others. She was also awarded the title of ``New York State Writer'' by Mario Cuomo in1986. It is a fitting testimony to the quality and importance of her literary work that both States, which she called home, chose to honor her in this fashion.  Grace Paley will be sorely missed, but her work, her passion for peace and justice, and her love of her fellow Vermonters will not be forgotten.                          ____________________
