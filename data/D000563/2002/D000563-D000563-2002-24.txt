If I am forced to object, I will, but I have other colleagues here who would like to share some concerns with the Senator from Pennsylvania. And as I understood, there was a dialogue between us, or at least I hoped there would be. That was the reason I was asking questions of the Senator. And if it is necessary at this point to object, and it will foreclose my colleagues from making a statement, I did not want that to happen. But if that is where we stand on this, I suppose I have no alternative. I object.
