Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) for introducing this legislation and for giving us this opportunity as a body, Democrats and Republicans, to express our condolences not just to the American families but also to those in Kenya and Tanzania who lost loved ones or had loved ones hurt very severely, and also to thank the countries of Kenya and Tanzania for the cooperation they have given in trying to apprehend these cowardly terrorists.  Let me also remind the body that within hours of that horrific act, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), chairman of the Committee on International Relations, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), who is the ranking member on the Helsinki Commission, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cardin) and I convened a press conference on the grassy triangle. The gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) and others were all very supportive of that.  We made it clear that no terrorist should take any solace in any bickering that they may see going on in the Capitol of Washington; that whatever the President's problems may be, we are united in our fight against terrorism; that we will stand shoulder-to-shoulder in trying to apprehend terrorists; and that when you pick on Americans, when you go after Americans, we are absolutely united.  I think that message is coming across. This resolution will help. I want to commend the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings) for bringing us this important resolution.
