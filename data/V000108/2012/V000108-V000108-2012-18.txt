And I think the only other thank-you I would add, and I would very sincerely join the chair in all of the recognitions that he has enumerated, is the Chair, herself, as well as all of those others who have served us over the last 4 days and done a very expeditious job.  I cannot thank the chairman enough for all he has done for us and for this country and for being the consummate gentleman. It is a privilege and a delight to work with you, as well as the other members of the subcommittee.  I would point out that, while we agree very substantively on this bill, there are degrees of differences. We did not, in the intervening last 4 days, agree on every amendment, but we had reasoned and thoughtful debate. We had votes, and decisions were made.  It is a profound privilege that people like Chairman Frelinghuysen, Mr. Dicks, and I have serving this country in this Congress. I am an institutionalist, and this is a perfect example of how that institution should work: to meet collectively, to resolve our differences, and to work as hard as we can to hopefully, in fiscal year 2013, leave this country a little bit better.  Again, thank all of the people, and particularly the staff and the Chair for all their good work.  I appreciate the chairman for yielding.
