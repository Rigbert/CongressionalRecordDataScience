We can go ahead and pass this as a mark that dictates at this time. If there is any kind of abuse, we can change it. Anything we do can be changed. That is what we are trying to do right now. These abuses are not things that just happened in the last 6 months. They have been happening over a long period of time.  We talked about doing something about this in the last three authorization bills. We haven't done it. We put it off. Nothing has happened. Now we have an opportunity to do it. All we are doing here is allowing us to at least have some ability to monitor what is going on and stop some of these things.  I just keep thinking about the ``60 Minutes'' program coming up with all of these abuses. What do we do? We have debated this issue. We turned around and said we will leave the status quo. That is what we are going to do if we pass the amendment.
