Speaker, it is with the greatest pleasure that I pay tribute to one of the most caring, dedicated, and selfless citizens in Indiana's First Congressional District, Imogene Matthews of Gary, Indiana.  After serving the constituents of Northwest Indiana in my Gary District Office for the last 10 years, Imogene announced her retirement this past December.  Imogene Vanetta Matthews was born on April 15, 1954, in Gary, Indiana. Imogene, affectionately known as Moby, was the youngest girl of 11 children born to Emmett and Pauline Matthews. A lifetime native of Gary, Indiana, Imogene graduated from West Side High School in 1972.  One need look no further than her career choices after high school to determine what kind of person Imogene is. From her beginnings at the Gary Manpower Administration helping to place young children in day-care centers and homes, to her years of service as executive secretary for Gary Mayor Richard G. Hatcher, to the last person she assisted in her capacity as a Federal caseworker in my office, she has dedicated her life wholly to public service.  I was fortunate enough to have Moby on my staff as a Federal caseworker since 1989. Her commitment to her work and the people of Northwest Indiana eventually earned her a position as my Deputy District Director.                              {time}  1330  During her tenure in my office, she has worked selflessly to ensure the well-being of all those around her. Her exceptional knowledge and expertise in dealing with the Immigration and Naturalization Service and the Social Security Administration are unparalleled. While serving on my staff, she reunited dozens of families, helping loved ones attain the privilege of U.S. citizenship and aiding those already in the U.S. by acquiring the passports and visas they needed to visit their relatives abroad.  You only needed one meeting with Imogene to see the revelation that her choice of vocation is not only a result of the responsibility she feels to a community she loves but is also a reflection of her deep and abiding compassion for those around her. Federal casework can be a thankless task. But Moby never wavered. Regardless of the barriers that faced her, Imogene threw herself into her work with the patience and perseverance of Job. Her overwhelming commitment to following through on her promises made her an absolute miracle worker. My office is often the last resort for many of my constituents with problems. Imogene never let anyone feel desperate or afraid. On the contrary, she was a great source of hope to many people who had nowhere else to turn. She treated everyone who walked into my office with the dignity and respect they deserved, regardless of their situation in life or the details of their problems. After working with her for a decade, I can say easily that her kindness knows no bounds.  As one might expect, Imogene selflessly gives her free time and energy to her community as well, her friends, and, most importantly, her family. Imogene is a member of the NAACP as well as the Young Women's Christian Association. She is also an active volunteer for the American Association of Retired Persons and is a member of the Friends of the Gary Public Library. In addition to these important activities, Imogene promotes another cause that is near and dear to her heart. She is an avid Chicago Bulls fan and a Michael Jordan fan.

Mr. Speaker, I ask that you and my other distinguished colleagues join mein commending Imogene ``Moby'' Matthews for her lifetime of dedication, service and compassion to the residents of northwest Indiana. She has touched the lives of many residents and she will be sorely missed not only by those she has helped with her outstanding service and uncompromising dedication but by myself and my staff who have seen her extraordinary expertise and felt her deep compassion and love. She will never be replaced.                          ____________________
