Speaker, do we remember the movie Roger and Me, where producer Roger Moore attempted to find Roger Smith, the President of General Motors? He looked everywhere for him. He looked in Detroit, he looked in Boca Raton. He could not find him, as Roger dutifully avoided the camera lens.  In Congress this month and last, we are producing a sequel to Roger and Me. It is called the Omnibus and Me. Let me ask, where is the omnibus bill? We know it is a large bill. We know we cannot find it. We know it is looking more and more like one of those dreaded congressional Christmas tree bills. No one seems to know in which room it is being written. No one knows exactly who is writing it. In fact, we are told three or four staffers are actually in charge. So who exactly are these unelected people? Where can Members go to read the bill?  Most importantly, Members do not know what is in the bill. We are told one-third of $1 billion is being slipped in to bail out poultry traders, get this, in Russia. That issue never came up during House consideration of the agricultural appropriation bill, which passed here overwhelmingly. It never came up in the Senate, either.  According to Sect. 201(f) of the Agricultural Trade Act of 1978; ``The Commodity Credit Corporation may not make export sales financing authorized under this section available in connection with sales of an agricultural commodity to any country that the Secretary determines cannot adequately service the debt associated with such sale.'' Currently, Russia is ineligible for the program.  So why is regular order being violated for certain special interests who can gain access to the corridors of this Congress very late in the year?  In fact, every piece of legislative business not completed during this Congress, now famous as the do-nothing Congress, the 105th Congress, is now being put on the table as bargaining chips among a very few players. Why? Because this Chamber and the other have not completed their business on time. The fiscal year began October 1. Everything happening here in Congress is being played actually in overtime, simply because every single congressional deadline under regular order has been missed by the group in charge.  What about the budget? There is no approved budget resolution for 1999, the fiscal year. We are already into that year. Some Committee on the Budget Members in leadership positions here in the House want to run for president, but they have not even completed the responsibilities of their committee work here in the House.  Look at the appropriation bills. A majority of them, eight of 13, have not been completed on time. Now they are being picked apart by a very few folks around here, without the sunlight of regular order and regular committee oversight.  Why is Congress here in October, at the end of a fiscal year? There is no budget. A majority of appropriation bills for fiscal year 1999, which has already begun, are not completed, a majority. Congress is operating in a stop-start knee-jerk operation actually not worthy of those that we represent.  For the record, let me point out again, there is no completed budget for the fiscal year we are already in because Congress did not finish its legislative business by passing its 13 appropriation bills by September 30.  On September 25 the first continuing resolution was offered that extended the congressional session 14 days overtime, as a handful of Members began drafting the omnibus bill that I have been looking for for several days. They are doing so in secret. Members, find the room and tell me where all this is being done.  Then, when they still did not finish after 2 more weeks, a second continuing resolution passed the House on October 9. They said they needed 4 more days to add more to the Christmas tree bill. That did not work, so then a third continuing resolution was offered on October 12, Columbus Day, somewhat historic, I suppose, for 2 more days, until October 14. Now today, a fourth overtime resolution was offered for 3 more days until Friday, the end of this week, October 16.  I sure would not put those manipulating this hit and miss scheduling in charge of anything after this Congress is over.  So I ask, where is the omnibus Christmas tree appropriation bill? Where can Members read it? Where, more importantly, can the public read it? Is it going to be put on the Internet, so the American people can read it before we have to vote on it, whenever that is?  I would say to Members, and I have been here a few years, I can tell Members with absolute certainty, if Members are not able to read this bill before it comes to the floor, Members have only one choice: Vote no.                          ____________________
