Mr. Speaker, instead of rolling out the red carpet this week for Slobodan Milosevic, the Clinton administration should hand over the Serbain President to international investigators for his alleged role in war crimes perpetrated in the former Yugoslavia. Having ignited the firestorm of extreme Serb nationalism which has consumed most of Bosnia and part of Croatia, Milosevic is now being enlisted as a member of the Clinton administration's fire brigade assembled to douse the smoldering ashes in its aftermath.  Milosevic, who has earned the title ``Butcher of the Balkans,'' has reincarnated himself, in the eyes of the Clinton administration, as a peacemaker despite the fact that he was named a suspected war criminal by Secretary of State Eagleberger during the final days of the Bush administration, and that he heads a government being sued for genocide before the International Court of Justice. The Clinton administration views the Serbian leader as the one who can deliver the Bosnian Serbs in support of a United States-brokered peace plan which will effectively divide Bosnian-Herzegovian along ethnic lines.  Is he really a new peacemaker or is he after something else? I fear the latter is true. Reeling under the devastating impact of economic sanctions imposed in 1992 by the U.N. on Serbia for its role in the wars in neighboring Croatia and Bosnia, Milosevic is keen to cut a deal which will pave the way for the sanctions to be lifted. I am not convinced he has given up on his dream of creating a ``Greater Serbia.''  The Clinton administration has embraced Milosevic as part of its full-court press to conclude a Bosnian peace accord, at almost any cost, as the presidential campaign season nears. Mr Speaker, I welcome the fact that the President has finally begun to focus on the crisis in Bosnia. At the same time, I have reservations about the conduct of the current negotiations and am vehemently opposed to allowing Mr. Milosevic into the United States.  Despite the hype and new spins, one fact is abundantly clear--Milosevic was the mastermind behind extreme Serb nationalism which spawned mayhem in Bosnia and Croatia and ultimately has led to the murder of tens of thousands of innocent civilians in these countries. Warren Zimmerman, the last United States Ambassador to Yugoslavia has observed ``nobody in Belgrade doubts that the war in Bosnia is being masterminded by Milosevic in collusion with his Bosnian Serb henchman, Radovan Karadzic.'' Zimmerman has characterized the Serbian President as a liar ``almost totally dominated by his dark side.'' The genocidal campaign unleashed by Milosevic has included the rape of tens of thousands of women, the destruction of thousands of mosques and Catholic churches, and the forcible expulsion of hundreds of thousands.  Mr. Speaker, the Bosnian Serb political and military leaders, Karadzic and Mladic, wouldn't dare step foot on United States soil following their indictment as war criminals by the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague, earlier this year. There is a cruel irony in the fact that, with his lieutenants largely out of the picture, Milosevic has returned to center stage as the perceived linchpin to peace in the Balkans following a 4-year war of armed aggression and genocide which he, himself, set in motion.  In a speech launching a week-long commemoration at the University of Connecticut of the 50th anniversary of the Nuremberg trials, President Clinton solemnly declared ``there must be peace of justice to prevail, but there must be justice when peace prevails.'' Apparently, the Clinton administration is prepared to put justice aside in their quest for peace in Bosnia which it believes hinges on Milosevic.  Mr. Speaker, I would submit that peace and justice can and should be pursued simultaneously. I agreed with President Clinton when he said, ``By successfully prosecuting war criminals in the former Yugoslavia * * * we send a strong signal for those who would use the cover of war to commit terrible atrocities, that they cannot escape the consequences of such actions.'' But what signal is the Clinton administration sending by welcoming Milosevic to the United States?  Even those who accept Milosevic's participation in the current peace talks--for whatever reason--must acknowledge that the Serbian leader will garner a degree of credibility and prestige by being allowed to enter the United States. Furthermore, Mr. Speaker, by willingly admitting Milosevic, the Clinton administration calls into question its determination to see all war criminals, regardless of rank, brought to justice.  Mr. Speaker, the arrival of Slobodan Milosevic in the United States is repugnant to American principles and is an affront to the memory of the tens of thousands of innocent victims of the Balkan war.  For the Record, Mr. Speaker, I wish also to include a disturbing article which was published in the Christian Science Monitor on October 24, 1995.          [From the Christian Science Monitor, Oct. 24, 1995]            Serbia Held Responsible for Massacre of Bosnians                            (By David Rohde)       Officers from Serbia participated in the attack on the UN-     declared ``safe area'' of Srebrenica, according to credible      eyewitness accounts obtained by the Monitor. And senior      Western diplomats and UN officials say Serbian President      Slobodan Milosevic is responsible for the attack and the      subsequent executions of thousands of Muslim civilians.       Muslim witnesses say that an officer from Serbia was      directing the roundup of Muslim prisoners in the village of      Konjevic Polje, and that a Serb officer captured by Muslim      forces was following orders issued from the Serbian capital,      Belgrade.       ``The Serb officer said they were under orders from      Belgrade not to allow any men to escape from Srebrenica,''      says Bosnian soldier Dzemal Malvic.       ``All Muslim men were to be captured or killed,'' said Mr.      Malovic, one of three Bosnian soldiers who say they spoke to      and looked at identify papers of the captured Serbian      captain.       In a separate interview, a Muslim officer confirmed that      the Serbian officer had been captured. The Serbian officer's      whereabouts are unknown, and he may have been killed later by      Muslim forces.       Western diplomats have long suspected that the Bosnian Serb      attack on Srebrenica in mid-July was approved by Belgrade,      but the government of President Slobodan Milosevic has      vehemently denied it.       Mr. Milosevic's involvement would be an embarrassment for      the Clinton administration, eager to portray Milosevic--who      will be attending peace talks in Ohio next week--as a      peacemaker in the Balkans, not a war criminal.       ``Whether by commission or omission, [Milosevic] is      responsible, no question,'' says a senior UN military      official based in Zagreb, Croatia. ``He had plenty of sources      on the ground there. He had to know what was happening, and      either approved of it or did nothing to stop it.''       A senior Western diplomat in Zagreb also says Milosevic is      responsible for what is quickly emerging as one of the      darkest hours of Bosnia's 3\1/2\ year conflict.       ``I have no doubt he directly approved or tacitly approved      of the taking of Srebrenica,'' the diplomat says. ``Whether      Milosenic knew [about the executions] or not, he knows what      kind of man [Bosnian Serb Army commander Gen. Ratko] Mladic      is and how he operates.''                       reports of mass executions       Over 2,000 Muslim men were executed by Bosnian Serb forces      following the fall of Srebrenica, according to nine survivors      interviewed by the Monitor last month.       War-crimes investigators now have evidence that as many as      3,000 to 4,000 men were executed by the Bosnian Serbs,      according to a senior UN official close to the investigation.      ``Wait until everything comes out,'' he says. ``Then, people      will understand how big this is.''       The UN official close to the International War Crimes      Tribunal in The Hague said mass graves ring the area around      Srebrenica, and confirmed the existence of a new set of      United States spy photos showing a new group of apparent mass      graves near the village of Karakaj, as reported by the Boston      Globe on Oct. 3.       The photos confirm the accounts of five men interviewed by      the Monitor who say over 2,000 Muslim prisoners were executed      near the town of Karakaj on July 18. The photos may be the      basis for new indictments against General Mladic expected to      be issued by the Tribunal.       Bosnian Serb officials have said that mass graves in the      village of Nova Kasaba captured in US spy photos and visited      by the Monitor in August contain the bodies of Muslim      soldiers who were killed in combat and not executed.       But the Karakaj site is too far from the route that Muslim      men would have followed to escape from Srebrenica, according      to the UN official.       Mevludin Oric, a survivor of the Karakaj execution, said in      an interview that one of the officers directing the roundup      of prisoners in Konjevic Polje was a 40- to 45-year-old      officer from Serbia. Mr. Oric is considered by war-crimes      investigators to be one of their most credible witnesses. The      Serbian officer was not present at the later execution, Oric      added.       Who gave the order to execute thousands of prisoners      remains unknown.       But evidence of Milosevic's involvement in Srebrenica has      been mounting for months, and it is not known if Mladic would      execute such a large number of men without at least the tacit      approval of Serbian leaders in Belgrade.       Mladic, who eyewitnesses interviewed by the Monitor said      was at Karakaj and three other executions sites during or      just before executions began, had been visiting Belgrade      regularly for weeks prior to the attack.       Dutch peacekeepers reported seeing members of paramilitary      groups from Serbia, and Muslims say they saw Belgrade-based      paramilitary leader Zeljko ``Arkan'' Raznjatovic in      Srebrenica.       The Washington Post reported seeing Muslim soldiers driving      a jeep with Yugoslav Army license plates on July 17. The      Muslims said they had captured the jeep from forces involved      in the attack on Srebrenica.       New York Newsday reported on Aug. 12 that Western      intelligence officials captured radio intercepts of Yugoslav      Army chief Gen. Momcilo Perisic, directing Mladic on how to      attack Srebrenica during the offensive.                              Serb denials       Yugoslav officials have strenuously denied the accounts,      but the Yugoslav Army and Arkan are believed to be tightly      controlled by Milosevic, who holds an iron grip over Serbia's      military.       Despite the growing evidence, Srebrenica survivors remain      skeptical that Milosevic--whom the Clinton administration is      depending on to force the Bosnian Serbs to agree to a peace      deal--will be tied to or punished for Europe's worst massacre      since World War II.       ``It all depends on the politicians,'' Malovic says. ``They      could punish them, or reward them, for doing this.''                          ____________________
