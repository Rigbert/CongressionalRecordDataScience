 President, I ask unanimous consent that the committee-reported amendments be withdrawn; that the Grassley substitute amendment be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; that the Grassley title amendment be agreed to; and that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table.
