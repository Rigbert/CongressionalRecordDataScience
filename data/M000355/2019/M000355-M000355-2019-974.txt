 Most immediately, in just a few hours, we will be confirming a new Secretary of Defense. The vote to advance Dr. Mark Esper's nomination yesterday afternoon came in at 85 to 6. That is precisely the kind of overwhelming bipartisan vote that is called for in this circumstance.  The nominee is beyond qualified. His record of public service is beyond impressive. His commitment to serving our servicemembers is beyond obvious. The need for a Senate-confirmed Secretary of Defense is beyond urgent. I urge every one of my colleagues to vote to confirm our next Secretary of Defense later today.                          ____________________
