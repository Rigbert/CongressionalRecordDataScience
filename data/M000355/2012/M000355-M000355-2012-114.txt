 He simply refused to do so. So last week Congress passed legislation requiring him to do so. In fact, it cleared the Senate, I believe, unanimously.  Then yesterday there was this: An Assistant Secretary down at the Department of Labor is now telling people they are under no legal obligation to let employees know if they will lose their jobs as a result of these cuts. Let me say that again. We have an Assistant Secretary of Labor who just yesterday said that employers are under no legal obligation to tell their employees they may lose their jobs as a result of these cuts. In other words, the President is trying to keep those folks in the dark about whether they can expect to lose their jobs. Why? Well, I think it is pretty obvious: to insulate himself from the political fallout that will result. The President doesn't want people reading about pink slips in the weeks before his election, so the White House is telling people to keep the effects of these cuts a secret--don't tell anybody, he says, keep it a secret--until, of course, after the election. Once again, a President who holds himself out as a great defender of the middle class and the goals of organized labor is putting his own political goals ahead of the hard-working Americans who will be affected by these policies. Rather than let those who will be affected by the cuts know about them, he will make everybody nervous.  For 3\1/2\ years--3\1/2\ long years--this President has pushed an ideological agenda without regard for the consequences it would have on the very middle-class Americans he purports to defend.  The President may not want to admit it, but the economic mess we are in is his legacy--his legacy. After 3\1/2\ years of finger-pointing--3\1/2\ years of finger-pointing--he owes it to the American people to be straight about it.  Mr. President, I yield the floor.                          ____________________
