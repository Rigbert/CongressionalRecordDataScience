Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Hinchey), a member of the subcommittee, who has worked so diligently on this bill and, as the rest of the members on our subcommittee, was actually robbed of his rights as a Member of this institution because our committee was recessed and never called back to complete work on this bill.
