Speaker, reclaiming my time, I appreciate the gentleman's observation.  My presumption is then, Mr. Chairman, before he leaves the floor, my presumption would be, for the Members of the House and also for the members of the Committee on Appropriations, that the Committee on Appropriations will proceed as if the House numbers were the numbers? Am I correct on that? I yield to the gentleman.
