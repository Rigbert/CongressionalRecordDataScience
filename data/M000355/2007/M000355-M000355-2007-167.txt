 President, today I commend Ms. Donna L. Pile of Lexington, KY, for her service to her community and her Nation as a member and leader of the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents.  Ms. Pile recently served as President of the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents, the first woman ever named to that position. She previously served in many positions of responsibility for the association. Ms. Pile was also president of the PIA of Kentucky in 2000 and has been Kentucky's representative on the PIA National Board of Directors since 2000. Ms. Pile is also a member of the National Association of Insurance Women.  Active in her community, Ms. Pile is managing partner of the A.G. Perry Insurance Agency of Lexington. She has served her community as a homeroom mother in grade school and as Booster Club president to the Jessamine County Boys' Soccer Program for 10 years. She has taught PIA Young Agents classes and also served on numerous strategic planning committees for Jessamine County Schools.  As president of the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents, Ms. Pile's dedication to the highest standards of her profession has earned her the respect of friends, associates, business colleagues, and the insurance industry as a whole. She took seriously her role to advocate for professional insurance agents across the United States and has left behind a stronger organization for her efforts.  I want to recognize today the many successes that Donna L. Pile has accomplished throughout her career and to again congratulate her on the completion of her term as the president of the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents.                          ____________________
