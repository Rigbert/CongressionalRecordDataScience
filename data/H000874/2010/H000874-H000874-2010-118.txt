I happen not to agree with it, but I think it is a courageous, intellectually honest proposal. And that is Mr. Ryan, who's the ranking member of the Budget Committee. If the gentleman would like us to put that budget on the floor--which is from his chair when he was in the majority of the Budget Committee--that is a really substantive proposal. Again, I don't agree with it, but I think it intellectually is an honest, effective proposal to deal with a very serious problem, not a little problem, but a trillion-dollar problem; not a little problem that sounds good in sound bites but is not going to get us to where we need to be.  I think Mr. Ryan has such a proposal, and I certainly would urge the chairman of the Budget Committee to agree to make sure that's on the floor because I believe that is a substantive proposal. The gentleman says we don't put his substantive proposals on thefloor. That's made by the ranking member of the Budget Committee, one of the leaders of his party, representing your party on the Budget Committee. And I would be glad to make arrangements to have that proposal on the floor.  Would the gentleman want me to do that?
