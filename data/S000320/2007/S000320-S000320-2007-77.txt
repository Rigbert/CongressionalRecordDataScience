 I have known Senator Cochran for 28 years, since I first came to the U.S. House of Representatives. I can tell you, without any reservation, he is a gentleman. He is a bright, very engaged Senator. He knows the appropriations process, but he is courteous to all of us. He will always listen to us, although his position might be 180 degrees from what we are talking about.  I congratulate him for this achievement. This is a milestone in the Senate. I don't know if I will ever be here for 10,000 votes. Not many people, as Senator Byrd mentioned this morning, have. So this is a feat in itself. I congratulate Senator Cochran for his diligence and his service to the Nation and to the people of Mississippi in the Senate and, before then, in the House of Representatives, and also as a naval officer, as a young man out of Old Miss Law School.                          ____________________
