President, it is time to lift the veil of secrecy around energy markets in this country.  Now that electric power is being traded as a commodity, with electricity bought and sold in markets all across the country, basic information about things like transmission capability and outages must be made available to the public. This information is crucial both for the markets to function efficiently and for the public to have confidence in these markets. But, unlike other commodities, it is often difficult to get basic information about how electric power systems and markets work. Information about the supply, demand and transmission of electricity around the country is simply unavailable in many areas of the country to State regulators and the general public.  The electric power industry has not made this information available, and without Congressional action, Americans will continue to be kept in the dark about information they need to make informed choices and which will enable energy markets to work in a fair way.  Today, along with Senator Burns, I am introducing the Electricity Information, Disclosure, Efficiency, and Accountability Act to open up access to operating information so that the markets can operate more efficiently, which can ultimately provide lower prices for consumers.  Our legislation will create a standard system to provide market participants,regulators and the public with access to key operational information about wholesale electric transmission systems and power markets. The bill requires operators of wholesale electric transmission and other bulk power systems to provide all system users with basic operating information, including all transmission line and generation facility data used to determine capacity or restraints on a transmission line and the supply and demand for electricity. Power system operators already have access to this information as part of their routine operation of bulk power systems. So there should be no additional burden on power generators to disclose information beyond what they are already providing to their system operators.  In general, the bill would require operating information to be released on a real-time basis, updated hourly. This would ensure that market participants can keep current with changing conditions throughout the day that impact market decisions. This release of real-time data will also ensure there is a level playing field for all users of the transmission grid and prevent some users from gaining a competitive advantage by access to non-public information.  At the same time, the bill also creates a mechanism for keeping commercially sensitive information confidential or delaying disclosure of information that could be used to manipulate markets. Our legislation gives the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission authority to decide what data is considered commercially sensitive and either should not be publicly disclosed or should only be disclosed when the data is no longer commercially sensitive.  In developing this legislation, we have worked with a broad range of stakeholders including market participants, regulators and consumer groups. The supporters include Enron, the largest electric power marketer in the U.S. today, the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, NARUC, and the Consumer Federation of America.  The bill we are introducing today will lift the veil of secrecy now shrouding the operations of electric power systems around the country. It will improve access to critical information about how electric power systems and markets work while fully protecting commercially sensitive data. By improving access to information, market participants will be better informed when they make the thousands of decisions that must be made every day about how electricity is generated to customers across the country. Better access to information will enable regulators to take appropriate steps to ensure our electric power systems are reliable and that markets are functioning properly. Ultimately, by creating more efficient systems and markets, electricity customers throughout the country will be better served.  I urge my colleagues to support the Electricity Information, Disclosure, Efficiency, and Accountability Act.  I ask unanimous consent that letters of support written by NARUC and the Consumer Federation of America be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners,                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2001.     Senator Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Wyden: Thank you for leadership in sponsoring      legislation to address the data access difficulties      confronting State Public Utility Commissions. Additionally,      the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners      (NARUC) would like to thank you for working with NARUC      members and staff to include in your draft legislation our      recommendations on the types of information necessary to      adequately monitor wholesale electricity markets and to      assure proper access to such information. NARUC supports the      draft legislation you are sponsoring regarding electricity      information disclosure.       Many regional electric markets throughout the country have      experienced price spikes of unusual and unexpected      proportions. These price spikes have led to curtailment or      shutdown of operations of some large industrial customers and      to increased prices for smaller commercial and residential      customers.       The high market price volatility has raised concerns about      the integrity of the markets, leading to calls from numerous      participants, consumers and policy makers for heightened      monitoring of these markets by regulatory bodies. In order to      identify corrective policy options to assure the public of      the competitiveness and efficiency of the developing      wholesale electricity market and its prices, regulatory      bodies need access to data such as production for generating      plants, transmission path schedules and actual flows.       The electric industry restructuring efforts of the federal      government and the various states are based upon an      assumption that wholesale markets are workably competitive.      To that end, policy makers must have the ability to provide      confidence to an already skeptical and uneasy public that the      market is not being ``gamed.'' This confidence can only be      provided if regulators are able to access the data necessary      to ensure that the market is functioning in a truly      competitive fashion. To the extent data is currently shared      among market participants for purposes of reliability, it      should also be available to regulators and the public.       In conclusion, I would like to thank you again for      considering NARUC's concerns and recommendations while you      drafted the ``Electricity Information, Disclosure,      Efficiency, and Accountability Act.'' NARUC would be pleased      to provide any additional assistance necessary to move this      legislation forward.           Sincerely,                                                   Charles D. Gray     Executive Director.                                  ____                               Consumer Federation of America,                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2001.     Re Support for Wyden/Burns Electricity Information,          Disclosure, Efficiency and Accountability Act.     Hon. Ron Wyden,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Conrad Burns,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Wyden and Burns: The Consumer Federation of      America supports this legislation, which would require that      essential information about the functioning and reliability      of electricity markets be provided to the public, regulators      and market participants on a real-time basis. This would      include operating data used by wholesale system operators to      determine available electric capacity and bottlenecks and to      maintain reliability. Bid data would also have to be made      available, such as the price, amount and delivery location of      electricity that is purchased.       In a series of studies over the last three years, the      Consumer Federation of America has documented in detail how      the flawed deregulation of electricity in a number of states      has led to extensive price spikes and brown outs for      consumers and huge windfalls for many energy producers. Among      the many steps that should be taken to fix this highly      dysfunctional market is the creation of functioning market      institutions and greater transparency. Market institutions      should be developed before, not after, the trading of      electricity begins so that trading is transparent and      disciplined by market forces. Undeveloped information and      trading mechanisms are prone to manipulation. As we've seen      in California over the last year, when abuse occurs under      such circumstances, consumers are vulnerable to price gouging      and the provision of unreliable electricity.       Electricity markets have a multitude of complex      transactions. Unfortunately, good information about these      transactions is not generally available at crucial times,      such as periods of scarcity when wholesale electric prices      are being driven up very quickly. There is simply no      centralized, reliable source of information, particularly for      electric system operators. Moreover, the brokers who are the      sources of information--on bid prices, for instance--may well      have an interest in skewing it. Overall, a number of      information and management weaknesses exist, including      inadequate market forecasting tools, a lack of monitoring      instruments and little real-time information to respond to      market problems.       This legislation addresses the lack of timely information      that exists about the rates, terms and conditions under which      wholesale electricity is being offered. It is an essential      step in making this nation's defective electricity markets      more competitive and more pro-consumer.           Sincerely,                                               Travis B. Plunkett,                                             Legislative Director.
