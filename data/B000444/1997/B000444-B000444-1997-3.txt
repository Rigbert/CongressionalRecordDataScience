 President, I rise to offer some remarks on Drug Director Barry McCaffrey's decision to decertify the Defense Department's proposed antidrug budget for fiscal 1999.  At the outset, let me state that I support General McCaffrey's decision to request that the Defense Department increase its budget request by $140 million for the antidrug initiatives the General identifies: $24 million to boost antidrug task forces on the border to help implement the United States-Mexico Declaration signed by Presidents Clinton and Zedillo in May, 1997; $75 million for enfocement and interdiction to reduce the flow of cocaine out of the Andean Region; $30 million for boost National Guard drug efforts on the southern border; and $12 million to target drug trafficking criminal activity in the Caribbean.  Even beyond the specifics of this issue, I am greatly heartened by the fact that General McCaffrey has chosen to exercise this important budget-setting authority. I must admit that I have been frustrated that, until General McCaffrey acted, no drug director had ever used this authority--not William Bennett, not Robert Martinez, and not Lee Brown.  Let me also be up-front with my colleagues, one of the reasons I so strongly favor this decision is because I wrote this authority into law. For more than a decade, I debated with the Reagan administration and my colleagues to establish the Office of National Drug Control Policy. One of the reasons my legislation was so bitterly opposed for so long was because I put some real teeth into this legislation. And, of all the teeth, it is this budget authority which is the sharpest of all.  Let me also explain to my colleagues that this so-called Biden Drug Budget Authority not only gives the Drug Director the authority to decertify the drug budget requests of the drug agencies, but it is crystal clear what must happen next. Just read the law: If the Drug Director exercises this authority, ``the head of the Department or Agency shall comply with such a request.''  It does not get much clearer than that.  To make one more point--now before the Senate we have legislation to re-authorize the Drug Director's office. Yesterday, the Judiciary Committee reported the bipartisan Hatch-Biden reauthorization bill. A bill cosponsored by Senators Thurmond, Coverdell, DeWine and Feinstein.  It is my hope that not only will the full Senate pass this legislation before we adjourn, but also that the leadership of the House reject the unproductive and partisan approach it adopted a few weeks ago and come onboard the bipartisan Hatch-Biden bill.  Nothing puts the need for a Drug Director in starker focus than General McCaffrey's action on the Defense Department drug budget. My colleagues should need no other example--though there are many others--to recognize the importance of having a Drug Director.  I urge my colleagues to support the General's decision on the Defense Department budget, and I urge my colleagues to take the concrete step it is within our power to do--pass the law to keep the Drug Office in place.                          ____________________
