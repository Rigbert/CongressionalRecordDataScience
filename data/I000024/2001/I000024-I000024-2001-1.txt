I wanted to give another perspective on this issue.  I was elected in 1986, the same time Denny Hastert, now Speaker of the House, was elected. All I have heard from Denny Hastert and from my colleagues on the House side all these years was they wanted to have a third airport.  I have to admit I prefer the provisions of Senator Durbin's bill. On a freestanding bill, I am a cosponsor. I think it is a good idea. This also affects something no one has talked about, and that is Meigs Field. So I have some selfish reasons I would like to see that, but not on a Defense appropriations bill. I think it is the wrong place for it, and I will oppose it, even though I agree with the provisions of the bill.  I have talked to House Members since 1986, and as near as I can tell they are split down the middle, so there is no unanimity in the delegation that I can see.
