 Schumer) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:                              S. Res. 192       Whereas, in the case of State of Nevada v. Lacamera, Case      No. 19FN0945X, pending in the North Las Vegas Justice Court      in Nevada, the prosecution has requested the production of      testimony from Ariana Morales, an employee of the office of      Senator Catherine Cortez Masto;       Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the      Ethics in Government Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a)      and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may direct its counsel to      represent current and former Members and employees of the      Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request for      testimony relating to their official responsibilities;       Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United      States and Rule XI of the Standing Rules of the Senate, no      evidence under the control or in the possession of the Senate      may, by the judicial or administrative process, be taken from      such control or possession but by permission of the Senate;      and       Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or      in the possession of the Senate may promote the      administration of justice, the Senate will take such action      as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the      privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That Ariana Morales, an employee of the Office of      Senator Catherine Cortez Masto, and any other current or      former employee of the Senator's office from whom relevant      evidence may be necessary, are authorized to testify in the      case of State of Nevada v. Lacamera, except concerning      matters for which a privilege should be asserted.       Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to      represent Senator Cortez Masto and any current or former      employees of the Senator's office in connection with the      production of evidence authorized in section one of this      resolution.  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of myself and the distinguished Democratic leader, Mr. Schumer, I send to the desk a resolution authorizing the production of testimony and representation by the Senate Legal Counsel, and ask for its immediate consideration.  Mr. President, this resolution concerns a request for evidence in a criminal action pending in Nevada State court. In this action the defendant is charged with threatening or attempting to intimidate public officials in voicemails he left with the Las Vegas office of Senator Cortez Masto. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for May 8, 2019.  The prosecution is seeking testimony from one of the Senator's staff assistants who listened to the voicemails at issue. Senator Cortez Masto would like to cooperate with this request by providing relevant employee testimony from her office.  The enclosed resolution would authorize that staffer, and any other current or former employee of the Senator's office from whom relevant testimony may be needed, to testify in this criminal action, with representation by the Senate Legal Counsel.                          ____________________
