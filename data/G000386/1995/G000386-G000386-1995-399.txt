 President, we have recently heard in the news quite a bit about AmeriCorps, and that is President Clinton's new program on voluntarism.  As many of my colleagues know, I spent several months investigating this whole matter, and I continue to review and will continue to review for a long time into the future the merits of AmeriCorps. There has been bipartisan criticism of this program and this concept of so-called voluntarism.  This administration seems to have learned nothing from its recent efforts to force a top-down solution to programs, for instance, like health care. The American people rejected at the ballot box last November a bureaucratic solution that the administration had for health care reform.  Now the administration believes the answer to voluntarism is to have it driven from the top down. They want to bureaucratize voluntarism. In health care reform, they wanted to make the choice for each citizen's health care. In this program, they want to make the moral choice for each volunteer, and they want to pay him for that.  That subverts the concept of voluntarism, in my view. It turns the notion of voluntarism on its head. Nevertheless, the administration wants to go forward despite the fact that 1.9 million Americans are already volunteering on their own and doing it without pay and they are doing it all over the United States because they are doing it by making their own moral choices within their own communities as they see the needs of those communities.  Mr. President, it is discouraging that the President has completely disregarded the findings of Vice President Gore's National Performance Review when it comes to the question of AmeriCorps or the expansion of the program. A founding principle of reinventing Government is that, according to Vice President Gore, you should not increase funding a program until it is a proven success. This administration has sought dramatic increases for AmeriCorps with little to no support the proposition whether or not it is succeeding.  The problem with AmeriCorps is the same problem that I see in the boondoggles of the Defense Department. As you remember, a decade ago, $500 hammers got a lot of attention, the $500 hammers that the Defense Department was buying.  In AmeriCorps, we recently uncovered that President Clinton's AmeriCorps is paying over $70,000 for one--yes, Mr. President, that is one--volunteer for AmeriCorps. That $70,000 could instead be used to provide dozens of young people Pell grants so that they could attend college. This point was made on this very floor 2 years ago by the then chairman of the Appropriations Committee, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, and that was when we were considering authorizing AmeriCorps at that particular time.  Instead, we are spending this money on creating one job with the Philadelphia Bar Association. That $70,000 job in Philadelphia is, unfortunately, not an anomaly. AmeriCorps has already provided me with many, many grants where the costs will be over $40,000 per year per job.  I am very pleased to announce to my colleagues today that the General Accounting Office has agreed to my request made in behalf of myself and Senator Mikulski to initiate an investigation into the actual costs of AmeriCorps. I am confident that the GAO investigation into AmeriCorps will help us all be better informed about the tremendous costs of this program.  As I read reports on the President's remarks, he intends to draw a line in the sand on this program. He intends to use this program to delineate the two political parties. I welcome this challenge because I believe the American people just repudiated the approach exemplified by the AmeriCorps Program. Just as they did not want to have a top-down bureaucratic solution on health care reform, they cannot fathom the same approach to voluntarism.  The American people do not want Government to make their moral choices for them. They do not want Government telling them for whom they should and should not volunteer, and they certainly can see through the rather thinly veiled attempt to subvert voluntarism by paying for it rather than using moral suasion.  Mr. President, I have received much data already from AmeriCorps pertaining to their grants. That data only further fuels my skepticism. I have also asked the General Accounting Office to independently analyze and evaluate the program. I will await their report this spring until I render a final judgment about the program.  But I must say, the celestial bodies seem to be aligned against the program, and the American people are against the approach embodied here. The administration would do better to more accurately apply the principles of reinventing Government to this concept. Rather than bureaucratizing and rather than drawing a line in the sand, we can be working together to make voluntarism work the way it has--and quite effectively and quite amazingly--since the earliest days of the Republic.  I yield the floor and yield back the remainder of my time.                          ____________________
