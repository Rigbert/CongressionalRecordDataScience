 President, on another matter, this week the Senate is in the midst of processing six--six--well qualified nominees for the Federal bench. We have voted to invoke cloture on the nomination of Judge Kurt Engelhardt, and today we will vote to confirm him.  Given his impressive qualifications, Judge Engelhardt's arrival on the bench will not come a moment too soon. Lawyers have described him as ``a wonderful judge'' with ``excellent legal ability'' who is ``very thoughtful and analytical.'' One said: ``[H]e would be great on the Fifth Circuit.''  After Judge Engelhardt, we will vote to advance the nomination of Michael Brennan of Wisconsin, another nominee who has earned the ABA's highest rating of unanimously--unanimously--``well qualified.'' Each nominee on the slate has been vetted by the Judiciary Committee, and each stands ready to serve as a diligent caretaker of the rule of law. Considering and confirming judicial nominations is one of the most important functions of the Senate. We will keep taking care of the people's business.                          ____________________
