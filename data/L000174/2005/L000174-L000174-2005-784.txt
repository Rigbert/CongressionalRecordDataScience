President, I believe you will find similar support for each of the other programs under this umbrella.  I challenge each Member to go back to their State and find one community that has not reaped the benefits of a CDBG investment. I challenge each member to visit with their local community action groups and hear how they use the Community Services Block Grant to support the neediest in their communities. These programs fill a real need and have proven results. A cut of $2 billion in Federal funds will result in the loss of at least $18 billion in matching funds from local and State governments and nonprofit and private sector investments. I fail to see the wisdom in dismantling programs that are so vital to our communities.  Our amendment would restore nearly $2 billion for community and economic development programs and urges the Senate to retain the administration of these programs at their current agencies. We fully pay for the increase in funds by closing egregious tax loop holes that over 90 Members of this Chamber has already gone on record in support of closing.  I encourage my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment and express their support for these important programs.
