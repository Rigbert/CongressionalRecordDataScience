Speaker, assuming on Tuesday or Wednesday we pass the Transportation-Treasury bill, that will leave only the VA-HUD bill pending from the Committee on Appropriations from the House perspective. Can the gentleman advise us whether or not the VA-HUD bill may be coming to the floor next week? It was not mentioned for next week, but the week following?
