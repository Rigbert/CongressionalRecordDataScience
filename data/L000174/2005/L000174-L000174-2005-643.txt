When we talk about votes, 40 is the threshold on filibusters. Of course, the Senate sets the rules. The Senate could say: You require 95 votes. Or it could say: You require 2 votes. There is nothing magic about 50, 40, 60, or anything else. But be that as it may, I would ask, through the Chair, whether the Senator from Nevada is aware of numerous instances in which Democrats have proceeded to debate and vote on the President's nominees against which there were more than 40 negative votes--I can think of three significant judicial nominations where there were 41 Democratic votes against allowing them to go forward: Timothy Tymkovich was confirmed to the Eighth Circuit although 41 Senators voted against him; Jeffrey Sutton was confirmed to the Sixth Circuit although 41 Senators voted against him; J. Leon Holmes was confirmed to the district court in Arkansas although 46 Senators from both parties voted against him. In addition, Senate Democrats proceeded to debate and vote on the controversial nomination of former Attorney General Ashcroft, who was confirmed although 42 Senators voted against his confirmation; Ted Olson, who was confirmed to be Solicitor General although 47 Senators voted against his confirmation; Victor Wolski, who was confirmed to the Court of Claims although 43 Senators voted against his confirmation.  Most recently, a number of us voted for cloture on the nomination of Stephen Johnson to head the EPA. He was confirmed with only 61 votes in support. I was one of those who voted for cloture so we could go forward with the President's nomination.  Was the Senator from Nevada aware of all those?
