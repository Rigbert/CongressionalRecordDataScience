Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, in closing I would like to first thank the gentleman from Hawaii [Mr. Abercrombie], my good friend. We worked through this bill over the last year and had many occasions to go back and forth, but in the end I think we ended up with a good piece of legislation which is supported by most everyone here, and I certainly am appreciative of the time and effort that both him and his staff have put into this, and I thank him and look forward to other legislation in the future; and also to the gentleman from California [Mr. Miller], the ranking member of the subcommittee, for all of his, and the overall committee, for all his help.  Mr. Speaker, this bill, in closing, will raise money for the Feds and the States. It certainly has bipartisan support in the House, the Senate and 14 Governors. It has the administration support from the White House; the Secretary of Interior, Bruce Babbit. It enacts clear and equitable reform, gives more power to the States. It establishes a certain statute of limitation period.  It is a good bill, and I urge its passage.
