 1283. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to regulate the commercial transportation of horses, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.  the humane methods of livestock slaughter act amendments act of 1995 Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last year I introduced legislation amending the Federal Humane Methods of Livestock Slaughter Act to regulate the commercial transportation of horses to slaughter facilities. After considerable discussion and much mail on this important issue, I have made several modifications to the original bill. Today, I am introducing legislation that will provide greater oversight and integrity concerning the commercial transportation of horses to slaughter facilities.  I am pleased that my bill is supported by the American Horse Council, and the American Horse Protection Association. Other organizations that support this legislation include the American Association of Equine Practitioners, the American Humane Association, the American Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the Humane Society of the United States.  Currently, some horses are being transported for long periods in overcrowded conditions without rest, food, or water. Some vehicles used for transport have inadequate headroom and are not intended to transport large animals. Further, some of the horses transported have serious injuries which can be severely aggravated by the journey. This legislation would give the Secretary of Agriculture the authority to correct these practices by regulating those in the business of transporting horses to processing facilities.  I want to make it clear that it is not my intention to either promote or prevent the commercial slaughter of horses. This industry has been in existence for a long time in this country, and I expect that it will continue to operate long into the future. My purpose in this legislation is to protect horses from unduly harsh and unpleasant treatment as they are transported across the country.  Horses occupy a central role in the traditions, history, and economy of Kentucky. Thousands of Kentuckians are employed either directly or indirectly by the horse industry. Horses have been good to Kentucky; and we should try to the maximum practical extent to be good to horses.  This bill would require that horses be rested off the vehicle after 24 hours, with access to food and water. Vehicles used to transport the horses would have to have adequate headroom and interiors free of sharp edges. Transporting vehicles must be maintained in a sanitary condition, offer adequate ventilation and shelter from extremes of heat and cold, be large enough for the number of horses transported, and allow for the position of horses by size, with stallions segregated from other horses. Finally, in order to be transported, horses must be physically fit to travel.  Enforcement of the Act is placed with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which presently regulates the slaughter process itself under the Humane Methods of Slaughter Act. The Department would be authorized to work with State and local authorities to enforce the provisions of this bill. This bill, while correcting abuses that exist, will not be an excessive burden on the processing facilities, auctions, or the commercial transporters of these horses.  Unlike other livestock, the transportation of horses to processing facilities is often a lengthy process, because there are fewer facilities that handle horses and they are located in only a few areas. Moreover, not all of them operate on a full-time basis. The result is that the transporting of these animals requires special protection.  There are several States that have passed legislation to regulate the transportation of these horses, but most of the travel is interstate, across wide areas. This is why Federal legislation is needed. The shipment of horses over long distances in inappropriate trailers, without food or water, is unacceptable. This bill would extend Federal regulation to the commercial transport of horses to slaughter and assure the humane and safe conditions of that transport.  I invite all groups that are concerned about these horses to work with me in passing this legislation.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the bill was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1283       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1.
