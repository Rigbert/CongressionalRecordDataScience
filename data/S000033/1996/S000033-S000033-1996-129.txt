 Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  I would like to begin by thanking the gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Gekas] and the chairman of the full Committee on the Judiciary, the gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Hyde], for their assistance in ensuring this joint resolution was passed by the Committee on the Judiciary and placed on the Suspension Calendar in a timely manner. We very much appreciate their willingness to move this matter along so rapidly.  Mr. Speaker, passage of this legislation is very important to the residents of Guildhall, VT. The Vermont-New Hampshire public water supply compact is noncontroversial but it is essential. Passage will allow Guildhall to pay its debt to New Hampshire and will allow the village of Guildhall to update its water transmission lines and provide adequate water services--including fire protection--to its residents. Right now, only one fire hydrant serves the village of Guildhall, and more are needed.  Mr. Speaker, Vermonters take pride in meeting their environmental obligations and this will allow the town of Guildhall to meet requirements under the Clean Water Act. And, if this bill passes under suspension today, Guildhall can start upgrading its water transmission lines and provide improved fire protection on schedule. I urge immediate approval of this resolution.
