 President.  I very much disagree with the position of the Senator from Illinois. I understand this is something that is new. I understand it is something being tried. I understand it turns counter to a lot of what has been done in the educational establishment today. But that doesn't mean it shouldn't be tried.  I wish to correct one point. I asked the Mayor if he believed he got a Faustian bargain. He said no, he didn't. He said: As a matter of fact, I proposed the three-pronged asset portion of this. In other words, one-third of the money would be new money to the schools, one-third of the money would be new money to charter schools, and one-third of the money would be new money to try this special scholarship program for poor children.  I would like the Record to reflect the rationale for the language in my amendment on the testing. In order to guarantee a valid and statistically reliable evaluation, we are told it is vital that we have the scholarship student and those students who applied for the scholarship but didn't get it take the same test for all 5 years. If the District should switch tests at some point in the 5-year duration of the program, we need to continue giving the test to start with, which today in the District is the Stanford 9 test. That is a norm-referenced test which is given all over the country, and it would preserve the evaluation. The use of the same exact test for all 5 years is critical to be able to compare apples to apples. If the District changes tests during these 5 years, you have a false comparison; you have apples to oranges. That is the reason the language is as it is.
