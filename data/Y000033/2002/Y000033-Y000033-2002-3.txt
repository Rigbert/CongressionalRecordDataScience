Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to submit the accompanying Joint Explanatory Statement of the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002.  To expedite enactment of the significant pipeline safety reforms included in this bill, the leadership of the House Transportation and Infrastructure and Energy and Commerce Committees has worked with the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee in developing the bill. This Joint Explanatory Statement therefore represents the views of the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and the Energy and Commerce Committee, along with the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Committee.  This Joint Explanatory Statement will provide legislative history for interpreting this important pipeline safety legislation. JOINT EXPLANATORY STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE DON YOUNG, THE HONORABLE   JAMES L. OBERSTAR, THE HONORABLE W.J. (BILLY) TAUZIN, THE HONORABLE  JOHN D. DINGELL AND THE HONORABLE ERNEST HOLLINGS THE HONORABLE JOHN                                  MCCAIN                           November 14, 2002 SECTION-BY-SECTION ANALYSIS OF H.R. 3609 PIPELINE SAFETY IMPROVEMENT                               ACT OF 2002     Section 1. Short title; amendment of title 49, United States          Code.       This section designates the act as the ``Pipeline Safety      Improvement Act of 2002.''     Section 2. One-call notification programs.       This section requires that state one-call notification      programs provide for the participation of government      operators and contact excavators. Section 2 also requires      that state one-call notification programs document enumerated      items set forth in the statute. Additionally, the requirement      that the Secretary of Transportation include certain      information in reports submitted under section 60124 of Title      49 is made permanent. Authorizations for appropriations for      grants to states for fiscal years 2003 through 2006 are      provided at $1,000,000 per year, and grants for      administration in section 6107(b) are updated for fiscal      years 2003 through 2006. This section also amends section      6105 of Title 49 by requiring the Secretary of Transportation      to encourage the states, operators of one-cell notification      programs, operators of underground facilities, and excavators      (including government and contract excavators) to use the      practices set forth in the best practices report entitled      ``Common Ground,'' as periodically updated, and requires the      Secretary of Transportation to provide technical assistance      to a non-profit organization specifically established for the      purpose of reducing construction-related damage to      underground facilities. Authorizations for appropriations for      fiscal years 2003 through 2006 are provided at $500,000 per      year, but would not be derived from user fees collected under      section 60301 of title 49.     Section 3. One-call notification of pipeline operators.       This section provides for the enforcement of one-call      notification programs by a state authority if the state's      program meets the requirements set forth in the statute. The      application of the term ``person'' who intends to engage in      an activity necessitating the use of the one-call system is      expanded to include government employees or contractors.       This section amends section 60123(d) of Title 49 by      rearranging the phrase ``knowingly and willfully'' to address      the problem raised when a court interpreted existing law to      require a knowing and willful standard to, not only engaging      in an excavation activity, but also to subsequently damaging      a pipeline facility. The consequence of the court's      interpretation makes prosecutions more difficult by requiring      the government to show the defendant knew subsequent damages      would result from excavation activity and that the      defendant's conduct was willful. This section of the bill      corrects the court's interpretation by now requiring that the      ``knowingly and willfully'' standard apply only to engaging      in an excavation activity.       This section also provides that penalties under the      criminal penalties section can be reduced if the violator      promptly reports a violation.     Section 4. State oversight role.       This section amends section 60106 of Title 49 to allow the      Secretary of Transportation to make an agreement with a state      authority authorizing the state authority to participate in      the oversight of interestate pipeline transportation      including incident investigation, new construction, and      other inspection and investigatory duties. However the      Secretary shall not delegate the enforcement of safety      standards for interstate pipeline facilities to a state      authority. This section further provides that the      Secretary may terminate agreements with the State      authorities if a gap results in the State authority's      oversight responsibilities of intrastate pipeline      transportation, the State authority fails to meet      requirements set forth in this section, or continued      participation in the oversight of interstate pipeline      transportation would not promote pipeline safety. Existing      state agreements shall continue until a new agreement      between the state and the DOT is executed or December 31,      2003, whichever is sooner.     Section 5. Public education programs.       Section 5 amends section 60116 of Title 49 to include      hazardous liquid pipeline facilities in this section      requiring a continuing program to educate the public on the      use of one-call notification systems, the possible hazards      associated with unintended releases, and how to tell if an      unintended release occurred, what steps should be taken for      public safety in the event of a pipeline release, and how to      report such an event. This section also requires owners and      operators to review existing public education programs for      effectiveness and to modify their programs as necessary. In      addition, the section allows the Secretary to issue standards      prescribing the elements of public education programs and      develop materials for use in such programs.       Previous versions of Senate-passed pipeline safety      legislation also included a provision calling for the      coordination of emergency preparedness between operators of      pipeline facilities and state and local officials, as well as      to provide for public access to certain safety information.      Agreement was not reached on how safety information could be      accessed by the public in a manner that would protect      security-sensitive information from distribution. The      managers agreed that this issue would be better dealt with in      the context of the pending homeland security legislation.     Section 6. Protection of employees providing pipeline safety          information.       This section adds provisions for the protection of      employees who are discharged or otherwise discriminated      against with respect to compensation, terms, conditions, or      privileges of employment for (1) providing information to the      Federal government about alleged violations of Federal law      relating to pipeline safety; (2) refusing to participate in      any practice made illegal by Federal law relating to pipeline      safety; or (3) assisting or participating in any proceeding      to carry out the purposes of pipeline safety legislation.      This section establishes the procedural framework in which      complaints are handled by the Secretary of Labor and the      remedies available to the prevailing party.       This section contains a provision that essentially says if      a preliminary order provides that an employee must be allowed      to return to work, the filing of any objection by the      employer ``shall not operate to stay any reinstatement remedy      contained in the preliminary order.'' The intention of this      language is to assure that the mere filing of an objection      would not work as an automatic stay, thus precluding an      employee from returning to work pending the outcome of the      matter. However, this language would not preclude an employer      from filing an independent motion for a stay if sufficient      grounds exist for the filing of such a motion.     Section 7. Safety orders.       Section 7 adds a paragraph to section 60117 of Title 49 to      give the Secretary of Transportation authority to order an      operator of a facility to take corrective action if the      Secretary decides that a potential safety-related condition      exists. The office of Pipeline Safety (OPS) requested this      provision so that corrective action could be taken      immediately rather than waiting until a facility is      classified as ``hazardous'' prior to requiring corrective      action.     Section 8. Penalties.       This section modifies the existing penalties provisions set      forth in section 60112 of Title 49 to allow the Secretary of      Transportation to decide if the operation of a pipeline      facility, is ``or would be'' hazardous to life, property, or      the environment. The purpose of the modification is to give      the Secretary authority to take action prior to the facility,      the construction of the facility, or any component of the      facility actually becoming hazardous, thereby establishing a      framework of preventative actions, rather than actions only      in response to an imminent hazard.       In subsection (a)(1) of section 60122, the amounts of the      penalties have been increased. The per day, per incident,      amount has been increased from $25,000 to $100,000. The      maximum civil penalty for a related series of violations has      been increased from $500,000 to $1,000,000. The section of      the bill also provides that, in determining the amount of a      civil penalty, the Secretary of Transportation shall consider      as an additional consideration in section 60122(b) of Title      49, the adverse impact on the environment. The Secretary of      Transportation may     consider the economic benefit gained from the violation      without reduction because of subsequent damages.       This section also modifies the enforcement section of the      statute (section 60120(a)(1) of Title 49) by specifically      providing that the court may award appropriate relief,      including a temporary or permanent injunction, punitive      damages, and the assessment of civil penalties. The current      statutory language specifying that the Attorney General      may proceed only at the request of the Secretary of      Transportation remains in effect.       Section 8 also requires that the Comptroller General      conduct a study of the actions, policies, and procedures of      the Secretary of Transportation for assessing and collecting      fines and penalties.     Section 9. Pipeline safety information grants to communities.       Section 9 requires the Secretary of Transportation to make      grants for technical assistance to local communities and      groups of individuals (not including for-profit entities)      relating to the safety of pipelines in local communities. The      purpose of this provision is to provide grants to communities      for technical assistance such as engineering or scientific      analysis of pipeline safety issues. Applicants must compete      for the grants in a procedure established by the Secretary of      Transportation, who shall also establish the criteria for the      recipients. Additionally, the Secretary must establish      procedures to ensure that the funds have been properly      accounted for and spent in a manner consistent with the      purpose of the grants. Any one-grant recipient may not      receive more than $50,000. The grant funds cannot be used for      lobbying or in direct support of litigation. This section      authorizes the appropriation of $1,000,000 for each of the      fiscal years 2003 through 2006.     Section 10. Operator assistance in investigations.       This section requires the operator of a pipeline facility      to make available information and records to the Secretary of      Transportation or the National Safety Transportation Board      (NTSB) in the event of an accident, subject to constitutional      protections for operators and employees. Actions taken by an      operator pursuant to this section shall be in accordance with      the terms and conditions of any applicable collective      bargaining agreement.     Section 11. Population encroachment and rights-of-way.       This section requires the Secretary of Transportation,      along with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)      and other federal agencies and state and local governments,      to study land use practices and zoning ordinances, as well as      the preservation of environmental resources, with regard to      pipeline rights-of-way. Based upon the purposes set forth in      this section, a report is to be written that identifies      successful practices, ordinances, and laws addressing      population encroachment on pipeline rights-of-way, being      mindful of protecting the public safety, pipeline workers,      and the environment. The report must be completed within one      year from the date of enactment and provided to Congress,      appropriate federal agencies, and the States for further      distribution to the appropriate local authorities.     Section 12. Pipeline integrity, safety, and reliability          research and development.       This section requires the heads of the participating      agencies to carry out a program of research, development,      demonstration, and standardization to ensure the integrity of      pipelines. The Secretary of Energy, Secretary of      Transportation, and the Director of the National Institute of      Standards and Technology (NIST) each have defined roles. The      Secretary of Transportation, in coordination with the      Secretary of Energy and the Director of the National      Institute of Standards and Technology, shall prepare and      submit to Congress a 5-year plan to guide the activities      under this section. The plan shall also be submitted to the      Technical Pipeline Safety Standards Committee and the      Technical Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Standards      Committee for review. The section authorizes appropriations      for the fiscal years 2003 through 2006 in the following      amounts: Secretary of Energy: $10,000,000; the Secretary of      Transportation: $10,000,000; and the National Institute of      Standards and Technology: $5,000,000. Any sums authorized      pursuant to this section shall not be derived from user fees.      In addition $3,000,000 from the Oil Spill Liability Trust      Fund shall be transferred to the Secretary of Transportation,      as provided in appropriations Acts, to carry out programs for      detection, prevention, and mitigation of oil spills for each      of the fiscal years 2003 through 2006.       Even though the Secretary of Transportation does not      regulate gathering lines, the participating agencies are      encouraged to include such lines in their research,      development, demonstration, and standardization efforts on      the integrity of gathering lines.     Section 13. Pipeline qualification programs.       This section requires the Secretary of Transportation to      require operators of pipeline facilities to develop      qualification programs for their personnel who perform      covered tasks (as defined in the Code of Federal      Regulations). This section also requires the Secretary to      have in place standards and criteria for such qualification      programs, including a method for examining or testing the      qualifications of individuals who perform covered tasks. Such      method may include written examination, oral examination, on-     the-job training, simulations, observation during on-the-job      performance, and other forms of assessment. The method may      not be limited to observation of on-the-job performance,      except with respect to tasks where the Secretary has      determined specifically that such observation is the best      method of examining or testing qualifications. Further, the      Secretary must ensure that the results of any such on-the-job      performance observations are documented in writing. The      Secretary may waive or modify requirements if not      inconsistent with pipeline safety. The Secretary is required      to verify each operator's qualification program, including      modifications to previously verified programs. In the event      the Secretary fails to establish standards and criteria as      set forth in this section, pipeline facility operators are      required to develop and implement qualification programs      based on the requirements of this section. The Secretary      is required to report to Congress within 5 years on the      status and results of personnel qualification regulations.      A pilot program is established for the certification of      individuals who operate computer-based systems for      controlling the operations of pipelines. The pilot program      seeks the participation of 3 pipeline facilities.     Section 14. Risk analysis and integrity management programs          for gas pipelines.       This section requires operators of pipeline facilities      subject to section 60109 of Title 49 to adopt and implement a      written integrity management program to reduce risks to each      facility. Within 12 months of the enactment of the bill, this      section requires the Secretary of Transportation to prescribe      standards to direct each operator's conduct of a risk      analysis and adoption and implementation of an integrity      management program, which must occur within 24 months from      the enactment of the section. Minimum requirements are set      forth in this section for integrity management programs and      for the rule regulating the same, which include a baseline      integrity assessment of each of an operator's facilities      which must be completed within 10 years after the enactment      of the section (at least 50 percent of such facilities shall      be assessed no later than 5 years after the date of enactment      of this section), and a reassessment of each facility at a      minimum of once every 7 years, with prioritization being      based on all relevant risk factors, including any previously      discovered defects or anomalies and any history of leaks,      repairs, or failures.       The Secretary of Transportation is required to issue a rule      on integrity management programs, and each operator of a      pipeline facility subject to section 60109 of Title 49 is      required to adopt and implement an integrity management      program, even if the Secretary does not issue a rule. This      section does not apply to natural gas distribution lines      because section 60109 of Title 49 does not, nor was it      intended to, apply to natural gas distribution lines.       Section 14 authorizes the Secretary of Transportation to      grant waivers and modifications pursuant to section 60118(c)      of Title 49 for any requirement for reassessment of a      facility for reasons that may include the need to maintain      local product supply or the lack of internal inspection      devices. The waivers or modifications shall not be      inconsistent with pipelines safety.       This section also requires that the Comptroller General      conduct a study to evaluate the 7-year reassessment interval      required by this section. The study is to be completed and      transmitted to Congress no later than 4 years from the date      of enactment.       In this section, each operator of a gas pipeline facility      is required to conduct a risk analysis for facilities located      in high consequence areas and to adopt and implement an      integrity management program for each such facility to reduce      associated risks. This section requires each operator to      prioritize facilities for integrity assessment based on all      risk factors, including any history of leaks, repairs, or      failures, and directs the operator to give priority to      facilities with the highest risks.       The Department of Transportation's Research and Special      Programs Administration (RSPA) issued a final rule defining      ``high consequence areas'' on August 6, 2002. The managers      strongly support RSPA's regulation defining high consequence      areas, although recognize that the definition could be      subject to alteration by future regulatory action by RSPA.       Pipeline safety regulations have long required gas      operators to survey and patrol along their pipeline rights-     of-way to classify areas of population. The new definition of      high consequence areas builds on the existing classification      of areas where the potential consequences of a gas pipeline      accident may be significant or may do considerable harm to      people and their property, and includes current class 3 and 4      locations, facilities with persons who are mobility impaired,      confined, or hard to evacuate, and places where people gather      for recreational and other purposes.       In the July 2002 Technical Pipeline Safety Standards      Committee meeting to consider the proposed definition, RSPA      made clear its intent to include in its definition known      areas where people gather, such as the Pecos River pipeline      crossing near Carlsbad, New Mexico, which was commonly used      by campers and fishermen and was the location of a pipeline      rupture in August 2000 that resulted in 12 fatalities. The      managers support is expressed for this new definition of high      consequence areas and expect RSPA to further     clarify the application of the definition in the substantive      rule to be issued on integrity management programs.     Section 15. National Pipeline Mapping System.       Section 15 requires operators of pipeline facilities,      except distribution lines and gathering lines, to provide to      the Secretary of Transportation geospatial data appropriate      for use in the National Mapping System, the name and address      of the person with primary operational control, and a means      for a member for the public to contact the operator for      additional information about the facilities. There is a      requirement to update the information as necessary.     Section 16. Coordination of environmental reviews.       Section 16 requires the President to establish an      interagency committee for the purpose of developing and      ensuring the implementation of a coordinated environmental      review and permitting process in order for pipeline operators      to complete all activities necessary to carry out pipeline      repairs within any time periods specified by rule by the      Secretary of Transportation.       The chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality shall      chair the Interagency Committee, which shall consist of      representatives of Federal agencies with responsibilities      relating to pipeline repair projects. The Interagency      Committee shall evaluate Federal permitting requirements and      shall examine the access, excavation, and restoration      practices of the pipeline industry for the purpose of      developing a compendium of best practices used by the      industry to access, excavate, and restore the site of a      pipeline repair. Based upon the evaluation conducted, the      members of the Interagency Committee shall enter into, by      unanimous consent, a memorandum of understanding to provide      for the coordinated and expedited pipeline repair permit      review process so that pipeline operators may commence and      complete pipeline repairs within any time periods imposed on      the repair projects by rules promulgated by the Secretary of      Transportation. Each agency represented on the Interagency      Committee is required to revise its regulations to implement      the provisions of the memorandum of understanding.       This section also provides for the implementation of      alternative mitigation measures to be used by operators of      pipeline facilities until all applicable permits have been      granted. To the extent necessary, the Secretary of      Transportation is required to revise the regulations of the      Department to accommodate such implementation. However, such      revisions shall not allow an operator of a pipeline facility      to implement alternate mitigation measures unless to do so      would be consistent with the protection of human health,      public safety, and the environment; the operator has applied      for and is diligently and in good faith pursuing all required      Federal, state, and local permits necessary to carry out the      repair project; and is compatible with pipeline safety.       The Secretary of Transportation is required to designate an      ombudsman to assist in expediting pipeline repairs and      resolving disagreements between Federal, state, and local      permitting agencies and the operator of a pipeline facility.      The actions of the ombudsman must be consistent with the      protection of human health, public safety, and the      environment.       The Secretary of Transportation is required to encourage      states and local governments to consolidate their respective      permitting processes for pipeline repair projects that are      subject to any time periods for repairs specified by rule by      the Secretary of Transportation.     Section 17. Nationwide toll-free number system.       Section 17 requires the Secretary of Transportation to work      in conjunction with the Federal Communications Commission      (FCC), facility operators, excavators, and one-call      notification system operators for the establishment of a      nationwide toll-free 3-digit telephone number system to be      used by state one-call notification systems.     Section 18. Implementation of Inspector General          recommendations.       Section 18 requires the Secretary of Transportation to      respond to each of the recommendations of the Department of      Transportation Inspector General contained in RT-2000-069      every 90 days and to submit the responses to the appropriate      committees of Congress.     Section 19. NTSB safety recommendations.       Section 19 requires RSPA and OPS to respond to      recommendations received from the NTSB within 90 days from      receipt of such recommendations. Such responses shall state      the intentions of the OPS with respect to the recommendations      and shall state the timetable for completing the procedures      and reasons for refusals to do so. The responses shall be      made available to the public. The OPS is required to submit      an annual report describing each recommendation received and      the OPS response to each recommendation for the previous      year.     Section 20. Miscellaneous amendments.       Section 20 amends section 60102(a) of Title 49 by adding      language expressing that the purpose of the chapter is to      provide adequate protection against risks to life and      property posed by pipeline transportation pipeline facilities      by improving the regulatory and enforcement authority of the      Secretary of Transportation.       This section also modifies the qualifications of the      individuals selected to serve on the Technical Safety      Standards Committees pursuant to section 60115 of Title 49 so      that none of the individuals selected for committee      membership from the general public ``may have a significant      financial interest in the pipeline, petroleum, or gas      industry.'' The intent of this provision is to prevent      industry employees and individuals with a sizable stake in      the pipeline industry from serving as representatives from      the general public, not prevent service from individuals who      have pipeline, petroleum, or gas industry stock interests in      their retirement plans.     Section 21. Technical amendments.       Section 21 makes technical amendments to correct previous      drafting errors in the existing legislation.     Section 22. Authorization of appropriations.       Section 22 authorizes appropriations for the Department of      Transportation and state grants for safety programs for the      fiscal years 2003 through 2006.     Section 23. Inspections by direct assessment.       Section 23 requires the Secretary of Transportation to      issue regulations prescribing standards for inspections of a      pipeline facility by direct assessment.     Section 24. State pipeline safety advisory committees.       Section 24 requires the Secretary of Transportation to      respond within 90 days after receiving recommendations from      advisory committees appointed by the Governor of any state.     Section 25. Pipeline bridge risk study.       Section 25 requires the Secretary of Transportation to      conduct a study to determine whether cable-suspension      pipeline bridges pose structural or other risks. The      Secretary may only use funds specifically appropriated to      carry this section.     Section 26. Study and Report on Natural Gas Pipeline and          Storage Facilities in New England.       Section 26 requires the Federal Energy Regulatory      Commission, in consultation with the Department of Energy, to      conduct a study on the natural gas pipeline transmission      network in New England and natural gas storage facilities      associated with that network and report back to the relevant      House and Senate Committees within a year of the date of      enactment.                              {time}  0250    Taken From the Speaker's Table and Concurred in Senate Amendment  H.R. 5469, to amend title 17, United States Code, with respect to the statutory license for webcasting, and for other purposes.       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Small Webcaster Settlement      Act of 2002''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.       Congress finds the following:       (1) Some small webcasters who did not participate in the      copyright arbitration royalty panel proceeding leading to the      July 8, 2002 order of the Librarian of Congress establishing      rates and terms for certain digital performances and      ephemeral reproductions of sound recordings, as provided in      part 261 of the Code of Federal Regulations (published in the      Federal Register on July 8, 2002) (referred to in this      section as ``small webcasters''), have expressed reservations      about the fee structure set forth in such order, and have      expressed their desire for a fee based on a percentage of      revenue.       (2) Congress has strongly encouraged representatives of      copyright owners of sound recordings and representatives of      the small webcasters to engage in negotiations to arrive at      an agreement that would include a fee based on a percentage      of revenue.       (3) The representatives have arrived at an agreement that      they can accept in the extraordinary and unique circumstances      here presented, specifically as to the small webcasters,      their belief in their inability to pay the fees due pursuant      to the July 8 order, and as to the copyright owners of sound      recordings and performers, the strong encouragement of      Congress to reach an accommodation with the small webcasters      on an expedited basis.       (4) The representatives have indicated that they do not      believe the agreement provides for or in any way approximates      fair or reasonable royalty rates and terms, or rates and      terms that would have been negotiated in the marketplace      between a willing buyer and a willing seller.       (5) Congress has made no determination as to whether the      agreement provides for or in any way approximates fair or      reasonable fees and terms, or rates and terms that would have      been negotiated in the marketplace between a willing buyer      and a willing seller.       (6) Congress likewise has made no determination as to      whether the July 8 order is reasonable or arbitrary, and      nothing in this Act shall be taken into account by the United      States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit      in its review of such order.       (7) It is, nevertheless, in the public interest for the      parties to be able to enter into such an agreement without      fear of liability for deviating from the fees and terms of      the July 8 order, if it is clear that the agreement will not      be admissible as evidence or otherwise taken into account in      any government proceeding involving the setting or adjustment      of the royalties payable to copyright owners of sound      recordings for the public performance or reproduction in      ephemeral phonorecords or copies of such works, the      determination of terms or conditions related thereto,     or the establishment of notice or recordkeeping requirements.     SEC. 3. SUSPENSION OF CERTAIN PAYMENTS.       (a) Noncommercial Webcasters.--       (1) In general.--The payments to be made by noncommercial      webcasters for the digital performance of sound recordings      under section 114 of title 17, United States Code, and the      making of ephemeral phonorecords under section 112 of title      17, United States Code, during the period beginning on      October 28, 1998, and ending on May 31, 2003, which have not      already been paid, shall not be due until June 20, 2003.       (2) Definition.--In this subsection, the term      ``noncommercial webcaster'' has the meaning given that term      in section 114(f)(5)(E)(i) of title 17, United States Code,      as added by section 4 of this Act.       (b) Small Commercial Webcasters.--       (1) In general.--The receiving agent may, in a writing      signed by an authorized representative thereof, delay the      obligation of any 1 or more small commercial webcasters to      make payments pursuant to sections 112 and 114 of title 17,      United States Code, for a period determined by such entity to      allow negotiations as permitted in section 4 of this Act,      except that any such period shall end no later than December      15, 2002. The duration and terms of any such delay shall be      as set forth in such writing.       (2) Definitions.--In this subsection--       (A) the term ``webcaster'' has the meaning given that term      in section 114(f)(5)(E)(iii) of title 17, United States Code,      as added by section 4 of this Act; and       (B) the term ``receiving agent'' shall have the meaning      given that term in section 261.2 of title 37, Code of Federal      Regulations, as published in the Federal Register on July 8,      2002.     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION FOR SETTLEMENTS.       Section 114(f) of title 17, United States Code, is amended      by adding after paragraph (4) the following:       ``(5)(A) Notwithstanding section 112(e) and the other      provisions of this subsection, the receiving agent may enter      into agreements for the reproduction and performance of sound      recordings under section 112(e) and this section by any 1 or      more small commercial webcasters or noncommercial webcasters      during the period beginning on October 28, 1998, and ending      on December 31, 2004, that, once published in the Federal      Register pursuant to subparagraph (B), shall be binding on      all copyright owners of sound recordings and other persons      entitled to payment under this section, in lieu of any      determination by a copyright arbitration royalty panel or      decision by the Librarian of Congress. Any such agreement for      small commercial webcasters shall include provisions for      payment of royalties on the basis of a percentage of revenue      or expenses, or both, and include a minimum fee. Any such      agreement may include other terms and conditions, including      requirements by which copyright owners may receive notice of      the use of their sound recordings and under which records of      such use shall be kept and made available by small commercial      webcasters or noncommercial webcasters. The receiving agent      shall be under no obligation to negotiate any such agreement.      The receiving agent shall have no obligation to any copyright      owner of sound recordings or any other person entitled to      payment under this section in negotiating any such agreement,      and no liability to any copyright owner of sound recordings      or any other person entitled to payment under this section      for having entered into such agreement.       ``(B) The Copyright Office shall cause to be published in      the Federal Register any agreement entered into pursuant to      subparagraph (A). Such publication shall include a statement      containing the substance of subparagraph (C). Such agreements      shall not be included in the Code of Federal Regulations.      Thereafter, the terms of such agreement shall be available,      as an option, to any small commercial webcaster or      noncommercial webcaster meeting the eligibility conditions of      such agreement.       ``(C) Neither subparagraph (A) nor any provisions of any      agreement entered into pursuant to subparagraph (A),      including any rate structure, fees, terms, conditions, or      notice and recordkeeping requirements set forth therein,      shall be admissible as evidence or otherwise taken into      account in any administrative, judicial, or other government      proceeding involving the setting or adjustment of the      royalties payable for the public performance or reproduction      in ephemeral phonorecords or copies of sound recordings, the      determination of terms or conditions related thereto, or the      establishment of notice or recordkeeping requirements by the      Librarian of Congress under paragraph (4) or section      112(e)(4). It is the intent of Congress that any royalty      rates, rate structure, definitions, terms, conditions, or      notice and recordkeeping requirements, included in such      agreements shall be considered as a compromise motivated by      the unique business, economic and political circumstances of      small webcasters, copyright owners, and performers rather      than as matters that would have been negotiated in the      marketplace between a willing buyer and a willing seller, or      otherwise meet the objectives set forth in section 801(b).       ``(D) Nothing in the Small Webcaster Settlement Act of 2002      or any agreement entered into pursuant to subparagraph (A)      shall be taken into account by the United States Court of      Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in its review of      the determination by the Librarian of Congress of July 8,      2002, of rates and terms for the digital performance of sound      recordings and ephemeral recordings, pursuant to sections 112      and 114.       ``(E) As used in this paragraph--       ``(i) the term `noncommercial webcaster' means a webcaster      that--       ``(I) is exempt from taxation under section 501 of the      Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. 501);       ``(II) has applied in good faith to the Internal Revenue      Service for exemption from taxation under section 501 of the      Internal Revenue Code and has a commercially reasonable      expectation that such exemption shall be granted; or       ``(III) is operated by a State or possession or any      governmental entity or subordinate thereof, or by the United      States or District of Columbia, for exclusively public      purposes;       ``(ii) the term `receiving agent' shall have the meaning      given that term in section 261.2 of title 37, Code of Federal      Regulations, as published in the Federal Register on July 8,      2002; and       ``(iii) the term `webcaster' means a person or entity that      has obtained a compulsory license under section 112 or 114      and the implementing regulations therefor to make eligible      nonsubscription transmissions and ephemeral recordings.       ``(F) The authority to make settlements pursuant to      subparagraph (A) shall expire December 15, 2002, except with      respect to noncommercial webcasters for whom the authority      shall expire May 31, 2003.''.     SEC. 5. DEDUCTIBILITY OF COSTS AND EXPENSES OF AGENTS AND                    DIRECT PAYMENT TO ARTISTS OF ROYALTIES FOR                    DIGITAL PERFORMANCES OF SOUND RECORDINGS.       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--       (1) in the case of royalty payments from the licensing of      digital transmissions of sound recordings under subsection      (f) of section 114 of title 17, United States Code, the      parties have voluntarily negotiated arrangements under which      payments shall be made directly to featured recording artists      and the administrators of the accounts provided in subsection      (g)(2) of that section;       (2) such voluntarily negotiated payment arrangements have      been codified in regulations issued by the Librarian of      Congress, currently found in section 261.4 of title 37, Code      of Federal Regulations, as published in the Federal Register      on July 8, 2002;       (3) other regulations issued by the Librarian of Congress      were inconsistent with the voluntarily negotiated      arrangements by such parties concerning the deductibility of      certain costs incurred for licensing and arbitration, and      Congress is therefore restoring those terms as originally      negotiated among the parties; and       (4) in light of the special circumstances described in this      subsection, the uncertainty created by the regulations issued      by the Librarian of Congress, and the fact that all of the      interested parties have reached agreement, the voluntarily      negotiated arrangements agreed to among the parties are being      codified.       (b) Deductibility.--Section 114(g) of title 17, United      States Code, is amended by adding after paragraph (2) the      following:       ``(3) A nonprofit agent designated to distribute receipts      from the licensing of transmissions in accordance with      subsection (f) may deduct from any of its receipts, prior to      the distribution of such receipts to any person or entity      entitled thereto other than copyright owners and performers      who have elected to receive royalties from another designated      agent and have notified such nonprofit agent in writing of      such election, the reasonable costs of such agent incurred      after November 1, 1995, in--       ``(A) the administration of the collection, distribution,      and calculation of the royalties;       ``(B) the settlement of disputes relating to the collection      and calculation of the royalties; and       ``(C) the licensing and enforcement of rights with respect      to the making of ephemeral recordings and performances      subject to licensing under section 112 and this section,      including those incurred in participating in negotiations or      arbitration proceedings under section 112 and this section,      except that all costs incurred relating to the section 112      ephemeral recordings right may only be deducted from the      royalties received pursuant to section 112.       ``(4) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), any designated agent      designated to distribute receipts from the licensing of      transmissions in accordance with subsection (f) may deduct      from any of its receipts, prior to the distribution of such      receipts, the reasonable costs identified in paragraph (3) of      such agent incurred after November 1, 1995, with respect to      such copyright owners and performers who have entered with      such agent a contractual relationship that specifies that      such costs may be deducted from such royalty receipts.''.       (c) Direct Payment to Artists.--Section 114(g)(2) of title      17, United States Code, is amended to read as follows:       ``(2) An agent designated to distribute receipts from the      licensing of transmissions in accordance with subsection (f)      shall distribute such receipts as follows:       ``(A) 50 percent of the receipts shall be paid to the      copyright owner of the exclusive right under section 106(6)      of this title to publicly perform a sound recording by means      of a digital audio transmission.       ``(B) 2\1/2\ percent of the receipts shall be deposited in      an escrow account managed by an independent administrator      jointly appointed by copyright owners of sound recordings and      the American Federation of Musicians (or any successor      entity) to be distributed to nonfeatured musicians (whether      or not members of the American Federation of Musicians) who      have performed on sound recordings.       ``(C) 2\1/2\ percent of the receipts shall be deposited in      an escrow account managed by an independent administrator      jointly appointed by copyright owners of sound recordings and      the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (or      any successor entity) to be distributed to nonfeatured      vocalists (whether or not members of the American Federation      of Television and Radio Artists) who have performed on sound      recordings.       ``(D) 45 percent of the receipts shall be paid, on a per      sound recording basis, to the recording     artist or artists featured on such sound recording (or the      persons conveying rights in the artists' performance in the      sound recordings).''.     SEC. 6. REPORT TO CONGRESS.       By not later than June 1, 2004, the Comptroller General of      the United States, in consultation with the Register of      Copyrights, shall conduct and submit to the Committee on the      Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee      on the Judiciary of the Senate a study concerning the      economic arrangements among small commercial webcasters      covered by agreements entered into pursuant to section      114(f)(5)(A) of title 17, United States Code, as added by      section 4 of this Act, and third parties, and the effect of      those arrangements on royalty fees payable on a percentage of      revenue or expense basis.
