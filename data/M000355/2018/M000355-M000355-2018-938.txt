 President, this week the Senate continues to confirm impressive nominees whom President Trump has asked to serve our country. We have confirmed two Assistant Secretaries to the Department of Education, Scott Stump and James Blew. We have confirmed a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, Randal Quarles. Now we will turn to the judiciary and consider nominees to the Fifth Circuit and Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.  First is Andrew Oldham of Texas, the President's choice for the Fifth Circuit. Mr. Oldham has impressed the legal community in his years of public service, most recently as general counsel to the Governor of Texas.  Mr. Oldham has degrees from the University of Virginia, Cambridge, and Harvard Law. He clerked on both the DC Circuit Court and the Supreme Court. He carries the highest possible rating from the American Bar Association, ``unanimously well-qualified.''  He comes highly recommended by peers and colleagues from across the political spectrum. Judith Zaffirini is a Texas State senator. She is a Democrat. She wrote the Judiciary Committee to support Mr. Oldham's nomination ``confidently, enthusiastically, and without reservation.'' She and the nominee have worked together on a number of important subjects. Through them all, she explains, ``Mr. Oldham reflected the ideal qualities of a judge . . . open-minded, fair . . . thoughtful and analytical.''  Lisa Blatt is a skilled litigator who argues frequently before the Supreme Court. She is also a Democrat. She wrote the committee too. Her letter describes Mr. Oldham as ``a great listener'' with ``a brilliant legal mind, [and] a wonderful sense of humor and collegiality.''  Her conclusion? He would ``make a superb judge.''  What about Mr. Oldham's own words? If confirmed, he explained to our colleagues during his hearing, he will ``uphold the rights of all litigants--big or little--equally, and apply the law to all fairly.''  He understands his responsibility, clearly. I look forward to confirming this nominee, and I urge each of our colleagues to join me.                            Economic Growth  Mr. President, on another matter, it has been a year and a half since Republican majorities took their seats in Congress and a Republican President was sworn in. In 2016, the American people made it clear it was time to try something new. They were tired of a so-called recovery that focused overwhelmingly on big, wealthy metropolitan areas. They had seen enough of tax hikes and top-down regulations that held their communities back. They turned to Republicans to deliver a pro-growth, pro-opportunity agenda to create better conditions for working families, job creators, and entrepreneurs to rise together.  Eighteen months later, the results could not be clearer. Today, more people say it is a good time to find a job than at almost any point since the turn of the millennium. U.S. manufacturers are more confident than ever about the future of their businesses.  Here is a story from yesterday's Financial Times: ``US retail sales rise for fifth straight month in June.'' This is a good sign for Americans all across the board. It shows our economy is healthy. It shows that families feel they have enough breathing room tomake purchases, which of course then benefit the companies and workers who produce what they are buying. Of course, it is especially good for the 42 million Americans whose jobs are supported by the retail industry.  According to industry data, more than 6 in 10 Americans work in retail at some point in their career, so this continued prosperity is really significant. There is little question that tax reform is to thank for a significant portion of this progress.  For one thing, our middle-class tax cuts are directly boosting families' discretionary income. As the Wall Street Journal reported this week, ``many households are experiencing less withholding from their paychecks thanks to the tax overhaul.''  Analysts also point to the business side of tax reform, which is letting more U.S. employers expand and hire. That means more jobs for American workers, which means more income for American families, which means more money in the cash registers of American small businesses. The virtuous cycle goes on.  The American people and most fair observers are marveling at what our economy is delivering to workers and middle-class families, but I am starting to think our Democratic colleagues may have forgotten what a successful economic agenda looks like because even in the face of headline after headline and testimony after testimony from job creators we represent, they try to brush off this impressive growth as nothing serious, and they advocate for repealing or undoing the Republican policies that are helping to make it happen.  Fortunately, Republicans know full well how to cut taxes, trim back regulations, and get Washington out of the American people's way. It is just what we have done. It is just what we will continue to do.                   Recognition of the Minority Leader
