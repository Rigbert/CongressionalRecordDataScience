 President, I want the Senator to have the last word, so I would ask that he have another 15 seconds to respond to what I am going to say.  Let's get this straight. This is an authorization. This is not an appropriation. I understand the Senator's concern. But we may need to, in terms of rationally ramping up the expenditures of this money without wasting the $48 billion, be spending $11 or $12 billion in the fifth year.  His concern is that becomes the baseline for the next 5 years. We are not authorizing for the next 5 years. We are authorizing for this 5 years. All we are doing is authorizing.  So I would strongly urge us to vote against this amendment.
