 1601,      legislation that would prohibit the use of somatic cell      nuclear transfer. . . . The legislation as drafted would have      the unintended effect of restricting critical legal      scientific research. The ability to create therapeutically      valuable stem cell lines from oocytes, therefore promoting      genetic reprogramming of cells to prevent and cure cancer      exemplifies the type of research that could be hindered with      overly restrictive regulations. The current language in S.      1601 could hamper or punish scientists who contribute to our      growing knowledge about cancer.''  The American Heart Association--I ask unanimous consent their letter be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:         American Heart Association, Office of Communications and            Advocacy,                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 1998.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: On Tuesday, February 10th, the      Senate is expected to initiate a cloture vote regarding a      motion to consider S. 1601, the Prohibition on Cloning of      Human Beings Act of 1998. The American Heart Association      urges you to vote against the cloture petition.       The American Heart Association wishes to make it clear that      we do not support any legislation allowing the cloning of a      human being. However, we fear that this legislation may place      biomedical research at risk and might negatively impact the      use of cloning techniques on human cells, genes and tissue      critical to identifying cures for a host of diseases,      including cardiovascular diseases. The American Heart      Association is concerned that a rush to passage of S. 1601      may inadvertently threaten to restrict critical biomedical      research, which promises to have great impact on disease      prevention and treatment for the American people.       For example, we are concerned that this legislation may      effectively ban research using the generation of stem cells      for treating heart attack victims, as well as blood vessel      endothelial cells for treating atherosclerosis.       The American Heart Association urges the Senate to engage      in a more deliberate debate on this important issue. Please      vote ``no'' on cloture for S. 1601 and allow a more extensive      debate on these complex issues.           Sincerely,                                        Martha N. Hill, RN, Ph.D.,                                                        President.
