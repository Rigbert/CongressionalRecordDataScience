Res. 225       Whereas child survival is a key element of global health      and is of utmost importance to the United States and all      countries of the world;       Whereas child survival must be addressed on a global scale;       Whereas increasing child survival rates is critical to      population growth in countries around the world;       Whereas child survival depends on access to key nutrients      that can avert millions of unnecessary deaths in third world      countries from preventable diseases;       Whereas 5 simple interventions, if delivered to children      before the age of 5, may significantly increase their chances      of survival;       Whereas these 5 interventions--vaccines, antibiotics,      Vitamin A and micronutrients, oral rehydration therapy, and      insecticide-treated bednets--can be provided to third world      countries at minimal cost;       Whereas 10,000,000 children die each year from preventable      diseases in third world countries and 6,000,000 of those      deaths could be prevented by the use of these interventions:      Now, therefore, be it       Resolved, That the Senate--       (1) designates the month of November 2005 as the ``Month of      Global Health'';       (2) reaffirms its commitment to ensuring that children      around the world receive the interventions necessary for      survival as an integral component of efforts to improve      global health; and       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe      the ``Month of Global Health'' with appropriate participation      in key activities, programs, and fundraising in support of      worldwide child survival.
