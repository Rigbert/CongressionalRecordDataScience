 Mr. DeLAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to make all the Members aware that the House has completed voting for the day and the week. We will take any votes called on the three pending motions to instruct, we will take votes on those next week.  Regarding next week's schedule, the House will convene on Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. for morning hour and 2 p.m. for legislative business. At that time we expect to consider several measures under suspension of the rules, and any votes called on those measures will be called at 6:30 p.m. on that day.  On Wednesday, the House will meet for legislative business at 10 a.m. In addition to potentially considering additional legislation under suspension of the rules, Members should be aware that we may be considering a number of conference reports. These include, but are not limited to, H.R. 1474, Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act; the Fiscal Year 2004 Military Construction Appropriations bill; the Fiscal Year 2004 Department of the Interior Appropriations bill; the Energy and Water Appropriations bill; and potentially the Labor-HHS and Education Appropriations bill.  Finally, I would like to remind all Members that we do not plan to have votes next Thursday, October 9, or Friday, October 10. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I would be happy to answer any questions he may have.
