 Chairman, I move to strike the last word.  Mr. Chairman, I had an amendment at the desk, but I am not going to offer that. Instead, I would like to enter into a colloquy with the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Young), chairman of the Subcommittee on National Security.  Mr. Chairman, as the gentleman is aware, the National Guard Starbase program, which has reached almost 200,000 children, is a community-based National Guard program that helps kids in grades 4 through 6 learn hands-on with Guard pilots and technicians. This public school outreach program boosts kids' learning and test scores in math, science, and technology applications. At the same time, Starbase stresses the prevention of drug abuse and builds understanding of self-esteem, goal-setting and teamwork. Unfortunately, as the gentleman is aware, this important project did not receive funding in the Defense appropriations bill.
