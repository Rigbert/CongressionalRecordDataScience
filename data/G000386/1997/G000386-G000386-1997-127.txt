 President, I would like to acknowledge the accomplishments of the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program [RSVP] in Waterloo, IA. This program is celebrating 25 years in their community, this year of 1997. In the last 25 years, over two million volunteer hours have been donated to the communities it serves. Among the recipients of these hours have been children, teachers, elderly, handicapped and a variety of service and community agencies. Some of the many community needs RSVP is assisting with are mentoring, assisting teachers, clerical, carpentry, transportation for the frail and elderly, mediation, respite care, tax preparation assistance, bulk mailings, money management, etc. The needs are as diverse as the volunteers themselves.  This RSVP program started out as a clearinghouse for volunteers and now includes sponsoring several programs of its own: a mediation program that assists with the small claims courts; a school volunteer program that provides mentors and other volunteers to assist with student needs; a money management program that helps individuals remain independent in their own homes; a respite program that provides relief to care givers; and a tax assistance program that provides tax preparation assistance to the low income and elderly.  RSVP provides challenging volunteer opportunities to those 55 and older. At the same time meeting many community needs through the dedication of their unselfish volunteers, who have proven to be a valuable asset to the communities they serve.                          ____________________
