President, I think the time has expired on our side. I am prepared to yield back. Things are getting a little redundant. I stand by this chart. I have a friendly disagreement with my good friend from North Dakota. I do agree that there are some offsets with tax increases. I do not consider that something that we should be embracing. There are still spending increases, budget increases, and we need to do something about it now.  I would say this: If the reverse were true, and if all of the amendments to increase the deficit came from the Republican side, I would still introduce this amendment.  I am going to yield back so that my friend from Florida can take up his amendment because he is next in line. But I would say this: Even if it were done on this side of the aisle as opposed to that side of the aisle, I would still say we have to do something for my 12 grandkids, and that is really get a handle on this.  My amendment is good. There are all kinds of people endorsing it. The National Taxpayer's Union is supporting my amendment. I am going to read it one more time and then I am going to yield back the remainder of my time and there will be a vote on it.       Beginning with fiscal year 2007 and thereafter, all      nondefense, non-trust-fund, discretionary spending shall not      exceed the previous fiscal year's levels . . . without a two-     thirds vote of Members duly chosen and sworn.  With that I yield back the remainder of my time.
