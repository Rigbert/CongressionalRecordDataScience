 President, I want to speak about something that is in conference now between the House and Senate on the fiscal year 1997 defense authorization bill, something I spoke about several times on the floor of this body before. I think I have some new information. In fact, I do have some new information that I was not able to use in the last debate.  This information has a direct bearing on the Marine Corps request for 12 more generals that is a bone of contention in the conference between the House and the Senate--the Senate supporting it, the House, thus far, in their deliberations on the other side being opposed to increasing the number of Marine Corps generals.  I did not have this particular piece of information when I addressed this matter on the floor on June 26 and again on July 17. I spoke on the extra Marine Corps generals during consideration of both the fiscal year 1997 defense authorization bill and the defense appropriations bill. In fact, I offered an amendment to block the Marine Corps request for more generals, but I failed.  These missing documents would have greatly strengthened my case. I want to thank Washington Post writer Mr. Walter Pincus for his alerting me to the fact that these documents existed. I am not talking about some purloined Pentagon documents either.  I am referring to the legislative history behind the current ceiling on general officer strength levels. First, there is section 811 of Public Law 95-79 enacted in July 1977. That established a ceiling of 1,073 general officers after October 1, 1980.  Second, there is section 526 of title X of the United States Code, and this happens to be current law. Section 526 placed a ceiling on the number of general and flag officers serving on active duty at 865 after October 1, 1995.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have these two sections of the law printed in the Record, along with other relevant materials.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:  Public Law 95-79 [H.R. 5970]; July 30, 1977--Department of Defense Appropriation Authorization Act, 1978                           *   *   *   *   *       Sec. 811. (a)(1) The total number of commissioned officers      on active duty in the Army, Marine Corps, and Air Force above      the grade of colonel, and on active duty in the Navy above      the grade of captain, may not exceed 1,073 after October 1,      1980, and the total number of civilian employees of the      Department of Defense in grades GS-13 through GS-18,      including positions authorized under section 1581 of title      10, United States Code, shall be reduced during the fiscal      year beginning October 1, 1977, by the same percentage as the      number of officers on active duty in the Army, Marine Corps,      and Air Force above the grade of colonel and on active duty      in the Navy above the grade of captain is reduced below 1,141      during such fiscal year, and during the fiscal years      beginning October 1, 1978, and October 1, 1979, by a      percentage equal to the percentage by which the number of      commissioned officers on active duty in the Army, Marine      Corps, and Air Force above the grade of colonel and on active      duty in the Navy above the grade of captain is reduced during      such fiscal year below the total number of such officers on      active duty on October 1, 1978, and October 1, 1979,      respectively.       (2) On and after October 1, 1980, the total number of      civilian employees of the Department of Defense in the grades      and positions described in paragraph (1) may not exceed the      number employed in such grades and positions on the date of      enactment of this subsection reduced as provided in paragraph      (1).       (3) In time of war, or of national emergency declared by      Congress, the President may suspend the operation of      paragraphs (1) and (2).       (b)(1) Subsection (b) of section 5231 of title 10, United      States Code, is amended to read as follows:       ``(b) The number of officers serving in the grades of      admiral and vice admiral under subsection (a) of this section      and section 5081 of this title may not be more than 15      percent of the number of officers on the active list of the      Navy above the grade of captain. Of the number of officers      that may serve in the grades of admiral and vice admiral, as      determined under this subsection, not more than 25 percent      may serve in the grade of admiral.''.       (2) Such section 5231 is further amended--       (A) by striking out subsection (c):       (B) by redesignating subsections (d), (e), and (f) as      subsections (c), (d), and (e), respectively; and       (C) by striking out ``numbers authorized under subsections      (b) and (c)'' in subsections (c) and (d) (as redesignated by      subparagraph (B) and inserting in lieu thereof ``number      authorized for that grade under subsection (b)''.       (3) Subsection (b) of section 5232 of title 10, United      States Code, is amended to read as follows:       ``(b) The number of officers serving in the grades of      general and lieutenant general may not be more than 15      percent of the number of officers on the active list of the      Marine Corps above the grade of colonel.''.       (4) The second sentence of subsection (c) of such section      is amended by striking out the period and inserting in lieu      thereof a comma and the following: ``and while in that grade      he is in addition to the number authorized for that grade      under subsection (b) of this section.''.                                                                    ____Department of Defense Appropriation Authorization Act, 1978--Conference Report                           *   *   *   *   *     Reductions in Certain Military and Civilian Positions in the          Department of Defense       The Senate amendment to the House bill (sec. 302) provided      for a reduction in the number of general officers and      admirals by 23 below planned levels in fiscal year 1978 and      an additional reduction of 47 in fiscal year 1979 to an      authorized level of 1,071 and also provided for an alteration      of the statutory provisions governing admirals in the Navy      and generals in the Marine Corps to place them in a similar      position to the Army and the Air Force when the national      emergency provisions lapse. The Senate amendment (sec. 502)      also provided for a reduction in the number of civilians in      General Schedule grades GS-12 through 18, or equivalent, by 2      percent in fiscal year 1978 and by the same proportionate      reduction as applied to generals and admirals for fiscal year      1979.       The House bill contained no such provisions.       The conferees agreed to reduce the authorized levels of      generals and admirals to 1,073 over a 3-year period beginning      with fiscal year 1978 and to apply a reduction to Defense      civilian employees in General Schedule grades GS-13 through      18, or equivalent, by the same proportionate amount over the      same period. The conferees feel strongly that the reductions      in the numbers of top-ranking military personnel should be      coupled with a concurrent reduction in the numbers in the top      six Defense civilian grade levels. For this reason, Sections      302 and 502 of the Senate amendment have been combined and      set out as a separate provision (sec. 811) in the general      provisions of the conference report. The conferees also agree      that all civilian reductions shall be accomplished through      attrition. The conferees concluded that a technical      correction of the Senate provision was required to achieve      consistency between statutory provisions affecting admirals      and Marine Corps generals and the general officers of the      other services.       The conferees agree on the need for a process to enable      Congress and the Department of Defense to develop criteria      for an ongoing review of the number of general officers and      directs the Secretary of Defense to submit a report with the      fiscal year 1979 military authorization request on the      required numbers of general officers as well as any      justification for deferring the proposed military and      civilian reductions in whole or part.       The House recedes with an amendment.                                                                    ____     Authorizing Appropriations for Fiscal Year 1978 for Military  Procurement, Research and Development, Active Duty, Selected Reserve,     and Civilian Personnel Strengths, Civil Defense, and for Other Purposes--Senate Report 95-129                           *   *   *   *   *     Sec. 302: Committee Amendment Reducing the Number of Generals          and Admirals       For fiscal year 1977, the Department of Defense plans to      have 1,165 generals or admirals--one flag officer for every      1,800 active military members. This number is in sharp      contrast to 1968 when during the Vietnam war, there was one      general officer for every 2,600 military members and to the      peacetime 1964 level when there was one general for every      2,100 military members. The Department of Defense proposed to      reduce the number of flag officers by 24 in fiscal year 1978.      The committee adopted an amendment to reduce this number by      an additional 23 in fiscal year 1978 and by 47 in fiscal year      1979. Since the services have undertaken different levels of      effort to reduce flag officers, the amendment gives the      President the authority to apportion the total number of flag      officers rather than applying a uniform reduction for each      service.       The purpose of this amendment is to begin a process to      enable Congress and the Department of Defense to develop      criteria for an ongoing review of the number of officers at      this level. The committee requests the Secretary of Defense      to submit a report with the fiscal year 1979 military      authorization request on the required numbers of general      officers including any justification for deferring the      proposed reductions in whole or part.       Within the total number of general officers authorized, the      Army and Air Force are restricted to having no more than 15      percent of the total number of generals at the grades of      lieutenant general and general and no more than 25 percent of      the general officers at these two grades can be at the grade      of general. However, except in time of war or emergency,      certain specific numbers are included in law for the Navy and      Marine Corps: 26 vice admirals and four admirals for the      Navy, and two generals for the Marine Corps. In addition, the      Marines are restricted to a number of lieutenant generals and      generals total number of officers at the grades of lieutenant      general and no more than 10 percent of the number of general      officers. These provisions for the Navy and Marine Corps have      been suspended by the President under national emergency      authority which is expiring. The committee feels the      distribution of general officer authorizations by grade      should be consistent and has included provisions in the      amendment to make the restrictions for the Navy and Marine      Corps consistent with those for the Army and Air Force.                                                                    ____United States Code, Title X                           *   *   *   *   *     Sec. 526. Authorized strength: general and flag officers on        active duty       (a) Limitations.--The number of general officers on active      duty in the Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and the number      of flag officers on active duty in the Navy, may not exceed      the number specified for the armed force concerned as      follows:       (1) For the Army, 386 before October 1, 1995, and 302 on      and after that date.       (2) For the Navy, 250 before October 1, 1995, and 216 on      and after that date.       (3) For the Air Force, 326 before October 1, 1995, and 279      on and after that date.       (4) For the Marine Corps, 68.       (b) Transfer between services.--During the period before      October 1, 1995, the Secretary of Defense may increase the      number of general officers on active duty in the Army, Air      Force, or Marine Corps, or the number of flag officers on      active duty in the Navy, above the applicable number      specified in subsection (a) by a total of not more than five.      Whenever any such increase is made, the Secretary shall make      a corresponding reduction in the number of such officers that      may serve on active duty in general or flag officer grades in      one of the other armed forces.       (c) Limited exclusion for joint duty requirements.--(1) The      Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff may designate up to 12      general officer and flag officer positions that are joint      duty assignments for purposes of chapter 38 of this title for      exclusion from the limitations in subsection (a) that are      applicable on and after October 1, 1995. Officers in      positions so designated shall not be counted for the purposes      of those limitations.       (2) this subsection shall cease to be effective on October      1, 1998.       (d) Notice to Congress upon change in grade for certain      positions.--(1) Not later than 60 days before an action      specified in paragraph (2) may become effective, the      Secretary of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed      Services of the Senate and House of Representatives a report      providing notice of the intended action and an analytically      based justification for the intended action.       (2) Paragraph (1) applies in the case of the following      actions:       (A) A change in the grade authorized as of July 1, 1994,      for a general officer position in the National Guard Bureau,      a general or flag officer position in the Office of a Chief      of a reserve component, or a general or flag officer position      in the headquarters of a reserve component command.       (B) Assignment of a reserve component officer to a general      officer position in the National Guard Bureau, to a general      or flag officer position in the Office of a Chief of a      reserve component, or a general or flag officer position in      the headquarters of a reserve component command in a grade      other than the grade authorized for that position as of July      1, 1994.       (C) Assignment of an officer other than a general or flag      officer as the military executive to the Reserve Forces      Policy Board.       (e) Exclusion of Certain Officers.--The limitations of this      section do not apply to a reserve component general or flag      officer who is on active duty for training or who is on      active duty under a call or order specifying a period of less      than 180 days.
