Mr. Speaker, title II of the bill requires HUD to rescind $1.3 billion in the funds that the Congress provided in 2007 or prior years. Frankly, HUD cannot meet this rescission without doing great harm to the most vulnerable of our population, those low-income individuals who are elderly, low-income, disabled persons and homeless families and individuals. As much as 40 percent of the homeless population in this country, Mr. Speaker, as much as 40 percent, are veterans.  Congress has always provided the section 8 program with full funding, knowing that if not all the funds were used, they would be recaptured and rescinded and used by the Congress for other high priority programs. However, this bill states categorically that if funds for the section 8 program are more than actually get used by the Public Housing Authority, they may not be recaptured or rescinded, even though they are clearly in excess.  Let me quote the report accompanying this bill: ``The Department is not permitted to recapture these reserves for the rescission.''  Just where is the Department expected to go to get these funds? The answer is very simple and very unfortunate. They would, first and foremost, eliminate funding for the construction of facilities that provide assisted living for low-income elderly persons, for low-income disabled individuals and homeless shelters, as well as other permanent housing for the homeless.                              {time}  2245  Let me repeat, other permanent housing for the homeless, as much as 40 percent of the homeless population are veterans.  These funds are not in excess. Quite to the contrary, they are very much in use. But construction programs spend out slowly and so the funds are there waiting to be applied towards various stages of construction. Unlike the section 8 funds, these funds would never be in excess. They are simply in the pipeline, fully obligated or committed to specific projects and ready for use.  So when HUD takes these funds, it means that facilities for these vulnerable groups will be eliminated. HUD has no other choices since there are no other programs with this much money still available from 2007 or prior years.  Mr. Speaker, however you look at it, this is a very bad outcome and every measure must be taken to prevent cutting programs that serve the most vulnerable, especially programs that serve the homeless veterans. My motion to recommit does just that. It protects those programs from being slashed as sacrificial lambs to a new policy that says excess voucher funds are more important than building facilities to house the elderly and disabled and homeless, especially homeless veterans.  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this motion.  Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Walsh), the former chairman of the VA-HUD Subcommittee and a tireless advocate for housing programs that serve vulnerable populations.
