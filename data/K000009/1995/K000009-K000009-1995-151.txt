Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.  Mr. Speaker, in referring to what the previous speaker said, he made an untrue statement. United States manufacturers manufacture 60 different models of right-hand drive vehicles both in this country and around the world, and for a Member from the State of Michigan to speak out against the United States, and we are hemorrhaging in terms of these trade deficits with Japan for over two decades, I think is unconscionable.  I thank the gentleman for yielding.
