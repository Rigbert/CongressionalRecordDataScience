I am someone who personally was able to have the work study program available to me as a college student at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. And I was able to work my way through school along with some scholarship assistance. I think that all of us who have struggled hard to get an education understand what the students of today, whose bills are even higher than ours were, are facing.  I do have to say on the Record that the University of Toledo is in my district. They are on their way to the Las Vegas Bowl. We are very proud of them for that. We have over 22,000 students at that particular institution.
