 President, I ask unanimous consent that the McCain-Baucus-Grassley amendment, which is at the desk, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; that the title amendment be agreed to; that the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table, en bloc; and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.
