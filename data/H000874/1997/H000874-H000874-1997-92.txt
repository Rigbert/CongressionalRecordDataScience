Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  I want to reiterate why Members ought to vote for this bill. The reason they ought to vote for this bill is because it does some things that are very important to average Americans, families in neighborhoods, in communities, concerned about the safety of their children, concerned about the safety of their families, concerned about the safety of their neighborhoods.  It provides $3.9 billion for law enforcement efforts. Every Member in this House supports that kind of effort. The fact of the matter is, $1.6 billion of that money is for antidrug activities. We could all talk about making communities safe. We can go back to our town meetings and say, I want to keep America safe from drugs; I want to keep American kids off of drugs. But the fact of the matter is, this effort makes that happen. This is an important initiative.  ONDCP, which is the organization that General McCaffrey heads up, as all of you know, the most decorated soldier in America, General McCaffrey heads up the ONDCP. He has organized an effort across the Government to make sure that we maximize our effort to make our communities safe. We provide for monies to go on television. We know that there is nothing that impacts young people in America like television.  What this bill does is provide funds so that we can communicate with young people with reference to staying off drugs, as I said earlier, just saying no. That is a critically important effort. I would ask Members to focus on that. There are some of you who think this bill is not perfect. You are absolutely right, it not perfect, but it is a very important effort in trying to address the drug problem in America, safe communities in America.
