Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to Gerald Solomon, the distinguished gentleman from New York, as he prepares to retire after 20 years of service to the country and his constituents, the last four years as Chairman of the House Rules Committee.  Jerry Solomon and I came to Congress together in 1978. In his ten terms representing New York's 22nd District in the House, his colleagues and his constituents have come to know him as a positive force for common sense legislation. Jerry's legacy is one of military preparedness, fiscal responsibility, strong foreign policy and government accountability.  As a former United States Marine, Jerry brought a unique knowledge of the necessities of military readiness to his legislative agenda. In the 1980's, he worked to strengthen our armed services, joining other exemplary leaders such as Ronald Reagan in helping to ensure a peaceful end to the Cold War and the United States' position of strength in the post-Cold War world. His work with the North Atlantic Assembly and his mastery of NATO issues proved an invaluable asset to the House as we considered foreign affairs and national security issues.  But Jerry Solomon's importance to the House does not stop there. His colleagues know him as a Member who recognized the patriotism and dignity of this country's veterans and fought tirelessly to see that the government provided them the rights and benefits they so richly deserve.  Jerry Solomon also devoted significant energy to securing accountability in our government, taking a principal role in creating the line item veto legislation passed by Congress in 1996. And it is important legislation like this that passes through Jerry's hands each day. As Chairman of the Rules Committee, he continues to dedicate himself to providing for the smooth movement of the many and varied pieces of legislation that come before the House in each session.  His shoes will undoubtedly be hard to fill. I join my colleagues in wishing a Jerry a fond farewell and a successful retirement. We aspire to continue his level of leadership and commitment.                          ____________________
