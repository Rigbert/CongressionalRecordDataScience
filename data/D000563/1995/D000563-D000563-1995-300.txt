Speaker, I would like to share with the people who are listening this morning an experience which I had in my district yesterday which I hope that all of you will reflect on because it is the outgrowth of a vote last week on the floor of this House of Representatives which could have an impact on every family in the United States.  What happened last week is that this House of Representatives passed a budget resolution. That is a spending plan for the next year. In fact, in this case it was a spending plan for the next 7 years. Those who supported that budget resolution, I was not among those, suggested that we could reach a balanced budget by the year 2002 if we have certain cuts in spending. And they proposed those cuts as part of the package.  The reason that I opposed that plan as presented by Speaker Gingrich and his Republican allies was the fact that it included a substantial tax cut, primarily to the wealthiest people in this country. In order to pay for that tax cut, it cut many of these spending programs more deeply. In fact, the programs that are hit the hardest are the health care programs, Medicare and Medicaid.  What the Republicans have done is to create a piggy bank with cuts in Medicare and Medicaid to pay for their tax cut package. And that is the part that I find objectionable. This is not a solely partisan view, although most Democrats share my point of view. In fact, in the Senate, the Republican leaders there have many misgivings as well as to whether we should be enacting a tax cut in the wake of our need to bring our budget into balance.  But the reason I come to the floor this morning is to reflect on the impact of cuts in Medicare and Medicaid. As I look about the gallery here, I see people of varying ages, from youngsters on school trips to those who are clearly retired, perhaps here on a holiday or vacation to witness this House of Representatives and its proceedings. The irony is that each person here has an interest in this issue because it affects every single one of us.  Let me explain. Right now the Medicaid Program in America is generally viewed as a welfare program. It is not a welfare program. It is a health care program. A third of the recipients under the Medicaid Program are, in fact, poor people receiving health care through it. but another third are disabled people, folks who because of mental or physical disability qualify for this Medicaid to pay their medical bills. And the final third represent people, our parents, grandparents who are in nursing homes and other facilities who do not have the resources left in their savings accounts to take care of themselves.  So when you say we are going to cut Medicaid, you are not just hitting so-called welfare low-income families; you are also hitting the elderly and the disabled.  As I went and visited nursing homes in my district yesterday, it was an eye opener to talk about what it will mean if the Republicans prevail and cut $188 billion out of Medicaid. It means less money coming from the Federal Government through these families into nursing home care.  What will be the ultimate result of that? Well, I can tell you, it is not very promising; what is involved here, unfortunately, is that a lot of people in nursing homes today literally, literally survive because of Medicaid payments. If those payments are cut, it raises a serious question about what happens to these people.  I guess even equally important for the younger folks in the audience here, the responsibility is then their family's. If the Government does not make an adequate payment to the nursing home, who then is going to pay the bill for the parent or grandparent there who needs a helping hand?  This, I think, is a serious personal concern for all of us. Right now Medicaid pays one-half of all nursing home care in the United States. If we take that and put it in perspective, when we cut back in Medicaid, we are putting a real burden on an industry that is labor intensive, and frankly we want to do a very good qualify job. If they cut back in the quality of service, every single one of us is concerned that that elderly person who needs help the most will be put in a perilous situation.  So that is why I opposed the Republican budget resolution. Let me say in a spirit at this time of bipartisanship, there are some things I think we can do that came out of a meeting yesterday. For one thing, we have to encourage more people to buy what is known as long-term care insurance. When you are my age or younger, you do not think about whether you are ever going to be in a nursing home, but frankly we have all got to be thinking about the possibility that that could happen some day and we may need insurance coverage to protect us.  We have got to encourage more American families to build this into their health insurance portfolio, not just the insurance for hospitals and doctors but also for long-term care. I will be working on legislation to try to encourage families to do that, to perhaps provide a tax deduction to provide for long-term care insurance as a solution to part of this problem.                          ____________________
