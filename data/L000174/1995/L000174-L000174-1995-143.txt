President, very briefly, with all due respect to my friend from Oklahoma, his description of the Leahy-Kassebaum amendment is not accurate.  Mr. President, we debated the basic aspects of the Leahy-Kassebaum amendment less than a month ago. Mr. President, 57 Senators voted against what is in the House position, voted against the position we seek to replace. Nothing has changed since then.  The Leahy-Kassebaum amendment simply says that private family planning organizations like the foreign organizations supported by the International Planned Parenthood Federation should not be restricted to require more subjective requirements, more restrictive than those applicable to Government.  In other words, it permits us to support private organizations, provided U.S. Government funds are not used, are not used for abortion activities as we made funds available for family planning to governments in countries where abortion is legal, as it is in this country, just as we give foreign aid to countries where abortion is legal, as it is in this country.  This bill contains the same explicit prohibition of funding for abortion that has been the law for years. Not one dime in this bill could be spent on abortion or anything related to abortion. The bill already contains a prohibition against using any United States funds in China.  The House amendment would, nevertheless, prohibit a U.S. contribution to the U.N. population fund. I think that would be foolhardy. The question is whether we should accept the House position so that the bill might go forward.  I ask unanimous consent that a statement of administration policy from OMB be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                          Office of the President,                              Office of Management and Budget,                                 Washington, DC, October 31, 1995.     Re H.R. 1868--Foreign operations, export financing and          related programs appropriations bill, FY 1996 (Sponsors:          Livingston, Louisiana; Callahan, Alabama).                   Statement of Administration Policy    [This statement has been coordinated by OMB with the concerned                                agencies]       This Statement of Administration Policy provides the      Administration's views on the item reported in disagreement      by the conference on H.R. 1868, the Foreign Operations,      Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Bill,      FY 1996. Your consideration of the Administration's views      would be appreciated.       The conferees have reported in disagreement provisions      related to population assistance to non-governmental      organizations. This is an issue of the highest importance to      the Administration.       The Administration opposes coercion in family planning      practices, and no U.S. assistance is used to pay for abortion      as a method of family planning. The House provision, however,      would prohibit any assistance from being provided to entities      that fund abortions or lobby for abortions with private      funds, thus ending U.S. support for many qualified and      experienced non-governmental organizations providing vital      voluntary family planning information and services. The      provision would also end U.S. support for the United Nations      Population Fund (UNFPA). This would sharply limit the      availability of effective voluntary family planning programs      abroad that are designed to reduce the incidence of unwanted      pregnancy and thereby decrease the need for abortion. The      Administration also has serious concerns about the      constitutionality of the House provision. If the House      language were included in the bill presented to the      President, the Secretary of State would recommend to the      President that he veto the bill.
