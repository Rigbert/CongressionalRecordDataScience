Chairman, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's amendment. I certainly urge Members to support it.  This bill maintains the increases provided last year for deferred maintenance and increases the construction account by $10 million. This amendment will further our efforts to address the longstanding deferred maintenance needs.  I urge an ``aye'' vote on the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your support of the amendment, and I would ask all Members on both sides of the aisle to support our national parks and support this amendment.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally).  The amendment was agreed to.  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair understands that amendment No. 12 will not be offered.                Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mr. Griffith  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 printed in House Report 115-297.
