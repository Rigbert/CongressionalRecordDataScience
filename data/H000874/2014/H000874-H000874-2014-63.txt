 As the gentleman knows full well, we have 3\1/2\ days next week. We have, I guess, 9 full days and 3 half days scheduled in September and the first couple of weeks in October, assuming that we meet in that last week of September.  There have been some rumors. My Members have been asking me about whether or not there is serious consideration being given to not using the last week scheduled in September. Does that have any credence?  I yield to my friend.  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank my gentleman for yielding.  Currently, there have been no changes to the schedule.
