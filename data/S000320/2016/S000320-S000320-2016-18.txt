 President, today I wish to honor the life of my friend Marlin Moore of Tuscaloosa, AL, who passed away on May 25, 2016. He will be long remembered as an accomplished businessman and a civic leader.  A native of Tuscaloosa, Marlin attended Tuscaloosa High School and then went on to become a student at the University of Alabama's School of Commerce. Following graduation, he joined the firm of Pritchett-Moore, Inc., where he worked under its founders, Marlin Moore, Sr., and Harry H. Pritchett.  Marlin eventually became president and then chairman of Pritchett-Moore. Not only did he develop 43 subdivisions during his time with Pritchett-Moore, but he was involved with the Realtors Association both on the State and national level. Marlin served two terms as president of the Tuscaloosa Association of Realtors, president of the Alabama Association of Realtors, and served as a board member of the National Association of Realtors for 11 years. For his contributions to the real estate community, he received the Alabama Realtor of the Year Award and was named a member of the Home Builders Association of Tuscaloosa Hall of Fame.  In addition to his interest and work in real estate, Marlin was also a founder of Security Bank, where he served as its chairman. He served as a board member of First National Bank and AmSouth Bank, and he served two terms on the board of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.  In addition to his professional contributions to west Alabama, Marlin worked with several philanthropic organizations such as the United Way of West Alabama, West Alabama Chamber of Commerce, Red Cross, Exchange Club, the Boy Scout Council, the West Alabama Community Foundation, and the University of Alabama and the Crimson Tide Track Program. In 2008, he was inducted into the Pillars of West Alabama for his dedicated efforts and service to the area.  The city of Tuscaloosa and the State of Alabama was fortunate to have a great businessman and civic leader like Marlin Moore, and he will be sorely missed. I offer my deepest condolences to his wife, Laine, and their children as they celebrate his life and mourn his loss.                          ____________________
