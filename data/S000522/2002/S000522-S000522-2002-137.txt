Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.  Again, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hyde), chairman of the Committee on International Relations, for his leadership in bringing this resolution to the floor today. Without his personal and strong support, there would not be a resolution.  But that is only the half of it. I have been in Congress now 22 years, Mr. Speaker, and I have known Chairman Hyde all those years. He is a champion of human rights anywhere and everywhere. Including East Timor. He is also a champion in the cause of promoting the sanctity of life wherever and whenever it is threatened.  East Timor, finally, Mr. Speaker, has an extraordinary future. Its leadership has overcome incredible odds, and theypossess an indomitable spirit and an enormous amount of courage. Our prayers and hopes are with President Gusmao and Nobel Peace Prize winner Bishop Belo and so many others who are now on the cutting edge of ensuring that a beleaguered population which has suffered so much finally enjoys the blessings of liberty and freedom.  Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter) and ask unanimous consent that he be permitted to control the time.
