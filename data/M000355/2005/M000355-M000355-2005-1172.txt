 SESSIONS. He did.  Mr. McCONNELL. So I want to make sure I have this correct. Both Judge Pryor and Judge McConnell criticized Roe v. Wade, both swore under oath they would follow Supreme Court precedents, including those they may personally disagree with, but unlike Judge McConnell, who was a law professor at the time of his nomination and did not have the opportunity as an academic to enforce the law, Judge Pryor has been a public official who has had the chance, on repeated occasions, to put his money where his mouth was, and he has consistently followed the law?  Our Democratic colleagues confirmed Judge McConnell by unanimous consent but are vigorously objecting to Judge Pryor; is that the case?
