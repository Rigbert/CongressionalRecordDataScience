Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding, and I want to say to Mr. Kildee, those of you who have been our pages and have made such an extraordinary contribution to this institution, Mr. Kildee has been on the Page Board for almost, as a matter of fact, maybe as long as I've been a Member of Congress, which is longer than, by almost a factor of two, not quite, all of you have been alive.  You come to this institution with a great responsibility, in my opinion. You are extraordinary young people in high school, learning not only about government but learning about all the other skills that you will need to know to be successful and to help your country be successful.  This program, I think, is an extraordinarily important program because of what it does. It gives to you at a young age while you are learning the opportunity to see firsthand your democracy in action, to see those who have been selected by your parents, by your brothers and sisters and aunts and uncles and your neighbors and friends to represent them in the Congress of the United States.  You have been given this unique opportunity that a very, very small segment of your fellow cohorts, your generation, will have had, to come firsthand to see the Members, who are all human beings, who all have ideas, who all have passions and fears and visions and desires like your parents and you have and who come here on behalf of their constituents to try to do good for their country.  As president of the Maryland Senate in the 1970s, I had the opportunity to run the Page Program in the State Senate, and I was always hopeful that those young people, who were your age, 16, 17 years of age, they were seniors, for the most part, you're juniors, would leave their service in this institution and in that institution with a positive perspective, with a thought that this democracy, founded so many centuries ago, still is a viable democracy that, as Winston Churchill said, is the best of all other forms of government tried.  It is, as you have seen, not perfect, but it has created one of the greatest societies that has ever existed, not the only great society but one of the greatest, and you have helped us make it function.  And sometimes you will think to yourself, well, I didn't get on the floor and speak; you're obviously not a Member; and perhaps you didn't write a great treatise on this issue or that issue and will feel from time to time, well, all I did was run this envelope from this office to that office or from the floor of the House to someplace else or, from time to time, get information for a Member who was debating something on the floor. But your service made this institution run better.  John Kennedy was a hero of mine, and, frankly, I got into politics because of John Kennedy. He came to the campus of the University of Maryland, talked about the difference that young people could make. He spoke on this floor at least on three occasions where he gave his State of the Union.                              {time}  1745  In his inaugural address, he said to all of us that the energy, the faith, the devotion we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it, and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.  Pages, I hope you leave from here with a better knowledge of how the people's House works and with a renewed conviction that your democracy works, perhaps, better than you thought or some had told you it did and that you will leave this place with an energy and a faith and a devotion to letting your colleagues know how well their democracy works and with the conviction that if they participate fully in this democracy that it will work even better.  Thank you for your service. Thank you for what you do in your communities, in your schools and in your communities, and thank you for transmitting the knowledge you have learned to literally thousands of your friends and colleagues. Godspeed.
