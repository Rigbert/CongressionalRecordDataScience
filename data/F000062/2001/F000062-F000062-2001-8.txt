  Following a historic summit in June, 2000 in Pyongyang, North Korea, South Korean President Kim Dae Jung and North Korean leader Kim Jon II agreed to hold reunions of South Korean and North Korean families separated at the 38th parallel since the start of the Korean war. Since then, three reunions have taken place and more than 3,400 citizens of North and South Korea have been reunited after more than 50 years.  I applaud these reunions and I believe they are an important step towards improving relations between North and South Korea and promoting peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. Unfortunately, more than 500,000 Americans of Korean ancestry, many of whom reside in my home state of California, who likewise have been separated from loved ones in North Korea for half a century have not been able to participate.  Time is of the essence. Family members in North Korea and the United States are entering the twilight of their lives. Many have died. Many simply do not know what has happened to their loved ones. We now have an opportunity to lend our support to efforts to reunite families who have spent far too long suffering from separation and uncertainty.  The resolution is simple. It states that it is the sense of Congress that the Congress and the President should support efforts to reunite people of the United States of Korean ancestry with their families in North Korea and that those efforts should be made in a timely manner.  The holiday season is a time for family members to come together, share their love and happiness, and look forward to the New Year. During this time, let us make a commitment to help Americans of Korean descent so that they too will soon be able to share in that holiday spirit with their brothers and sisters, mothers and fathers, and grandmothers and grandfathers in North Korea.  I urge my colleagues to support the Resolution.                          ____________________
