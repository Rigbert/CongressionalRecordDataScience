 President, I rise today to pay tribute to a dear friend, a successful businessman, and community leader, the late Henry Heuser, Sr. I also would like to extend my condolences to his two sons, Henry, Jr. and Marshall.  Henry has made it easy for us to remember him--leaving behind an impressive list of accomplishments that most people only hope to achieve in their lifetime. Henry will be remembered for many different reasons, not least of which is his generosity to the Louisville community. Henry gave much of his time, energy and monetary resources to benefit others. Aware that he had resources which not everyone was privileged to have, he shared his wealth both of knowledge and of money with the city over his lifetime. Henry often gave to charity and community groups that needed support, including a recent $1 million donation to the Louisville Deaf Oral School for a much-needed expansion project. He made the donation in memory of his late wife, Edith, who volunteered for and supported the school for many years.  Henry also will be remembered as a dedicated civic leader for Louisville--Henry had a heart for the city of Louisville, and a vision for its bright future. Henry was a founder of Leadership Louisville, a group of community leaders that were committed to making a difference in the city. Henry also was very involved in the religious community of Louisville, and even led the effort to bring the Presbyterian Church's headquarters to the city several years ago. Another of the legacies Henry leaves behind is that of ``The Derby Clock,'' as it has come to be known. Henry was an integral part of the planning and design for the clock, and I know I will think of him when I see it repaired, reassembled, and prominently displayed in our city.  Henry also will be remembered for his success in business, with the Henry Vogt Machine Company and his more recent enterprises, Unistar and Equisource. Henry's sharp mind and innate common sense clearly served him in the business world and in the community.  I am certain that the legacy of excellence that Henry Heuser, Sr. has left will continue on, and will encourage and inspire others. Hopefully it will be a comfort to the family and friends he leaves behind to know that his efforts to better the community will be felt for years to come. On behalf of myself and my colleagues, I offer my deepest condolences to Henry's loved ones, and express my gratitude for all he contributed to Jefferson County, the State of Kentucky, and to our great nation.                          ____________________
