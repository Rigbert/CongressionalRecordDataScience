Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my good friend, the gentleman from New York (Mr. Gilman), for yielding me this time.  Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by urging all of our colleagues to support H.R. 2415, the American Embassy Security Act, and I just want to say how pleased I am to have introduced this legislation, along with my good friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. McKinney), the ranking member of our subcommittee.  The gentlewoman from Georgia (Ms. McKinney) and I held four subcommittee hearings. We heard from all those interested in the components of this bill, including a very, very important hearing that we had on March 12, at which time we heard from Admiral Crowe who headed up an accountability review board. He made a passionate and very strong statement as to why in fiscal year 2000 we need to provide $1.4 billion to try to beef up our security at our embassies, especially in light of the devastating attacks in Africa on two of our embassies, and the ongoing threat to all our embassies.  In our hearing, Admiral Crowe said, and I will just quote very briefly, that throughout the proceedings the boards were most disturbed regarding two interconnected issues.  The first was the inadequacy of the resources to provide security against terrorist attacks and the second was the relatively low priority accorded security concerns throughout the U.S. Government by the Department of State, other agencies in general, and on the part of many employees both in Washington and in the field.  Admiral Crowe also pointed out that he found very troubling--again, this is quoting Admiral Crowe--the failure of the U.S. Government to take the necessary steps to prevent such tragedies in the interim, since the time when Bobby Inman made his recommendations back in the 1980's. There was so little done by all--the Congress, the White House--and now it is time to redress that.  We also heard from David Carpenter, the Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security, for the Department of State. He pointed out--and I think this bears underscoring and putting an exclamation point after it--the terrorist threat is global, lethal, multidimensional, and growing. Our analysts estimate that during the past 12 months, there were over 2,400 threats or incidents against U.S. interests overseas. Their estimate for the same period a year ago is approximately 1,150 such threats or incidents. This is an increase of over 100 percent in the past year.  The threat is generated by indigenous terrorists and transnational anti-American groups and by state sponsors of terrorism.  We also heard, Mr. Chairman, from Mr. Daniel Geisler, who is the President of the American Foreign Service Association, speaking on behalf of those who would be most affected: The Foreign Service officers overseas, their families, all of those who are on the front line at our missions and consuls abroad, who, while they do not want to shrink, as he pointed out, they never want to develop a bunker mentality, but he did point out, and I would like to quote him, he said to us that he had grave concerns that this failure will be corrected; that is to say the failure of funding to beef up our embassy security. He went on to say our doubts are heightened by the administration's grossly inadequate request for funds to build safer embassies.  The fiscal year 2000 budget request does not have a single penny, he went on, for construction funds, even though the State Department had proposed that OMB request $1.4 billion for worldwide security.  We would agree with the State Department on this bill. My colleague and I worked, during the work of this markup, both subcommittee, full committee. The gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Bereuter) lent a mighty hand in regard to embassy security, and the bottom line is we have the $1.4 billion. Hopefully, it will pass; and hopefully, the appropriators will provide an identical amount for embassy security.  I would also like to point out, Mr. Chairman, that several other provisions in this legislation promote our American values by promoting freedom and democracy around the world, and it does address a number of urgent humanitarian needs.  Section 106 of the bill will ensure that a fair share of U.S. contributions to international organizations be directed to the organizations that do the most good in the most effective way. This section does not increase the amount we will contribute to international organizations but does set aside $5 million of this amount for the world food program; $5 million for the U.N. Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture; $5 million for the International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor.  This section also sets aside $240,000 to the OAS for a Special Rapporteur for Freedom of Expression in the Western Hemisphere, of which at least $6,000 is to be spent investigating violations of freedom of expression by the Government of Cuba.  Section 106 also carries forward an important provision of current law that addresses the human rights and humanitarian needs of the people of Burma. This provision requires the U.S. to withhold from its contributions to the UNDP an amount equal that will be spent in Burma unless the President certifies that all UNDP activities in Burma meets four conditions.  First, these activities must be focused on the needs of the poor.  Second, they must be undertaken only through private and voluntary organizations independent of the Burmese dictatorship.  Third, the President must certify that they do not benefit the dictatorship.  Finally, they must be carried out only after consultation with the democratic leadership of Burma, the people who won, I might remind my colleagues, the 1988 election and then were forced into exile or worse by the military regime.  Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2415 contains a permanent authorization for Radio Free Asia, which would otherwise have to close its doors on September 30 of this year. It also provides an authorization that will allow increased broadcasting beyond the current 2 hours per day to Vietnam and to North Korea.  This is particularly important in the case of Vietnam, where the Hanoi regime currently jams Radio Free Asia broadcasts. The jamming costs the dictatorship about the same amount per hour as it does our broadcasts, and maybe even more.  Let me also point out the need that some of this will get through, and our hope is that the message of freedom and democracy will pierce that veil.                              {time}  1515  Mr. Chairman, the bill also ensures the survival of one of our great freedom broadcasting services, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, by formally repealing a 1994 ``sense of Congress'' provision that Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty should receive no U.S. Government support after Fiscal Year 1999.  The 1994 provision is inconsistent with the administration's budget request and with the bipartisan Congressional consensus that freedom broadcasting continues to deserve U.S. support as the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union and its former satellites struggle to develop their own thoroughly free and thoroughly professional broadcast services.  The bill also increases from $75 million to $80 million the annual funding cap for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in order to permit necessary expenditures for Radio Free Iraq, Radio Liberty broadcasts to Iran, and necessary security upgrades in response to credible threats of retaliation to those broadcasts.  Mr. Chairman, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is still irreplaceable, and this bill ensures its continued good work into the 21st Century.  Mr. Chairman, section 202 of the bill requires the President to report on the extent of international narcotics traffic through or to Cuba, as well as the extent of the involvement by the Cuban Government, its agencies and entities, and the United States' actions to investigate or prosecute such acts.  We have seen a few newspaper stories lately that suggest that the Castro regime would actually like to help us stop drug trafficking. I am informed, however, that our government is aware of substantial evidence that the regime itself has been involved in such trafficking. This report will help set the record straight one way or the other.  Section 205(a) continues a requirement enacted last year for periodic reports on outstanding claims by United States firms against the Government of Saudi Arabia. This amendment is necessary to help U.S. firms which have completed extensive work for the Saudi Government but have had no success in getting their due compensation. For example, Gibbs and Hill, Inc., of New Jersey has outstanding claims for $55 million for work on a desalinization plant completed in 1984.  Section 205(c) continues a report requiring the Secretary of State to report on the extent to which the Government of Vietnam is cooperating with the U.S. on the fullest possible accounting of POWs and MIAs, has made progress on the release of political and religious prisoners, is cooperating on requests by the U.S. to obtain full and free access to persons for interviews under the Orderly Departure and Resettlement Opportunities for Vietnamese Refugees programs, has taken efforts and actions to end corrupt practices in connection with exit visas, and is making efforts to interview and resettle former reeducation camp victims and other persons.  But, unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, not all of the problems with the Vietnamese refugee program are caused by the Vietnamese Government. I am ashamed to say that some of our former allies and their families have been left behind, or even forcibly returned to Vietnam, because of compassion fatigue or outright cynicism on the part of the people who work for the U.S. Government.  Section 274 of the bill is an attempt to get the attention of the State Department to this problem and to ensure that, if we are going to spend more money on diplomatic presence in Vietnam, we spend it, or at least part of it, on keeping our commitments to the people who stood by us and who have suffered because they share our values.  This section prohibits the use of funds authorized by the act to support an increased number of personnel assigned to U.S. posts in Vietnam unless the President first certifies to Congress that the Vietnamese in-country refugee processing program meets certain conditions and standards.  The conditions that will require modification of the State Department plans to phase out U.S. refugee programs in Vietnam in order not to abandon allied war veterans and other Vietnamese who have been persecuted on account of their wartime associations with the United States.  This provision has been endorsed by the American Legion, the U.S. Catholic Conference, Refugees International, the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, and numerous other human rights organizations.  Mr. Chairman, we are not talking about a lot of people here, a few thousand compared to millions of refugees who have been resettled in the United States over the years; but it is important to complete this program in the same generous spirit with which it was begun.  Mr. Chairman, section 207 establishes a human rights fellowship program within the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. The fellows would be selected on the basis of their human rights expertise and recruited for specific projects or assistance needed by the bureau. I think it is a useful way to bring some of the much-needed fresh air into the State Department. Our foreign policy needs the perspective, not only of diplomats, but also of people who have devoted their whole lives to the pursuit of human rights.  Section 321 of the bill establishes a Foreign Service Star, an award for civilian employees of the United States assigned to an official mission overseas who are killed or wounded in government service.  Section 408 requires the Secretary of State to take all appropriate steps to ensure that members of the Royal Ulster Constabulary are not participants in any program of educational or cultural exchange or training through the National Academy Program at Quantico, Virginia, unless and until the President certifies a complete, independent, and transparent investigation of the murders of Rosemary Nelson--whom my colleagues will remember appeared before our committee and said she feared the RUC--and Patrick Finucane have been initiated by the government of the UK.  There are 41 amendments, some of which will be en bloc. This is a good bill which deserves the support of my colleagues.  Ms. McKINNEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Filner).
