 President, S. Res. 41 designates April 4, 2001 as ``National Murder Awareness Day.'' In 1999 alone, 15,533 people were murdered in the United States according to FBI statistics. Murder affects not only the victims themselves, but it affects the lives of countless other family members and friends of victims. While murder rates have decreased from their record highs in the 1980s, further improvement is needed as the murder rate in 1999 was still 5.7 per 100,000 inhabitants--24 percent higher than the 1950 murder rate.  To help address the glaring murder problem in our country, I introduced the National Murder Awareness Day resolution with my colleague Senator Sessions. This resolution will raise awareness of the devastating impact murder has on our country. In addition, it recognizes the important role local communities can play in combating the thousands of senseless murders that occur each year.  The idea of devoting a day to raising murder awareness originated with Citizens Against Crime, a grassroots victim's rights organization located in Selma, Alabama. This group was successful in having the Alabama state legislature designate April 4, 2000 as Alabama's ``Murder Awareness Day.'' According to Citizens against Crime, this designation was overwhelmingly successful in mobilizing community resources to address the problem of violent crime in Alabama.  Mr. President, the murder problem in America is complex and will require concerted efforts by people and communities throughout our great country. The National Murder Awareness Day resolution reflects the importance of these efforts. I am pleased my colleagues joined me in passing this important resolution.
