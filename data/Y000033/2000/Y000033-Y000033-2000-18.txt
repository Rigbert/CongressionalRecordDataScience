Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2903 will help manage and conserve America's fisheries and benefit marine mammals. Because of the press of time before we adjourn and the limited number of legislative days, we have folded together nearly a dozen previously House- or Senate-passed fisheries conservation measures. These bipartisan provisions include the reauthorization of the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act and the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act, a grant program from marine mammal stranding networks, and a study of eastern gray whale populations. All these measures deserve our support.  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
