Mr. Chairman, I have not considered that, although I do think we deserve the merit for this bill probably more so than the one it is named after. I do say this with respect. The gentleman and I put the work in on this bill. The gentleman was chairman of the subcommittee. It came through his committee. Unfortunately, history has a way, those that are still available are never remembered in good light. So after we leave, we will not know whether to rename the bill.
