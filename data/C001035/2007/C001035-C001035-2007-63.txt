President, I rise today on behalf of myself, Senator Conrad, Senator Smith, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Inouye, to introduce legislation to ensure that our seniors and disabled citizens have timely access to home health services under the Medicare Program.  Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse midwives, and clinical nurse specialists are all playing increasingly important roles in the delivery of health care services, particularly in rural and medically underserved areas of our country where physicians may be in scarce supply. In recognition of their growing role, Congress, in 1997, authorized Medicare to begin paying for physician services provided by these health professionals as long as those services are within their scope of practice under State law.  Despite their expanded role, these advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants are currently unable to order home health services for their Medicare patients. Under current law, only physicians are allowed to certify or initiate home health care for Medicare patients, even though they may not be as familiar with the patient's case as the non-physician provider. In fact, in many cases, the certifying physician may not even have a relationship with the patient and must rely upon the input of the nurse practitioner, physician assistant, clinical nurse specialist or certified nurse midwife to order the medically necessary home health care. At best, this requirement adds more paperwork and a number of unnecessary steps to the process before home health care can be provided. At worst, it can lead to needless delays in getting Medicare patients the home health care they need simply because a physician is not readily available to sign the form.  The inability of advanced practice registered nurses and physician assistants to order home health care is particularly burdensome for Medicare beneficiaries in medically underserved areas, where these providers may be the only health care professionals available. For example, needed home health care was delayed by more than a week for a Medicare patient in Nevada because the physician assistant was the only health care professionalserving the patient's small rural town, and the supervising physician was located 60 miles away.  A nurse practitioner told me about another case in which her collaborating physician had just lost her father and was not available. As a consequence, the patient experienced a 2-day delay in getting needed care while they waited to get the paperwork signed by another physician. Another nurse practitioner pointed out that it is ridiculous that she can order physical and occupational therapy in a subacute facility but cannot order home health care. One of her patients had to wait 11 days after being discharged before his physical and occupational therapy could continue simply because the home health agency had difficulty finding a physician to certify the continuation of the same therapy that the nurse practitioner had been able to authorize when the patient was in the facility.  The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act will help to ensure that our Medicare beneficiaries get the home health care they need when they need it by allowing physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists and certified nurse midwives to order home health services. Our legislation is supported by the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, the American Nurses Association, the American Academy of Physician Assistants, the American College of Nurse Practitioners, the American College of Nurse Midwives, the American Academy of Nurse Practitioners, and the Visiting Nurse Associations of America.  I urge my colleagues to sign onto this legislation as cosponsors. I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  American Nurses Association,                                                     June 6, 2007.     Hon, Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.     Hon. Gordon Smith,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins and Smith: I am writing on behalf of      the American Nurses Association, ANA, to express support for      the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act of 2007. ANA is      the only full- service national association representing      registered nurses, RNs. Through our 54 state and territorial      nursing associations, we represent RNs across the nation in      all practice settings.       ANA applauds your efforts to improve access to home health      services. Advanced practice registered nurses, APRNs, are      playing an increasing role in American health care delivery.      Nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and      certified nurse midwives can practice independent of      physicians in most states. Many studies have shown that APRNs      provide cost-effective, high quality care. In addition, they      are often willing to provide services in areas where access      to physicians is limited.       Medicare has recognized the independent practice of APRNs      for nearly two decades, and these health care professionals      now provide the majority of skilled care to home health      patients. Unfortunately, a quirk in Medicare law has kept      APRNs from signing home health plans of care and from      certifying Medicare patients for the home health benefit. In      areas where access to physicians is limited, this outdated      prohibition has lead to delays in health care delivery. These      delays in care inconvenience patients and their families. In      addition, delays can also result in increased cost to the      Medicare system when patients are unnecessarily left in more      expensive institutional settings.       The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act of 2007 would      address these problems by specifically allowing nurse      practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, and certified      nurse midwives to certify home health services. ANA looks      forward to working with you to support the enactment of this      important legislation.           Sincerely,Rose Gonzalez, MPS, RN Director, Government Affairs.                                  ____                                               American College of                                               Nurse-Midwives,                                 Silver Spring, MD, June 14, 2007.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the certified nurse-     midwife, CNM, and certified midwife, CM, members of the      American College of Nurse-Midwives, ACNM, I am writing to      express strong support for the legislation you plan to      introduce this week to ensure appropriate and timely access      to necessary home health services for women that might be in      the care of a certified nurse-midwife or other primary care      provider.       As you know, currently Medicare only allows a physician to      order home health services for Medicare beneficiaries. ACNM      believes this is an antiquated requirement that fails to      recognize the role advanced practice nurses, including      certified nurse-midwives, play in the delivery of high      quality, primary care services. Your legislation would ensure      that a patient under the care of a certified nurse-midwife      can receive necessary home health services in a timely      manner. This is particularly important for those women with      disabilities who are covered by the Medicare program and are      of childbearing age. It is also important for senior women      who might be under the care of a certified nurse-midwife for      primary care services.       Thank you again for your leadership on this important      matter. ACNM looks forward to working with you to see this      legislation's passage during the 110th Congress. For further      information on this matter, please contact Mr. Patrick      Cooney, ACNM's Federal Representative, at (202) 347-0034.           Sincerely,                                                Eunice K.M. Ernst,     CNM, MPH, DSn(Hon), FACNM, President.                                  ____                                          National Association for                                          Home Care & Hospice,                                     Washington, DC, June 6, 2007.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the National Association      for Home Care & Hospice, NAHC, I am writing to offer our      appreciation and support for the Home Health Care Planning      Improvement Act of 2007 that would allow nurse practitioners,      NPs, clinical nurse specialists, CNSs, certified nurse      midwives, CNMs, and physicians' assistants, PAs, to sign      Medicare home health plans of care. We commend you for this      much needed legislation that will help ensure timely access      to home health services while reducing Medicare expenditures      on more costly institutional care.       NPs, CNSs, CNMs, and PAs are playing an increasing role in      the delivery of our nation's health care, especially in rural      and underserved areas, and are providing necessary medical      services to Medicare beneficiaries. They are often more      familiar with particular cases than the attending physician.      In addition, they are sometimes more readily available than      physicians to expedite the processing of necessary paperwork,      ensuring that home health agencies will be reimbursed in a      timely manner and that care to the beneficiary will not be      interrupted. Studies have shown that the expanded use of      these professionals can result in dramatic decreases in      expensive hospitalizations and nursing home stays.       We appreciate the outstanding leadership you have shown in      helping make home and community-based services more readily      available to our nation's elderly population and those with      disabilities.           With our highest regards,                                              Val J. Halamandaris,     President.                                  ____                                                 American Academy,                                       of Nurse Practitioners,                                     Washington, DC. June 7, 2007.     Senator Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: I am writing in behalf of the      American Academy of Nurse Practitioners to endorse the      introduction of the Home Health Improvement Act of 2007. This      bill will authorize nurse practitioners to order home health      services for patients for whose care they are responsible.       As you know, nurse practitioners have been authorized Part      B Medicare providers since 1998. Under the provisions of this      law, nurse practitioners render, order and refer for services      under their own PIN and UPIN numbers. They may order physical      therapy, occupational therapy, bill as consultant and      consultees when providing services through telemedicine and      order and bill for performing and interpreting diagnostic      tests within their scope of practice. Despite their ability      to provide and bill for services in all of these areas, they      are still unable to refer patients for home health care.       Nurse practitioners have been demonstrated to provide safe      and responsible care to the patients they serve. They have      expert knowledge that allows them to provide high level      assessments of patient needs and recognize when additional      care, such as home health care is needed or not needed by      their patients. Given their proven track record in the care      of the elderly, it is not logical that nurse practitioners      are authorized to be Part B providers, but are unable to      order home health care and hospice care for their patients.       Currently nurse practitioners with patients needing home      health care services must locate a physician who will see the      patient and write the orders for this care. Not only is the      patient's well being jeopardized by the delays that are      incurred by this requirement, but added cost is incurred by      the Medicare program through extra visits to providers with      higher reimbursement rates than nurse practitioners. Passage      of this bill will increase the quality and timeliness of care      to patients who need home health nursing services.           Sincerely,                                Jan Towers PhD, NP-C, CRNP, FAANP,     Director of Health Policy.                                  ____                                                 American College,                                       of Nurse Practitioners,                                                     June 7, 2007.     Hon. Susan Collins,     United States Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the American College of      Nurse Practitioners (ACNP), a national, non-profit membership      organization whose mission is to ensure a solid policy and      regulatory foundation that enables Nurse Practitioners to      continue providing accessible, high quality healthcare to the      nation--I am writing to express our appreciation to you for      introducing the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act of      2007.       The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act importantly      will amend the Social Security Act by broadening access to      home health services for Medicare beneficiaries. A patient's      Nurse Practitioner, physicians' assistant, or certified nurse      midwife will now have the right to make changes to their home      health care plan. Your critical legislation will safeguard      the patient's continuity of care by preventing interruptions      due to delays in paperwork from an oftentimes off-site      physician who may never have even seen the patient.       The bill also recognizes the professional training and      qualifications of Nurse Practitioners and ensures quality      patient care, especially in rural and underserved areas where      Nurse Practitioners are often more familiar with particular      cases than the attending physician. ACNP thanks you for your      ongoing support of the Nurse Practitioner community. Please      know that ACNP stands ready to work with you and your staff      to ensure Medicare beneficiaries have access to the highest      quality care. If we can be of any assistance, please feel      free to contact our Health Policy Advisor, Jodie Curtis      ([email protected]) or our Chief Executive Officer,      Carolyn Hutcherson ([email protected]).           Sincerely,                                            Susan Apold, PhD, ANP,     President.                                  ____                                                  American Academy                                      of Physician Assistants,                                     Alexandria, VA, June 6, 2007.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     United States Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Collins: On behalf of the more than 60,000      clinically practicing physician assistants (PAs) in the      United States represented by the American Academy of      Physician Assistants (AAPA), I thank you for introducing the      Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act of 2007. The AAPA      strongly supports this important piece of legislation, and      looks forward to working with you to secure its passage      during the 110th Congress.       In 2006, nearly 231 million patient visits were made to      physician assistants (PAs) and over 286 million prescriptions      were written by PAs. PAs have a longstanding history of      providing care in medically underserved communities, and have      been credited with improving access to quality and cost-     effective health care for many among the nation's most      vulnerable patient populations.       Although the 1997 Balanced Budget Act extended Medicare      coverage of medical services provided by PAs, as allowed by      state law, PAs are not able to order home health care for      Medicare beneficiaries. At best, PAs and their supervising      physicians are forced to go through unnecessary extra steps      to ensure that all home health orders are signed by the      physician before the care is provided. At worst, Medicare      beneficiaries experience needless delays in receiving home      health care because a physician is not available on-site to      sign the form.       The inability of PAs to order home health care is      particularly burdensome for Medicare beneficiaries in      medically underserved communities where a PA may be the only      health care professional available. For example,       Needed home health care was delayed by over a week for a      Medicare patient in Nevada, because the PA's supervising      physician was located 60 miles away. The PA, who holds a      full-time job in another part of the state, is the only      health care professional for the patient's small rural town,      providing care two weekends a month;       critical access hospitals in Nevada and other states are      having difficulty with discharge planning. By law, critical      access hospitals must have a PA or nurse practitioner on site      fifty percent of the time. However, Medicare will not accept      home health orders that have been signed by a PA;       PAs in orthopedic practice regularly work after-hours and      on weekends. However, necessary home health care must be      delayed for Medicare beneficiaries until a physician is      available to sign the order.       The Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act of 2007      increases Medicare beneficiaries' access to needed care by      allowing PAs to order home health care. The AAPA is pleased      to endorse the Home Health Care Planning Improvement Act of      2007.           Sincerely yours,                                        Mary P. Ettari, MPH, PA-C,                                                        President.                                 ______                                       By
