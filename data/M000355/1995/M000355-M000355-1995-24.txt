 Warner):  S. 1435. A bill to grant immunity from personal civil liability, under certain circumstances, to volunteers working on behalf of nonprofit organizations and governmental entities; to the Committee on the Judiciary.                      THE VOLUNTEER PROTECTION ACT  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, volunteer service has become a high-risk venture. Our ``sue happy'' legal culture has ensnared those selfless individuals who help worthy organizations and institutions through volunteer service. And, these lawsuits are proof that no good deed goes unpunished.  In order to relieve volunteers from these million dollar liability judgments, I am pleased to introduce the Volunteer Protection Act.  The litigation craze is hurting the spirit of voluntarism that is an integral part of American society. From school chaperones to Girl Scout and Boy Scout troop leaders to good samaritan doctors and nursing home aides, volunteers perform valuable services. And, these volunteers are being dragged into court and needlessly and unfairly sued. The end result? Too many people pointing fingers and too few offering a helping hand.  So, this bill creates immunity from lawsuits for those volunteers who act within the scope of their responsibilities, who are properly licensed or certified where necessary, and who do not cause harm willfully and wantonly.  In addition to creating a Federal standard for volunteer protection, the bill allows the States to add further refinements to the Federal standard. This will give the States a degree of flexibility and it strikes a balance between the federalism interest and the need to protect volunteers from these lawsuits. If a State enacts one or more of these additional criteria, the State law will be consistent with the Federal standard:  A requirement that the organization or entity adhere to risk management procedures, including the training of volunteers.  A requirement that the organization or entity be accountable for the actions of its volunteers in the same way that an employer is liable for the acts of its employees.  An exemption from the liability protection in the event the volunteer is using a motor vehicle or similar instrument.  An exemption from the liability protection if the lawsuit is brought by a State or local official in accordance with State or local law.  A requirement that the liability protection applies only if the nonprofit organization or government entity provides a financially secure source of recovery, such as an insurance policy, for those who suffer harm.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be printed in the Record and Legal Backgrounder entitled, ``Unfair Lawsuits Threaten Volunteers'' as well as the American Tort Reform Association's ``A Few Facts About Volunteer Liability'' also be printed in the Record.  Mr. President, this bill is widely supported by those organizations who rely on volunteers to provide important services to our communities. Some 150 organizations have endorsed this bill and I ask that a list of the Coalition for Volunteer Protection be printed in the Record.  I look forward to the Senate's consideration of this bill and to prompt passage. We cannot afford not to enact this legislation. Our communities are depending upon us.  There being no objection, the materials were ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1435       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Volunteer Protection Act of      1995''.     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds and declares that--       (1) the willingness of volunteers to offer their services      is deterred by potential for liability actions against them      and the organizations they serve;       (2) as a result, many nonprofit public and private      organizations and governmental entities, including voluntary      associations, social service agencies, educational      institutions, and other civic programs, have been adversely      affected by the withdrawal of volunteers from boards of      directors and service in other capacities;       (3) the contribution of these programs to their communities      is thereby diminished, resulting in fewer and higher cost      programs      than would be obtainable if volunteers were participating; and       (4) because Federal funds are expended on useful and cost-     effective social service programs, many of which are national      in scope, depend heavily on volunteer participation, and      represent some of the most successful public-private      partnerships, protection of volunteerism through      clarification and limitation of the personal liability risks      assumed by the volunteer in connection with such      participation is an appropriate subject for Federal      legislation.       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to promote the      interests of social service program beneficiaries and      taxpayers and to sustain the availability of programs,      nonprofit organizations, and governmental entities that      depend on volunteer contributions by reforming the laws to      provide protection from personal financial liability to      volunteers serving nonprofit organizations and governmental      entities for actions undertaken in good faith on behalf of      such organizations.     SEC. 3. PREEMPTION.       This Act preempts the laws of any State to the extent that      such laws are inconsistent with this Act, except that this      Act shall not preempt any State law that provides additional      incentives or protections to volunteers, or category of      volunteers.     SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON LIABILITY FOR VOLUNTEERS.       (a) Liability Protection for Volunteers.--Except as      provided in subsections (b) and (d), no volunteer of a      nonprofit organization or governmental entity shall be liable      for harm caused by an act or omission of the volunteer on      behalf of the organization or entity if--       (1) the volunteer was acting within the scope of his or her      responsibilities in the nonprofit organization or      governmental entity at the time of the act or omission;       (2) if appropriate or required, the volunteer was properly      licensed, certified, or authorized by the appropriate      authorities for the activities or practice in the State      undertaken within the scope of his or her responsibilities in      the nonprofit organization or governmental entity; and       (3) the harm was not caused by willful and wanton      misconduct by the volunteer.       (b) Concerning Responsibility of Volunteers With Respect to      Organizations.--Nothing in this section shall be construed to      affect any civil action brought by any nonprofit organization      or any governmental entity against any volunteer of such      organization or entity.       (c) No Effect on Liability of Organization.--Nothing in      this section shall be construed to affect the liability of      any nonprofit organization or governmental entity with      respect to harm caused to any person.       (d) Exceptions to Volunteer Liability Protection.--If the      laws of a State limit volunteer liability subject to one or      more of the following conditions, such conditions shall not      be construed as inconsistent with this Act:       (1) A State law that requires the organization or entity to      adhere to risk management procedures, including mandatory      training of volunteers.       (2) A State law that makes the organization or entity      liable for the acts or omissions of its volunteers to the      same extent as an employer is liable for the acts or      omissions of its employees.       (3) A State law that the limitation of liability does not      apply if the volunteer was operating a motor vehicle, vessel,      aircraft, or other vehicle for which the State requires the      operator or vehicle owner to possess an operator's license or      to maintain insurance.       (4) A State law that the limitation of liability does not      apply if the civil action was brought by an officer of a      State or local government pursuant to State or local law.       (5) A State law that the limitation of liability shall      apply only if the nonprofit organization or governmental      entity provides a financially secure source of recovery for      individuals who suffer harm as a result of actions taken by a      volunteer on behalf of the organization or entity. A      financially secure source of recovery may be an insurance      policy within specified limits, comparable coverage from a      risk pooling mechanism, equivalent assets, or alternative      arrangements that satisfy the State that the entity will be      able to pay for losses up to a specified amount. Separate      standards for different types of liability exposure may be      specified.     SEC. 5. DEFINITIONS.

SEC. 6. EFFECTIVE DATE.       This Act applies to any claim for harm caused by an act or      omission of a volunteer filed on or after the date of      enactment of this Act, without regard to whether the harm      that is the subject of the claim or the conduct that caused      the harm occurred before such date of enactment.                                                                    ____                             American Tort Reform Association,                                                   Washington, DC.                          Volunteer Liability       In October 1983, Craig Fredborg celebrated his birthday by      climbing Box Springs Mountain, overlooking Riverside,      California. To his companions' horror, Fredborg slipped on a      boulder and plummeted some 90 feet, sustaining severe spinal      injuries.       Alerted that Fredborg lay helpless on the slope, Walter      Walker, now 54, and his son Kevin, 31, and teammates from the      volunteer Riverside Mountain Rescue Unit scrambled to aid a      physician and a paramedic in mounting a ticklish nighttime      helicopter evacuation. Over the last 30 years, the unit's      volunteers have saved hundreds of lives. But for their      troubles, the Walkers and the others involved in the      emergency mission were sued two years later by the victim,      who asked $12 million in damages, claiming that `reckless and      negligent' rescue techniques had caused him to become a      quadriplegic.       The lawsuit eventually was dropped. But not before the      Walkers lost a lot of hours from their family printing      business giving depositions and meeting with defense      attorneys provided them by the county sheriff's department.      Perhaps the most significant consequence of the suit, says      Walker, is that meticulous documentation and planning      procedures have been instituted in its wake to forestall      future liability claims. `Probably we were a little weak in      that,' he concedes. Nevertheless, he adds, `It definitely has      slowed us down in getting the team into the field . . .      Concern about liability exposure has complicated how we look      at every mission.' ''--David O. Weber, ``A Thousand Points of      Fright?'', Insurance Review, February 1991.       A man who was high on LSD was rescued by a student, after      he had jumped from a 30 foot dockside bar into a seven foot      pool of water. The man suffered a broken neck and was left      paralyzed for life. However, he subsequently sued both the      school and the student. The judge eventually threw the case      out, but unfortunately, this is just another prime example of      a waste of tax payers money.--Mississippi Press, May 2, 1993.       ``Amateur referees at softball diamonds, high school      stadiums and college field houses are finding that their      decisions can trigger major-league lawsuits.'' An Iowa      souvenir company faced with a suddenly devalued inventory      challenged the last-second foul call of a part-time Big Ten      basketball official with a $175,000 negligence suit. The      official eventually won his court battle, but only after a      costly two-year fight that went all the way to the Iowa      Supreme Court.       ``Some of our people got to the point where they were just      afraid to work because of the threat of lawsuits,'' says      Dottie Lewis of the Southwest Officials Association in      Dallas. The Association provides officials for scholastic      games.       A New Jersey umpire was sued by a catcher who was hit in      the eye by a softball while playing without a mask; he      complained that the umpire should have lent him his. The      catcher walked away with a $24,000 settlement.--The Wall      Street Journal, Friday, August 11, 1989.       58% of the principals responding to a survey sponsored by      the National Association of Secondary School Principals said      that they had noticed a difference in the kinds of school      programs being offered in schools because of liability      concerns, and the use of non-faculty volunteers was affected.      Typically, parent volunteers assist schools with tutoring,      science programs, class trips and social activities.--1989      Survey Members of the National Association of Secondary      School Principals.                                                                    ____              National Coalition for Volunteer Protection       Academy of Medicine of Columbus and Franklin County, Air      Force Association, Alabama Forestry Association, Alabama      Oilmens Association, Alabama Textile Manufacturers      Association, Alliance for Fire and Emergency Management,      American Association of Blood Banks, American Association      of Equine Practitioners, American Association of Museums, American      Association of Nurserymen, American Association of      Occupational Health Nurses, American Chamber of Commerce      Executives, American College of Emergency Physicians--     National Office.

Unfair Lawsuits Threaten Volunteers                     (By William J. Cople III) \1\       Volunteer service is under assault from an unlikely      quarter--the civil justice system. Like so many others,      volunteers and their service organizations have been swept      into the courts to face potential liability in civil suits.      Under the rule of law, our actions are judged by common      standards of conduct. This provides the basis for the courts      to recognize rights and afford remedies to those who claim to      be aggrieved. But civil justice should not be used recklessly      to inhibit beneficial conduct that may involve some amount of      risk. In order for volunteer service to survive and prosper,      the civil justice system must find an equilibrium under which      it recognizes and protects personal and property rights      without stifling the volunteer spirit so necessary to a vital      and self-reliant community.     \1\ William J. Cople III is a partner with the Washington,      D.C. law firm of Spriggs & Hollingsworth and serves pro bono      as the General Counsel of the National Capital Area Council      of the Boy Scouts of America.---------------------------------------------------------------------------       Efforts to achieve this balance have been hindered by the      civil justice system itself. Both federal and state courts      seem to be trapped in a disturbing pattern of recognizing      novel rights and enlarging the scope of existing rights in an      effort to redress a multitude of real and perceived wrongs      and injuries. The courts have regrettably found rights, and      corresponding remedies, to exist in cases involving      grievances that are trivial or mundane and in cases where      acts or omissions were not previously understood to be a      legal wrong. In other cases, judges and juries have found      serious injuries and other matters of grave concern to      deserve recompense, even though the legal duty was uncertain      or the causal connection to the harm was attenuated.       As a result, the value of rights that historically have      been recognized in the courts as a proper subject of redress      has been debased by according them respect no greater than      the most tenuous rights now being recognized. Moreover, the      expansion of potential liability may diminish desirable and      beneficial conduct, such as the willingness to serve as a      volunteer. In the past, the courts seem to have understood      that some circumstances, even ones of tragic proportion, are      simply caused by accident or misfortune, and not necessarily      by culpable conduct on the part of any other person. Yet,      this now has become an unacceptable conclusion. Every      conceivable circumstance in which we deal and interact with      each other seems to create a victim. This has spawned the      civil litigation clogging the courts, as every victim of      circumstances seeks compensation by shifting the blame for      those circumstances to someone else.       An unfortunate effect of this civil litigation is to      heighten the risks of volunteer service. In thousands of      service organizations, volunteers give freely of their time      and effort to support activities that they believe to be      worthwhile for a host of personal reasons. This is done      without expectation of compensation or other remuneration of      any kind. Nonetheless, many volunteer organizations have been      forced by the growing threat of civil litigation to purchase      and maintain liability insurance or other forms of legal      indemnity covering volunteers for their services.       Even with insurance coverage, the increasing risk of      litigation no doubt has a chilling effect on the willingness      and enthusiasm of volunteers to donate their time and effort.      Many volunteers may think twice before becoming involved,      while others may continue to participate, but curtail their      services to those activities that seem relatively risk-free.      Still others may cease to be a volunteer, out of an abundance      of caution and justifiable aversion to being caught up in      civil litigation. Quantifying the effects of increased risk      of civil liability on volunteer service will have to await      empirical evidence. It is fair to say, however, that      volunteers themselves have become victims of the civil      justice system. The increasing propensity to enlarge the      universe of rights and award compensation, often in stunning      amounts, may be to the detriment of volunteer service.       This danger was illustrated recently in a personal injury      lawsuit brought against volunteers serving a local council of      the Boy Scouts of America. In a case brought in Oregon state      court, Powell v. Boy Scouts of America, et al., a youth      seriously injured in an activity sponsored by Scouting sued      the Boy Scouts and its adult volunteers for negligence.       The Boy Scouts of America is a national volunteer service      organization, chartered by the U.S. Congress in 1916,      pursuant to 36 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 21-29. Acting primarily      through its volunteers, the Boy Scouts is dedicated to the      training of youth in accordance with long-established      Scouting ideals and principles. Id. Sec. 23. The Boy Scouts      operates      through several hundred local Scout councils. Community organizations      within each Council, including churches, schools, and civic      groups, among others, conduct Scouting programs and      activities. The availability of these programs and activities      depends upon individual volunteers willing to devote      considerable time and effort in providing adult supervision      for participating Scouts. These volunteers provide their time      and resources to support the Council and the local      organizations. They not only develop and plan the Scouting      activities, but also raise the funds in the community      necessary to support them. Without these volunteers, the Boy      Scouts would be deprived of its principal resource for      carrying out its national charter as a youth service      organization.       In the Powell case, several adults in Portland, Oregon      volunteered to supervise an outing of the Sea Explorers, a      Scouting unit in the Boy Scouts' Cascade Pacific Council. In      a tragic accident, one of the young men participating in the      Sea Explorer outing suffered a paralyzing injury in a rough      game of touch football. The injured youth, who was 16 years      of age at the time of the accident, broke his neck during the      football game and is now quadriplegic. At least one of the      adult volunteers apparently knew that the boys were throwing      a football around, but neither observed the game in which the      boy was injured.       Based on this incident, the injured youth filed a personal      injury lawsuit against the Boy Scouts and the Columbia      Pacific Council (predecessor to Cascade Pacific Council) in      Multnomah County Circuit Court, Oregon. The suit alleged that      the youth's injury was foreseeable and preventable, and that      the Boy Scouts and its volunteers negligently failed to      supervise him adequately during the Sea Explorer outing.       The Court dismissed the original lawsuit, evidently based      on an insufficient nexus between the Boy scouts and the      youth's injury. Subsequently, the injured young man filed his      personal injury lawsuit directly against two of the adult      volunteers who participated in the Sea Explorer outing.      Following trial, an Oregon jury entered a verdict against the      two adult volunteers, finding them liable for some $7      million. In one of the largest monetary verdicts in Oregon,      the jury awarded $4.89 million dollars for future care and      lost earnings plus $2.14 million dollars for pain and      suffering. In accordance with Oregon state law, the amount of      the verdict will be reduced by the proportionate negligence,      approximately one-third, that the jury assigned to the      injured youth for his own negligent conduct. The Oregon      Circuit Judge presiding at trial also reduced the amount      awarded by the jury for pain and suffering to $500,000,      reflecting a statutory limit on non-economic damages that may      be awarded in personal injury suits in Oregon.       The Oregon jury's verdict in this case against the Sea      Explorer adult volunteers brings the civil justice dilemma      into striking focus. The case was born of a tragic accident      in which a young man's life and future were forever changed      by a debilitating permanent injury. But this tragedy may have      been compounded, not alleviated, by finding culpability and      imposing liability on the adult volunteers under      circumstances suggesting an enlargement of the volunteers'      legal duty. The jury seemingly held the volunteers to a      standard of care requiring them constantly to supervise the      youth entrusted to their charge, even for activities which      under other circumstances may routinely be permitted without      such meticulous oversight.       Any parent entrusting their children to the care and      supervision of another should expect and demand that all      reasonable and prudent care be taken in discharging that      responsibility. However, this does not mean that this duty of      care must be carried out in such an extraordinary manner that      only constant supervision of the youth in their care,      regardless of age and other factors, will suffice for      volunteers to satisfy their legal responsibility. Certainly,      the circumstances surrounding tragic incidents should be      carefully examined. All relevant facts and circumstances      should be given due weight and consideration in judging      whether an adult volunteer has adequately met the      responsibility to supervise a child entrusted to his care.      But circumstances will nonetheless occur where senseless      tragedies happen without anyone being legally to blame. As in      the case of other legal duties, adequate supervision should      mean reasonable and prudent conduct as required under the      circumstances as they existed at the time. Organizations      serving the youth in our community, as well as those      fulfilling other beneficent purposes, should not be forced      into the role of guaranteeing a safe harbor free of all risk.      Likewise, neither should volunteers be held a standard that      may be infeasible, or even unattainable.       To choose otherwise would mean that the civil justice      system needs to resolve every mishap and inexplicable tragedy      by identifying someone to bear legal responsibility for a      victim of those circumstances. This may, or may not, have      happened in the case of the Multnomah County Circuit Court      jury's verdict against the Scout volunteers. But the      circumstances of the case, and the available evidence that      has been reported, seem to suggest that the jury overreached      in an effort to assign blame.       As is the case of the Oregon verdict against the Sea      Explorer volunteers, there are a great many cases involving      injury to person, property, or other rights, which are      anything but trivial. In fact, their dimensions may be so      tragic that such cases motivate judges or juries to find      fault and assign blame where it might otherwise hesitate and      decline to do so. The judgments entered in such cases,      however, have other serious consequences. They obscure the      standards of conduct under which we should expect to comport      ourselves. This expectation of being able to determine,      before we act, whether we are engaging in conduct that is      right or wrong is a critical component to civil justice.      Moreover, when civil litigation affords redress to every      injury, regardless of whether the circumstances justify it      under the rule of law, those rights that are long established      and highly prized are commensurately demeaned. If virtually      every injury is entitled to compensation, then the most      important rights become lost in the sea of compensable      grievances that the courts recognize. Finally, we need to      underscore that a legal judgment entered in a single case can      have a multitude of consequences extending far beyond that      case itself. This surely is a reason for concern in the case      of volunteers to service organizations.       The Boy Scouts afford their volunteers certain insurance      liability coverage or other indemnity for their acts or      omissions that may occur in the course of providing services      as a Scouting volunteer. This coverage is far from unlimited.      Similarly, other youth service and charitable organizations      may also be able to provide such insurance coverage for their      volunteers, but still others may not. Even with insurance      coverage available, many of the most talented and energetic      volunteers may eschew volunteer service, fearing that their      good intentions will buy themselves a lawsuit. This is a      particularly invidious effect, which is difficult to measure      and even harder to correct. Existing and prospective      volunteers may refuse to participate in many organizations      out of a genuine concern with accepting an unreasonable risk      of potential liability. Volunteers who might otherwise be      motivated to serve may be deterred from doing so based solely      on this concern for liability.       The Supreme Court of the United States aptly characterized      the problem in Parratt v. Taylor 451 U.S. 527, 101 S. Ct.      1908 (1981). In Parratt, a prisoner, who lost his mail order      hobby materials when normal procedures for receipt of mail      packages were not followed, brought a federal civil rights      case for the alleged deprivation of a Constitutional right.      In its decision in that case, the Court seemed to forewarn      the civil justice system that not every wrong is entitled to      redress as a violation of Constitutional rights because      ``[i]t is hard to perceive any logical stopping place for      such a line of reasoning.'' Id. at 544. The Court's      observation, though made in the context of a civil rights      suit more than ten years ago, is equally salient today. The      civil justice system should not recognize a legal right for      every victim of circumstances. The rule of law should be used      to define our standards of conduct and promote consistency      and reasonable expectations in their application. The case      involving the Sea Explorer volunteers in Oregon serves to      reveal a truth. Despite the best of intentions, when misused      or used in unpredictable ways, the civil justice system ends      up serving no one, least of all those who volunteer.                                 ______      By
