Chairman, it is my understanding that under the rules, this amendment is not in order and, therefore, I am forced to withdraw the amendment, but in no way do I wish to diminish the importance of the concept that I have been discussing here this evening. I would really beg for the Chair's consideration as time goes on and for the ranking member's consideration of this important issue of renewable biofuels as a critical part of what our Department of Agriculture should be involved in.
