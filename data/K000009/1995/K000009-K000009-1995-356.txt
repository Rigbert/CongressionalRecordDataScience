Speaker, I rise to honor the life of an extraordinary woman, Mrs. Eleanor Kahle of Toledo, who died at the age of 78 years young on August 13, 1995. Councilwoman and vice mayor emeritus, Eleanor Kahle, was a citizen-stateswoman, a mentor, a team player, and a friend to thousands. Her passing leaves a void in our community no one can adequately fill.  Eleanor (Konieczka) Kahle, Polish-American by heritage, began her life on September 10, 1916, in what was then the small community of Sylvania outside of the city of Toledo. At the time of her death, she had become a citizen of the world. In fact, though over her lifetime she received recognitions too numerous to mention, the one she cherished most was her last, that of being named National Volunteer of the Year of Sister Cities International.  It has been said that Eleanor Kahle had four careers in her life: that of wife and mother of six children, pastoral associate in the Catholic Church, executive director of the West Toledo Senior Center, and elected official in the city of Toledo. In all of these careers, Eleanor Kahle forged new ground. She took no responsibility more seriously than raising her six sons as a young widow, and delighted in their achievements as adults and in their children's.  She was also a devoted woman of the church. There did not exist such a position as pastoral associate in the diocesan Catholic Church until Eleanor Kahle pursued its creation. In the 1970's as a pastoral associate, she was essentially the highest ranking woman in the Catholic Church, performing nearly all of the duties of the priesthood with the exception of the celebration of the Mass and the Sacraments.  Doggedly pursuing the creation of a senior citizens center for several years in spite of tremendous opposition, she oversaw the birth of the thriving West Toledo Senior Center in 1979, directing its growth until her retirement in 1993. Today that center stands, 5,000 seniors strong, housed in a large, pleasant, refurbished building, as a true legacy to her.  In 1983, I was honored by her service on my congressional staff in Washington as a special assistant on senior citizen issues, guiding and advising me as Congress debated changes in the Social Security system to assure its future solvency. She approached that opportunity with the zest, intelligence, and dedication that characterized her entire life.  In 1987, at the age of 70, when most people would not dream of making such a major change in their life, Eleanor began her stellar political career as an elected official winning a seat on Toledo's city council. Four years later, in 1991, she finished first in the city council races among a field of eight, and was elected the city's vice mayor, one of only two women in Toledo history to rise to the post. Always planning and working toward unmet horizons she kept up the brisk pace of public life right until her unexpected illness, and never wavered from the idea that she might return to her duties. It was during her career as a councilwoman that Eleanor Kahle committed herself to the Sister Cities International ideals. She traveled abroad extensively as a goodwill ambassador for Toledo and our Nation, establishing new relationships with the cities of Szeged, Hungary, and Poznan, Poland. She hosted dozens of visitors in her home and was Toledo's most dedicated ambassador-at-large.  In every endeavor, Eleanor Kahle conducted herself with grace, dignity, and eloquence. In her own mind, she never had to be the leader, ``just wanted to make sure the job got done.'' Yet in her persevering and joyful way, she led her community forward always, many times as a lone pioneer. Who can forget the twinkle in her eye or her cherubic grin. In the words of her children, while describing her and comparing her to the roses she so enjoyed, Eleanor Kahle was ``a true American beauty.''  In special memory of Eleanor's life, in honor of her gifts and talents, and in recognition of her achievements and the special roles she fulfilled so exceptionally in our community, our Nation, and our world, the Eleanor Kahle Memorial Scholarship Fund will be established at Lourdes College, to be awarded to a nontraditional student who wishes to pursue those goals which Eleanor cherished and toward which she strove. This scholarship will stand as a legacy to Eleanor, her life, and her ideals. On behalf of all the citizens of our community whose lives have been improved by her vigilant work, let us publicly thank her as well as her family for their selfless devotion to others. We shall miss her always and be inspired by her life's work. She remains our true friend.                          ____________________
