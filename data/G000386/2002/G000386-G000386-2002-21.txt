 President, I rise today to bring to your attention an outstanding individual, Eric C. Hurst of Minot, ND.  This young man tragically lost his life in an attempt to rescue one of my fellow Iowans. Mr. Hurst loved his job as a canoe guide in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness in Minnesota. While working on July 30, 2002, Mr. Hurst witnessed a young lady, Jamie Christenson, drowning in the boundary Waters near Basswood Falls. Without hesitation, Mr. Hurst dove in to rescue Ms. Christenson. Unfortunately, both Mr. Hurst and Ms. Christenson were pulled under water by the strong undercurrent. When they surfaced, revival attempts were futile.  Although this story has a tragic ending, we must not forget the heroism displayed by Eric Hurst. He was willing to try to save Ms. Christenson from the turbulent waters of Basswood Falls without regard to the danger it posed to his own life. This is truly the ultimate sacrifice one can make.  It is with deep respect and great sadness that I recognize Mr. Eric C. Hurst before this body of Congress and this nation for his unselfish act of heroism. Eric Hurst and Jamie Christenson will be missed by the many people they touched in their life and I express my sincere condolences to their families.                          ____________________
