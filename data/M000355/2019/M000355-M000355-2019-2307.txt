 President, after 16 years of service to the people of Taylor County, KY, Judge-Executive Eddie Rogers is beginning his retirement. My friend leaves behind a legacy of passion for the men and women he represented, and I would like to take a moment to acknowledge Eddie's career in public service and to thank him for his commitment to Taylor County.  Eddie first entered the county's top job in 1999, and he worked closely with the members of the fiscal court to address the challenges facing the area. He made some difficult choices, but as he looked back on his career, Eddie said he always did what he thought was best to help attract new jobs to Taylor County and provide new opportunity for Kentuckians.  Serving in office a second time beginning in 2006, Eddie's leadership secured several major accomplishments for the county that will continue to be enjoyed for years to come. During Eddie's tenure, he oversaw the opening of the Taylor County Judicial Center and the construction of a new fire department. The county also built a new animal shelter, and in the near future, a technology center will open as a result of Eddie's work. These buildings will stand as lasting landmarks to Eddie's service and his success in Taylor County.  At his final fiscal court meeting as judge-executive, the county's other elected officials thanked Eddie for his leadership, his collaborative nature, and his record of achievement. They also noted his work with the Kentucky Association of Counties, helping other communities across the Commonwealth. In addition to his tireless work for Taylor County, Eddie's colleagues also thanked him for his personal friendship. I can echo those sentiments and say I have enjoyed working with Eddie on a broad range of projects for the community and our home State. Joined by members of his family, Eddie adjourned his last meeting with the appreciation of many throughout Taylor County.  At the end of his 16 years of dedication, Eddie has a lot to be proud of, and I would like to thank him for his hard work. With his children, Michele, Wynn, and Natalie, and his grandchildren, Dalton and Laine, I hope he will enjoy a well-earned retirement. I ask my Senate colleagues to join me in congratulating Eddie for his years of service to Kentucky.  (At the request of Mr. Schumer, the following statement was ordered to be printed in the Record.)                          ____________________
