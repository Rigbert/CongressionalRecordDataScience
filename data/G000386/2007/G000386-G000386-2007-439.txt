 President, I would like to take a moment today to honor the distinguished civil service career of a particularly remarkable Iowan. Mr. Robert ``Bob'' Crawford will be retiring shortly from his civilian service to the Department of the Army and in doing so will leave behind a legacy of exceptional support and dedication to his work and to his country.  Over the years, Bob Crawford has amassed a series of professional accomplishments that are truly outstanding. His commitment to his work has earned him a Commander's Award for Civilian Service and he has twice been awarded the Superior Civilian Service Award. Bob's hard work, honesty, and leadership have become defining characteristics of his career and he has earned the respect of his colleagues and peers for his many years of expertise.  Bob Crawford currently works as the Deputy to the commander for the U.S. Army Joint Munitions Command, JMC, where he is entrusted to maintain the development and production of the ammunition supply for our brave service men and women overseas. Before serving in this capacity, Bob worked in a number of different roles within the ammunition production industry, ranging from a production engineer, to a production director, to a deputy for operations, and finally to his current position. While his responsibilities have shifted and grown over the years, Bob Crawford's commitment to the values of the Department of the Army has remained as steadfast and unwavering as ever.  As early as his time at the University of Illinois and then at St. Ambrose University, Bob has been distinguishing himself within his field and I am glad to be able to congratulate him and honor his magnificent career as it now comes to a close. I wish Bob and his wife Sharon and their children in Bettendorf, IA, the very best of luck for the future and I thank him for his 25 years of public service.                          ____________________
