 President.  I thank my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, for offering this amendment I offered in the Budget Committee. I can tell you, as a working parent, one of the most critical issues that faces parents every single morning across this country is, will my child have a place to be? I have had the experience, and I guess that many parents across this country have had the experience, of dropping their child off at day care on a Friday and have them say to you, ``We will not be here on Monday. We decided to go out of the business.'' There is nothing worse that can happen to you in a day than to all of a sudden panic and try to find a place to put your child who may be 2, 3, 8, or 10, and you know they need a safe place, you know you need to be at work Monday morning, and there is nowhere for your child.  Mr. President, across this country businesses are recognizing this critical issue because they know they need their employees to be productive. A productive employee is not sitting at work worrying about whether their child is safe or taken care of; a productive employee is one who knows their child is all right. This amendment simply puts in place a placeholder so that this Congress will address the issue that is discussed at almost every kitchen table of every family across this country.  I thank my colleague from Connecticut for being a leader on this issue for so many years.
