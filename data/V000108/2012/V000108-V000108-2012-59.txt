 First, I would like to say that I hope that we will not begin to legislate every rule coming out of the Department of Energy on this particular bill, though I understand the frustration that the Department of Energy is capable of causing from time to time. However, in this instance, I do understand that the Department is responding to the concerns expressed by the gentleman from Nebraska, and it is anticipated that a resolution is expected soon.  On that basis, I do not oppose the amendment as a gentle reminder for the Department to address this issue expeditiously.  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.
