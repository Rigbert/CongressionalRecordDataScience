Speaker, it seems to me that it is very revealing that when my Republican friends feel strongly about the budget, they enshrine their views in the Constitution. But when it comes to protecting senior citizens, for the last half hour we have heard every manner of argument as to why Social Security really does not need constitutional protection.  I am of the view that on a bipartisan basis Social Security deserves legally binding, constitutionally protected safety. Unfortunately, this resolution does not do that.  Senior citizens deserve better, and on a bipartisan basis we should make sure that it gets done.
