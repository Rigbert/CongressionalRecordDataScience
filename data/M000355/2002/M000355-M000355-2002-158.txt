 President, today I recognize the achievements of a great Kentuckian. Dr. Lee Todd has not yet completed his first year as President of the University of Kentucky, but he has already left his mark on Kentucky's largest public educational institution. His approach to academic governance has earned him the accolades of both the students and faculty of the University of Kentucky, as well as from local community leaders.  Dr. Todd's success at UK should not come as a surprise. As an alumnus of the University, he understands the interests and passions of the students. His training and tenure as an academic has given him a detailed understanding of the challenges and needs of the faculty. And his career as a successful businessman has well-prepared him to forge an efficient and responsive administration that is dually committed to crafting excellence in education and enhancement of UK's endowment. I have no doubt that he will succeed at both goals.  Building upon the achievements of his predecessors, Dr. Todd has continued to bring top-notch research and teaching faculty to Kentucky. In addition, he has forged greater cooperation with and stronger ties to the Lexington community--a relationship that promises to be mutually beneficial. From UK's truly exceptional Medical Center to its important agricultural research, the University of Kentucky is not merely a preeminent state educational institution, but a tremendous asset to the Lexington community and the entire Commonwealth of Kentucky. Likewise, President Todd has worked to create a partnership with the federal government, a partnership I look forward to continuing in the future.  President Lee Todd has brought with him innovative ideas and a commitment to excellence at the University of Kentucky. I hope that the students of the University and the people of Kentucky are lucky enough to have President Todd at the helm for a very long time. Kentucky is fortunate to be able to claim Dr. Todd, his wife Patsy, and his children Troy and Kathryn as citizens.  I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking Dr. Todd for his service to the Commonwealth of Kentucky and to higher education.                          ____________________
