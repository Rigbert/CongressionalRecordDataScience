Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, just wanted to thank the gentleman from California [Mr. Riggs] from the authorizing committee and say we will welcome the work of his committee later this fall.  In addition to that, I think WIC is one of the most audited and studied programs in the entire Government of the United States. There are currently four studies ongoing on the program which I know will enlighten the gentleman's work, including one that the Committee on the Budget is doing in conjunction with the GAO.  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Obey].
