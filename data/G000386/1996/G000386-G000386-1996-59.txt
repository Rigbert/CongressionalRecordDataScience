 President, a few steps from this Capitol Building is a combat zone. In just a few blocks from here lies the killing ground that is one of the consequences of the illegal drug trade in this country. On average, over 400 people in Washington are murdered every year. That is roughly 60 lives lost per 100,000 population. The national average is 6 per 100,000. That makes Washington the Nation's murder capital. Those casualties, the lives lost and maimed, occur in just a few neighborhoods. They are not spread out over the whole city. Much of this carnage is directly the result of drugs and the harm that they cause, a harm that falls disproportionately on a few neighborhoods.  Now, virtually every ounce of illegal drug you can buy within a stone's throw of here--and that is just about any drug you could want in any quantity you care to buy--is produced overseas. It is imported into this country. Washington is not on the border with Mexico. We don't grow poppies in ward 6 or coca in Anacostia. These drugs find their way here in commercial cargo, in motor homes, in peoples' stomachs. They fly, walk, drive, and float into this country every day in a thousand ways. That availability is killing us. But the story does not stop here.  The criminal thugs that bring drugs into this country are not philanthropists. They are in the business to make money. And lots of it. That's why they come to the world's largest emporium. And they do well. But that leaves them with the problem of what to do with all the loot: how to turn all that dirty money into nice, clean cash. To do this, they exploit our banks and business. They smuggle cash out in bulk. They use our electronic highways.  As the Center for Technology Assessment noted last year, our ``Financial institutions and their wire transfer systems provide the battleground to control money laundering.'' Criminal gangs employ a thousand techniques that fertile imaginations--the best that money can buy--can devise. They do all of this in defiance of our laws, in vicious contempt for common decency. And when these sorry riches find their way into secure havens, they are then used to corrupt and intimidate individuals, institutions, and whole governments. The vicious cycle is complete and begins again.  These criminal gangs, to push their drugs and launder their millions, make use of the very same systems that are the sources of our prosperity. They smuggle drugs in and they sneak the cash out. They exploit our financial processes and our commercial mechanisms to do this. We must not permit this to happen. There in lies our dilemma.  On the one hand, we must decide on those policies and practices that will most effectively facilitate our trade and finance. We must do this in order to sustain our continued prosperity and competitiveness. On the other hand, we must decide how best to discourage the criminal exploitation of our financial systems and our commercial arrangements. This clash of interests is no easy problem to deal with, but deal with it we must.  Unfortunately, this country has a major drug problem. As it is in virtually every other area of economic activity, the United States is the world's largest market for illegal drugs. Americans have more money and more time than do many other people. This means that every entrepreneur in the world is out to make it big in the U.S. market. Some of the most skilled, intelligent, and ruthless of these entrepreneurs are drug traffickers.  We are not dealing here with mom-and-pop operations. We are dealing with well-financed, international business enterprises with a global reach. They are sophisticated and dangerous. Let there be no mistake, the criminal organizations that traffic in drugs or other illegal goods are among the most significant threats to our well-being that we currently face.  The major international criminal organizations--based in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America--now disposeof economic resources that enable them to defy local and international law. They are richer than many countries. They are ruthless, and they are remorseless. Either through a process of threat and intimidation or by bribery and financial manipulation, they are able to challenge the authority of governments. They are able to undermine the integrity of public and private institutions. Where they cannot suborn they subvert. Where they cannot corrupt they kill.  The rollcall of countries currently facing direct and serious challenges from these groups is disturbing. Today criminal gangs in Russia, China, Italy, Nigeria, Mexico, and Colombia openly operate or have been able to penetrate into the depths of the political, social, and economic systems in those countries. Many smaller countries, without the range of resources available elsewhere, are simply overmatched and outmaneuvered in trying to enforce their own sovereignty. In some cases, criminal penetration has become so serious that it raises questions about the future stability of the country in question. There is growing concern about the ability of many governments, often deeply penetrated by criminal corruption, to respond meaningfully--if at all--to these criminal gangs.  In addition, banks and businesses pay out billions of dollars every year, directly or indirectly, to these same criminal gangs. Whether in protection money or in losses suffered from sophisticated scams. Whether in extortion or swindles, individual businesses and national economies are routinely ripped off, to the tune of billions of dollars annually, by ruthless criminal thugs.  The cost of their activities are not paid out just in the crimes that they commit. They also exact a cost in terms of trust. They undermine good faith. When left unchecked, they pervert the very ideas of a free market. The bleed public establishments of public support. They threaten democratic institutions and the social, political, and economic circumstances that must sustain those institutions. We can see that process at work in Colombia, and Russia, and next door in Mexico. But the problem does not stop here.  In this country, these criminal gangs daily kill and maim more Americans than have suffered at the hands of terrorist bombs. They have done more damage to our social fabric and well-being than has any rogue political leader in Libya or Iran. They have caused more real harm in a day than all the illegal videotapes produced in China. Through the drugs that these scoundrels make and sell, they sow havoc in our homes and neighborhoods, on our streets, and in our clinics.  We must take the steps necessary to ensure that our citizens are secure from harm and that the very processes of our well-being are protected from abuse. We must ensure that the free-trade highway does not become an expressway for drug smuggling. We have to ensure that banking without borders does not become an opportunity for banking without conscience. But how to do that without smothering legitimate activity? We must devise the means to disrupt criminal enterprise without destroying free markets. We must ensure effective international cooperation and yet work with countries often incapable of taking effective action. We must lead, but we cannot succeed without cooperation.  That is what this hearing is about. We must look at what we are doing and what we can do better. We need to consider what works and what does not. We need to cast a critical eye on our actions and those of our allies and friends to determine what more we can do. I am concerned that our policies are not up to the task. I am concerned that we have put our priorities in the wrong places. Frankly, we have a long way to go and a lot of work ahead of us. More kids are starting to use drugs. We are seeing more calls for legalization. We have dropped the ball on fighting back.  In the meantime, the criminals are getting richer and more sophisticated. As we face 21st century thugs, we need 21st century G-men. We need to be smarter and faster. We need to be focused and consistent. As one Treasury official put it, money laundering is a ``crime hidden in the details of legitimate commerce.'' The same is true for smuggling. The devil is in the details. It is the details that we want to get at. It is how to respond effectively to the details of these criminal activities that we must address in our policies.                          ____________________
