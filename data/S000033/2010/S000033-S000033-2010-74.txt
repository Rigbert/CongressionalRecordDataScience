 President, what we are talking about now is beginning to address the deficit issue in a significant way, and $25 billion over a 10-year period is a good start. I think we cannot continue to have people coming down to the floor of the Senate and saying: Think about the legacy we are leaving our children and grandchildren. And then when it really comes to the point of doing something, of saying to ExxonMobil, which made $19 billion in profit last year and got a $156 million refund from the IRS, you can't have it both ways, this is a time to stand up and do the right thing. Again, it is not just ExxonMobil. It is Chevron, which received a $19 million refund from the IRS. It is Valero Energy, the 25th largest company in America with $68 billion of sales last year and received a $157 million refund check.  What we have the opportunity to do now is to, in fact, address the deficit crisis--$25 billion over a 10-year period; create over 100,000 new jobs over that period as we move into energy efficiency and sustainable energy.  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.
