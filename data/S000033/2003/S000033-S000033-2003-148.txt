 Speaker, I am enclosing a letter that I recently wrote to Michael Powell, Chairman of the FCC, regarding the growing consolidation of media ownership in America. This letter is especially relevant today as the FCC is now in the process of eliminating the few remaining regulations which would stop further consolidation of the industry.                                                 February 27, 2003       Dear Chairman Powell, let's be clear. One of the great      crises facing this country is that a handful of huge      corporations control the flow of information. Whether it is      television, radio, newspapers, magazines, books or the      Internet, fewer and fewer giant conglomerates are determining      what we see, hear and read. Unless we stop this trend and      create a media with much broader ownership and diversity of      opinion, it is not certain that democracy will survive in      this country. This is a major, major concern that must be      dealt with immediately. I fear very much that if we continue      down the path we're on, we will end up like the former Soviet      Union--a nation where there were many different news outlets,      but all were controlled by the same entity. The difference is      that in this country it will be multi-national corporations      who control the media, and not the government.       Let me express my outrage that the FCC has chosen to have      only one public hearing on what is one of the most important      issues facing Americans today. Before any decisions are made      regarding deregulation and increased corporate control over      the media, the FCC must hear from the American people. In my      view, the FCC should hold at least twenty meetings across the      country to hear directly what ordinary the people have to      say. Having held two town meetings in the state of Vermont on      the issue of media consolidation, I can tell you first hand      that the people of this country want to be heard on this      issue. In Vermont, at the two public meetings that we held,      over 600 people came out. I guarantee that you will have huge      audiences all over the country and, let me take this      opportunity to invite you to Vermont. Please do not make a      decision without input from the people. Given what goes on in      Washington it may be hard to believe, but there are opinions      in this country which do not necessarily agree with Rupert      Murdoch, General Electric, the Disney Corporation.and other      large campaign contributors.       Why do we want more de-regulation and more concentration of      ownership in the media. We should be moving in the other      direction--less concentration, more diverse ownership and      more points of view. Television is the means by which most      Americans get their ``news.'' Without exception, every major      network is owned by a huge conglomerate that has      enormous conflicts of interest. Fox News Channel is owned      by Rupert Murdoch, a right-wing billionaire who already      owns a significant portion of the world's media. His      network has close ties to the Republican Party, and among      his ``fair and balanced'' commentators is Newt Gingrich.       NBC is owned by General Electric, one of the largest      corporations in the world and a company with enormous      conflicts of interest. GE has a long history of anti-union      activity. It has substantial interests in weapons      manufacturing, finance, nuclear power and many other      industries. It has vital concerns about our trade policy as      they have been one of the leaders in shutting down American      plants and moving them to low-wage countries like China and      Mexico. GE is also an important contributor to the Republican      Party.       ABC is owned by the Disney Corp., which produces toys and      products in developing countries where they provide their      workers atrocious wages and working conditions. CBS is owned      by Viacom, another huge media conglomerate that owns, among      other entities, MTV, Showtime, Nickelodeon, VHI, TNN, CMT, 39      broadcast television stations, 184 radio stations, Paramount      Pictures and Blockbuster Inc.       The essential problem with television is not just a right-     wing corporate bias in news and programming, or the      transformation of politics and government into entertainment      and sensationalism. Nor is it just the constant bombardment      of advertising, much of it directed at children. It's that      the most important issues facing the middle-class and working      people of our country are rarely discussed. The average      American watches dozens of hours a week of television, but to      a very significant degree does not see his or her reality      reflected on the screen.       In my strong opinion what the people of this country see,      hear and read should not be controlled by a handful of multi-     national conglomerates. More concentration of ownership in      the media industry would be a disaster for this country. Stop      the deregulation, and begin hearings on how we can have more      diverse ownership and more divergent viewpoints on the public      airwaves. Democracy is too precious to be given over to      corporations interested only in growing bigger and more      profitable. The airwaves and cable-ways belong to the people,      and the interests of the people should be served.       Thank you for your consideration.           Sincerely,                                                  Bernard Sanders,     U.S. Congressman.                          ____________________
