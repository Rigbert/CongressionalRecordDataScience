 President, tomorrow in Charleston will be a citywide day of mourning for the nine firefighters who died, rushing into the blazing furniture store to try to save a life. I rise to pay my respects to those fallen heroes and to their families.  The other day, when I heard the fire chief, Rusty Thomas, say he lost nine of his best friends, I know what he meant. So does every Senator in this Chamber because firefighters are the best things our communities have.  They risk their lives every day we lay a heavy, heavy responsibility on them. But think of how many countless lives are saved because of their dedication, because they will find the people trapped inside a burning building.  I remember when our former colleague from Charleston, Senator Hollings, had the terrible fire that burned his home, it was those same South Carolina firefighters who came to help one of our own.  Whether they are in Charleston or the volunteers in Claymont, DE, where I come from, when they are done putting out a blaze, you can find them organizing the little league teams or grating the baseball diamonds or taking care of the boy and girl scouts. They are the grit that makes this country great.  What happened in South Carolina reminds all of us just how important firefighters are to our communities, how brave these people are, and how dangerous their work is.  We saw it during Hurricane Katrina, when 1,000 firefighters who themselves lost their homes and their cars, whose whole lives were turned upside down, spent day after day rescuing people from rooftops.  We saw it on September 11, when that grizzled fireman came out of the debris of human flesh and cement and steel to become the face around the world of America's determination.  Three hundred forty-three firemen were lost on that terrible day. And the tragedy in Charleston is the single greatest loss of firefighters in the nation since then.  Just as the spirit of those firefighters on September 11 helped lift America off our knees, I hope that the grief Charleston feels this week will be lifted by the legacy of their fallen heroes.                          ____________________
