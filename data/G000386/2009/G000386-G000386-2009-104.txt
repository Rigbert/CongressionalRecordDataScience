 President, before the Senator from Arizona leaves, on the point he made and the efforts by the members of the other party to strike Medicare Advantage, I have a letter that was sent to members of the Medicare conference on September 30, 2003, with more Democratic signers who are still in the Senate than Republican signers who were in the Senate, which set out all of the reasons Medicare Advantage was so very important and why it needed to have more money put into the year 2003.  For instance, I will read from the letter:       For nearly 5 million Medicare beneficiaries across America,      Medicare Plus Choice--  That is what it was called before Medicare Advantage--     is an essential program that provides high quality,      comprehensive, affordable health coverage. These seniors and      disabled Americans have voluntarily chosen to receive their      health coverage through Medicare HMOs and other private      sector plans because they have excellent value. To preserve      this important option for seniors across the country,      bipartisan legislation was introduced in the Senate as S.      590, the ``Medicare Plus Choice Equity and Access Act.''       Cosponsored by Senators Schumer and Santorum, S. 590 sought      to increase reimbursement rates and add new reimbursement      options. . . .  Et cetera, et cetera. We have plenty of history in the Senate that is bipartisan that we ought to maintain--Medicare Advantage--rather than do an injustice to it, as this legislation before the Senate is trying to do.  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                                  U.S. Senate,                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2003.       Dear Medicare Conferee: We are writing to ask you, as a      member of the Medicare conference committee, to ensure that      the final Medicare bill includes a meaningful increase in      Medicare+Choice funding in fiscal years 2004 and 2005. While      the Senate bill makes a modest step toward this goal, we hope      that the stronger provisions in the House bill will be      preserved in conference.       For nearly 5 million Medicare beneficiaries across America,      Medicare+Choice is an essential program that provides high      quality, comprehensive, affordable health coverage. These      seniors and disabled Americans have voluntarily chosen to      receive their health coverage through Medicare HMOs and other      private sector plans because of their excellent value. To      preserve this important option for seniors across the      country, bipartisan legislation was introduced in the Senate      as S. 590, the ``Medicare+Choice Equity and Access Act.''       Co-sponsored by Senators Schumer and Santorum, S. 590      sought to increase reimbursement rates and add new      reimbursement options for Medicare+Choice programs. Although      the Senate version of the Medicare bill does include a modest      increase in reimbursement rates in FY 2005, we were pleased      to see that the House version contains a more comprehensive      commitment to strengthening Medicare+Choice beginning in      2004.       Medicare+Choice uses private sector innovations to offer      all of the traditional Medicare benefits in addition to extra      benefits such as prescription drug coverage, vision benefits,      and hearing aids. These added services are particularly      important to low-income seniors who cannot afford the high      out-of-pocket costs they would incur under the Medicare fee-     for-service program. In many cases, this program is the only      option for low-income seniors to receive comprehensive,      affordable health coverage.       But in recent years, lack of adequate government funding      for the Medicare+Choice program has steadily reduced the      health plan choices and benefits of seniors across the      nation. As funding increases have continually fallen short of      rising health care costs, seniors have watched the quality of      their health     care decline. Each year, health plans deprived of essential      funding have been forced to eliminate benefits, increase      seniors' out-of-pocket costs, or even withdraw completely      from certain areas.       We strongly support additional Medicare+Choice funding for      two very important reasons: (1) to protect the health care      choices and benefits of the nearly 5 million Medicare      beneficiaries who are currently enrolled in private sector      health plans; and (2) to strengthen the foundation for future      health plan choices.       We believe that the Medicare+Choice funding provisions in      H.R. 1 are critically important to preserving choice and      quality for America's seniors. We urge you to include these      provisions in the final bill reported out of the Medicare      conference committee.           Sincerely,         Rick Santorum, John F. Kerry, Arlen Specter, Jon Corzine,            Gordon Smith, Jim Bunning, Dianne Feinstein, Joseph I.            Lieberman, Patty Murray, Charles E. Schumer, Frank R.            Lautenberg, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Ron Wyden, Mark            Dayton, Norm Coleman, Mary L. Landrieu, Maria Cantwell,            Christopher J. Dodd.
