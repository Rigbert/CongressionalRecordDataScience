Speaker, I would like to thank our Chairman Jim Walsh and our Ranking Member Alan Mollohan and all the staff that assisted in crafting this bill VA-HUD FY02 Appropriations bill. Faced with the allocation provided to the subcommittee, I believe the bill before us is a good and balanced product, which I support and plan to vote for today. The allocation, however, was simply inadequate to take care of our veterans and their truly pressing needs. All around our country veterans wait too long for doctors appointments, are disabled by substance abuse and mental illness, far too many are homeless, and surely it is nothing less than a crisis that a backlog of more than 500,000 claims for compensation and pension benefits are pending before the VA today.  I am, however, happy to note that this report does provide an important first step toward ensuring that veterans suffering from schizophrenia have greater access to new and vitally important atypical anti-psychotic medications. Under the provision, a physician's practice of prescribing atypical anti-psychotic medications must not be used as performance indicators when evaluating the physician's work. The provision also clarifies and reiterates the policy that physicians are to use their best clinical judgment when choosing these critical anti-psychotic medications.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is provided with $7.9 billion --$74 million than the FY01 funding and $587 million more than requested. The measure provides full funding for EPA enforcement activities and staff. I am pleased that changes were made from the House bill that would have significantly reduced EPA enforcement staff and shifted more enforcement duties to states.  The Department of Housing & Urban Development (HUD) is funded at a level of $30.1 billion--$1.7billion more than FY01 appropriations, but $433 million less than requested. It includes funding for 25,900 new Section 8 rental vouchers to provide housing assistance to additional families. There were increases in the Conference report for housing programs for the elderly, disabled, and persons with AIDS.  I am disappointed that the Conference did not provide the Senate's appropriation of $300 million for HUD's Public Housing Drug Elimination Grant Program. This program fits several of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's main strategic goals: improving quality of life, promoting economic vitality, and keeping communities and neighborhoods safe. Housing authorities are specifically required to develop, in cooperation with local police, plans that ensure safety and crime prevention. Crime statistics show that crime has dropped nation wide and especially in our cities and public housing facilities since this program was created. I again am very disappointed that his program has been eliminated, with no clear replacement that is accessible to localities.  The National Credit Union Administration provides $1 million for the Community Development Revolving Loan Fund for loans to community development credit unions. Of this amount $350,000 is provided for technical assistance to low income and community development credit unions. Technical assistance grants are available to low-income designated credit unions and those credit unions that expand service to low-income communities or investment areas. The purpose of these awards is to strengthen these credit unions by funding the following activities: improved technology and service delivery systems; economic development; consumer and entrepreneurial education; micro-enterprise business development; employment opportunities for through community business development; and credit union infrastructure and staff development.  Once again, I appreciate the hard work behind this bill but am deeply concerned that as we prepare to honor veterans on Veterans Day that an inadequate allocation will prevents us from providing this nation's defenders and protectors of liberty with the services and benefits they deserve.                          ____________________
