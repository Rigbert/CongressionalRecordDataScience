President, I would like to enter into the Record an amazing story of heroism and courage. Faced with the threat of severe injury to his 4-year-old brother, Michael, Christopher Simmons, an 8-year-old from Mt. Vernon, Illinois, boldly placed himself between his brother and a 95-pound dog. In doing so, Christopher demonstrated a profound sense of selflessness that is all too rarely reported. His heroism, as described in an article in the Mt. Vernon Register-News, was quite possibly the only thing that saved his younger brother from serious bodily harm.  On April 6, 1997, as the boys' father, Phillip Simmons, spoke with the dog's owner, Christopher noticed the boxer playfully tugging at Michael's jacket. Suddenly, the dog lunged for the 4-year-old's throat. Christopher, without the slightest hesitation, stepped in front of the attacking dog and kicked it in the left eye. The dog, startled momentarily, became more angry and jumped onto Christopher, clawing and biting his chest. Fortunately, Christopher's quick thinking gave his father enough time to come to his aid, removing the dog from the boy's chest and subduing it until the owner arrived.  Christopher received two chest wounds and lost a significant amount of blood. Michael, now 5 years old, needed surgery to repair a wounded jaw and a severely damaged ear. The dog's teeth barely missed nerves that help control the movements of the eyes and the jaw. If the dog had been able to do more harm to Michael, the little boy may not have survived.  This horrible incident had one positive consequence: Christopher will be in Washington next month to represent 2.1 million Cub Scouts as he presents President Clinton with the Scouts' annual Report to the Nation. I am pleased to have this opportunity to join President Clinton in honoring Christopher for his tremendous heroism and outstanding courage. I ask that the Mt. Vernon Register-News article describing Christopher Simmons' act of heroism be printed in the Record.  The article follows:          [From the Mount Vernon Register-News, Feb. 2, 1998]    Mt. Vernon Youth Who Saved Brother From Dog To Meet With Clinton       MT. VERNON--A young boy who stepped between his 4-year-old      brother and a 95-pound attacking dog is being rewarded for      his bravery with a meeting with President Clinton.       Christopher Simmons, 8, has been chosen to represent the      nation's 2.1 million Cub Scouts in presenting scouting's      yearly Report to the Nation in the Oval Office next month.       His bravery also earned him the Scouts' rare Honor Medal,      ``for unusual heroism in saving or attempting to save life at      considerable risk to self.'' Only 42 such medals were earned      last year by the nation's 4.5 million Cub Scouts, Boy Scouts      and Explorers.       Christopher's story began last April 6 when his dad,      Phillip, took along Christopher, then 7, and his brother,      Michael, to help the dog's owner with some yard work.       Phillip Simmons was chatting with the man, who is in his      80s, when he saw the dog shaking Michael by his coat. The      boxer then released its grip and aimed for Michael's throat.       ``As his jaws closed on Michael's head, Christopher      launched a kick that connected with the dog's left eye,'' the      father recalled last week. ``The pain further enraged the      dog, who instantly turned on Christopher.''       As Christopher stepped back, with the dog's paws on his      chest and its jaws ripping at his coat, the momentary      diversion gave Simmons time to reach his sons.       ``I jumped on him and kicked him,'' Christopher, a third-     grader at St. Mary's School, recalled last week at his home      here. ``Then he jumped on me. By that time my dad was there.      I pulled my brother out of reach of the dog.''       Seizing the dog by one ear, Phillip Simmons rammed his fist      down the animal's throat and held him against a car.       ``As the dog struggled, I looked back to see Michael      standing frozen in a pool of blood, still within reach of the      dog if he got loose,'' the father recalled.       ``Chris, even though bleeding from two sets of chest      wounds, had the presence of mind to pull Michael out of range      of the boxer so I could release the dog,'' Phillip Simmons      added. ``There is no doubt that if it had not been for      Christopher's quick thinking and action, I would have lost my      4-year-old son.''       Michael, now 5, had to have surgery on his jaw and dangling      left ear. Physicians stitched along a crease so that the ear      would heal with no visible damage. The boxer's teeth barely      missed a nerve that controls the eye and another that      controls the jaw.       A typically lively 5-year-old, Michael seems to have few      emotional scars, though his parents say he is very afraid of      dogs.       The dog had no history of harming or threatening anyone.       Instead of insisting the dog be killed, the Simmons family      agreed to allow the boxer to be sent to a breeding farm where      children were not allowed. The dog has since died.                          ____________________
