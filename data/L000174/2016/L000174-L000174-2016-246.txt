President, this past weekend the Nation honored Justice Antonin Scalia, who was laid to rest after serving on the Supreme Court for nearly three decades. Marcelle and I were home in Vermont when we learned that Justice Scalia had passed. Frankly, we were stunned by the news. I did not often agree with Justice Scalia, but he was a brilliant jurist with a deep commitment to our country and to the Constitution, and we enjoyed his friendship for decades. He will be remembered as one of the most influential Justices in modern history.  While his family and all should have had a chance to mourn his passing, I was shocked when, in the immediate wake of his death, Senate Republicans moved quickly to shut down the constitutionally mandated process to fill the vacancy left on the Supreme Court. Within hours of his death being announced, they declared they would oppose any effort to confirm the next Supreme Court Justice this year. I have served in this body longer than any Member here and I have heard some shocking things during that time, but I am surprised by the political crassness of these statements.  Before a nominee had even been named, some Republicans reflexively decided to prematurely reject anyone--anyone--nominated by the President. This impulsive rush to judgment runs completely contrary to how this body has always treated nominees--always treated nominees--to the highest Court in the land. Republicans should not allow the hyper-partisan rhetoric of the campaign trail to trump one of the Senate's most important constitutional duties.  I have talked to the President, and I know he will fulfill his constitutional duty. He will nominate an individual to bring the Supreme Court back to full strength, and of course he should. The President has already begun consulting with Members of both parties in Senate, but after a nomination has been made, we in the Senate should get to work and do our jobs--the jobs we were elected to do.  I was all over my State of Vermont last week. The Vermonters I spoke with last week reflect Americans across the country who are tired of partisan political games that are chipping away at the foundation of our constitutional democracy. I heard this from both Republicans and Democrats in Vermont.  As Oliver Goodenough, a law professor at Vermont Law School, wrote this weekend in the Rutland Herald, an extended Supreme Court vacancy caused by Senate inaction ``would certainly create a constitutional embarrassment.''  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                [From the Rutland Herald, Feb. 21, 2016]                    Court Battle--Another Shutdown?                       (By Oliver R. Goodenough)       Within hours of the announcement of Anton Scalia's death,      one of our political parties was already trying to make      points with the electorate about the process of picking his      successor. At that evening's debate, the GOP presidential      candidates advocated that the constitutional process should      be suspended, either voluntarily by President Barack Obama or      by purposeful inaction by the Senate.       Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, was just as      speedy, trying to warn Obama off from acting on the mandate      of Article II, Section 2, which charges the president with      nominating a replacement for Justice Scalia and the Senate      with providing its advice and consent on the president's      choice.       One can understand McConnell's disappointment. Appointments      to the Supreme Court are for life, which means only      resignation, impeachment or death will create a vacancy. In      the somewhat ghoulish game of waiting for a slot on the      closely divided Supreme Court to open up, the short-term      expectations of mortality had been focused elsewhere--Justice      Ruth Bader Ginsberg, in particular, has been a survivor of      long-odds pancreatic cancer.       So Republicans were brought up short by the death of a      conservative hero, whose replacement could shift the balance      of the court. The accidents of history will do that      sometimes.       The Constitution makes provision for what happens in such a      case--in the kind of clear, unequivocal language that is the      best target for Justice Scalia's vaunted originalism. The      president nominates. The Senate, for its part, gives the      qualifications of any nominee a serious vetting; it is not      entitled to just ignore the nomination.       Some reports have argued that such a course of process      sabotage would create a ``constitutional crisis.'' This is      probably an overstatement; it would certainly create a      constitutional embarrassment. With nearly a year left in      Obama's term, waiting for his successor to name the new      justice in 2017 would remove the ninth voice from the court      not just for the current yearly term but also for most of the      following term as well, since the replacement would arrive in      the spring and miss months of argument and deliberation. For      the better part of a year, the vacancy would sit like a      broken tooth in the operations of the court. Close cases      would often end up tied, with the result that the lower court      finding would remain the binding result. Not itself a      disaster, but a result that the constitutional provisions for      naming a successor are designed to avoid.       The embarrassment of sabotage on judicial appointments      actually already exists: Republicans in the Senate have      effectively shut down the process of nominating new judges      for the federal courts of appeal. The blockage isn't over      qualifications--such considerations would be a proper      exercise of the Senate's confirmation role, raised in      committee and on the Senate floor Rather, the nominations are      sitting in a limbo of inaction: It is simply a matter of not      doing the job at all.       This is the real crisis, a state of politics where      Republicans in the House and Senate are willing to derail the      processes of government to thwart the actions of President      Obama, good, bad or indifferent. The most obvious example was      the full shutdown of government. Limited shutdowns on matters      like judicial appointments are parts of the same pattern.       Of course, obstructionism is not just a Republican failing,      and it can be present in both parties to some degree in the      spicy stew of politics in our robust democracy. But the      bottom-line commitment of all parties should be to      maintaining a functioning government, structured and      administered in accordance with the framework set out in our      Constitution, even when it is not working to their advantage.      Why is this so hard for at least some Republicans to buy      into? Why the willingness, indeed eagerness, to bring down      the house we all live in?       The key is a widespread denial among Republicans of the      legitimacy of the Obama presidency. This is partly related to      the man himself--all the blather about his birth, his      religion, etc. While many Americans find it a vindication      that we can elect an African-American to our highest office,      for some it is an impossibility which in turn justifies the      most extreme forms of resistance. Race is our original sin as      a country, and its legacy haunts us still.       Republicans are also in denial over changes in the social      and economic fabric of America. We are, as always, in the      process of moving from what America has been to what it will      be. Conservatives have a role to play, reminding us of the      valuable parts of where we came from. Progressives have a      role, recognizing the imperatives of the future and charting      the paths of change toward positive outcomes. Politics is the      sometimes rough and tumble playing field where the dialog on      this goes forward.       The intransigence of shutdowns, however, whether of the      full government or a critical aspect like the nomination      process, exceeds the boundaries of acceptable play and hurts      us all. Obama needs to make a good faith nomination to fill      the vacancy on the Supreme Court. McConnell and his      colleagues in the Senate majority need to review it in good      faith. That is what the Constitution provides; that is what      the country needs. Get on with it.
