Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, we are going to support the amendment as intended. However, there is a slight, as I think the gentleman from Minnesota mentioned, drafting error, the section that applies to both the current new starts and the new small starts process. We will take the amendment at this time with the gentleman's understanding we want to correct the language in conference so that the exemption applies only to the new small starts process.  Does the gentleman understand that?
