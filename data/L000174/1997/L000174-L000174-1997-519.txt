President, reserving the right to object, and I tell the distinguished majority whip that I will object and explain why, I understand that there are people who wish to be consulted, I believe on both sides of the aisle, on this. Therefore, I do object and suggest perhaps we could run a hotline on both sides. We may be able to work out a time agreement.
