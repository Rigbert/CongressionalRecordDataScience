Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, I have been on this subcommittee for many years. In 1983, Terrell Bell, then the Secretary of Education, issued a report. That report was entitled: A Nation at Risk. It said that we were at risk of becoming a Nation of mediocrity because our educational system was not keeping apace. The response of the Reagan administration was to send down a budget which had the largest cut in education funding at the national level to that date in history.  Now, that budget that Ronald Reagan sent down was not passed. It was increased substantially. But me thinks the chairman protests too much in saying we are all for the first sentence, that we want to spend more for education. It is useful, I think, to remember a little bit of the history of why we are here and why this motion, we think, is necessary.  First of all, when we passed the House bill, we were $3 billion less than the Senate bill on education, $3 billion less.                              {time}  1315  So that, when the House took its action, all of this euphoria about spending more on education was not present. But we have had a lot of policies, Mr. Speaker, since then about what the American public care about. We have had a lot of debate between the Presidential candidates, and everybody is falling all over themselves to be for education.  So what do we see between then and now, between the passage of a Republican budget that provided little fundsfor education and today? Well, we see a $3.7 billion increase, notwithstanding the fact that we Democrats stood on the floor when this bill passed and we opposed its passage, of course, and said we needed more money.  Oh, no, it is fine. This is just a first inning in any event. We have been just at the first inning in about 13 bills, which is why we are stuck in the mud because this process has not been real.  Well, my colleagues are starting to get real. We understand that, because November 7 footsteps are heard loud in these Chambers and the American public's voice is heard louder as the days go by.  I rise in support of this motion. I believe that the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Porter) our distinguished chairman who we are going to lament will not be here next month to help us work on these issues because he cares about these issues.  But I think we need this motion because we need to say we want to go to those figures in our conference. The conference has not really been a real conference. The reason it has not been a very real conference is because the dollars that the Republicans say are available for these bills keeps moving, it keeps moving as their political antenna quivers. And every time they got a little quiver, there is a little more money and they add it to the bills, which they should have done, of course, on substance, not on politics, on the concern that the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Goodling) says about children.  Now, the second part of this motion is a critically important part. I have had this discussion with one of the Members of the United States Senate. He says local control. I am for local control, but I am for accountability for the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) when I go home and say, we took your money and here is how we spent it, not the school boards spent it, but this is what I said was a priority, the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).  I believe that there is a critical need in this country, as the President believes, for us to help with school construction. Because we know that schools are falling down, we know there are not enough classrooms, we know that there are some schools that are not safe for our kids to be in. So the President of the United States has proposed, and I support, saying we are going to give some money for school construction, not to build new pools in schools, not to have new football programs, etcetera, etcetera. That is not my responsibility. If the locals want to do it, they spend, as all of us know, 93 percent on education. We spend 7.  But I believe that school construction is critically important if we are going to have more classrooms. Because, in order to have more smaller classes, we have got to have more classrooms; and in order to have more classrooms, we have got to have more teachers. So the President proposes that we have a program for more teachers, as well.  The Republicans made a deal last year when they passed the omnibus appropriations bill that they were for that and they said they were for that. Now, maybe they were for it because that is the only way the bill would get passed, but notwithstanding the fact we had an agreement that that would happen. That is what this motion to instruct is all about, both ends of it, more money.  Now, yes, I agree, we seem to be moving in that direction because they added not only $3.7 billion from the House bill, they added $8 billion in total to the House bill. Eight billion dollars they have added to the House bill. We are glad they are getting there because the children of America, the families of America need this investment.  I am prepared it take the responsibility for more classrooms, more teachers, and to assist with school construction. I think that is my responsibility, and I am prepared to stand up for it and vote for it.  So when they tell me, Mr. Speaker, that they want local control, I want local control. But when they say that we should not make determinations on specific needs, I think they are wrong. That is our responsibility.  I urge passage of this motion to instruct.
