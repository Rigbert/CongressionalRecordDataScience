President, I rise today with my colleague from Nevada, Senator Cortez Masto, to introduce the Building Our Largest Dementia Infrastructure for Alzheimer's--or BOLD--Act. I am pleased that Senator Capito and Senator Kaine are also joining us as original cosponsors.  Our legislation would create a public health infrastructure aimed at combating Alzheimer's disease and preserving brain health. Alzheimer's disease is one of the greatest and most under-recognized public health threats of our time. Former Surgeon General David Satcher has said that it is the most under-recognized public health threat of the 21st century. Five and a half million Americans are living with the disease, and that number will soar as our population continues to grow older and lives longer.  In addition to the human suffering it causes, Alzheimer's is our Nation's most costly disease. The United States spends more than $259 billion per year, including $175 billion in Medicare and Medicaid costs. The financial impact of this dreadful disease will only continue to grow. In fact, it is estimated that by the year 2050, Alzheimer's will cost our country $1 trillion and afflict 16 million Americans.  While Alzheimer's is the only one of our Nation's most deadly diseases without an effective treatment or cure, tantalizing new research suggests that there are steps we can take to promote prevention and improve treatment.  The first step we should take is to recognize Alzheimer's as a public health crisis. It is because of public health advancements that we have safe water to drink, vaccines to prevent deadly diseases, interventions to quit smoking, and emergency preparedness tools to save lives. The effort to combat Alzheimer's disease requires a similar unified, national public health effort. That effort is gaining steam.  In 1999, when I founded the Bipartisan Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's, there was virtually no focus in Washington on this devastating disease. In fact, people were afraid to even refer to the disease, just as years ago people did not talk about cancer.  Seven years ago, I coauthored with then-Senator Evan Bayh the bipartisan National Alzheimer's Project Act, which set the primary goal of preventing and effectively treating the disease by the year 2025. That bill created an expert council, which has calculated that $2 billion in Federal funding per year is needed to achieve that goal.  On the Appropriations Committee, I have worked hard with Senator Blunt and others to turn the words of that recommendation into action. The funding bill for this year provides another $2 billion increase for the National Institutes of Health, and that includes a $414 million increase for Alzheimer's research--the largest in history. That brings the total for Alzheimer's research to $1.8 billion--well within reach of the $2 billion goal, which the experts tell us is necessary for breakthroughs.  While this research is moving forward, we must put into practice what we know and enhance the quality of care and support for those living with Alzheimer's and their families. In March, the Aging Committee, which I chair, held a hearing on the arc of Alzheimer's, from preventing cognitive decline to ensuring quality care for those living with dementia. The hearing shed light on the fact that although we do not yet know how to prevent Alzheimer's, we are advancing in our understanding of the disease. Its progression does not happen overnight; it is preceded by years and perhaps decades of changes in the brain and a continuum of changes in behavior, including cognitive decline. A growing body of evidence suggests that lifestyle factors, such as regular physical activity and attention to heart health, may reduce the risk of cognitive decline. There is so much we have yet to know.  Alzheimer's is a public issue for those living with the disease, for those caring for their loved ones with the disease, for all of us as taxpayers, and for those who know that our brain is our most precious resource. Alzheimer's exacts a tremendous personal and economic toll on families and communities. More than 40 million Americans know all too well the compassion, commitment, and endurance that it takes to be a caregiver of a loved one facing a chronic disease like Alzheimer's.  The legislation we are introducing today would apply a new public health approach to Alzheimer's disease. It would establish Centers of Excellence in Public Health Practice dedicated to promoting effective Alzheimer's disease management and caregiving interventions, as well as educating the public on the disease, cognitive decline, and brain health.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is already doing tremendous work to combat Alzheimer's within the Public Health Road Map of the Healthy Brain Initiative. This legislation would create centers of excellence across the country to implement the CDC's Public Health Road Map. The centers would take a number of key steps against Alzheimer's. They would work to support early detection and diagnosis, lessen the risk of avoidable hospitalizations, reduce the risk of cognitive decline, enhance support to meet the needs of caregivers, reduce health disparities, and support care planning and management for those with the disease. The Centers' activities would support health and social services professionals as well as families and communities.  In addition to establishing the Centers of Excellence in Public Health Practice, this bill would spread the opportunity for communities across America to create the necessary core capacity to combat Alzheimer's and to enhance existing efforts in this regard. The legislation would establish and distribute cooperative agreements to public health departments to support systems change, communications, and programmatic interventions. These agreements would also support the actions in the CDC Healthy Brain Initiative's Public Health Roadmap.  Finally, at the heart of public health is data. This legislation would direct the CDC to collect data on cognitive decline, cognitive impairment, caregiving, and health disparities within its current systems. The bill would also create cooperative agreements for the analysis and reporting of data to ensure that the results are disseminated to the public and are used, ultimately, to improve brain health.  For far too long, we have viewed Alzheimer's disease as an aging issue that plagues our seniors today and threatens to affect many more tomorrow. In fact, the disease is far more than that.It is a public health issue with a course that we can change. If we do not take action, both in this new public health approach and by continuing to build on the research, this disease will bankrupt the Medicare and the Medicaid Programs. We cannot afford to spend over $1 trillion in the year 2050 on just this one disease. We cannot afford to lose 16 million Americans by that year to this devastating disease. We cannot afford to allow the heartache and devastation of this disease to affect more and more American families.  There are steps that we can take today to prevent cognitive decline and to improve the lives of those who are living with Alzheimer's and the lives of their caregivers. This public health approach is not only empowering, but it is key to avoiding the terrible impacts that I have outlined.  After decades of expanding much needed biomedical research in Alzheimer's, we are ready for the next step--to translate research into policy. The BOLD bill would create a new, enlightened public policy out of promising research by creating the first ever national public health infrastructure for Alzheimer's disease.  I am pleased to say that the bipartisan bill that the Senator from Nevada and I have introduced, with our colleagues from Virginia and West Virginia, is endorsed by the Alzheimer's Association, the Alzheimer's Impact Movement, the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors, and the National Association of Counties.  I ask unanimous consent that their letters of support be printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.  I urge my colleagues to support this critical and bipartisan legislation.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                  Alzheimer's Impact Movement,                                 Washington, DC, November 6, 2017.     Hon. Susan Collins,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Shelley Moore Capito,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.     Hon. Tim Kaine,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins, Cortez Masto, Capito and Kaine: On      behalf of the Alzheimer's Association and the Alzheimer's      Impact Movement (AIM), including our nationwide networks of      advocates, thank you for your continued leadership on issues      and legislation important to Americans with Alzheimer's and      other dementias, and to their caregivers. The Alzheimer's      Association and AIM are pleased to support the bipartisan      Building Our Largest Dementia (BOLD) Infrastructure for      Alzheimer's Act, which would create an Alzheimer's public      health infrastructure across the country to implement      effective Alzheimer's interventions focused on public health      issues such as increasing early detection and diagnosis,      reducing risk and preventing avoidable hospitalizations.       More than 5 million Americans are living with Alzheimer's      and, without significant action, as many as 16 million      Americans will have Alzheimer's by 2050. Today, another      person develops the disease every 66 seconds; by 2050,      someone in the United States will develop the disease every      33 seconds. This explosive growth will cause Alzheimer's      costs to increase from an estimated $259 billion in 2017 to      $1.1 trillion in 2050 (in 2017 dollars). These mounting costs      threaten to bankrupt families, businesses and our health care      system. Unfortunately, our work is only growing more urgent.       As scientists continue to search for a way to prevent,      cure, or slow the progression of Alzheimer's through medical      research, public health plays an important role in promoting      cognitive function and reducing the risk of cognitive      decline. Investing in a nationwide Alzheimer's public health      response will help create population-level change, achieve a      higher quality of life for those living with the disease and      their caregivers, and reduce associated costs. The BOLD      Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act would provide this crucial      investment by establishing Alzheimer's centers of excellence      across the country and funding state, local and tribal public      health departments to increase early detection and diagnosis,      reduce risk, prevent avoidable hospitalizations, reduce      health disparities, support the needs of caregivers and      support care planning for people living with the disease.      These important public health actions allow individuals with      Alzheimer's to live in their homes longer and delay costly      institutionalized care. These goals are consistent with the      National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease, which includes      a strategy to ``work with state, tribal, and local      governments to improve coordination and identify model      initiatives to advance Alzheimer's disease and related      dementias awareness and readiness across the government.''       The BOLD Infrastructure for Alzheimer's Act would also      increase the collection, analysis and timely reporting of      Alzheimer's data. This data is critical to identifying      opportunities for public health interventions, helping      stakeholders track progress in the public health response,      and enabling state and federal policymakers to make informed      decisions when developing plans and policies. Finally, the      bill would also strengthen implementation of the Center for      Disease Control and Prevention's Public Health Road Map,      which includes strategic action items for state and local      public health departments and their partners to promote      cognitive functioning, address cognitive impairment and help      meet the needs of care partners.       The Alzheimer's Association and AIM deeply appreciate your      continued leadership on behalf of all American's living with      Alzheimer's and other dementias. We look forward to working      with you to advance this important bipartisan bill. If you      have any questions about this or any other legislation,      please contact Rachel Conant, Senior Director of Federal      Affairs.           Sincerely,     Robert Egge,       Chief Public Policy Officer, Executive Vice President,      Government Affairs, Alzheimer's Association.                                  ____                                                 November 6, 2017.

Hon. Tim Kaine,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senators Collins, Cortez Masto, Capito and Kaine: On      behalf of the undersigned organizations, thank you for your      leadership on the important public health issues facing our      nation, including the urgent issue of Americans with      Alzheimer's and other dementias.

These mounting costs threaten to      bankrupt families, businesses and our health care system.       Public health plays an important role in protecting the      health and well-being of Americans, including promoting      cognitive function and reducing the risk of cognitive      decline.
