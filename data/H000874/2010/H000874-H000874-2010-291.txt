He died at the age of 87, leaving behind a lifetime of wisdom, friendships, and service to his community.  After serving in the U.S. Navy in the 1940s, Mr. Prouty took over his father's family farm. He ran it skillfully for decades, growing tobacco, corn, wheat, barley, rye, soybeans, heirloom tomatoes, and flowers--and he passed it on to his own son. He was one of the family farmers who are the backbone of American agriculture; he cared about conserving the land, keeping up with the latest agricultural techniques, and lending a hand to his neighbors. In the words of his son, John Prouty was ``as generous and as honest and as insightful a person as you could meet.'' And in between long hours managing his 160 acres, he took time to serve on the county planning commission and the county and state farm bureaus. For his lifetime of hard work, he was inducted into the Governor's Agricultural Hall of Fame this year.  Mr. Prouty represented the best of American farming, and I sincerely hope that the legacy he left behind will inspire all those in Maryland who work to keep their family farms thriving. I know that he will be an inspiration to all those he left behind: his wife Margaret; his children, Susan, John, and Elizabeth; and his four grandchildren.                          ____________________
