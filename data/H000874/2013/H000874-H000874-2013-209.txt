 I had the great honor of serving as vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus when Bill Gray was chairman of the Democratic Caucus, and I had the honor of succeeding Bill Gray as chairman of the Democratic Caucus when he became the whip, the Democratic whip of our caucus.  Bill Gray was a very good friend of mine. I had the honor of serving with him, saw him as chairman of the Budget Committee, and all the roles that the gentleman from Philadelphia said. I will have further things to say later in the week.  I want to thank the gentleman for rising to honor a historic American, first African American leader in our party; but much more than that, an extraordinary individual, as the gentleman from Philadelphia has pointed out.  I join in a moment of silence in honor of our friend, a great American, a great Member of this body, and a great leader in his church and, as the gentleman has pointed out, United Negro College Fund, which gave so many opportunities to so many millions of young people in this country.  I thank the gentleman for his remarks.
