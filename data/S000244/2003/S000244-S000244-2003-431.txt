Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.  Mr. Chairman, I am going to quit while I am ahead. The gentleman from New York agrees with me that this amendment is a bad one. There is no more that I can say but to urge the membership once again to vote against it.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.  The CHAIRMAN pro tempore. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).  The question was taken; and the Chairman pro tempore announced that the noes appeared to have it.
