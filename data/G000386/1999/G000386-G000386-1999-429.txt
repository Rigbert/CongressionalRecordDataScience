 President, the Fairfield Ledger of Fairfield, IA, printed a photo of a newly married couple earlier this month. The groom is wearing a stylish suit and a wide smile. The equally resplendent bride has eyes only for her new husband.  The couple is picture-perfect, just like any other couple starting a new life together. Unlike any other couple, the groom in this case is age 102.  The Rev. Fred Robb of Washington, Iowa, married Fern Claxton, 25 years younger, at the Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Iowa, on April 9, 1999. The couple renewed an old friendship at the Rev. Robb's 100th birthday celebration in 1996. Among other meetings, they shared in the 100th birthday celebration of the minister's brother, Milt Robb, in January.  The Rev. Robb is one of more than 750 centenarians in Iowa. I don't know for a fact, but I'd bet many of them approach aging with the same positive spirit as the Rev. Robb.  I run into a lot of older Iowans who don't impose unnatural limits on themselves because of their age. They don't stop doing what's important to them just because the calendar reflects a certain milestone. These individuals are ageless, not due to the years they have lived but in their approach to life. One of my favorite examples of an ageless Iowan is a 92-year-old woman who was in a hurry because she said she had to deliver meals to the ``old people.''  During Older Americans Month, I want to congratulate Fred and Fern Robb on their ageless spirit and wish them a happy life together. By defying the conventional wisdom that newlyweds must be young, the Robbs advance the theme of Older Americans Month: ``Honor the Past, Imagine the Future: Toward a Society for All Ages.''                          ____________________
