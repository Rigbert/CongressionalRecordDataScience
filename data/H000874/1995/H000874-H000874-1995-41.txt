Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.  Mr. Speaker, the chairman rose and responded and talked about the media. I did not say anything about the media. He talked about hallway allegations. I did not say anything about that. I think where he got that was from the letter from Ms. Carle. I was not going to object to the submission of this letter. I disagree with some aspects of it, but it is fine to have in the Record and we will discuss its pertinent parts.  I thought there were 10, I still think there are 10, maybe there are 9. Whether it is 9 or 10, the fact remains that a few days before Christmas, for no cause, they were told, some after 23 years of service, some after 20, some after 19, some after 15, that their services were no longer going to be utilized by the House of Representatives. They effectively were fired before Christmas. They are still on the payroll; they will still be paid. They have comp time coming to them, they have certain leave coming to them. But the fact of the matter is we took that action.  The issue here is that in July of 1995, in reorganization, this manual was published and given to the employees, and it said if they were going to be removed, they would have certain rights. This was not complied with. Period. That is not a newspaper report, that is not hallway talk. That is Steny Hoyer standing on this floor reading this very simple sentence and saying the Clerk's own rules were not complied with in this action. That was wrong, unfair, and ought to be reversed.
