President, I rise today to express my gratitude for the Senate's confirmation of Eric F. Melgren as Federal District Judge for the District of Kansas.  It is important that we deliver solid judges to our court system. With that said, I believe Eric Melgren is qualified for this important responsibility. Since 2002, he has been serving as U.S. attorney for the District of Kansas. Between 2002 and 2003, the District of Kansas had a fourteen percent increase in the number of criminal cases filed in U.S. District and State courts.  Eric's nomination will be of great benefit to the District of Kansas. Due to an increase in caseload, a temporary judgeship was created in the District of Kansas in 1990. Since the temporary judgeship was created, we have seen an increase in the caseload for the District of Kansas.  Currently, Kansas has five active Federal district judges. With Eric's confirmation, we will now have six active judges. However, one of these judgeships is temporary and set to expire on November 21 of this year. If the temporary judgeship would have expired before the Senate confirmed Eric and another judge took senior status this year, the District of Kansas would only have four active judges. Therefore, with the increase in caseload, it was vital that we confirmed Eric before the expiration of this temporary judgeship.  Again, thank you for confirming the nomination of Eric Melgren. He is a man of integrity and sound judgement. Eric's passion for the law will be of great benefit to the State of Kansas and the rest of the Nation.
