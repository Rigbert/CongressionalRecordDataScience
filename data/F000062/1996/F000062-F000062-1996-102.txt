 President, I rise to urge my colleagues to support this simple but strong legislation to protect our children.  This bill, which I introduce with Senator Boxer, would provide three simple protections:  First, the bill would prohibit commercial list brokers from selling personal information about children under 16 to anyone, without first getting the parent's consent.  All kinds of information about our children--more facts than most of us might think or hope for--is rapidly becoming available through these list brokers. It is only a matter of time before this information begins to fall into the wrong hands.  Recently, a reporter in Los Angeles was easily able to purchase parent's names, birth months and addresses for 5,500 children aged 1-12 in a particular neighborhood. The reporter used the name of a fictitious company, gave a nonworking telephone number, had no credit card or check, and identified herself as ``Richard Allen Davis,'' the notorious murderer of Polly Klaas. When ordering the list, the company representative simply told her, ``Oh, you have a famous name,'' and sent her the information COD. This is simply unacceptable.  Second, the bill would give parents the authority to demand information from the list brokers who traffic in the personal data of their children--brokers will be required to provide parents with a list of all those to whom they sold information about the child, and must also tell the parent precisely what kind of information was sold.  If this personal information is out there, and brokers are buying and selling it back and forth, it is only reasonable that we allow parents to find out what information has been sold and to whom that information has been given.  Finally, this bill would prohibit list brokers from using prison labor to input personal information. This seems like common sense to most of us, but unfortunately the use of prison labor is not currently prohibited.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a May 6, 1996, Wall Street Journal article be printed in the Record. This recent Wall Street Journal article described the terrible experience of Beverly Dennis, an Ohio grandmother who filled out a detailed marketing questionnaire about her buying habits for a mail-in survey. She filled out the questionnaire when she was told that she might receive free product samples and helpful information. Rather than receiving product information, however, she soon began to receive sexually explicit, fact-specific letters from a convicted rapist serving time.  The rapist, writing from his prison cell, had learned the very private, intimate details about her life because he was keypunching her personal questionnaire data into a computer for a subcontractor. Ms. Dennis received letters with elaborate sexual fantasies, woven around personal facts provided by her in the questionnaire. This bill would have prevented the situation from ever occurring.  This bill is really very simple. Some marketing companies may be unhappy that the Government is trying to legislate how they do business, but we have to weigh the safety and well-being of our children against the small inconvenience of requiring parental consent in these cases. Given the rapidly changing nature of the marketing business and the ways in which child molesters and other criminals operate, this bill is an important step in protecting our kids from those who would do them harm.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                S. 1908       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``Children's Privacy      Protection and Parental Empowerment Act of 1996''.     SEC. 2.

(a) In General.--Chapter 89 of title 18, United States      Code, is amended by adding at the end of the following:     Sec. 1822.

(b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the      beginning of chapter 89 of title 18, United States Code, is      amended by adding at the end the following new item:``1822. Sale of personal information about children.''.                                                                    ____              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 6, 1996]                Privacy Issue Raised in Direct-Mail Case                          (By James P. Miller)       Beverly Dennis thought she'd receive free product samples      through the mail when she filled out a detailed Metromail      Corp. questionnaire about her buying habits. Instead, she got      a disturbing letter from an imprisoned rapist.       Although Ms. Dennis didn't know it at the time, prison      inmates were processing data from the questionnaires for the      direct-marketing unit of R.R. Donnelley & Sons Inc. The      ``highly offensive, sexually graphic and threatening'' letter      came from a Texas inmate who learned about her life while      keypunching data from the questionnaires, according to a      lawsuit Ms. Dennis filed last month in state court in Travis      County, Texas.       The suit accuses Metromail of fraud for not telling Ms.      Dennis that prisoners would process the surveys and alleges      that the disclosure of personal information to violent      criminals constitutes and ``intentional or reckless      disregard'' of her safety. The suit seeks class-action status      on behalf of all consumers whose privacy interests were      allegedly injured in the same way.       The inmate's 12-page letter ``referred to the magazines of      interest to Ms. Dennis, her interest in physical fitness, the      fact that she is divorced, her income level, her birthday,      and the personal care products she uses,'' according to her      lawsuit. In one chilling passage quoted in the lawsuit, the      convict spun out a sexual fantasy involving a brand of soap      Ms. Dennis had mentioned in the survey.       The 1994 episode underscores the dangers of giving prison      inmates access to highly personal information about      consumers. ``It's an important case,'' says Marc Rotenberg,      of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, a      privacy advocacy group. ``It goes right to the question of      privacy safeguards in the marketing industry.''       Mr. Rotenberg, who teaches privacy law at Georgetown      University, says the ``novel questions'' raised by the suit      include ``how you establish harm in the misuse of personal      information, as well as what the appropriate limitations      are'' when handling personal data.       Michael Lenett, an attorney with the Cuneo Law Group in      Washington, D.C., who is representing Ms. Dennis, says the      defendants ``would have had to know that disclosure of      personal private information to convicted felons would run a      very serious risk of possible harm.''       A Donnelly spokesman says senior management didn't know      that prisoners were entering the data because the work was      handled through a contractor. Senior management learned of      the arrangement when Ms. Dennis received the letter and ``we      ordered it stopped,'' he says. Using prisoners to handle      consumer data, he says, ``wasn't Metromail's policy then, it      isn't now, and it never will be.'' He said he couldn't      comment on the suit's specific allegations.       The suit names as defendants Metromail and its parent,      along with the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Also      named is closely held Computerized Image & Data Systems Inc.,      the tiny Roslyn Heights, N.Y., concern that contracted to      process Metromail's survey data and then subcontracted the      work to the Texas prison system.       A spokesman for the Texas correctional system said      prisoners still process data, but declined comment on the      suit. A Computerized Image official said he couldn't      immediately respond, but he said the company no longer uses      prisoners to process data.       Inmates in the prison systems of more than a dozen states      routinely process data, answer 800-number calls for      information, even work as telemarketers. Electronic Privacy's      Mr. Rotenberg says the suit will probably shed some light on      the questions of how much sensitive consumer information is      being handled by prisoners, and how adequate the safeguards      are.       Metromail gathers information about consumers through a      variety of sources, such as new-car registrations, birth      notices and title transfers. It sells the lists to commercial      customers, such as telemarketers.       Ms. Dennis provided the information about herself in      response to Metromail circulars that suggested national      grocery-product concerns were prepared to send free product      samples and coupons to consumers who got on Metromail's      ``Shopper Mail list'' by filling out the questionnaire.       If it said [on the circular] it would be sent to a prison,      I certainly wouldn't have filled it out,'' the Ohio      grandmother said in an interview, adding that when she      received the letter, she was ``terribly frightened.''                          ____________________
