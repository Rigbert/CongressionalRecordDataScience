 Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Chairman, I think we are all in agreement, those of us who have spoken, about what the issue here is, and it is not a complicated issue. What all of us believe is that when a patient walks into a doctor's office, we want to know that we are getting the best possible treatment that we can get and that there is not a perverse incentive being offered to the physician to give us less than the best quality care that can be offered.  We do not want to believe that a physician can make more money by offering us lesser care. That is not what health care is supposed to be about and, most importantly, that is not what the doctor-patient relationship is supposed to be about. If there is any relationship built on trust in our society, it is supposed to be the doctor-patient relationship, and historically that has been the case.  What this amendment does, it applies to Federal employees what already exists in law for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries, and it says that there cannot be perverse incentives offered to physicians so that they do not provide Federal employees the best quality care available.  I thank all of the cosponsors for this amendment and look forward to the body's support.  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.
