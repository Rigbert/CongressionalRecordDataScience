Speaker, I understand the School Readiness Act or the Head Start Reauthorization bill will be on the floor. Let me ask if you expect to have an open rule on that bill? Specifically, while you are getting information, we want to be assured hopefully that we will be allowed to offer such amendments as we deem to be appropriate and that we will be allowed to have a substitute for the majority's bill.
