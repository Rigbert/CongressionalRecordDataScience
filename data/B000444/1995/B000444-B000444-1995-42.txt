 I know the Republican whip wants to speak.  Mr. President, I do not want to repeat what I said last night. I agree with Senator Boxer, Senator Snowe, and Senator Harkin about the fact that we should not be getting paid. I will not elaborate. I think it speaks for itself. It is clear.                          ____________________
