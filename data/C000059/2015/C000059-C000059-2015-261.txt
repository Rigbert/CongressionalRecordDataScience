Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3, the Keystone XLPipeline Act. The legislation would immediately authorize the construction, connection, operation, and maintenance of the Keystone XL pipeline.  My constituents are sick and tired of the delays in approving and building the Keystone pipeline. The recent drop in gas prices highlights the economic benefits of increased energy production right here in North America.  Building the Keystone pipeline will increase access to more North American energy sources and further reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East. For the first time in decades, North American energy independence is within our grasp if we make the critical investments in the necessary infrastructure.  President Obama's opposition to the Keystone pipeline and all of its economic benefits shows just how out of touch he is with middle class working families.  The State Department studied the environmental impacts of the Keystone XL pipeline and concluded that it would not have a negative impact. Furthermore, the State Department found that the Keystone XL pipeline project would support roughly 42,000 jobs. Earlier today, the Nebraska Supreme Court dismissed a key lawsuit challenging the Keystone XL pipeline.  The passage of H.R. 3 is the tenth bill approved by the House of Representatives to authorize the construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. Thankfully, the new Republican majority in the Senate has indicated it will take action on similar legislation next week. I know my constituents and hardworking American families hope we can finally start construction on this economically important project.                          ____________________
