Speaker, thanks to my good friend and Michigan colleague Dave Camp for his leadership on this issue. I come from the State of Michigan, where there is no single issue of greater importance than jobs and the economy.  The fact is hundreds of thousands of American jobs rely on exports, and promoting a robust trade agenda will only help bolster our economy and create more jobs. 95 percent of the world's consumers live outside of the United States, so opening up their markets for our manufactured and agricultural goods is a matter of common sense.  In 2010, U.S. exports totaled more than $1.8 trillion, or 12.5 percent of GDP. Michigan ranks 8th in the nation for the number of export-dependent jobs. In 2008, nearly 12,000 companies exported goods from locations within our state. And last year, Michigan export shipments totaled some $44.5 billion.  The three pending free trade agreements are expected to increase Michigan agriculture exports by $45 million per year--the agreement with South Korea alone will increase Michigan pork exports by $4.5 million annually.  The medical device industry also stands to benefit greatly from these agreements. Demand for medical devices in South Korea is expected to grow by 10 percent each year, and the new duty-free status given to devices will give companies like Stryker, headquartered in my district, unprecedented access to that market. In fact, it is my understanding that medical device sales may increase as much as $1 billion. This legislation finally allows us, the United States, to reverse course and export products rather than jobs. Isn't that a good thing? Of course it is!  By removing barriers to U.S. exports, American job creators will have significant new market access: that' good news for business, jobs, and Southwest Michigan; and the entire country.                          ____________________
