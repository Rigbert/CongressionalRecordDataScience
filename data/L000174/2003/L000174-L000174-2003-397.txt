President, today the Senate will confirm another two judicial nominees, bringing the total number of judicial nominees sent by President Bush to be confirmed to 140. With today's vote, the number of judicial nominees confirmed this year alone climbs to 40. That exceeds the number of judges during all of 2000, 1999, and 1997, and is more than twice as many judges as were confirmed during the entire 1996 session. It is more than the average annual confirmations for the 6\1/2\ years the Republican majority controlled the pace of confirmations from 1995 through the first half of 2001. Thus, in the first 7 months of this year, we have already exceeded the year totals for 4 of the 6 years the Republican majority controlled the pace of President Clinton's judicial nominees and the Republican majority's yearly average.  Indeed with the confirmation of this 140th judge, the Senate has now confirmed in 2 years, from July 20, 2001 to July 28, 2003, more judges for President Bush than it was willing to consider during any 3-year period in which President Clinton's nominees were being considered by a Senate Republican majority.  A good way to see how much faster we are proceeding on judicial nominations for a Republican President than Republican Senators were willing to proceed for a Democratic President is to compare where we are on this date over the last several years. Over the last 6\1/2\ years of Republican control under President Clinton, the Republicans allowed only 20 judicial confirmations, on average, by July 28, and included only 4 circuit court nominees, on average, by this time. Today we willhave doubled those benchmarks with the confirmation of the 39th and 40th judicial nominees, which have included 10 circuit court judges. The double standard that Republicans have used in their treatment of judicial nominees is evident from this chart.  On this day, in 1995, only 32 judicial nominations had been confirmed; in 1996, only 14; in 1997, only 9; in 1998 the confirmations totaled 33; in 1999, only 9; and in 2000 the confirmation total by this point of the year was 35. Today, we confirm the 40th judge so far this year. Vacancies in the courts stand at less than half of what they were during the Clinton years and we have more Federal judges serving than ever before.  We have already this year confirmed 10 judges to the Courts of Appeals. This is more than were confirmed in all of 4 of the past 6 years when the Republicans were in the majority--in 1996, 1997, 1999, and 2000. And in the 2 other years, the Tenth Circuit nominee was not confirmed until much later in the year.  Today, the Senate confirms Earl Lee Yeakel and Kathleen Cardone to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Judge Yeakel has been serving on the Texas Court of Appeals since 1998, appointed by then-Governor Bush. Judge Cardone has served as a State court judge on different courts throughout the El Paso area since 1990. Both were just nominated on May 1, their paperwork was not complete until June, and they are being confirmed just a month later. This is another sign of how fair the Democrats have been to this President's nominees.  The Judiciary Committee has already held hearings for 6 of President Bush's nominees for the Western District of Texas alone and for 13 of President Bush's district court nominees from the State of Texas. Eight of those judges were given hearings and confirmed during the 17 months I served as chairman of the Judiciary Committee. That was nearly one judge for Texas every other month, in addition to the four United States Attorneys and three United States Marshals who were reviewed and confirmed in that period of time.  As I have noted throughout the last 3 years, the Senate is able to move expeditiously when we have consensus nominees. Unfortunately, far too many of this President's nominees have records that raise serious concerns about whether they will be fair judges to all parties on all issues.  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.  How much time do I have remaining on this side?
