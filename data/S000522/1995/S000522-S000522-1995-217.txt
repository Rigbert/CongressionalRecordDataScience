Mr. Speaker, I rise to support my colleagues from Rhode Island and New York in their efforts to call attention to human rights abuses by Indonesia in its occupation of East Timor, and to prevent the use of United States military assistance to further Indonesia's atrocities in East Timor.  Indonesia's Armed Forces invaded East Timor in 1975, only weeks after East Timor had attained independence from Portugal. Since then, the Indonesian army has carried out a campaign of what amounts to ethnic cleansing against the Timorese through a program of forced migration. Persecution has been particularly harsh against the Christian population of East Timor.  More than 200,000 Timorese--out of a total population of 700,000--have been killed directly or by starvation in forced migrations from their villages since the Indonesian invasion.  There are recent reports of a renewed campaign of repression of Catholics in East Timor. These reports include atrocities such as the smashing of statues of the Blessed Mother. The campaign has also been directed personally against the Catholic Bishop of Dili [DILLY], Bishop Belo. His phones are tapped, his fax machine is monitored, his visitors are watched, and his freedom of movement is restricted. But Bishop Belo persists in his courageous efforts to defend justice, peace and the preservation of the dignity of his people. Recently, he has set up a church commission to monitor human rights abuses, and a radio station to disseminate information and news.  Mr. Speaker, the people of East Timor comprise a sovereign nation. They differ from most Indonesians in language, religion, ethnicity, history, and culture. They are entitled to independence and freedom. And in the meantime, they are entitled to fundamental human rights including the freedom of religion.                          ____________________
