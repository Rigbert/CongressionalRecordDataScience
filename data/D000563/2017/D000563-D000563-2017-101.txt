President, let me first say at the outset that many of us have extended well wishes to our colleague, Senator Paul, who was injured over the weekend. We wish him a speedy recovery and hope that he returns soon. He is an important part of the Senate and an important colleague to those of us on both sides of the aisle.                          ____________________
