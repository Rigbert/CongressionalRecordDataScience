 President, I say to my good friend from Hawaii, I addressed this issue we are discussing now in my opening remarks this morning. I congratulate him for achieving this milestone. He has been an inspiration not only to Members of the Senate but to many Americans throughout his life, beginning, obviously, with his extraordinary service for our country during World War II.  As I indicated to my good friend, I addressed this earlier today. I wish to join with others in congratulating him on this important milestone he has achieved today.
