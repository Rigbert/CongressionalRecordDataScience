President, the Senate passed a rescission bill today that I wish was not needed. Unfortunately, too often disasters like the California earthquake and the Oklahoma City bombing occur that we cannot foresee or prevent. Those events are tragedies, and we must do what we can to assist the victims.  But there is another disaster that made this bill necessary--a disaster we could have stopped, one that will affect every American for years to come. That disaster is the Republican's budget resolution. There is not a Member of this Congress that doesn't want to balance the Federal budget, but there is a right way and a wrong way to do it. The budget resolution passed by Congress tries to right 30 years of overspending with 7 years of draconian cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, education, affordable housing, heating assistance, and just about every program hard-working American families depend upon.  This was not a bipartisan budget resolution. Republicans rejected President Clinton's more moderate approach. I voted against that resolution. Unfortunately, not enough Senators joined me to block this disastrous budget that has created the need for the cuts we are making today.  In April, I came to the Senate floor to vote against H.R. 1158, the earlier rescission bill that focussed its cuts on the poor, the hungry, and on our children. I said then that I hoped Republicans and Democrats could find a way to work together to develop a bipartisan bill that balanced those cuts more evenly. We have done that, and I believe the bill we have passed today is more equitable than the rescission bill that I voted against a few months ago.  The cuts to education programs, to AmeriCorps, and to programs fighting drug use in our schools and communities, have been reduced. To offset those cuts, administrative costs for the Federal Government were trimmed.  This is not a perfect bill. I am deeply concerned about many of the cuts included in the rescission package, most importantly the cut of $319 million to the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program [LIHEAP]. I fought to restore funding to LIHEAP in the original Senate rescission bill, and I have continued to oppose cuts to this important program as the House and Senate worked on a compromise.  This cut will hurt Vermonters who cannot afford to heat their homes during our long New England winters. I do not believe that most Americans would choose to let those people freeze so that the budget can be balanced in 7 years as opposed to 10, or so that wealthy Americans can get a bigger tax break next year. Certainly I would not.  I am also extremely disappointed with a timber provision, pushed through by special interests, that could be devastating to our Nation's forests. There is no justification for this timber legislation. It is a gift to special interest, powerful PAC money, and the champions of misinformation. The letter I will include for the Record makes this clear.  I commend Senator Murray for the work she has done to establish a sustainable forest-based economy in the State of Washington, while creating 3,500 new jobs in the lumber, wood manufacturing, and paper industries. I applaud her for having the courage to stand up to this backdoor attempt to weaken the laws protecting our forests without hearings, without committee mark-ups, without public participation, or open floor debate. I hope that this is not an indication of the way this Congress intends to address our environmental laws. The American people did not vote for that kind of change, and they will not stand for it any more than I will.  I voted for this rescission bill today--not because it is a good bill, but because it is a necessary bill. It is necessary to pay for the disasters in California, in Oklahoma, and for the disaster that the Republicans have created with their budget resolution.          regarding the national bankruptcy review commission
