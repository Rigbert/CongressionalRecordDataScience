President, I am pleased that Chairman Harkin has included a proposal of mine in his amendment. Under my proposal, eligible elementary and secondary schools can offer grain products to students.  Grains are a critical part of a healthy diet. They are an excellent source of fiber. The 2005 dietary guidelines for Americans recommend that Americans consume three or more (2-ounce) ounce-equivalents of whole grain products per day. A diet that includes higher levels of fiber-containing grain products provides many health benefits, such as reducing the risk of coronary heart disease. This proposal helps improve the diet and health of our children.
