 This unanimous-consent request has been cleared on both sides. We will have three votes beginning in about 10 minutes from now and that leaves very little left to do before final passage. So we are almost through.  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I now be recognized for up to 8 minutes for an explanation of the amendment on Cambodia, which is at the desk, and further, following that debate, the Senate proceed to vote on or in relation to the McConnell amendment No. 886, the one I will describe shortly, to be immediately followed by a vote on or in relation to the McConnell amendment No. 887, also about Cambodia, which I anticipate will be voice-voted, to be immediately followed by a vote on or in relation to the Allard amendment No. 891, to be immediately followed by a vote on or in relation to the Dodd amendment No. 901. I further ask consent that there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the remaining votes in the sequence. I finally ask unanimous consent that all votes in the sequence following the first vote be limited to 10 minutes in length.
