Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Mr. Speaker, again I wanted to thank my colleagues. This bill would not have happened without the great work done on both sides of the aisle, and in particular, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson-Lee) who came to our committee and testified and her work in the previous Congress, as well.  This morning, I met with a number of students in my district on a college campus. I know we have done some very good things here. The awareness level is up. Whereas, a year or two ago, I do not think that awareness level was there. But now, in fact, warnings are posted in a lot of dorms and many campuses across the country. The word is out, particularly among college women, that they have to be careful and they need to go to parties with a friend and they need to make sure that whatever they are drinking, a soft drink or whatever it might be, it needs to be watched carefully.  There is an awareness, too, by parents warning their daughters in particular as they go off to school, particularly now as this school year has started off, to be careful.  This is a nightmare. It needs to end. This bill does that in a very strong and bipartisan way that deserves enactment into law.  I appreciate everyone's support, everyone's statements today.
