 President, today marks the 23d anniversary of the monumental Supreme Court decision, Roe versus Wade, which legalized abortion nationwide and affirmed the right of all American women to choose safe, legal abortion services. I join Americans across the country in commemorating this important day in our history.  Yet this is a bittersweet celebration. We are still fighting to safeguard our rights, and battles are being waged on many fronts. Each year, antichoice forces in Congress use the appropriations process to erode women's abortion rights every chance they get. In 1995, they were successful in denying Federal workers abortion coverage in their health benefit packages. They will try again this year for more victories.  On this special anniversary, we must remember those who have suffered and lost their lives because of their commitment to protecting the health of women in our country. Increasingly, the radical minority in the antiabortion crusade has turned to violence to pursue their agenda, with blatant disregard for who is caught in their crossfire. Over the last several years, I, like so many Americans, have been greatly disturbed by images of clinics under siege by vandals and arsonists, and horrified by reports of doctors murdered because they perform abortions--a legal procedure. We cannot let our reproductive rights be taken away because of a threat of violence, nor can we allow the actions of radical fanatics to dictate our Nation's public policy decisions. Just as our clinics are under attack, so too are our personal freedoms.  Emboldened by their momentum, Mr. President, antiabortion forces in both Houses of Congress passed H.R. 1833, the so-called Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act of 1995. By their own admission, this is the first step in the antichoice movement's strategy to deny women their right to choose -- one procedure at a time. This legislation is an affront to the women of this country, and an unprecedented intrusion into the autonomy of medical professionals to determine the best methods of care for their patients. I am reminded today of the frustration I felt during debate of this bill, of the misinformation and divisive rhetoric infused in the conversation.  The antichoice majorities in Congress may have forgotten that most Americans feel abortion should be legal. They may also have forgotten about the days of back-alley abortions and women dying of infection from unsanitary procedures. Well, I haven't forgotten and I will do whatever I can to ensure the days of the back-alley abortion, a virtual death sentence for women, remain a tragic thing of the past. Let today remind us that, for now at least, the law is on our side.  I urge President Clinton to join us today in commemorating this landmark anniversary. And I respectfully request that he deliver on his promise to veto H.R. 1833. The women of this country are counting on him to do what is right. I know he will not let us down.                          ____________________
