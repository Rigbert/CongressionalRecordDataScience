 Speaker, I would like to have printed in the Record statements by high school students from my home state of Vermont, who were speaking at my recent town meeting on issues facing young people today. I am asking that you please insert these statements in the Congressional Record as I believe that the views of these young people will benefit my colleagues.    Statement by Erica Lewis and Dan Johnson Regarding Drunk Driving       Erica Lewis: We would like to express a concern that is      becoming a big issue with teen Vermonters today. Our concern      is probably the same as many others: Teen driving under the      influence of alcohol.       Young adults are usually both inexperienced drivers as well      as inexperienced drinkers. These two combined is a fatality      waiting to happen. Alcohol, when consumed, decreases      alertness, causes depression, nausea, unconsciousness,      hangovers, and possible overdose, which could lead to death.      We, as teenagers, should be aware of the serious risks that      are involved when wrong choices are made and lives are at      stake. Driving should be considered a privilege, not a right,      for we all have the right to be safe while driving, and when      alcohol is involved, no one can predict the outcome. Anyone      of us here today could be driving down the road next week      and, because of a drunk driver, never make it to where we      were headed. Because of this increasing problem, there needs      to be more awareness of alcohol and its effects. It is up to      us, the younger generation, to make an impression on our      peers and those that follow, and most of all to prove to our      elders that we have what it takes to make the right decisions      and follow through.       There is no overall solution to this problem, but we, as      mature young adults, should make a strong effort to plan      ahead before it gets to a point where it might be too late,      whether that be make arrangements for a designated driver or      staying until you are capable of driving.       Dan Johnson: A suggestion that we have and strongly agree      with is a paper called a contract for life. It is an      agreement between teenagers and their parents stating, if at      any given time that either they feel incapable of driving,      there will be transportation provided, and safe      transportation, for them. This contract was given to us from      our drivers ed teachers at the Essex Technical Center. Other      suggestions that we agree with is larger penalties for adults      in furnishing alcohol for minors at stores to sell this. Teen      drinking and driving will always be a problem, but,      hopefully, with our help, we can reduce it. Thank you for our      time.       Congressman Sanders: A very important contribution to this      discussion. Thanks very much.                                  ____ Statement by Jesse Field, Renay Thompson and Elaine Griffen Regarding                            Capital Punishment       Jesse Field: Last year, every U.S. citizen committed 45      homicides. None of them were ever prosecuted. These crimes      were planned out at least ten years in advance, and the      victim not only knew about the coming execution, but was kept      in prison the entire time. How, you may ask, can this happen.      Well, the answer is, these crimes were legal.       You may realize by now what we are talking about: Capital      punishment. You may also be saying, but these people were the      scum of the earth, they don't deserve to live after what they      did. This statement raises a serious moral question. But      there are other reasons, as well, to abolish capital      punishing: High costs, increased murder rates, and      discrimination.       Elaine Griffen: Many people often argue it takes a lot of      their tax dollars to keep an inmate locked up, and why should      they have to pay so he or she can live? The truth is, it does      cost them a lot. A study from 1997 found that it costs      $20,000 per year to keep a prisoner in jail. That's $800,000      to lock them up for forty years. However, the same source      found that it costs taxpayers $2 million to execute someone.      This is mostly because there are so many more appeals and      Court costs attributed to an inmate on death row. So, in      fact, taxpayers are not getting a break when they execute a      criminal.       Renay Thompson: Another common argument for the death      penalty is capital punishment deters crime. This is not true      at all. When a crime is committed, often the last thing on a      potential criminal's, mind is what consequences they will      suffer as a result of this.       And as George Bernard Shaw says, ``It is the deed that      teaches, not the name we give it.'' Murder and capital      punishment are not opposites that cancel one another, but      similars that breed their kind. Studies done have shown that,      as the number of executions increase, so does the murder      rate. Georgia, which reinstated capital punishment in 1983,      saw an increase of 20 percent in their murder rate in the      following year, also a year in which the national homicide      rate fell 5 percent. When Florida started executing prisoners      again in 1979, the 1980 murder rate went up 28 percent, and      1981 and 1982 were the highest in recent history. These      incidents show, as Michael Godfried put it, that the state      may be, tragically, leading by example.       Jesse Field: Discrimination is also a major issue in      sentencings and executions. Poor people cannot afford      lawyers, and their defense is not as good. They are convicted      and given the death penalty more often. There are also issues      of racial discrimination involved. While only 12 to 13      percent of our nation's population is African-American, 41      percent of people on death row are black. A study done by the      New Jersey Supreme Court shows there is strong evidence of      racial bias in jurors. They are more likely to give the death      penalties to minorities than whites. New Jersey is      considering abolishing capital punishment on this issue      alone, because it leads to a constitutional violation.       Elaine Griffen: Despite the strong case both points make      against capital punishment, the most important issue by far      is that of morals. For some people, it takes the     form of religion. For example, the brother of the woman who      was murdered by Carla Fay Tucker is strongly against the      death penalty for reasons of religion. He met with his      sister's killer while she was on death row. He forgave her      and she responded with tears and apologies. We killed this      woman anyway. Bud Welch's daughter, Julie, died in the      Oklahoma City bombing, and still he does not support the      execution of Timothy McVay. He rejects legal murder for      reasons of his religion, and also other moral issues such as      the sanctity of life.       Another moral point that is important to make is the fact      that we are trying to teach people that murder is wrong by      committing it. By the logic of our government, we then killed      and are wrong, and deserve to be killed as well.       Renay Thompson: It is interesting to note that the United      States is the only developed country that still uses the      death penalty. Other countries in the same category with the      U.S. on this issue are China, Iraq, India, North Korea, and      Cuba, among others.       We would like to see a Federal abolition of capital      punishment like the one from 1972 to 1976. As an alternative      to the death penalty, we suggest life penalties without      parole. These would be less costly, and the millions of      dollars per prisoner saved could be reallocated into a fund      to build a greater quantity of more secure prisons.       Congressman Sanders: That is an excellent presentation.                                  ____       Statement by Alia Stavrand Woolf Regarding Charter Schools       Alia Stavrand Woolf: For the record, my name is Alia      Stavrand Woolf. I am a ninth grader at the Gailer School.       All right. I used to go to the Shelburne Community School,      and it wasn't working for me. Classes had no depth, and math      was going agonizingly slowly. The only school work I enjoyed      was my independent study. Students generally weren't allowed      to broaden their studies. So students who already ``got it''      were asked to help the other students in the class learn the      material.       Well, this sounds great in principle, and does work up to a      point. But after a while, it got to me. Think about what it      would be like if all day, every day, you had to watch      Jeopardy reruns and you couldn't turn the TV off because,      during the commercials, you were expected to explain the      answers to your nextdoor neighbor.       I became a difficult student because I felt like I was      wasting my time in school and not learning nearly as much as      I could. By the end of fifth grade, my parents and I were      pretty tired of trying to work within the system. When we      moved to Charlotte that year, we decided it was time to look      at what educational options were open. We asked the Charlotte      public school if I could skip a grade so I could be more      challenged in school. They said no. We considered home      schooling, but both my parents work.       After a lot of looking, we found a private school in      Middlebury called the Gailer School. It integrates different      disciplines and incorporates independent study and community      service. We met with the headmaster, and he actually talked      with me, not to me, about what I wanted to learn. But private      school tuition was not in the budget. I would have to start      doing a lot more chores around the house, like all of the      laundry, vacuuming, lawn mowing, taking care of my brother, a      lot of work, so my mom could work more hours. I would also      have to get on the bus at 7:00 a.m. to ride to Middlebury and      wouldn't get home until 5:00 at night. This was no easy      decision for my parents or for me.       Most public school classes are aimed at the average      student. When you think about it, only one percent of      students will be perfectly average. There are always special      education classes, but not nearly so often are there advanced      placement offerings.       All ends of the spectrum need to be addressed. A student      should not have to go to private school to have their needs      addressed, and it is mainly the elite who can choose an      appropriate education for their child. Shouldn't there be the      opportunity for all students to be challenged?       Students now come from as far south as Rutland, as far      north as Fairfax, and as far east as Rochester to go the      Gailer School in Middlebury. This should send a clear message      to lawmakers that many students care so deeply about their      education that they are willing to make significant      sacrifices.       There is simply not enough scholarship money out there so      that all students who want to can go to private school.      Frequently, students start at private schools, but then have      to drop out for financial reasons. While I am fortunate that      my family has been able to send me to private school, it      should not be only the economically elite who have access to      alternative education.       I think a solution to this problem is federal legislation      encouraging states to institute charter schools. Options      would then open up for disadvantaged students. Because      charter schools are still technically public schools, any      student could go to the school of their choice. Students,      like adults, need options; no school fits all students, just      like no company is right for all workers.       In our free-market society, students need the best grade      school education they can get, because they will have to      compete for good colleges and jobs. I do not understand why      our system of public schools is set up like a protectorate.      It seems like more effort goes into maintaining the status      quo than offering kids like me an excellent education.       Students deserve the opportunity to attend charter schools      that are innovative and visionary. I see charter schools as      an especially exciting opportunity for all students who are      not average to have their talents appreciated and their      interests encouraged. I love learning, and I learn best when      I love my school.       Congressman Sanders: Thank you very much for an excellent      presentation.                               ____________________
