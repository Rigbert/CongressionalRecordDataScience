Speaker, the debate today on whether to support this bill comes down to a very simple question: Why not?  If millions of Americans want the choice of keeping the insurance that they have, why not?  If you believe Congress acting together, not the President acting unilaterally, should try to help people who have lost their coverage, why not?  If you believe that ordinary Americans, not the Federal Government, should decide what their insurance plans look like, why not?  We have a chance today to provide hope to millions of Americans who got that cancelation notice, hope that they can keep the insurance that they like, hope that they are going to have even more choices, and hope that they, not the Federal Government, can pick what their insurance plans actually look like.  So let me be clear.  Our bill, H.R. 3350, does not fix ObamaCare, the President's health care bill. It is only an attempt to help people harmed by this law. But if we can provide some relief to people from this disaster, why not?  Let's defeat the motion to recommit and pass the underlying bill.  I yield back the balance of my time.
