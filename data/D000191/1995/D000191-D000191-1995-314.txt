Now, I do not know, but if someone offered me a 21 percent rate of return on my modest savings, I might say, is there not a risk. That seems like an awful high rate of return.  If they said, no, Congressman, do not worry about it, there is no risk at all, I think maybe I would make a few phone calls. But the Wall Street people, the Goldman Sachs firm, which is into Mexico for $25.2 billion over the last 3 years, and others, said, oh, no, this is an emerging economy. There is no risk. This is just sort of like the United States except the people speak Spanish. There is no risk down there. Do not worry about the government. They just had an election.  Well, they had an election 6 years ago. The party that lost won, and they were the one we liked the most. And this last time the party that we liked the most, well, they won again. They may have fixed the election, but they always win, so there is no risk. They do not allow people to organize, labor unions. And if they do organize the labor unions, do not worry, we also control the judiciary because we do not have an independent judiciary in this country. And the judiciary will take care of those pesky people trying to drive up wages there in Mexico. So we will keep wages down there even lower than we can drive wages in the United States so your investment in Mexico is totally safe.  This is what is extraordinary to me, that we have allowed this thing to spin so far out of control, that we get sold such a bill of goods. Not you and I, since we voted against the NAFTA agreement, but so many of our colleagues. And now we are going to go to this extent to cover some very prestigious fannies around here and extend $40 billion of our taxpayers' money to bail them out. They could not get it through the Congress, to the credit of this institution. But now they are going to find another way to do it.
