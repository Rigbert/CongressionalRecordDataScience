 President, let me just echo the remarks of the majority leader. I see that Senator Warner is now on the Senate floor. He and I had a conversation at noon about a proposal he hoped to offer. It is my understanding, I would say to my friend, the majority leader, that his proposal has just been handed to us. That was the reason for the delay this afternoon, with all due respect to the Senator from Virginia. I know he was working on drafting it, but that is the reason we have not been able to hopefully get to the point of having an agreement, which the majority leader and I both would like to have.  We are ready for this debate, and now that Senator Warner is on the Senate floor and has his proposal, we will give a copy to the majority, and I will be able to see it myself, and hopefully, shortly, we will be able to enter into an agreement that will be satisfactory to both sides. Certainly, that is my hope and my expectation.
