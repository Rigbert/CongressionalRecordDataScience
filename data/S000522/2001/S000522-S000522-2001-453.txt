Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor St. Joachim's Roman Catholic Church in Trenton, New Jersey, as they celebrate their Centennial. At the turn of the 20th Century, millions of immigrants from Italy journeyed to the United States in the hopes of starting a new life. Thousands of these immigrants--who later become proud Italian-Americans--settled in Trenton, New Jersey.  These immigrants found jobs in the city's once thriving steel mills, rubber factories, and pottery factories. But life was about much more than work. These newcomers sought comfort in their Italian culture, kinship with their fellow immigrants, and solace and guidance in their Roman Catholic faith.  In 1901, 100 years ago, because of cultural differences and language barriers, Rev. James A. McFaul, Bishop of Trenton, established St. Joachim's Parish to accommodate the spiritual needs of the city's newest Catholics. Bishop McFaul gave the task of establishing this new parish to Rev. Aloysius Pozzi, an Italian Priest who at the time had been in the United States for less than five years.  This new Parish had a meager physical beginning. There was no church, and Masses were held in Centennial Hall on Hudson and Genesee Streets. But while lacking in physical materials, this new Parish was rich in members and spirit. In fact, the first Mass of St. Joachim's was offered for 1,500 people.  Plans to build their own church were quickly developed and on August 15, 1903, the cornerstone of St. Joachim's Church was laid during festivities attended by church and civic leaders, as well as thousands of Italian-American immigrants. But Rev. Pozzi, who later became a Monsignor, did not rest once the church was built; instead he worked tirelessly to establish a new parochial school, which opened in 1909. For 90 years, St. Joachim's School provided area children with a value-filled Catholic education until declining enrollment forced its closure in 1999.  Mr. Speaker, for 100 years, St. Joachim's has faithfully served its parishioners, ministering and providing services to the community. I ask all of my colleagues to join with me in congratulating St. Joachim's on their Centennial Celebration and to thank them for all of their contributions to the rich heritage and culture of Trenton, the Capital City of New Jersey.                          ____________________
