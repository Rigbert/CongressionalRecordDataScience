 When our resolution comes to the floor, I hope a handful of my Republican colleagues will take a look at it and realize that we have to give these students a second chance at their lives. We misled them into attending for-profit schools that were worthless. The schools defrauded them. They ended up with a debt to our government, and under the provisions of the Higher Education Act, that debt can be forgiven. Let's give these defrauded student borrowers a second chance. Ultimately, they deserve an opportunity from our government to have a better holiday coming before them and a better life ahead.  I yield the floor.  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Scott of Florida).
