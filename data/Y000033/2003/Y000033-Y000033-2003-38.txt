Mr. Chairman, I want to compliment the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) and my friend, the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Duncan), the chairman of the committee and rise in opposition. I do this somewhat reluctantly because the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) has talked to me about this issue over some time.  But to have a cliche, I do not think this amendment does anything right now but muddy the waters, and this is a very clean bill, and I would suggest respectfully that although his endeavors have great merit, that to put it on this bill, at this time, would be a detriment to the bill itself. We have had most, I would say all of the harbors speak out very strongly about this.  As the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Oberstar) said, if this was to be left in the bill or be adopted in this committee, then I think there would be a great opposition to the legislation because of OMB. And I would prefer that not to happen. I would prefer this to be a clean bill. I will work with the gentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher) to try to solve this problem because I happen to agree that there ought to be some revenues generated from all the cargo containers that come into our ports, but I do not believe this is the appropriate vehicle to do so.
