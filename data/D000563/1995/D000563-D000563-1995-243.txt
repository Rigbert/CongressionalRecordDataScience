Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from New York [Mrs. Lowey], the newest member of our subcommittee.  I guess it is odd for people to be watching this and wondering what a resident of New York City is doing on the Committee on Agriculture. But I can tell you that she has noted, as many have, that this bill goes far beyond addressing the concerns of rural America. It addresses nutrition programs and environmental concerns which are of as much importance to her home city and home State as well.
