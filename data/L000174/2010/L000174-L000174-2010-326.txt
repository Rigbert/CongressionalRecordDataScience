President, I would like to direct the attention of the Senate to an article that was recently published in the Rutland Herald about Seldon Technologies, located in Windsor, VT.  This article describes the laudable efforts of a Vermont company taking part in the ongoing disaster relief operation in Haiti. Seldon Technologies has donated one of its state-of-the-art water filtration devices to a nonprofit organization that provides clean water to people in developing countries and those affected by natural disasters, such as Haiti. I commend Seldon for using its technology to help the many Haitians who are still desperately in need of assistance.  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this article entitled ``Windsor Water Company Ships Help to Haiti'' be printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:               Windsor Water Company Ships Help to Haiti                           (By Josh O'Gorman)       Windsor, VT.--A local company is doing its part to help      with disaster relief in Haiti.       Seldon Technologies, which develops state-of-the-art water      filtration devices, has donated one of its products to Water      Missions International, a South Carolina-based nonprofit that      works to provide clean water to developing countries and      disaster areas such as Haiti.       Seldon Technologies donated a Seldon WaterBox Mobile      Filtration System, which will help Water Missions aid workers      stay healthy and provide immediate, clean, drinking water to      temporary shelters.       ``The Seldon staff are excited about the opportunity to      utilize our new filtration products on behalf of those in      need,'' said CEO Alan G. Cummings. ``Such use matches our      corporate mission. Seldon's progress has been helped      immeasurably by our Senator Leahy and his interest in new      technology initiatives in Vermont.''       Democratic U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy has secured several      Department of Defense contracts for Seldon to develop water      filtration products for civilian and military use.       The WaterBox, which retails for $2,695, can provide water      to 390 people a day, based upon the World Health      Organization's disaster standard of 1.9 gallons per person,      said Heidi Luquer, who handles disaster and relief for Seldon      Technologies.       Brad Reed, president and chief operating officer for Water      Missions International, said the donation fits his      organization's mission.       ``It's a good example of groups trying to help each other      when one approach complements the other,'' said Reed, whose      organization has been working to provide clean drinking water      in Haiti since 2004 and had 22 clean-water projects up and      running prior to the Jan. 12 earthquake that killed more than      200,000 people and left more than 1 million homeless.       Water Missions International has increased its efforts      since the earthquake, bringing in an additional 12 aid      workers from Germany, Honduras and the U.S., and will have 80      water projects in place by the end of the week, Reed said.       Seldon's WaterBox is currently en route to Haiti and is      expected arrive by the beginning of next week, said Reed.
