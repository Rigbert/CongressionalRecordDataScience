 Mr. McCONNELL. I think I heard some of our colleagues say these Draconian Medicare cuts would actually lead to the closure of some rural hospitals. I am wondering if the Senator from Maine thinks that may even be possible given the magnitude of these Medicare cuts we are hearing complaints about all across America.
