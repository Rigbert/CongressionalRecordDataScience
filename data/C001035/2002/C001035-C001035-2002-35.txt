 Support for our proposal is growing with each hour. I am excited about that. This proposal offers real relief to our State governments that are struggling with budget shortfalls. But, most importantly, it offers the promise that low-income families who depend on Medicaid will not face a cutoff of some of their important benefits.  The Senator from West Virginia raises a very good point. There are health care providers in my State, as well as his, rural hospitals in particular, that are struggling to make ends meet. The threat of Medicaid cuts imposed by States trying to balance their budgets during this very difficult fiscal time poses a threat to their ability to continue to provide quality care.  That is why we have the support of so many health care provider groups.  I am going to read from some of letters that we have received that endorse our proposal. In some cases, the letters speak to earlier legislation that I introduced along with my friend and colleague, Senator Ben Nelson of Nebraska. But, as I said earlier, we have pooled our efforts because we want to get relief to the States as fast as possible.  Let me tell you what our visiting nurses say about the importance of providing this relief.  This is a letter that I will read from the Visiting Nurse Associations of America. It is signed by the president, Carolyn Markey.  She writes:       On behalf of the Visiting Nurse Associations of America      (VNAA), I would like to express our strong support for you      and Senator Ben Nelson's proposed legislation that would      provide temporary fiscal relief to states for Medicaid-     covered health care services. VNAA is the national membership      association for non-profit, community-based Visiting Nurse      Agencies (VNAs), which collectively care for approximately      50% of all Medicaid home health patients each year.       VNAA is concerned that approximately one-half of the states      across the nation have had to cut their FY 2002 Medicaid      budgets in order to avoid a budget crisis. We fear that the      majority of states will implement additional cost-containment      measures, including reducing benefits, increasing beneficiary      cost-sharing and further reducing Medicaid reimbursement to      health care providers.       On average, Medicaid already reimburses providers      significantly less than the cost of care.  That is an important point. There are already reimbursement levels that aren't covering the cost of providing this essential care.  The letter goes on to say:       VNAA's 2001 data shows that, collectively, VNAs are      incurring an average $565 loss per Medicaid patient, with an      annual loss of $148,500. VNAs' mission is to provide care to      all eligible persons regardless of their condition or ability      to pay. Because of this mission, VNAs will attempt to      continue to admit all eligible Medicaid beneficiaries, but      subsidizing Medicaid will force VNAs to cut other social      service programs that are funded through charity      contributions, such as Meals on Wheels and preventive health      clinics.       Your legislation is sorely needed at this time. It would      help states maintain eligibility and program levels in order      for low-income families, children, seniors and persons with      disabilities to continue to receive the health care they      need. It will also prevent the exodus of some providers from      Medicaid participation, and prevent other providers from      having to cut vital community-based social services.  Those are the stakes. The stakes are high.  I ask unanimous consent to have the full text of the letter from Carolyn Markey, the president of the Visiting Nurse Associations of America, printed in the Record.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                       Visiting Nurse Associations                                                   of America,                                     Washington, DC, May 29, 2002.     Hon. Susan M. Collins,     Russell Senate Office Building,     Washington, DC.
