Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.  Well, here we are again, yet another short-term pass. It is a heck of a way to run a great nation. Our system is falling apart: 140,000 bridges on the National Highway System need repair or replacement; 40 percent of the surface National Highway System is in such bad shape we have to dig up the roadbed and resurface; and we have an $86 billion backlog in transit just to bring the existing transit up to a state of good repair. It is so bad that we are killing people in the Nation's Capital unnecessarily because of the state of disrepair of the Metro system.  It is embarrassing. The United States of America has gone from number one in the world, unparalleled in terms of its infrastructure in the Eisenhower era and through a good deal of the latter part of the last century, to 26th and falling fast. We are investing less of a percentage of our GDP in infrastructure repairs and maintenance--let alone, building out a new system--than virtually every nation in the world.                              {time}  1415  We are down to around 1 percent. There are many developing nations who are investing much, much more because they know they have to move their people and their goods more efficiently in a world economy.  We cannot continue to kick this can down the road. The road is at a dead end. Today, we will reluctantly go along with a 2-month patch because, if we do not act today, at the end of this month, June 1, 4,000 people will be laid off at DOT and all Federal funding for surface transportation and transit would stop. That would be the end of it. It wouldn't be authorized.  States that had bills pending couldn't be paid, and States that want to get new commitments for new projects wouldn't be able to do it, a tragedy at the height of the construction season. Sixty days should be enough time to negotiate a long-term bill.  Today, we introduce the GROW AMERICA Act written by the administration. It has many, many good points to it, especially the spending levels. We need to enhance spending. We can't pretend, Oh, we are going to do more with less. We are past that point.  Look at what has happened to the purchasing power of the gas tax, which hasn't been changed since 1993, two and a half times faster road traffic volume is going up than we are dealing with the funding issues. We are in a huge deficit situation, and there are many, many ways--many of them proposed on a bipartisan basis--to deal with this. We should be able to work that out.  More importantly, this committee writes the policy. We introduced a bill today that sets the levels for $87 billion. It is an increase in transit to deal with the backlog, an increase in highways to deal with the insufficiencies there, a new dedicated program for freight; and it puts some more money into rail--commuter rail, in particular--to deal with positive train control and other issues.  We believe that this is the last wake-up call to give Congress time. Sixty days is more than enough time to write a long-term authorization and for the Ways and Means Committee to figure out a way to fund it.  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.
