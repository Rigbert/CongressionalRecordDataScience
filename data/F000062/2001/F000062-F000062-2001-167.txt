 President, I rise today to introduce the ``State Criminal Alien Assistance Program Reauthorization Act of 2001,'' bipartisan legislation that would authorize funds to relieve State and county governments of the some of the high costs of incarcerating persons who enter this country illegally and are later convicted of felonies or multiple misdemeanors. I am pleased to be joined in introducing this bill by Senators Jon Kyl, Bob Graham, John McCain, Harry Reid, Jeff Bingaman, and John Kerry.  The broad principle on which this bill is based is simple: the control of illegal immigration is a Federal responsibility. The Federal government's failure to control illegal immigration, and the financial and human consequences of this failure are, thus, Federal responsibilities as well.  More and more, the fiscal consequences of illegal immigration are being dealt to the states and local counties. The ``State Criminal Alien Assistance Program Reauthorization Act of 2001'' would properly vest the fiscal burden of incarcerating illegal immigrants who commit crimes with the Federal government. It would do this by authorizing up to $750 million for federal reimbursement to the States and county governments for the direct costs associated with incarcerating undocumented felons.  At the initiative of my colleague from Florida, Senator Bob Graham, the Federal government took the first steps in 1994 in addressing these costs by authorizing reimbursements to State and local governments through the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, SCAAP, established by the Violent Crime and Law Enforcement Act of 1994. Since 1997, the authorization level for SCAAP has been $650 million. Last year, the provision authorizing SCAAP funding through the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund expired. Enactment of the reauthorization legislation would constitute an acknowledgment that these costs, though borne by other levels of government, remain the Federal government's obligation.  Winning enactment of this authorization bill is half of what Congress needs to do to provide adequate funding to states and counties for this important program. Congress also must appropriate an adequate level of funding for SCAAP, and my colleagues and I will be working in the Appropriations Committee to assure that this is done.  This bill would help all states that are experiencing increasing costs from incarcerating undocumented felons, both low-impact and high-impact states. Even in historically low impact states and counties SCAAP funding has been on the rise. SCAAP funding to Fairfax County, Virginia, for example, has risen from $14,906 in FY 1999 to $2 million in FY 2000. In the County of Outgamie, Wisconsin, SCAAP funding has jumped from $0 in FY 1999 to $548,458 in FY 2000. In the State of Mississippi, SCAAP funding rose from $47,171 in FY 1999 to $$780,795 in FY 2000.  Clearly, these numbers suggest that the increasing costs to states and local governments for incarcerating criminal aliens is not just a problem for States on the southwest border but, rather, it is a nationwide problem.  High impact States, like California, continue to face extraordinary criminal alien incarceration costs. In February 1997, there were 17,904 undocumented felons in the California correctional system with Immigration and Naturalization Service holds. By the end of February 2001, there were 20,937 illegal alien inmates in the system with INS holds. This year, California taxpayers can expect to spend $576.1 million to pay for what is, indeed, a Federal obligation. In fact, 1995, the first year in which SCAAP funding was awarded, California has spent a total of $3.8 billion in costs directly associated with incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens.  Local counties often shoulder a disproportional share of the burden of criminal aliens as well. In California, for example, counties are responsible for providing local law enforcement, detention, prosecution, probation and indigent defense services. While SCAAP only reimburses a portion of the costs directly related to the incarceration of undocumented criminal aliens, most other indirect criminal justice expenditures, are fully borne by County taxpayers.  Furthermore, while funding levels for SCAAP has remained about the same, the number of local governments applying for the awards has greatly increased over the past few years. In fiscal year 1996, local governments were reimbursed at a rate of approximately 60 percent for the costs of incarcerating criminal aliens convicted of a felony or two or more misdemeanors when only 90 jurisdictions applied for such reimbursement. For fiscal year 2000, 361 local jurisdictions applied for SCAAP funding, and reimbursement amounted to less than 40 percent of the costs incurred by these jurisdictions.  SCAAP funding is especially important to Los Angeles County, which has a larger undocumented immigrant population than any single state except California, and operates the nation's largest local criminal justice system. Los Angeles County also has a violent crime rate which is far higher than the national average, and accounts for about one out of every 16 violent crimes committed in the United States.  A recent study conducted by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department concluded that 23 percent of the County's inmate population consisted of criminal aliens in 2000. The study further found that the impact of criminal aliens on the criminal justice system in Los Angeles County had doubled from approximately $75 million in 1990 to more than $150 million in 1999.  There are numerous other jurisdictions in California that are significantly affected by criminal aliens, including the border counties of San Diego and Imperial. Like Los Angeles County, these counties are not being adequately reimbursed for the costs associated with the incarceration of criminal aliens.  In FY 1999 San Diego and Imperial counties spent a combined $56 million on law enforcement and indirect costs involving illegal aliens, whether criminal or not. These costs include criminal alien incarceration, justice and court costs, emergency medical care, autopsies, and burials of indigents. SCAAP compensated these counties for only $8 million or 15 percent of these costs which went solely to the cost of incarcerating criminal aliens.  Border counties, however, are taking a hit in other areas: San Diego, has to spend 7 percent of its total public safety budget to cover other costs, including indigent defense, court and emergency medical costs; Imperial County expends 16 percent of its public safety budget to cover these costs.  The structure of public financing in California makes it extremely difficult for local governments, especially county governments, to increase their sources of revenue. This problem is greatly exacerbated when they are also forced to pay for costs related to the Federal responsibility of controlling illegal immigration.  Without the ability to raise taxes in any significant way to deal with the costs associated with criminal illegal aliens, counties are forced to cut back on other expenditures that would otherwise benefit the legal resident population.  It is unfortunate, that at a time when Congress is concerned about unfunded mandates, the Administration has seen fit to proposed cutting SCAAP funding by almost $300 million for fiscal year 2002. Given the increasing numbers of illegal aliens that California and other states incarcerate each year, the Administration's decision in this regard is perplexing.  If the Administration has its way, States and local counties would face an unfair set of choices with real consequences: either cut other essential local law enforcement programs and community services, or raise local taxes. Neither of these are acceptable options.  I am pleased that this legislation has the support of such organizations as the National Association of Counties and the California Correctional Peace Officers Association. I ask for unanimous consent that their letters in support of this measure be printed in the Record.  I also ask unanimous consent that the letter to President Bush, signed by a bipartisan group of Senators, expressing concern about the proposed cuts in SCAAP funding and the text of the bill be printed into the Record.  I join my colleagues in introducing the SCAAP reauthorization bill today in hopes that it will go further to alleviate some of the fiscal hardships States and local counties incur when they must take on a Federal responsibility. I look forward to working with my colleagues to move it through the Senate.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows;                                 S. 862       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of      the United States of America in Congress assembled,     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.       This Act may be cited as the ``State Criminal Alien      Assistance Program Reauthorization Act of 2001''.     SEC. 2. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2002                    THROUGH 2006.       Section 241(i)(5) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8      U.S.C. 1251(i)(5)) is amended--       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of subparagraph (E);       (2) by striking the period at the end of subparagraph (F)      and inserting ``; and''; and       (3) by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:       ``(G) $750,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2002 through      2006.''.                                  ____                                                  U.S. Senate,                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 2001.     Hon. George W. Bush,      President of the United States, The White House, Washington,          DC.       Dear Mr. President: We write out of deep concern over your      Fiscal Year 2002 Budget proposal to cut funding for the State      Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) by nearly 50      percent. We ask that you reconsider this recommendation and,      instead, at a minimum, support funding this program at $750      million. SCAAP is a vitally important program that assists      states in recovering the costs associated with the      incarceration of criminal aliens. We would strongly oppose      cuts in this important program.       As you are well aware, control of our nation's borders is      under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal government.      Unfortunately, Federal efforts are often not adequate to      combat illegal immigration. As a consequence, such high      impact states as California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas,      Florida, New York, Washington, Nevada and Massachusetts      continue to face extraordinary costs associated with      incarcerating criminal aliens. Much of these costs are borne      by counties, some of which are among the poorest in the      nation and traditionally operate with slim budgets and      staffing.       By some estimates, the total annual cost to states and      county governments exceeds $1.6 billion. In light of this      growing burden, your FY 02 budget proposal inexplicably      recommends cutting funding for this urgently needed program      by $300 million.       Unless the Administration supports and Congress      appropriates sufficient funds for SCAAP, our state and local      governments will continue to unfairly shoulder the burden of      bearing the costs of a Federal responsibility. Given the      upward trend in incarceration costs, any shortfall in SCAAP      funding would force states to draw funds away from other,      cash-strapped crime control and prevention programs. In      short, the impact on the states would be devastating.       Therefore, we urge you to support funding for this      important program at a level of $750 million.           Sincerely,     Dianne Feinstein.     Bob Graham.     Jon Kyl.     Harry Reid.                                  ____                             National Association of Counties,                                      Washington, DC, May 1, 2001.     Hon. George W. Bush,     The President, The White House, Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: The National Association of counties      strongly supports the State Criminal Alien Assistance program      (SCAAP) at least at its full authorization level. However, we      believe the program needs to be funded at a much higher level      than proposed, in order to address the serious shortfall in      meeting costs to counties.       As of today, SCAAP only reimburses counties at a rate of 40      percent of actual expenses. To truly meet our annual costs      for the incarceration of alien undocumented criminals, this      considerable increase in funding would be needed. Moreover,      due to recent changes in the administration of the program,      significant costs such as inmate recreation and drug      treatment expenses are no longer recognized.       While immigration policy is solemnly within federal      responsibility, many of the expenses associated with it      burden counties and state governments. Costs of providing      services for undocumented aliens extend to county hospitals      and county health departments and county human service      agencies. With the upward trend in incarceration costs,      counties depend even more on federal programs such as SCAAP      since most of our local correctional agencies are at or near      capacity.       We strongly urge you to fund SCAAP at least at its full      authorization level.           Sincerely,                                                   Larry E. Naake,     Executive Director.                                  ____                             Pinellas County Sheriff's Office,                                        Largo, FL, April 27, 2001.     Senator Bob Graham,     Senate Hart Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: We write to you in response to your      Fiscal Year 2002 budget proposal to cut funding for the state      Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) by more than 50      percent. We urge you not to reduce the program but rather      secure funding at a minimum of the current appropriation      level. As of today, SCAAP only partly reimburses the actual      expenses borne by state and local governments. To truly meet      our annual costs for the incarceration of alien undocumented      criminals, a considerable increase in the funding would be      needed. Due to recent changes in the administration of the      program, significant costs such as inmate recreation and drug      treatment expenses are no longer recognized.       While immigration policy is solemnly within federal      responsibility, many of the expenses associated with it      burden local jurisdictions. Costs of providing services for      undocumented aliens extend to the municipal police, local      hospitals and health care department. With the upward trend      in incarceration costs, counties depend even more on federal      programs such as SCAAP since any undocumented alien caught      committing a state felony or several misdemeanors enters the      state or county criminal justice system.       We strongly ask you to reconsider your proposed cuts for      SCAAP and instead secure financial assistance for the states      and counties.           Sincerely,                                                  Everett S. Rice,                                                          Sheriff.                                       ____                              Collier County Sheriff's Office,                                       Naples, FL, April 27, 2001.     Re State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP).     President George W. Bush,     The White House,     Washington, DC.       Dear Mr. President: We write to you in response to your      Fiscal Year 2002 budget proposal to cut funding for the State      Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) by more than 50      percent. We urge you not to reduce the program but rather      secure funding at a minimum of the current appropriation      level.

Hon. Bob Graham,     U.S. Senate,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Graham: Enclosed is the original and a copy of      my letter to President Bush regarding the State Criminal      Alien Assistance Program. I appreciate the pro active stance      that you have taken to counter the proposed funding cut.       We have examined Senate Bill 169 and do not feel that it is      a reasonable alternative. Each county and state, regardless      of its geographic location, should have equal opportunity to      apply for reimbursement using the same formula and criteria.       The other questions that you posed regarding the efficiency      and effectiveness of the current SCAAP program are on point,      but we do not have supporting statistics or documentation      readily available. I would simply suggest that adequate      funding for the program in its current form is of greatest      importance.       Thank you again for taking the lead to protect the SCAAP      program.           Sincerely,                                                    Cal Henderson,     Sheriff.                                  ____                                           California Correctional                                   Peace Officers Association,                                      Sacramento, CA, May 9, 2001.     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,     Senate Hart Building,     Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I am writing on behalf of the      California Correctional Peace Officers Association (CCPOA),      representing approximately 28,000 correctional officers and      parole agents in the State of California, to express our      strong support for legislation you plan to introduce to      reauthorize the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program      (SCAAP).       It is our understanding that your bill would reauthorize      the SCAAP program at an increased level of $750,000,000 for      fiscal years 2002 through 2006. As you know, this program      reimburses state and local governments for the costs of      incarcerating criminal aliens. This program pays for the      incarceration costs of criminals who have illegally entered      or stayed in our country, have committed at least one felony      or two misdemeanor crimes while in this country, and are      serving time in local jails or state prisons. SCAAP      recognizes that the federal government has sole jurisdiction      over preventing illegal immigration and should be accountable      for the consequences of illegal immigration. States and      counties should not have to bear the financial consequences      of the federal government's failure to prevent illegal      immigration.       CCPOA was disappointed that the President's $265 million in      funding for this program, a decrease of $299 million from      last year, because ``SCAAP reimburses a relatively small      portion of states incarceration costs and contributes little      to reducing violent crime.'' SCAAP does only reimburse a      small portion of states' incarceration costs, which is      exactly why appropriations for this program need to be      increased, not decreased. The program was never intended to      reduce violent crime. It was intended, and has succeeded, in      allowing state and local resources to be used on state and      local crime issues, rather than federal responsibilities.       Again, CCPOA commends you for your leadership in this area.      Please contact our Washington representative, Shannon Lahey      if we can be of any assistance to you in securing the passage      of this important legislation.           Sincerely,                                                     Mike Jimenez,     Executive Vice President.                                  ____                             National Association of Counties,                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2001.     Hon. Diane Feinstein,     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.       Dear Senator Feinstein: I understand you will be      introducing legislation tomorrow that will raise the SCAAP      authorization level to $750 million annually. The National      Association of Counties (NACo) wishes to go on record in      support of your legislation.       NACo recognizes that securing the nation's border from      illegal immigration is clearly the responsibility of the      federal government and that Congress should fully reimburse      counties for the costs of incarcerating undocumented aliens.       We look forward to working with you on this issue.           Sincerely,                                                   Larry E. Naake,                                               Executive Director.
