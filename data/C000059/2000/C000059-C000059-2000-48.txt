 H.R. 5041, introduced by our colleague, the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Hill), establishes the boundaries and classification of a segment of the Missouri River in Montana under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. The boundary and classification of this segment will conform to those published and recommended by the Department of the Interior in 1980. The Bureau of Land Management has been managing the river as wild and scenic since 1980.  In essence, Madam Speaker, this a technical correction to the law enacted in 1980. Apparently, this wild and scenic designation lacked the proper documentation and this bill clears up discrepancy.  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5041.  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.
