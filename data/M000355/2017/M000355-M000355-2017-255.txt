 President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Wyden or his designee be recognized to offer a motion to commit the bill, the text of which is at the desk. I further ask that the time until 8 p.m. be equally divided between the leaders or their designees; that at 8 p.m. the Senate vote in relation to the motion to commit with no intervening action or debate; and that following the disposition of the Wyden motion, the majority leader be recognized.
