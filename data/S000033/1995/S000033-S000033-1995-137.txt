 Chairman, I offer an amendment.  The Clerk read as follows:       Amendment offered by Mr. Sanders: Page 84, after line 17,      insert the following new section:       Sec. 628. No amount made available in this Act may be used      for the salaries or expenses of any employee, including any      employee of the Executive Office of the President, in      connection with the obligation or expenditure of funds in the      exchange stabilization fund when it is made known to the      Federal official to whom such amounts are made available in      this Act that such obligation or expenditure is for the      purpose of bolstering any foreign currency.
