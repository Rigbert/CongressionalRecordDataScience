Speaker, I am not sure what I am being told, but the gentleman indicated that he may give us, and may be contemplating, more notice than 1 hour. I am not sure what that has to do with the committee, but in any event Members will have a minimum of 1 hour's notice before they would be called back to vote on any legislation tomorrow?  Mr. DeLAY. The gentleman is correct.
