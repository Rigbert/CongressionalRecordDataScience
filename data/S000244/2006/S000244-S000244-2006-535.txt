Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.  Mr. Chairman, this is a poison pill amendment. It is no secret that if this amendment is adopted, the voting rights extension will be doomed because the supporters of this bill will withdraw their support. So if you want a VRA, vote ``no'' on the King amendment.  I would repeat the fact that we are dealing here with United States citizens. Illegal immigrants, legal immigrants who have yet to be naturalized are not eligible to vote. Three-quarters of the people who do require language assistance for ballots are native-bornAmericans. They achieved their citizenship by birth in the United States of America. And should we deny them the opportunity to understand their ballots because their background or the educational system where they grew up did not make them functional in English?  I believe English should be the national language. I believe that English is the language of commerce, and one cannot achieve the American dream without being functional in English. But, at the same time, should we deny people who are citizens, most of them native born, the opportunity to understand the ballots because this part of the Voting Rights Act ends up being repealed or allowed to sunset?  I answer that question, ``no.'' And that is particularly important in States that have a lot of ballot initiatives, some of which have got triple negatives the way they have been drafted.  The registrar of voters in Orange County, California, said that ballot questions are drafted there to reflect a 12th to 14th grade level of education. Believe me, if you are not functional in English, and it is a post-high-school grade level that the ballot questions are drafted in, certainly we ought to give these people assistance.  Reject the amendment
