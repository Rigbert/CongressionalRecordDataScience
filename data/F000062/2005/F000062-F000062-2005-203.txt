 President, I am pleased to be able to join with my colleagues, Senator Chuck Grassley from Iowa, and Senators Boxer and Harkin in support of an amendment to the FY06 National Defense Authorization Act that would transfer one of our Nation's greatest battleships, the USS Iowa to the State of California for permanent donation status.  I understand the affection that many Iowans have for this important ship and that a model of the USS Iowa can be viewed in the Rotunda of the Iowa State Capitol.
