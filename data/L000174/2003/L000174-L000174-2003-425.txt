One of my lasting memories of Pat ental holdings1Total= 000>is seeing her standing in the hallway here in the Capitol, well past ental holdings1Total= 000>midnight, patiently explaining to individual Senators why the ental holdings1Total= 000>Department of Defense should include funds for breast cancer research ental holdings1Total= 000>in its medical budget.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an important ental holdings1Total= 000>matter with my friend, the distinguished committee chairman.ental holdings1Total= 000>  I have been a long-time supporter of laser peening technology. Laser ental holdings1Total= 000>peening is a revolutionary materials processing technology that has ental holdings1Total= 000>proven very effective in solving many of the fatigue problems currently ental holdings1Total= 000>plaguing military engines, such as the F101 engine in the B-1 bomber. ental holdings1Total= 000>Laser peening has been scientifically and battlefield proven to extend ental holdings1Total= 000>fatigue life and fatigue strength of metal parts.ental holdings1Total= 000>  In recognition of the benefits of laser peening, the Army has ental holdings1Total= 000>initiated an effort to establish a technology insertion program that ental holdings1Total= 000>would employ laser peening in support of major Army helicopter ental holdings1Total= 000>programs. Congress provided $1 million to begin this effort in fiscal ental holdings1Total= 000>year 2002.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Laser peening technology is being evaluated to extend the life of ental holdings1Total= 000>flight critical components on Army helicopters--including the CH-47 ental holdings1Total= 000>Chinook, AH-64 Apache, and UH-60 Black Hawk. These components are ental holdings1Total= 000>subject to fretting fatigue, wear that results when two metal ental holdings1Total= 000>components rub against each other. Without laser peening, fretting ental holdings1Total= 000>produces cracks that penetrateental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>[[Page S9398]]ental holdings1Total= 000>ental holdings1Total= 000>deep into the component surface, causing fracture, failure, and ental holdings1Total= 000>ultimately requiring part replacement. Laser peening will be applied to ental holdings1Total= 000>families of components such as integrally bladed rotors, gears, and ental holdings1Total= 000>bearing raceways to significantly increase service life and ental holdings1Total= 000>reliability. These components are used in all of the Army's helicopters ental holdings1Total= 000>and ground vehicles with turbine engines, including the Comanche, Black ental holdings1Total= 000>Hawk, and Apache helicopters and the M2 Abrams tank.ental holdings1Total= 000>  Stated simply, laser peening will improve the performance, extend the ental holdings1Total= 000>service life and reduce the cost of these critical systems. Without ental holdings1Total= 000>continued support for laser peening technology, this program will halt ental holdings1Total= 000>and these savings and improvements will never be realized.ental holdings1Total= 000>  In recognition of the tremendous potential for laser peening for the ental holdings1Total= 000>Army, I would ask the chairman's assistance in allowing the funds ental holdings1Total= 000>available for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation for the Army ental holdings1Total= 000>to be used for laser peening for Army aircraft and ground equipment.ental holdings1Total= 000>
