Speaker, it is with great sorrow and a heavy heart that I offer my heartfelt condolences to the family of a pioneer in the communities of Northwest Indiana. Mr. Mamon Powers, Sr., a construction worker and owner of Powers and Sons Construction Company, died on Tuesday, November 13, 2001, following a long struggle with illness, and will be laid to rest on Saturday, November 17, 2001. Mr. Powers was 80 years old.  Mamon Powers, Sr. was born of humble means in the small town of Churchill, Mississippi. The son of a preacher and homebuilder, Mamon learned the virtues of hard work and strong faith at an early age. Although African-Americans were only allowed to attend school through eighth grade in Churchill at that time, Mamon refused to be encumbered by the bonds with which society attempted to restrict the rights of African-American citizens. He continued his education by attending Campbell College, now known as Jackson State University, and by serving his country in the United States military.  To the benefit of Northwest Indiana, Mamon Powers, Sr. came to the city of Gary after serving with the military. He went to work in the steel mill, but quickly learned that he would not be successful because racial barriers prohibited many African-Americans from joining the union. However, Mamon's love for the community and his determination to succeed led him to work for Means Developers. With the addition of Mamon's knowledge of construction and his desire to make the city of Gary a better place, Means Construction developed one of the city's finest neighborhoods, Means Manor.  Mamon Powers, Sr. began his own construction company in the early 1950's and eventually became one of the first African-American members of a union in the city of Gary. Over the years, he developed his business into the most successful African-American construction company in the state, and one of the 100 largest in the country. Powers and Sons Construction Company was also recognized nationally by the Small Business Administration in 1997 for its minority business development initiatives. He was responsible for the construction of hundreds of private homes in Northwest Indiana, as well as the construction of many commercial buildings. His professional career made an impact on the community that cannot be measured simply by the number of buildings he created. His love for his work was revealed in his creations, and it inspired the citizens of Gary to take pride in their community.  While Mamon was dedicated to his work, his love for his family and his community remained his top priority. He was committed to his late wife, Leolean, and their six children, Mamon, Jr., Mark, Demetrius, Claude, Florita, and Marquita. He served on the Methodist Hospital Board of Directors and as a member of the Lake County Community Development Committee. In 1989, he was inducted into the Steel City Hall of Fame for his outstanding contributions to Northwest Indiana. Earlier this year, the Frontiers Service Club nominated Mamon for the prestigious Gary Drum Major Award for extraordinary set-vice in the community.  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and my other distinguished colleagues to join me in offering our condolences to the family of Mr. Mamon Powers, Sr. Mamon was a true inspiration to everyone who knew him, and his work in Northwest Indiana will survive as a tribute to his memory. He impacted the lives of many in our community, our state, and our country, and I am proud to have had the opportunity to represent Mamon Powers, Sr. in Congress.                          ____________________
