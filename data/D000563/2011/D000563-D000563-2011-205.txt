President, there are two amendments that are likely to be called this evening, and I want to address them briefly because I believe both these amendments should be carefully scrutinized.  One amendment is by Senator Ayotte of New Hampshire. What she would do in her amendment is restrict the authority of the President of the United States to refer suspected terrorists to our criminal justice system to be investigated, prosecuted, and tried. She would make it mandatory those terrorists--particularly associated with al-Qaida--would be tried before military commissions and tribunals.  I listened as she and Senator McConnell came to the floor to explain their point of view. It is an interesting point of view, that we are at war with al-Qaida and, therefore, any trials of suspected terrorists associated with them should be before a military tribunal. Unfortunately, the logic of their argument falls flat when you look at reality. Here is the reality.  Since September 11, 10 years ago, President Bush and President Obama have faced time and time again allegations that individuals are suspected terrorists. Each President--Bush and Obama--has had to consult with the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General, and other leaders in their administration to determine the appropriate place to investigate and try these cases.  Here is the record. Since 9/11, the Department of Justice advises us that on as many as 300 separate occasions--300--these suspected terrorists have been taken to the article III criminal courts of America and successfully tried and prosecuted. In that same period of time, exactly three suspected terrorists have been sent to military commissions and tribunals.  For the Senator from New Hampshire to now argue that all cases have to go to military commissions is to ignore the obvious.
