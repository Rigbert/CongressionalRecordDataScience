Speaker, I rise today to honor an extraordinary woman, Mrs. Marie Crump, as she celebrates a birthday and as the community celebrates her years of leadership and service to Prince George's County.  Mrs. Crump began her service to Prince George's County in the 1950s when she became active in the 14th District Democratic Club and was elected treasurer. She also became quite active with the Young Democrats and soon distinguished herself as an invaluable resource of effort and knowledge.  In addition to volunteering for campaigns, Mrs. Crump also volunteered her time in service to Prince George's County's nonprofit community. She served as the local chair for the Red Cross, The Community Chest and the March of Dimes. In 1962, Mrs. Crump was selected as the Mother's March Chair for Birth Defects of Prince George's County and served in that capacity for 5 years.  As she retired in 1979 from an illustrious career with the County Treasurer's Office, she joined the Board of Directors for the Prince George's Civic Opera and has since devoted countless hours to its development for the enrichment and enjoyment of all Prince Georgians.  Mrs. Crump has spent over 40 years working to improve Prince George's County for all her citizens. She has made a profound impact on all those with whom she has worked and her life has been an example of the noblest of ideals--that of service to others.  Today, on behalf of the citizens of Prince George's County, I offer our thanks and our deepest gratitude for Mrs. Crump's lifelong work and I wish her the best as we recognize the magnitude of the difference she has made and as she celebrates her birthday with family and friends.                          ____________________
