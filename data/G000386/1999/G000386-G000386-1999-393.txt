 President, today I am introducing legislation to help clarify for the administration certain aspects of drug policy that seem to have caused confusion. The confusion seems to lie in how to think about our friends and enemies when it comes to drug policy. There seems to be a willingness to overlook the actions and activities of certain rogue states when it comes to their involvement in drug production and trafficking.  The purpose of our international drug policy is to establish a framework for achieving results that sustain the national interest. As part of that, the goal is to identify countries that are major producers or transit zones for drugs. It is also to determine whether those countries are committed to cooperate with the United States, with other countries, or are taking steps on their own to stop illegal drug production and transit. This goal is clearly in the national interest.  Most illegal drugs used in this country are produced overseas and smuggled to this country. In accomplishing this, international drug thugs violate our laws, international laws, and, in most cases, the laws in the source and transit countries. Those drugs kill and maim more Americans every year than have all international terrorists in the last 10 years. In addition, they have made many of our schools, workplaces, our streets and our homes unsafe and dangerous.  There are few threats more direct, more immediate, and more telling in our everyday lives than drug use and the activities of those who push them on our young people. We pay the costs in our hospitals, in our jails, and in our families. It is a devastation that we share with other countries. And the problem overseas is growing worse. Not only is drug production up but so is use. The source and transit countries are now facing growing drug use problems. Thus, in addition to attacks on the underpinnings of decent government from criminal gangs, many countries now face epidemic drug use among young people.  What other countries do or do not do to confront this threat is of interest tous. The nature of the drug trade, production as well as transit, is an interconnected enterprise with international reach. Many drug trafficking gangs have contacts with each other. They share markets, expertise, and facilities. In some cases, they can count on the complicity of foreign governments or of significant individuals in those governments. This means that a serious policy to get at the trade and its connections must be international, coherent, and integrated. It cannot be piecemeal, episodic, and disjointed. But that is what we have today.  Congress has over the years repeatedly pushed for an integrated, coherent approach, often over the reluctance of administrations. Dealing with the drug issue is often messy and uncomfortable. It disturbs the pleasantries of diplomatic exchanges. Progress is hard to achieve and difficult to document. And sometimes taking drug policy serious upsets other plans.  This seems to be the case in this administration's dealings with several major drug producing or transit countries. It seems the administration would rather not know what these countries are up to on drugs, lest knowing make it difficult to pursue other goals. In several of these cases, the countries involved are not friends of the United States. One, Iran, is a sworn enemy. It has used terrorism and other tactics to attack U.S. interests and to kill Americans. it is also a drug producing and transit country.  For many years, the lack of cooperation or reliable information of Iranian counter drug efforts placed them squarely on the list of countries decertified by the United States. Last year, however, the administration removed Iran from the list. it did so on feeble pretexts, with limited information, and in a less than forthright manner. The administration used lawyerly interpretation of statute to drop Iran from the so-called Majors' List. Doing this meant the administration could then duck the question of whether to certify Iran as cooperating on drugs or not.  To accomplish this little sleight of hand, the administration had to ignore the interconnectedness of drug trafficking, congressional intent, and the national interest. So far as I can determine, it did this in the vague hope that a unilateral gesture towards Iran on drugs would see a reciprocal gesture leading to detente. It is hard to account for the change otherwise. And even so it is hard to comprehend. Never mind Iran's continuing hostility, its past and current support of terrorism aimed at the U.S. and American citizens. Never mind the facts. Never mind drug production and transit. Never mind the national interest. This is another case of the triumph of hope over experience that seems to be the lodestar of this Administration's foreign policy.  What makes the case even more disturbing is the apparent subterfuge the administration resorted to in order to evade explaining this major shift in policy. I say major because Iran had been on every drug list since its inception and Iran has been decertified for that whole history. I say subterfuge because of the pettifoggery the administration resorted to.  Given the facts of Iran's past, what is reasonable to assume would be a responsible way of dealing with the issue? It is the clear intent of the law on these matters that the administration would consult with Congress before making a major change in policy. But what did it, in fact, do? Not only did the administration not consult, it nitpicked. The law requires the administration to submit the Majors List by November 1. Instead of complying with this known statutory requirement, the administration delayed by over a week the submission of the list, conveniently waiting until after Congress had adjourned. Mere coincidence? Well, the administration did precisely the same stalling routine the year before when Syria was similarly spirited off the list. Without any prior notice to Congress. Once is accidental, twice is beginning to look like a pattern.  Weeks after this move, the administration finally provided an explanation. It deserves a full retelling to appreciate. First, some basic facts. Iran has a long history of drug production, most opium. It is a major transit country for opium and heroin from Afghanistan and Pakistan. Major Iranian criminal gangs have been involved in the drug trade for years.  Since the Iranian revolution, it has been difficult for any outsiders to determine what, if anything, the Islamic Government is doing to stop this trade. It is also important to understand that Iran was on the Majors List as a producing country. The law requires that any country that grows more than 1,000 hectares of opium poppy be put on the list. Iran met this qualification. The standard for classifying a transit country is not so precise and it is this imprecision that the administration exploited.  Here, in brief, is the administration's explanation for dropping Iran from the list: Iran no longer grows more than 1,000 hectares, and the transited heroin does not come to the United States, so it does not qualify for the list.  This latter rationalization is based on the administration's own favored way of reading the law. In this reading, a major transit country does not qualify for the list if current intelligence information does not show a direct flow to the United States. Since the underground nature and fungibility of the international drug trade is hard to quantify precisely, this leaves a lot of room for interpreting the facts to reach a politically correct conclusion. This, of course, leaves aside the question of whether such an exception was ever part of congressional intent or is consistent with the law or the national interest. The reasoning is shaky on both policy and information. It also ignores the nature of international drug trade and criminal organizations and what must be done to get at them. And it relies on how little we know about what goes on inside Iran.  In reality, the administration's approach is a resort to technicalities and convenient interpretations to dodge the real issues. But as we have been instructed, it all depends upon what the meaning of ``is'' is. But let's remind ourselves that what is being done here is to base a weighty policy decision involving serious issues of national security and well being on lawyerly gamesmanship. And this on the unanchored hope that the gesture, and that's all it is, might get a friendly reaction in Iran. What did Iran actually do in response? What you would expect. It thumbed its nose in our direction. But let me illustrate a little further the way facts have been employed.  Recall that Iran used to be on the Majors List for producing over 1,000 hectares of opium. Drop below this number, in the administration's reasoning, and you automatically fall off the list. In this very careful parsing of meaning, I would suppose that if a country produced 999 hectares, no matter what other facts applied, it wouldn't qualify. But is this the case in Iran? The administration's explanation is that they could not find opium production in Iran in 1998, ergo, they do not qualify on this criteria. But this so-called objective assessment needs a little closer look.  In most cases, we base our estimates of illicit crop production on overhead imagery and photo interpretation. While we are pretty good at it, this is not a precise science, whether we're talking vegetables or missiles. And it is, by the way, even more difficult when it comes to counting vegetables. Good analysis is dependent of weather, adequate overhead coverage, information from corroborating sources, and a track record of surveying that builds up a reliable picture over time. What was the case in Iran? Before the so-called objective, imagery-based assessment in 1998, the last overhead coverage of Iran had been in the early 1990s.  The 1998 decision was therefore based on a one-time shot after years of no informaiton. Corroborating information is also scant. But the situation is even more dubious.  Based on the past estimates, Iran cultivated nearly 4,000 hectares of opium in various growing regions across the country. The 1998 survey concentrated in only one of those traditional growing areas. Although in the early 1990s it was the major one, it still only accounted for some 80 percent of total cultivation. The 1998 survey could find no significant growing areas in these areas. But if we are to believe Iranian authorities, they have specifically attacked this cultivation with vigorous eradication efforts. The imagery would seem to support this claim. But we also know that growersadjust to enforcement. It is not unreasonable, therefore, to assume that drug producers might shift the locus of cultivation to less accessible areas and resort to measures to disguise production. The 1998 survey did not examine other areas.  We cannot, of course, prove a negative, but that should not lead us to jump to conclusions, especially when those conclusions are what we want. Let me illustrate the point. If 20 percent of Iranian opium production--a number based on earlier assessments--was in areas other than those checked, that figure alone gives us close to 800 hectares. Since those other areas--which cover an immense amount of countryside--were not checked, we cannot know if there was any production for sure. But, it would only require a little effort on the part of growers to shift a small amount of production to get us to our 1,000 hectare threshold. Also remember that opium is an annual plant. In some areas it has more than one growing season. Thus, a region that only had 500 hectares of opium at any one time but had two growing seasons, would have an actual total of 1,000 productive hectares per year. I do not know that this was the case in Iran, but neither does the administration. It doesn't know because it didn't look. It didn't look because it was not convenient.  I would suggest, even if you agree with the assumptions the administration is making about the intent of the law, that there are enough uncertainties in estimating Iranian opium production to counsel caution in reinterpreting the data. And even more caution in using this to revise policy. All the more so, given the nature of Iran's past actions and attitudes towards the United States. But even if you buy all the rationalizations leading to a decision to drop Iran from the Majors List, we are left with this: Is it responsible or creditable to make such a major shift in policy without even the pretense of consultation with Congress? Without an effort to explain the decision and shift to the public?  If there are grounds for reconsidering Iran's counter narcotics efforts, why was it necessary to resort to gimmicks? Is there something wrong with presenting the facts publicly and reaching a reasonable consensus consistent with the national interest? Not to mention that in this decision on Iran and the earlier one on Syria that we did not consult with Israel, our most consistent ally in the region? Was it necessary? Was it wise?  Is this the way we conduct serious counter drug policy as part of our international efforts? But this is not the only disturbing case.  I earlier alluded to a similar situation with regard to Syria. I will not review the details of that case. Suffice it to say, they are in keeping with what was done about Iran. The case I would like to look at more closely is that of North Korea. Here we have another rogue state and enemy of the United States that seems to get favored treatment when it comes to drugs.  There is credible and mounting evidence that North Korea is a major producing country of opium and processor of heroin. Stories of these activities have circulated for years, including details provided by defectors. Information that is further supported by the arrests of North Korean diplomats in numerous countries for drug smuggling using the diplomatic pouch. Defectors have indicated that illegal opium production and heroin sales have been used to fund North Korea's overseas activities and its nuclear program.  These reports also indicate that opium cultivation in North Korea far exceed the 1,000 hectare level, ranging from 3,000 to 7,000 hectares depending on the climate and growing conditions. In a country plagued by famine, precious arable land has been turned to illicit opium production by the government to fund terrorism and the development of nuclear weapons. Until this year, however, the administration did not report on these activities. It was not until Congress required such a report that we have even a hint of all of this in official reporting. When I asked the administration two years ago to supply data on opium cultivation in North Korea, it responded by saying they did not have any detailed information. Why? Because the administration was not looking for it. Under pressure, it is now beginning to look. While I welcome this, I am concerned that this search for information will be handled in the same manner as was used in the case of Iran. Information will be collected, but it will be carefully scripted and narrowly interpreted.  I find it puzzling that we should be willing to cut such corners. What is it about nations that are declared enemies of this country and many of our allies that we look the other way when it comes to drugs? What do we gain from empty gestures? And why do we make these gestures on an issue as basic to the national interest and well being of U.S. citizens as drug policy? I am at a loss to explain it. So, rather than trying to guess at motives, I am offering legislation to clarify the situation and to require more overt explanations. I therefore send to the desk the Most Favored Rogue States Act of 1999 and ask my colleagues to join me in supporting it. It addresses a serious issue that needs our immediate attention.                                 ______                                       By
