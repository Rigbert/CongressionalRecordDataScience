 So I would like to encourage--and I see one of those Senators here on the floor, the distinguished Senator from New Mexico.  Again, let me repeat, we are down to about four or five amendments that will require a rollcall vote, other than the amendments that may be offered by the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and by the majority leader. So that is where we are at the moment. I see Senator Bingaman here.
