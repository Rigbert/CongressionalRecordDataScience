Speaker, let us be crystal clear about what this House is doing today. We are making a medical judgment. That ought to be of deep concern to every American who believes that the Federal Government has no business injecting itself into the middle of the doctor-patient relationship. If we pass this partial-birth abortion conference report, elected representatives of the people of the United States, not the medical community, not doctors, not trained persons, will be telling every American woman that she cannot obtain certain medical procedures that are currently legal and available to her. If that does not trouble you, this should: this conference report is patently unconstitutional.  The proponents of this conference report are literally trying to paper over Supreme Court precedent in direct contradiction of the Supreme Court's decision 3 years ago in Stenberg v. Carhart. This conference report deliberately excludes an exception for cases in which a woman's health is in jeopardy. Instead, the proponents of this conference report have added dozens of pages of congressional findings that conclude that the prescribed abortion procedure is never medically necessary. The distinguished gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter) quoted Justice Thomas in saying that that would not work and could not work.  Mr. Speaker, I do not believe that anyone here believes that abortion is a desired outcome to a woman's pregnancy; no one believes that. I think without question that this belief is even stronger when an abortion is obtained in the later stages of pregnancy. However, Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is, this legislation, and I have said it before and I will say it again, would not prevent one abortion.                              {time}  1045  This legislation will not prevent one abortion, not one. Why? Because it leaves in place other procedures. That is because, while it claims to ban a specific medical procedure performed in the most tragic of circumstances, it leaves other means of terminating a pregnancy in place. To that extent, this legislation is without effect.  I would challenge any proponent of this legislation to tell me why it prohibits the termination of a pregnancy. I understand the proponents say it prohibits a procedure, but there will be not one proponent because it will not be medically justifiable to say so, that it precludes the termination of a pregnancy at any stage.  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, this House has again missed an important opportunity to seize what common ground exists in this difficult issue. The bipartisan Late-Term Abortion Restriction Act, which failed on this floor, which I co-sponsored this year, addresses the heart of the matter: the termination of pregnancy in the late stages of pregnancy. That legislation would have precluded all late-term abortions by any method except to save the life or protect the health of the mother.  It is clear that the conference report before us is nothing but a veiled attempt to undermine the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in Roe versus Wade. It will fail. It will fail in the courts. How else can one explain the conferee's decision to strip out the Senate language reaffirming Roe? I hope my colleagues reject this bill.
