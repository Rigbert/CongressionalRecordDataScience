Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the substitute to the Solomon amendment.  For those that are listening to this great debate, in order to help the public know about what Congress has been doing about Puerto Rico for the past 4 years, all hearings, testimony, reports, amendments and the bill can be found on the Committee on Resources' home page at www.house.gov/resources/.  I have just read an editorial in the Washington Times that said there were no hearings on this legislation. We have spent 4 years having hearings and input from everybody participating in this legislation. To have a leading newspaper be that irresponsible is no call for true journalism in this great Nation of ours. Talk about propaganda. It is wrong when a leading newspaper can, in fact, promote something that is incorrect to the general public.  So remember, www.house.gov/resources/ to hear the history of how this came to the floor today.
