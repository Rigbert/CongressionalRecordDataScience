Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for yielding me the time.  Mr. Speaker, I just want to make sure that Members understand thatthere is a profound difference between the Helsinki Commission, which I chair, which was formed back in 1976 to implement the Helsinki Final Act to which the USSR and the Warsaw Pact nations and others were a party to. They signed on the dotted line.  The commission that is contemplated in this legislation is a watchdog commission. It is like any other commission that might be formed, but there is no participation by China or any of the other countries in Asia, so there is a major difference. So I would hope we would no longer somehow compare it to the Helsinki Commission. There is no real comparison between the two.
