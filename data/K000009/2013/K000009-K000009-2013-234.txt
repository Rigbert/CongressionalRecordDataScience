Speaker, I rise today to submit a recent New York Times article titled, ``Ruling on Katyn Killings Highlights Russia-Poland Rift,'' by Alan Cowell and Andrew Roth, regarding the Katyn Massacre of 1940. In so doing, we call continued attention to the atrocities committed in Stalinist-controlled Russia inside the Katyn Forest and surrounding areas, events which continue to deeply resonate within the world consciousness and haunt Polish-Russian relations. In 1940, the Soviet secret police was directed by Joseph Stalin to systematically murder approximately 22,000 Polish military officers, prisoners, and intellectuals in and around the Katyn Forest. A U.S. House of Representatives Select Committee was tasked in 1951 with conducting an investigation into the Katyn killing and concluded that the Soviets were responsible for the mass murder. In 2010, after decades of denial and despite protests from its Communist members, the Russian Parliament approved a statement that ultimately acknowledged Stalin's responsibility in perpetrating these heinous crimes. Thus, in September 2012, I issued a formal announcement that the US National Archives and Records Administration, at my request, opened newly declassified compilations and Katyn documents held in storage by the government of the United States. Yet, this past October, while reaffirming in its ruling that Russia had failed to meet obligations to properly investigate the massacre, The European Court of Human Rights found it had no jurisdiction over the massacre and that it ultimately held no duty to investigate the events at Katyn. The Polish people and freedom-loving Americans deserve better. Humanity deserves better. As pointed out in the New York Times piece, in its ruling and in failing to demand a complete and thorough investigation into these events, the ECHR fails to fully condemn this genocide, setting a disturbing precedent for the future and provides no comfort to those families of the victims. As Pope Paul VI so eloquently stated, ``If you want peace, work for justice.'' Justice remains unserved. Thus, I call upon Russia to declassify, once and for all, its 2004 decision to close the investigation into the Katyn Massacre. Let the world of nations continue to work in conjunction with the Polish government and victims' families to uncover the truth of what happened in the Katyn Forest and nearby killing fields. The whole truth will enlighten future generations so that they learn from these heinous crimes, heal the fissures of tyranny and prevent atrocities of the future.         [From the New York Times International, Oct. 22, 2013]         Ruling on Katyn Killings Highlights Russia-Poland Rift                    (By Alan Cowell and Andrew Roth)       London.--In the long-simmering and emotional debate over a      notorious mass killing during World War II, the European      Court of Human Rights ruled Monday that Russia had failed to      comply with its obligations to adequately investigate the      massacre of more than 20,000 Polish prisoners of war by the      Soviet secret police in 1940.       But the court said it had no jurisdiction over the massacre      itself or on the subsequent treatment of the relatives of the      dead, prompting an outcry in Poland and expressions of      satisfaction among officials in Moscow, underscoring the deep      and lingering divisions inspired by the mass killing in the      Katyn Forest near Smolensk.       ``We are rather disappointed by this verdict,'' said      Poland's deputy foreign minister, Artur Nowak-Far, according      to Agence France-Presse. ``The ruling does not take into      account all the arguments of the Polish side that have here a      great moral and historic right.''       Andrzej Melak, president of the Association of the Families      of Katyn Victims, called the judgment ``scandalous,'' adding      that it was ``inadmissible and incomprehensible.''       ``The failure to condemn this genocide and the impunity of      its perpetrators led to it being repeated in Rwanda, the      Balkans and it will be repeated again,'' he said. ``Poles      will not accept a ruling like this.''       But in Moscow, Georgy Matyushkin, the deputy minister of      justice and its envoy to the European Court on Human Rights,      told the Interfax news agency that the ruling showed that      ``the court does not have the conventional duty to      investigate the events at Katyn'' and that it would thus be      ``illogical'' for it to address allegations of improper      treatment of the victims' relatives.       ``The Russian authorities from the very beginning said that      these events are located outside of the frame of the      jurisdiction of the European court from the point of view of      the time frame,'' Mr. Matyushkin said. ``And this point of      view was accepted by the European court.''       The Polish prisoners, including nearly 5,000 senior Polish      Army officers, disappeared in late 1939 and early 1940 during      a period of German-Soviet cooperation, when Soviet forces      occupied eastern Poland. In April and May 1940, they were      taken to the Katyn woods, near Smolensk, west of Moscow,      where they were executed and then buried in mass graves there      and in two other villages.       After decades of denial, Russia admitted responsibility for      the massacre in 1990, and opened a criminal investigation.      The investigation was closed 14 years later, but much of its      findings were classified and no one was publicly held      responsible.       Relatives of the victims complained to the court in 2007      that the Russian inquiry had been ineffective and that the      Russian authorities had displayed a dismissive attitude to      requests for information about the event. The case was      brought by 15 Polish citizens who are relatives of 12 victims      of the massacre--police and army officers, an army doctor and      a primary school headmaster--according to court filings.       The court's highest panel, the Grand Chamber, ruled      unanimously that ``Russia had failed to comply with its      obligation'' under the European Convention on Human Rights to      ``furnish necessary facilities for examination of the case,''      according to a statement from the court in Strasbourg,      France.       But the ruling said the court had no jurisdiction to      examine complaints over the killings themselves because the      massacre took place a decade before the rights convention      became international law and 58 years before Russia acceded      to it, in 1998.       That period was too long for a ``genuine connection'' to be      established between the killings and Russia's accession to      the convention, the ruling said. The court rejected an      application for awarding damages.       The court also ruled that there had been no violation of      the convention's provision prohibiting inhuman or degrading      treatment as it relates to the suffering of families of      ``disappeared'' people. That part of the ruling overturned a      lower court's ruling in 2012, which found that that provision      had been violated in the cases of 10 of the 15 Polish family      members.       In its ruling, the Grand Chamber said Russia had not      offered a ``substantive analysis'' for keeping the decision      to classify the decision to close its investigation. ``The      court was unable to accept that the submission of a copy of      the September 2004 decision could have affected Russia's      national security,'' the ruling said.       Nikita V. Petrov, a historian for the Memorial human rights      group, which has sought to declassify the decision, called      the ruling a ``light reprimand'' that would do nothing to      further the investigation.       ``It's like telling a criminal, `You haven't behaved      yourself very well,' '' he said. ``But it does not say that a      crime is still taking place, because the government is hiding      information about past criminal activities like the Katyn      case.''       The massacre has continued to haunt Russian-Polish      relations.       In April 2010, a plane carrying the Polish president and 95      other members of Poland's political and military elite to a      commemoration of the massacre crashed over Smolensk, killing      everyone on board, The crash led to mutual recriminations      over an event intended to help heal the wound.       In November 2010, the Russian Parliament approved a      statement holding Stalin and `other Soviet leaders      responsible for the Katyn killings.       Despite protests from Communist Parliament members, the      State Duma acknowledged that archival material ``not only      unveils the scale of his horrific tragedy but also provides      evidence that the Katyn crime was committed on direct orders      from Stalin and other Soviet leaders.''                          ____________________
