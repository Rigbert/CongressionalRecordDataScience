President, it seems like every morning, Americans wake up to another headline about the collapse of a big United States corporation. The failures have devastated the savings of millions of hardworking Americans, savings they were depending on for their retirement, or to pay for their kids' college education.  When the smoke clears and the fall-out settles, the issue of stock options comes to the fore. Report after report details the massive fortunes amassed by the directors and top executives of so many of the companies that are at the center of the storm. So often, these executives were granted huge stock option packages, which they cashed out quickly for multimillion dollar payouts shortly before the company went over the brink.  The landmark legislation that the Senate passed unanimously last week, and which I strongly supported, will curb significant corporate abuses and accounting scandals, but it does not touch the issues surrounding stock options. It is time the Senate acted to do so. Therefore, today I am introducing the Prevention of Stock Option Abuse Act.  There is no question in my mind that some companies have abused stock options, using them as a vehicle for funneling large amounts of wealth to top executives. What's more, options have been granted in ways that fail to serve their intended purpose of aligning the interests of management with the long-term interests of the company. Instead, several of the massive option grants have created perverse incentives, enabling top executives to get fabulously rich by pumping up the company's short-term share price. The tactics they use to do so may jeopardize the company's long-term financial health, but by the time the long term impact is felt, the executives have already cashed out and left the firm.  When an executive develops a big personal stake in options, it can lead to a big conflict of interest. Too often, the company's long-term interests take a back seat to the executive's desire for personal reasons to boost the short-term share price. When the betting is between massaging the numbers to ``manage'' quarterly profit projections and improving the quality of the business through such things as R investments, short-term profits, and the value of executive stock options, can be the odds-on favorite.  But the abuse of stock options in the executive suite should not be taken as an indictment of stock options in general. I remain convinced that stock option plans, as long as they are broad-based plans that extend to rank-and-file employees as well as CEOs, can play a very important role in our economy. They can enable corporations to attract and retain good workers and top talent. And they can improve motivation and productivity, by giving employees a strong personal interest in the long-term success of the corporation.  Therefore, the legislation I am introducing today aims to stop the abuses at the top while not gutting options that are so vital to rank-and-file workers. It focuses on restoring the link between the long-term interests of the company and those of senior management, and giving shareholders knowledge about and control over the stock options of corporate leaders.  Specifically, the bill would direct the Securities and Exchange Commission to issue rules, applicable to all publicly traded companies, in three main areas.  First, to increase shareholder influence and oversight with respect to grants of stock options, the bill calls for rules requiring shareholder approval of stock option plans. This would help prevent the all too common ``I'll-scratch-your-back-if-you-scratch-mine'' culture of clubby directors and top executives voting each other huge option packages with little or no shareholder input.  Second, the bill contains tough provisions to ensure that stock options will provide incentives for corporate officers and directors to act in the best long-term interests of their corporations, rather than incentives to stimulate short-term run-ups in the stock price. It would do this by establishing substantial vesting periods for options and holding periods for stock shares, so that top executives do not have the ability to quickly cash out and jump ship.  The holding period would be multi-tiered. Directors and officers would be allowed to sell up to one quarter of their shares six months after acquiring them, to permit a degree of diversification or to meet their current financial needs. But for the majority, they would be required to wait at least three years. And they would be required to hold on to some of their stock until at least six months after leaving the company.  Third, and finally, to improve the transparency of stock option grants to directors and officers, the bill calls for rules to provide better and more frequent information to shareholders and investors. Shareholders deserve more information than that contained in the average footnote. Specifically, the bill would require stock option information to be reported quarterly, not just annually, and broken out into a separate, easy-to-find section in each company's public SEC filings.  To date, there have been two paths offered to deal with the issue of stock options. Some think the problem is so severe that options should be pared back across the board and that Congress should dictate new accounting rules for them. Others say that business as usual should be the order of the day, and that no immediate action is necessary.  The bill that I have introduced today seeks to lay out a third path. It offers a way to ensure that broad-based stock options can continue to be a useful tool for deserving workers, shareholders and the economy as a whole, while still curbing abuses by those in the executive suites whose conduct is over the line. I don't claim that the bill is the complete solution in its present form, but I believe it offers a strong framework for a new approach, and I look forward to working with my colleagues and others to refine and improve it as it moves through the legislative process.  The job of cleaning up corporate corruption will not be complete until Congress acts to correct the abuse of stock options. I hope my colleagues will join me in this effort to put tough new rules in place that will retain broad-based stock options for workers and curb their abuse by top management.                                 ______                                       By
