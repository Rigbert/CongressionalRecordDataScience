 President, this is the second time we have addressed this issue in the last several weeks. A similar provision was in the State Department authorization bill that we dealt with. We raised the issue then, and the Senator moved to strike a similar provision, a withdrawal provision. It was accepted by a voice vote. This bill went on to pass the Senate 90 to 5, I believe.  I am surprised this issue has surfaced again. Not only does section 408 depart from the State Department authorization bill, but it is bad policy; it is just simply bad policy.  I hope my friends, the managers of this bill, will consider the fact that we have been through this once already and maybe allow us just to have a voice vote and move on. We have enough to fight over in this bill.  I have much more to say on this, but, as the old joke goes, everybody has already said it, so I am not going to repeat it. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely right; it is a repeat of what we did.  I thank the Senator for yielding to me, and I yield the floor.
