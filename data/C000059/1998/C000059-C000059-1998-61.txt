Speaker, I rise today to make Members aware of an important event taking place in my district during the end of next year.  The Congressional Medal of Honor Society will host a convention on November 3-7, 1999 in Riverside, California. The convention will consist of two parts. The first will be an actual gathering of Medal of Honor recipients, their spouses, and other interested participants. The second will be a dedication of a memorial at Riverside National Cemetery, the second largest national cemetery next to Arlington, for all Medal of Honor recipients past and present.  Of the 3,417 Medals of Honor which have been presented since 1863, only 162 recipients are still with us. During the course of the convention, the members of the Society will hold a memorial service at Riverside National Cemetery. Attendees will commemorate and remember those who have died since the last convention. Shortly thereafter, dedication ceremonies for the newly-built Medal of Honor Memorial will take place.  Mr. Speaker, I wish to commend the hard work of those planning the convention, as well as those who are organizing the construction and dedication of the memorial site. They are at this moment trying to raise the necessary funding through private donations. Even for worthwhile projects such as the convention and memorial dedication, which all freedom loving Americans support, both organizing committees have decided to forego taxpayer funds. By this, I am truly impressed.  I am honored and proud to have the Riverside National Cemetery located in my district. Those who are interred come from every State of the Union. The Riverside National Cemetery is the most active cemetery in the system, averaging more than 29 burials per day. This rate will increase with the passage of time. When the cemetery is fully utilized, there will be approximately 1,400,000 honored dead interred at Riverside National Cemetery. It may soon dwarf Arlington National Cemetery and virtually every other cemetery in the national system.  Riverside National Cemetery, at present, is the final resting place for two Medal of Honor recipients--Staff Sgt. Ysmael Villegas, United States Army, awarded posthumously for actions in the Philippines, and Commander John Henry Balch, United States Navy, awarded for actions in France. Among the many other veterans buried at RNC is one of the last Buffalo Soldiers, Woody Strode. Mr. Strode was an African-American actor who performed in several western movies.  In my state of California, 102 individuals have been awarded the Medal of Honor. One was Lt. John Finn, USN (ret.) the most senior living recipient. He was decorated for his action of December 7, 1941. Just as noteworthy, he was already nearing retirement at that time. Another was Brigadier General John Doolittle who was decorated for his actions in leading what everyone believed would be a one-way trip in the raid on Tokyo barely six months after Pearl Harbor. Finally, there was Private First Class Sadao Munemori, United States Army. He was decorated posthumously for his actions as a member of the most decorated unit in World War II, the famed 442nd Regimental Combat Team. With their cry of ``Go For Broke,'' this unit was composed entirely of Nisei, or second generation Americans of Japanese ancestry. They helped turn the tide against Germany in World War II.  Mr. Speaker, the Medal of Honor memorial will contain all 3,417 names. At present, there is no publicly accessible place in which all of the nation's Medal of Honor recipients are honored at one location. This will truly be a one-of-a-kind memorial.  For each Medal of Honor recipient, an Italian Cypress tree will be placed throughout Riverside National Cemetery. Within the immediate vicinity of the monument, 300 of these trees will be planted. These trees live in excess of 100 years, reach heights of over 100 feet, grow well in southern California, and require minimal maintenance. The monument itself will include a walled area which will surround a pool and a miniature waterfall.  An area has already been identified for the location of the memorial. It will not, in any way, interfere with the burial capabilities of the cemetery. It will be located in an easily accessible area for guests and visitors to the cemetery. Across time, it will draw this country's citizens to this national shrine to heroism and patriotism.  In closing, I wish to quote the mission of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society because I believe it best reflects what this convention and memorial is all about . . . ``To serve our country in peace as we did in war . . . To inspire and stimulate our youth to become worthy citizens of our country . . . To foster and perpetuate Americanism.''  I look forward to the Congressional Medal of Honor convention and to the dedication of the memorial. This is something that has long been overdue. We must honor those who were willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for our great country.                          ____________________
