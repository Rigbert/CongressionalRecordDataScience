Mr. Speaker, the United Nations Habitat II conference on sustainable urban development has concluded in Istanbul, Turkey. While most observers will point to the conference's focus on the pressing challenges of urbanization, the repression employed by the host Government of Turkey in response to criticism of its human rightsrecord has cast a pall over the meeting and should be protested at an international level.  While Turkey cannot be compared to China in terms of democratic development, Ankara seems to have taken some lessons from Beijing when it comes to stifling dissent. As Habitat was just convening, Turkish police forcibly evacuated the headquarters of 35 NGO's organizing an ``Alternative Habitat.'' These NGO's were protesting the government's destruction of some 3,000 Kurdish villages and the creation of 3 million refugees in southeast Turkey. These groups rightly believe that such policies were incompatible with the spirit and goals of Habitat II.  Mr. Speaker, last week, Turkish authorities detained hundreds of peaceful demonstrators, including a Habitat NGO representative, and a handful of TV journalists filming the police actions. The demonstrators were protesting government policies, and the reaction of Turkish security forces was reminiscent of China's action during the UN Beijing Conference on Women.  These attacks on free speech and the right of free assembly are cynical attempts by the Government of Turkey to deflect international scrutiny of their policies in southeast Turkey. Yet, Mr. Speaker, these heavy-handed tactics bring even greater scrutiny to the government's repressive, undemocratic activities. Mr. Speaker, I have to imagine that the thousands of NGO's and officials from around the world who attended Habitat II have taken home a distinct impression that Turkish democracy is severely lacking.  Mr. Speaker, the Turkish Government tried to prevent its repressive policies in southeast Turkey from coming to light, but a group of mayors from towns and villages in the region did submit a revealing report to the conference. The report linked human rights abuses in the region directly to Habitat issues and the urban ills facing Istanbul and other large cities in Turkey. The mayors believe that crowding, poverty and instability in Istanbul originated in the towns and villages of southeast Turkey, where economic deprivation and the government's war on terrorism had forced millions from their homes to urban centers unequipped to meet their needs.  Mr. Speaker, I fear Turkey is headed down a road of increasing instability and upheaval. As long as the government stifles the protests of its own people and refuses even to allow open debate of these problems, there will be scant hope for resolving such tough issues.  Mr. Speaker, I would like to enter into the Record an article from the Turkish Daily News, June 14, 1996, edition, which further spells out the problems faced by those attempting to bring human rights issues before the Habitat II meeting.              [From the Turkish Daily News, June 14, 1996]                 The Olympic Struggle for Human Rights?                           (By David O'Byrne)       Istanbul--``Turkey is dedicated to advancing the cause of      human rights despite the presence of malign element-     terrorism-pinching the Turkish nation from within and      without.''       This rather ungainly quote is taken directly from the      introduction to a brochure on human rights published by the      Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs. One of a package of      material prepared for participants in the UN Habitat II      conference, this heavily qualified and ungrammatical      statement is fairly typical of the document as a whole. For a      country like Turkey with a more than dubious record in the      human rights department and aspirations to host the 2004      Olympics, this government publication is far from unequivocal      acceptance of widely accepted standards.       In fact, the tone of the brochure is decidedly defensive.      Much of the brochure is concerned with alleged criticisms of      the Turkish human rights record by the Kurdish Workers' Party      (PKK) and its supporters. But as a terrorist organization the      PKK is certainly not noted for its human rights record, so      it's indeed strange that their opinions should carry such      weight. Shorter mention is made of other religious and ethnic      minorities, again aimed at countering what the Foreign      Ministry sees as unwarranted criticism from, apparently,      foreign sources.       The unfortunate implication is that human rights are      something only demanded by ``minority groups'', and then only      at the bidding of `outside' forces. Despite giving details of      numerous amendments to the Turkish constitution and listing      Turkey's many accessions to international treaties, nowhere      are human rights referred to as something to which the      Turkish population as a whole should be concerned with.       At the Habitat NGO forum however, there was no sign of      Turkish people ignoring the human rights issue. In fact many      of the stalls were occupied with Turkish groups whose sole      concern was human rights. Chilling photographs and texts in      several languages detail terrible human rights' abuses in      several different countries. Turkoman people in Iraq have,      not surprisingly perhaps, suffered terribly under the      despotic regime of Saddam Hussein. In western China--or      eastern Turkistan as it is also referred to--native Turkomens      have been remove from positions of authority as the region      has been settled by increasing numbers of Han Chinese moved      in by the Chinese government.       Continued nuclear testing in the region has left many parts      uninhabitable and has led to the predictable increases in      cancers. Displays showing the results of Russian occupation      of Chechenya and the occupation of parts of Azerbaijn by      Armenian government forces were equally disturbing.       The Turkish speaking minority from Greece were also      represented. Greek government policy has long centered around      moving the Turkish Muslim community from Western Thrace to      areas where it can more easily assimilated. The closure of      schools and mosques coupled with continued harassment by the      police and civil authorities has forced many to Turkish      Greeks leave. Another Foreign Ministry brochure available to      people attending Habitat details these and other human rights      abuses.       Groups concerned with minorities inside Turkey received no      such official sanction however. This in spite of the      government statement reprinted above. On the contrary,      foreigners attending the NGO forum complained constantly      about the presence of plain clothes policemen. One utterly      innocuous seminar on the ``colorful life of dark people''--ie      gypsies--attracted 11 people, two of whom were plain clothes      police. While one of the policemen dominated the discussion      with loud irrelevant contributions, the other attempted to      interview the three Turkish participants and ascertain why      they were interested in gypsies.       Outside of Habitat too further Turkish interest in human      rights issues made itself evident. The Turkish human rights      group IHD organized an ``Alternative Habitat'' conference,      only to find it closed down practically before it started.      Further interest was shown by the friends and relatives of      the 400 or so people who, since 1979, are alleged to have      ``disappeared'' whilst in police custody. Their silent      peaceful protests have been taking place outside Galatasaray      school for the past year. Coverage by the press was minimal,      with journalists attending dutifully in case of incident.       Last Saturday they were rewarded (sic). Although officially      banned the demonstration went ahead anyway with predictable      results. A larger than usual but none the less peaceful group      of people attempted to sit down in Galatasaray Square but      were immediately set upon by the legions of waiting police.      Journalists, photographers and even delegates from the      Habitat conference were arrested, many being severely beaten      in the process. Television pictures of the unwarranted      brutality were shown all over the world and photographs were      published in many of the world's leading journals. A press      conference held the following day to protest at the arrests      was also broken up by the police with many arrests.       There were by this time an estimated 1500 people in      custody. As releases began--without charge--groups of people      congregated outside police stations to welcome their friends.      Prominent human rights lawyer Serpil Kaya emerged from her      incarceration to find a group of her friends being harassed      by the police. On pointing out that they weren't breaking the      law she was immediately rearrested. Judging the reaction of      shocked delegates to the Habitat conference was not      difficult, they were only too happy to express their anger at      what they had witnessed. As a spokesman for the NGOs      explained in a press conference, ``We have witnessed that      hundreds of individuals have been beaten, arrested and      detained while demonstrating peacefully on the city streets.      We will not forget what we have seen.''       During the whole length of the Habitat conference another      demonstration has been going on, largely unnoticed. Teams of      runners have been jogging along the Bosphorus bearing Olympic      flags. Turkey's bid for the 2000 Olympics failed to make much      impression. The Habitat conference is one of the first major      international events to be staged in Turkey. The current bid      for the 2004 Olympic games has been making good use of      Habitat to show the international community what Turkey is      capable of. Those efforts now appear sadly wasted.       Until a Turkish government can make a statement regarding      human rights that is both unqualified and is seen to be put      into practice it is most unlikely that the international      community will see fit to trust Turkey with another event of      major significance. After the events of the past two weeks      the effort required to bring the 2004 games to Istanbul would      seem to be more herculean than olympic.                          ____________________
