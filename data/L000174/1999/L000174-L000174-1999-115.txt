President, I offer this amendment to protect victims of domestic violence in a bankruptcy proceeding. I am pleased that Senators Murray and Feinstein are joining me as cosponsors.  Unfortunately, domestic violence pervades all areas of our country. Last year, the Department of Justice reported more than 960,000 incidents of violence against a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend occur each year, and about 85 percent of the victims are women.  As if those statistics were not disturbing enough, the report went on to say that only half of the incidents of intimate violence experienced by women are reported to the police. That leaves almost 1 million incidents that go unreported every year.  The pain and terror caused by these crimes of violence are all too often also shared by children, as the Justice Department found that more than half of female victims of intimate violence live in households with children under the age of 12.  As our government and community organizations grow more responsive to the needs of victims of intimate and domestic abuse, more victims are leaving their abusive homes seeking safety and assistance. There are a number of programs, including the Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grants, which I authored in the 1994 crime law, that make victim services more accessible to women and children escaping domestic violence.  For some victims, however, escaping domestic violence means starting a whole new life away from danger. It sometimes means permanently leaving one's home to find safe housing. Safe housing could be across town or in another state--and it often means having to purchase or rent a new home.  Escape from domestic violence sometimes necessitates victims to leave their job, which could leave a woman and her children without an income. Recovery from domestic violence could--and often does--also involve long-term medical and counseling services. These are all necessary expenses which the victim must face.  The amendment that I am proposing today would ensure that victims are not penalized for such expenses in a bankruptcy proceeding.  My amendment would ensure that additional expenses and income adjustments associated with the protection of a victim and the victim's family from domestic violence are included in their monthly expenses under the bill's means test.  I believe that we must ensure that we protect the victims of domestic violence if they are forced to file for bankruptcy. I urge my colleagues to support our amendment.                           Amendment No. 2528    (Purpose: To ensure additional expenses and income adjustments  associated with protection of the debtor and the debtor's family from     domestic violence are included in the debtor's monthly expenses)
