When the law was written, that is what it said: This program will expire. The authorization will end. I have extended it inthis bill an additional year so we can take the time not to push the kids out of the classrooms and take the time to make the judgment whether it is working.  One of your colleagues, whom you vote with frequently and who sits behind you, from Oklahoma, who has this passion about authorizations, he says: You know, you do an authorization bill, and you are talking about spending money. I don't happen to agree with him. I think it takes an appropriation in addition to an authorization. But if an authorization has any meaning, particularly when dealing with a new venture, in terms of Federal taxpayer dollars going to private schools, I think we owe it to everybody--the taxpayers as well as the parents, teachers, and kids--to ask the hard questions.  If the GAO comes in and tells us someone somewhere in the District of Columbia has created what they call a voucher school so that their wife can declare herself principal and their daughter can declare herself a teacher and the kids can sit in a building which doesn't have a fire exit, I am a little worried about that. I don't think we ought to go on with business as usual in that situation, and I would like to at least have an honest appraisal.  I would say to the Senator from Tennessee, it is my impression Senator Lieberman of Connecticut is leaning toward the voucher school program, so he doesn't come to this with prejudice against it. I would not presume that is his ultimate position, but I think he will be an honest broker. He will bring all the facts out. I think that is why we are here, and I think it is a legitimate exercise of our responsibilities.
