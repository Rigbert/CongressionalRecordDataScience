President, I want to thank the Democratic Leader, Senator Reid, for his leadership and the hard work he has done to include an amendment to National Defense Authorization Act which increases protections for the dedicated women and men throughout our judiciary. The recentshooting of a State judge in Nevada provides another terrible reminder of the vulnerable position of our State and Federal judges. Unfortunately, this is not the only recent reminder. Last May, the Judiciary Committee heard the courageous testimony of Judge Joan Lefkow of Chicago, the federal judge whose mother and husband were murdered in their home. We must protect judges where they work and where they and their families live.  The amendment now incorporated into the bill which I cosponsored with Senator Reid, Chairman Specter, and Senator Durbin, would enact provisions from the Court Security Improvement Act of 2005, CSIA, S. 1968, which Chairman Specter and I introduced last November. Our bill and this amendment authorize additional resources to improve security for State and local court systems. We also respond to requests by the Federal judiciary for a greater voice in working with the U.S. Marshals Service to determine their security needs. This amendment provides criminal penalties for the misuse of restricted personal information to seriously harm or threaten to seriously harm Federal judges, their families or other individuals performing official duties. It provides criminal penalties for threatening Federal judges and Federal law enforcement officials by the malicious filing of false liens, and provides increased protections for witnesses. It also includes an extension of life insurance benefits to bankruptcy, magistrate and territorial judges, and provides health insurance for surviving spouses and families of Federal judges, both of which are provisions that I suggested be included.  Finally, this amendment contains provisions which have passed the Senate several times extending and expanding to family members the authority of the Judicial Conference to redact certain information from a Federal judge's mandatory financial disclosure. This redaction authority is intended to be used in circumstances in which the release of the information could endanger the filer or the filer's family. I hope that the House of Representatives finally takes up and passes this extension and expansion of redaction authority.                          ____________________[Pages S5990-S6004]From the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]        NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007
