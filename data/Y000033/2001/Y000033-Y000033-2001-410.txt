Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 30 seconds.  Mr. Chairman, I want to correct something that was just said, veterans health care is discretionary. Veterans health care is discretionary and would be affected by this amendment. I mentioned earlier, as have others, 75 percent of the fiscal year has gone by. By the time this bill goes to the other body, gets conferenced, goes to the White House, 80 percent of the year might be gone.  The money is going to be spent. This does not work. The money is obligated, and it is just not going to work. This amendment is not as good as it might sound.  Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Regula), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services and Education.
