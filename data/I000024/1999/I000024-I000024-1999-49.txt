I want to accommodate the wishes of others who want to be heard.  As I look at this, if we allow ourselves to be put in a situation where we do not know whether we have a nuclear deterrent, that is nothing short of unilateral disarmament. I know there are differing philosophies around here. I believe in the White House they honestly believe that if we all stand in a circle and hold hands and disarm, everybody is going to be happy. But I am not at all satisfied with that. I believe we need to have a nuclear deterrent.  Right now, we are faced with a situation where, because of the vetoes of this President, we don't have a national missile defense system. That is to say, if they should deploy one of these missiles from North Korea, China, or Russia, which takes 35 minutes to get here, we have no way of knocking it down. We would be dependent upon a nuclear stockpile to have something to send back that is more significant. And not knowing whether or not those weapons would work would be worse than knowing they would not work.  So the time is here to do it. I have applied this to my ``wife test,'' which I often apply to things. I asked, ``Can we take a chance on not being able to fire missiles?'' She agrees with me, and she is never wrong.  Seeing the junior Senator from Texas, I recall something the senior Senator from Texas has said many times, which I think is very appropriate to quote at this time:       We have to remain strong. We all wish for the day and hope      for the day when the lion and the lamb can lie down together.      But when that day comes, I want to make sure we are the lion.
