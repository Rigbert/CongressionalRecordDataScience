 President, I rise today to honor the lifetime achievements of a man with truly a lifetime of achievements.  Russell W. Peterson served as Governor of Delaware from 1968-1972, restoring peace on the streets of Delaware's largest city in the wake of the tumultuous 1968 summer riots--as he overcame decades of resistance to implement a sweeping overhaul of State government. Russ Peterson is known to Delawareans as the father of the state's landmark Coastal Zone Act, just as he is renowned nationally as one of our country's leading environmentalists.  I will go into more detail of his many accomplishments, however, the reason I pay tribute to him today is for his recognition--not only as a statesman, environmentalist and civil rights leader--but as a grandfather! Delaware's Creative Grandparenting, Inc. has awarded Russell W. Peterson its first-ever ``Lifetime Achievement Award.'' Peterson, a grandfather of 17 and father of four, deserves every accolade bestowed upon him.  When Russ Peterson was elected Governor of Delaware in 1968, the National Guard patrolled the streets of Wilmington. As he promised, the day Peterson was sworn in as Governor, the National Guard was pulled from the streets. As a 27-year-old New Castle County Councilman first elected that same year in 1968, I assure you Governor Peterson's leadership and steady stewardship made a lasting impression upon me. I am proud to call him a friend.  As Governor, he bucked resistance and reformed Delaware's arcane Commission form of Government into a Cabinet form of government. He convinced the General Assembly to streamline 112 Commissions into ten department leaders. It was nothing short of a revolution!  His greatest accomplishment came in June, 1972, when he single-handedly pushed through the landmark Coastal Zone Act, which forever prohibits development along Delaware's precious coastal zone. Yes, he's the man who proclaimed ``to hell with Shell,'' as he fought efforts by oil refineries to further develop on the Delaware River. The Coastal Zone Act shall forever stand as a monument to Russ Peterson in my State.  Governor Peterson also signed Delaware's Fair Housing Act into law and appointed the first female to the Delaware bench--Family Court Judge Roxana C. Arsht. And in July, 1972, he signed into law a major revision of the Delaware Code, which is important for what was not included. The Whipping Post! From 1669-1952, more than 1,600 men were flogged at the whipping post. Delaware was the last State to eliminate this barbaric punishment, thanks to Russ Peterson.  After leaving office in 1972, Russ served as an advisor to Presidents and held numerous prestigious environmental positions. He was named Vice-Chair of Governor Nelson Rockfeller's National Commission on Critical Choices of America. Then, he chaired President Ford's Council on Environmental Quality. In 1976, Peterson became President of New Directions, a world-wide citizens' lobby group. In 1978, he was tapped to be the director of the congressional Office of Technological Assessment. He secured his worldwide reputation as an environmentalist as the President of the National Audubon Society.  Mr. President, I consider myself very fortunate to call him a friend. I am honored that just last week, Governor Peterson took the time to write me a handwritten note to say he was ``proud that you are my Senator.'' That sort of praise from such an accomplished man is humbling.  Russ Peterson, my friend, you have a lot of living yet to do and more accomplishments yet to come. Today, though, we honor your lifetime of achievements.                          ____________________
