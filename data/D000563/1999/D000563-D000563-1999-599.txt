 Let me say at the outset that I am honored to support this amendment. I am glad that Senator Wellstone, Senator Kennedy, and many others have joined in this effort.  For those who question whether Senator Wellstone's testimony before the Senate is accurate, I share with them some statistical information which came as a shock to me. General McCaffrey, who is our Nation's drug czar, appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee last year. I asked General McCaffrey if the statistics I had read were accurate.  The statistics I had read were as follows: 12 percent of the American population is African American; 13 percent of those committing drug crimes are African American; 33 percent of those arrested are African American; 50 percent of those convicted are African American; and 67 percent of those in prison for drug crimes are African American.  This is clearly completely disproportionate. This segment of the population has been focused on and what Senator Wellstone is seeking to do with this amendment is to make certain that we do not close our eyes to the reality. The statue of justice can keep a blindfold over her eyes with the scales before her; we cannot put a blindfold over our eyes. We have to be open to the reality that if we are discriminating against any group of Americans, regardless of their background or color, ethnic origin or race or religion, we have to be sensitized to it.  I do not know why this bill takes a step backwards. Thank goodness for the amendment offered by Senator Wellstone and others which puts us back on the right track to be honest and fair in the administration of justice in America.  I proudly stand in support of your amendment. I thank the Senator for his leadership.
