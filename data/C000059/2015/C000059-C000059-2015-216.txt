Chairman, could the gentlewoman please ship some of that water to California?  Ms. McCOLLUM. Reclaiming my time and my water, we would love to have the gentleman there, and when the water is very hard, it freezes, and then the gentleman can try ice fishing, which is a great sport.  Mr. Chair, I think the amendment is coming to the desk. Once more, I thank you very much for your patience, and I yield back the balance of my time.               Amendment Offered by Ms. Castor of Florida
