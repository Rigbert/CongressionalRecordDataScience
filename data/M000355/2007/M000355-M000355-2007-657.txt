 President, briefly, five amendments have been pending, three have been filed. I will have a better sense, I say to my friend, the majority leader, after lunch tomorrow how many amendments my side will be interested in filing. I certainly share the majority leader's view, provided cloture is not invoked on Wednesday, that we would work with the majority leader in the hopes of winding up this bill at the earliest possible time.                          ____________________
