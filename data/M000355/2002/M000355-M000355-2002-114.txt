 President, included in the supplemental is foreign assistance for Turkey. My colleagues and I recognize and appreciate Turkey's contributions to our war on terrorism and the reconstruction of Afghanistan.  We are also aware of a recent meeting in Iceland between the foreign minister of Turkey and Armenia, and encourage additional efforts to improve bilateral relations. I fully support the President's April 24, 2002 statement calling for Turkey to restore economic, political and cultural links with Armenia. I have already communicated to both the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Defense my hope that confidence building measures--includingopening a rail link between Kars, Turkey and Gyumri, Armenia--can be agreed upon and implemented. Opening the border is in America's national interests, as I believe it may help America in our war on terrorism.  The benefits of resolving regional disputes greatly outweigh the maintenance of the status quo. In short, regional stability not only enhances U.S. security interests, but also contributes to economic, political, and social development in Turkey and throughout the Caucuses.  Turkey and Armenia have an opportunity to make meaningful progress in their bilateral relations--and they have my support and encouragement.  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the President's statement be printed in the Record following my remarks.  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:                                              The White House,                                       Washington, April 24, 2002.       Today, we commemorate an appalling tragedy of the 20th      century, the massacre of as many as 1.5 million Armenians      through forced exile and murder at the end of the Ottoman      Empire. These horrific killings left wounds that remain      painful for people in Armenia, in Turkey, and around the      world. I join the Armenian community in America and across      the globe in mourning this horrendous loss of life.       Today is an occasion for the world to reflect upon and draw      lessons from these terrible events. It is a day for      recognizing that demonizing others lays the foundation for a      dark cycle of hatred. Transcending this venomous pattern      requires painful introspection about the past and wise      determination to forge a new future based on truth and      reconciliation. In this spirit, I look forward to Turkey      restoring economic, political, and cultural links with      Armenia.       The United States greatly values the contributions that      Armenians make to our national life. With faith and courage,      generations of Armenians have overcome great suffering and      proudly preserved their centuries-old culture, traditions,      and religion. The United States is also deeply grateful for      Armenia's swift and decisive cooperation in the war against      terrorism.       Just as the United States reached out to the Armenian      people to provide shelter and freedom early in the last      century, so did Armenia extend a supportive hand to the      American people in the immediate aftermath of September 11.      Our two peoples stand together in this fight in support of      values that define civilization itself.       I am also very proud of America's strong support for a free      Armenian state, whose citizens enjoy the fruits of peace and      increasing prosperity. In the months to come, America will      continue to increase its security cooperation with Armenia      and with Armenia's neighbors to combat terrorism and pursue a      lasting and just settlement to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict,      which will strengthen peace and stability in the Caucasus.      The United States will also continue its strong support for      Armenia's efforts to develop democratic and free market      institutions, and to deepen its integration into the Euro-     Atlantic community.       On behalf of the American people, I send warm wishes and      expressions of solidarity to the Armenian people on this      solemn day of remembrance. Together, our nations look with      hope and determination toward a future of peace, prosperity,      and freedom.                                                   George W. Bush.
